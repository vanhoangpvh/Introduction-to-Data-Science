Grisaia: Phantom Trigger The Animation - Stargazer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42392/Grisaia__Phantom_Trigger_The_Animation_-_Stargazer,"['Here is a movie that makes no sense but I enjoyed watching. A strange loli fighting force sent to bring in a comrade gone rogue - but the twist is, they aren\'t magical girls... they\'re MILITARY GIRLS!The combination is odd as hell. There is fanservice. There are nuns. The nuns are spec ops. The spec ops nuns takes down a cartel villa in the jungle. There are Enemy at the Gates style sniper games, we spend forever setting them up and they\'re over in like 5 minutes. There is a sniper loli from a pedagree of snipers whose father went rogue and killed his handler...for causing the death of his wife, also a sniper. They check in with the audience every few minutes to make sure we understand that. Like really understand that. Everyone is a Loli, except the samurai handler guy who looks like a Loli. There is complex political intrigue as between military brass, the government, the handlers, and liasons between. For some reason a lesbian couple is not allowed to sortee and hangs back at ""the academy"", taking up about 10 minutes of screentime in this very short movie for no reason whatsoever to complain and get grub and fall asleep. Two chickens are beheaded, much to the loli\'s tutor\'s dismay - and yes, she\'s a loli, and a tutor, and she is permitted to sortee. Nearly dies when rappelling from helicopter.I would love to have an actual sniper, seal, or any vet chime on this thing as to realism because the feel of it is remarkably like watching black hawk down, saving private ryan, band of brothers etc... but with colorfully designed Lolis and many needless interruptions to insert Anime content into this spec ops movie. Put it this way - if they were to spin this out into a series and call it ""The Bourne Identities of Jailbait Child Soldiers"" I would watch it for the combat. The military jargon and dialogue, the use of weapons and spotting and scoping and ops and handlers and tactical maneouvers... it\'s like watching an ""All Custscenes"" video of a polished modern warfare style FPS game with Anime style graphics. I\'m convinced such a title would actually be good now based on what I saw here. Frankly it\'s fucking cool. The art is great and the way they chose to direct it is definitely atypical in a good way. There just wasn\'t anything else going for this movie, unfortunately. I\'m not familiar with the source material if there is any, so maybe that improves the viewing experience for those who are. I dunno, but I have to blast it sorry:Sound - first the good, the gunshots. The sound effects in the jungle. The dropped bodies through the scope that make no sound, the silence was excellent. The radio comms. The explosions, the helicopter, the rapelling from the helicopter - really, it\'s like they hired the people you would hire to do a warfare video game to do sound for this movie. Now, the bad - they did that whole edgy rock with vocals thing I just can\'t stand during a fight scene at one point. The only acceptable use of this for me personally was Don\'t Lose Your Way in Kill la Kill, and that was a very very different looking/feeling show and kind of fighting, and they used a very specific sample from that track in Kill la Kill. I can\'t stand this as it just reminds me of bad AMVs, and AMVs have a very specific point to them - the music is supposed to be focused on, and the video complimentary to it. The music was a distraction here, this is a general opinion of mine, and I don\'t think they did it more than once IIRC. I don\'t understand how you can hear this played back to you when editing and think it\'s good. Voice acting was acceptable, neither good nor bad.Story - meaningless, only the sniper\'s backstory is interesting and it gets so little attention and has so little to do with what\'s going on other than to annoy us. I couldn\'t help but feel like someone was trying to explain to me in my ear at random intervals throughout the movie and talking way too loud because they\'re drunk ""THIS LOLI IS THE GREATEST SNIPER IN THE WORLD! HER FATHER WAS A SNIPER! HER MOTHER WAS A SNIPER! SHE\'S BEEN SNIPING SINCE SHE WAS A FETUS! SHE WAS THE SPERM THAT FERTILIZED THE EGG THAT WAS PRODUCED WHEN HER MOTHER KILLED SADDAM!"" holy fuck we get it guys please enough already, we\'re not dumb. It\'s really boring, I would far prefer a series of shorts focusing on each Loli or a group of them in the field carrying out operations, which thankfully does finally happen to an extent. I want to see more jungle warfare and guerilla tactics used by cute girls to kill grown men like they\'re possessed by Jasons Statham and Bourne at the same time. Instead we get some blockbuster style ""politics"" with corruption, red tape, subterfuge, but really no payoff or point to any of it, a little taste of a lesbian relationship between two people that mean nothing to anything else happening, and the feeling at the end that nothing happened, and no wrap up. Who greenlit this script, that\'s what I want to know - because they unfortunately shat on the parade of talent that made this movie so watchable despite it\'s complete irrelevance and lack of inspiration as a story.Art - this is the thing. Stuff looks good, it really does. The lighting is great. The weapons and angles and scoped scenes and backgrounds and to an extent the character models as well - there is some good work that was done here. It\'s actually quite nice to look at, I like the colours, the flashback sequences have a different palette and it works nicely to emphasize the ""this is a piece of a dark past"" point, though they prove unable to capitalize on this achievement. If someone did make an AMV out of this material, it would probably be pretty good. There\'s frankly stuff to study in here, if you were interested in replicating cute Anime girls doing military stuff. The standout is the art and in particular the effort to replicate the look and feel of war/spec ops movies that follow a small unit on a journey through the battlefield.Honestly what a piece of shit plot though. I can\'t tell you this is good, and I can\'t tell you why I enjoyed it. Because then they might come for me, and I don\'t wanna go to jail.The story is very, very meaningless. My guess would be that if you can\'t appreciate this for it\'s aesthetic you\'ll probably turn it off in the middle. for causing the death of his wife, also a sniper.

There was another mission taken place before there's which had a girl...named Megumi who lost her friend and who was her tutor during that missions and hasn't left the island since she is wishing to kill that man for killing her friend so the school she goes came to take her and to finish off the mission with Mihama Academy and that she is also linked to Touka, a sniper who were also friends with the person that got killed on that previous mission. So this was an ok story for the movie but wasn't really interesting for me but was fine in most parts of it.Art 7/10 and Sound 6/10- All the same as before, art was really drawn well like the last movie which was a set from the original Grisai series and that sound was fine and that when their mission had stated, it really got the ost building up to give more tension within the movie.Character 6/10- Not many new faces were shown except for that girl named Megumi who we see just wants revenge and the other school who are nuns and which is weird but are assassins during their mission. Touka and Megumi both are friends with Shiho, their friend and master who had died so it was kinda interesting to see how both of them meet and how they are similar to each other with their sniping skills.Enjoyment 6/10- This time, the movie wasn't like the previous one so it gets a 6 but it still got one or two funny moments and it was cool seeing the students get into action again in their missions since we see their skills on how to kill each of their targets.Overall 6/10- So 6 since it wasn't like the previous movie but was still good.  Don't if this series will continue for being animated from the game but maybe I might the visual novel to see what happens. named Megumi who lost her friend and who was her tutor during that missions and hasn't left the island since she is wishing to kill that man for killing her friend so the school she goes came to take her and to finish off the mission with Mihama Academy and that she is also linked to Touka, a sniper who were also friends with the person that got killed on that previous mission.

At least I know what to expect. So, were my low expectations met or were they delightfully shattered? Well...- Story & ThemeIt\'s a school trip, but surprise; it\'s also a training camp, but surprise; another school will also be there, but surprise; there are even more complications. This exposition takes up about a third of the movie during which time nothing else really happens apart from them travelling and talking. You know the old phrase ""show, don\'t tell""? The writers of this didn\'t. Also, there is no tension at any...point since the young girls who are attending assassination school do everything perfectly.- Characters & WritingThe same characters are here that were in the previous two episodes, but we also get a bit of interaction with Thanatos from the earlier series. There are a few new girls from the other school as well. Because apparently only young girls are fit for covert ops. Also they dress as nuns, even on mission. Long wide dresses are apparently good for sneaking around unseen. And their garments are bullet proof. The only thing the teacher hired in the previous story does throughout the movie is to be surprised that the girls at an assassination school talk about weapons and eat chicken. Some characters almost have some development going on, but it\'s not enough to mention.- Style & PresentationStill the same. Fine but not noteworthy.- ConclusionThis movie advances the franchise from the ""cute girls doing violence"" genre into the ""cute girls doing violence without any stakes"" genre. It\'s OP boring with surface level relationships and a few more tragic backstories that try to fill in the void of not have any interesting characters. So no, my low expectations were not subverted or shattered but instead pretty much exactly what I got out of this. point since the young girls who are attending assassination school do everything perfectly.- Characters & WritingThe same characters are here that were in the previous two episodes, but we also get a bit of interaction with Thanatos from the earlier series.

Grisaia no Kajitsu Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29101/Grisaia_no_Kajitsu_Specials,"['Looking to see your favorite Grisaia girls get completely oversexualized in borderline hentai scenarios? Then this is for you.These specials are basically 3-minute clips portraying all of the main heroines in excessively lewd situations and nothing more. No plot or anything, just pure, naked fanservice through and through. Every episode focuses on a different girl and a different setting, some a lot better than others.A short summary of what they are all about:Episode 1: Yumiko in a bunny girl outfit playing around on the bed with a carrot by pretending it\'s Yuuji\'s ""thing"". She also ends all her sentences with ""-pyon"". It\'s unbearably awkward to...listen to and makes me hold my head in agony.Episode 2: Michiru floating around in the water and having Yuuji rub sunscreen onto her. And of course you must never forget to apply sunscreen *under* your swimsuit as well when you do that. Queue breast-fondling. For what it\'s worth though, it was actually pretty hot.Episode 3: This might as well be classified as hentai in my mind, but anyway here we have Sachi helping Yuuji wash his body in the bathroom. *Obviously* this means she has to use her breasts to rub his back whilst reaching her hands around him to grab some ""mysterious erect pole"" and stroking it up and down... yeah. Slight plot twist at the end though.Episode 4: Now we have Makina becoming a first-rate drill instructor and showing off her highly inappropriate speech pattern to lecture a group of recruits. Then she demonstrates how to climb a pole with her body and may or may not end up orgasming on screen by rubbing herself against it.Episode 5: This time we have Amane dressed up in a yukata going out with Yuuji and somehow someway she ends up getting her tits roughly fondled by him for a couple minutes... yeah that\'s pretty much it.Episode 6: Last but not least we have the illustrious Kazuki-sensei dressing up and playing doctor with her little brother by first examining his body, then making him do the same to her with a stethoscope. Things get very intimate and the wincest vibes are at an all-time high, but I don\'t think anyone particularly minds. listen to and makes me hold my head in agony.Episode 2: Michiru floating around in the water and having Yuuji rub sunscreen onto her.

We have six episodes of each character being sexualized to an extreme point. Personally, the only one I enjoyed was the Yumiko one because Yumiko is my favorite character.Therefore, I've come to the realization that if you want to get the most joy out of these specials; I'd recommend only watching the episode containing your favorite girl or favorite girls. Otherwise it's liking watching porn but, the type of porn you ain't into. Below are the episodes dedicated to that girl.Episode 1 - YumikoEpisode 2 - MichiruEpisode 3 - SachiEpisode 4 - MakinaEpisode 5 - AmaneEpisode 6 - Kazuki Kazami...(Yuuji's sister)Overall, most of these are funny and can satisfy your inappropriate thoughts. However, it's nearly impossible to review borderline porn so yeah... You'll just have to watch it yourself since each episode is roughly three minutes.

Free! Take Your Marks: Character Butai Aisatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37860/Free_Take_Your_Marks__Character_Butai_Aisatsu,"['There are 4 episodes here, and it took a bit of doing to find them posted on Youtube, kindly translated also.Each episode is only 4 minutes and is supposed to be a preview the movie. Each episode focuses on different characters, and the beginning is the same spiel about how to get pictures taken (okay to take pictures, please do not use flash, okay to share etc.) The endings are the same also, more of the usual cinema public service announcements on using the correct exits in case of emergency, turn of your cell phone, etc. etc.  So needless to say, due to the...length and brevity there isn\'t much about the story (at all) and barely any character development although this does give us a chance to spend time with our favorite anime swimmers.This is a glorified picture drama. The key part of each episode is the photo shoot. Yes. New content, posed, with plenty of props, featuring beautiful, handsome, eye candy for us to look at. And all of them are wonderful. I spent several enjoyable minutes pondering which guy looked the most photogenic in each photo, and wondering if these exist to use as wall paper for our electronic devices. For your convenience, here\'s a summary of the KEY part of each episode.Episode 1: Iwatobi relay 4 plus Rin in Halloween Outfits.Episode 2: Iwatobi relay 4 in Police person outfits.Episode 3: Samezuka relay 4 in Pirate Outfits. One Piece ""hottie"" version vibes.Episode 4: Iwatobi relay 4 plus Rin in medieval uniforms with capes.

Grisaia: Phantom Trigger The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35868/Grisaia__Phantom_Trigger_The_Animation,"['This anime is disliked and dropped off by many Grisaia series fans and some of the reasons are that it isn\'t a continuation of the Grisaia series or doesn\'t contain characters from the Grisaia series like ""omg where is Yuuji?, ok rate 0/10 done."" which I find quite unreasonable since it is indeed quite an  acceptable and can be enjoyable to watch.Ok, from what i understand, at Mihama Private academy a school for assassins has new 4 students, a class president, a homeroom teacher and a principle where they are assigned a proper mission to assassinate or capture a target which is different from...the other Grisaias as they kill people to solve a problem or to save someone. However both of the shows also contains some similarities such as the epic fighting scenes and how there is still a sniper.Also, I wouldn\'t think that this isn\'t a continuation of the Grisaia series because I think this is happenning while Yuuji is having his harem time on the island shown at the end of Grisaia no rakuen right? And lets be honest, even if the Grisaia series continues with the same character the whole story would just entirely be about harem and ecchi stuffs anyways so I think starting off with a new set of character can be a good choice as well. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying that it is wrong to dislike this show because I don\'t think it is the best show as well, I\'m just saying that if you dislike this show you should have a better reason than disliking because your favourite set of characters is no longer in the show.This concludes my review of the show ""Grisaia: Phantom Trigger The Animation"", Thank you for reading the other Grisaias as they kill people to solve a problem or to save someone.

Consequently characters who made the grisaia’s show like yuuji are really missing.This show is just 40 minutes of uninteresting and predictable story. One more time all the characters are girls (except Aoi) and story is then filled of fan service and unnecessary scene that made the show a bit boring.This movie is clearly bad compared to its predecessors.The only positives aspect are: the animation that is well done and the music that I find interesting.Dissociate from grisaia no rakuen, it makes a good original story, but in the grisaia’s...universe this wasn’t necessary.In the first movie, the story take place several years after grisaia no rakuen event. We follow the story of many students of the Mihama academy, a “secret” school where the government trains assassin.

Next is Touka Shishigaya voiced by Ayane Sakura the long range sniper and the tsundere of the group, she\'s your Michiru of the group. Christina Kujirase voiced by Kaori Nazuka is the bridge bunny and information gatherer of the group and the expected calm ojou-like character who handles the girls day to day chores, she\'s your expected Sachi. Next is Murasaki Ikoma voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki the ninja and stealth operative and is your Makina, she was LA\'s second favourite of the cast. Next is the character we narrative focus in the first half with is Shiori Arisaka voiced by Mikako Izawa and your Chizuru of the group. Finally is Haruto Aoi voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga, Rena\'s master and the Yuuji of the group and a master swordsman in a ways but is the person taking care of the group outside of school as well, thus the Yuuji comparison.The first half of the movie pretty much gives the basics of the character introductions LA mentioned above as well as mission in saving Shiori, wasn\'t that bad as we get to know the cast as well as the re-structured Mihama Academy now being the spiritual successor of what the original cast went through in Rakuen. the second half was more focused towards Rena and her backstory when she encounters her childhood friend turned criminal oddjob killer Bucks/Maki Inohara voiced by Yoshino Nanjo. This was the obviously the more interesting segment of the movie as we get to delve deep into one of the groups, mainly in this case Rena and see how she became how she is now, not to mention she and Haruto got some development together as well as a result what with being master and rabid dog analogy they give to themselves. The second half if anything shows what potential the new cast has if we\'re going into their backstories through their current missions and see them have a chance to develop as a result and showing off Rena\'s was a good move in all honesty as LA came to like Rena even more.The animation done by Bibury Animation Studios had great character designs and good to great gunfighting, add in the violence, semi-censored at times and considering what we\'re dealing with in Grisaia some fan service and disservice moments and to say the animation done by Bibury was great is an understatement.As for voice cast, well Maaya Uchida gets billing for LA mainly for favourite character by default but Ayane Sakura, Kaori Nazuka, Mikako Izawa, Atsumi Tanezaki and Yoshino Nanjo stood out, really the new cast was great in this movie, what could LA say, let alone they\'re chemistry with one another, especially Maaya Uchida and Yoshino Nanjo.So to say that not having the original cast of Grisaia is a disservice to this movie and the Grisaia franchise, well not really, LA sees Grisaia: Phantom Trigger the Animation as trying to expand the world with it\'s new cast and trying to implemented what worked in Rakuen into these new characters, much like Grisaia in it\'s early beginning of Kajustu, it ALSO had problems, so like that Grisaia: Phantom Trigger the Animation will have it\'s problems, that LA will see and take note of, but Grisaia: Phantom Trigger the Animation by all means have LA interested and would like to see more with this new cast of characters, if Grisaia: Phantom Trigger the Animation will ever continue into an anime series. back, let them rest and have their happy ending.As for the new cast, well LA latched onto Rena Fukami voiced by Maaya Uchida as the ""rabid dog"" of the cast, a glutton for food but has a crush on her ""master"" Haruto Aoi, but also a close quarter monster in battle, she\'s your Yumiko. Next is Touka Shishigaya voiced by Ayane Sakura the long range sniper and the tsundere of the group, she\'s your Michiru of the group. Christina Kujirase voiced by Kaori Nazuka is the bridge bunny and information gatherer of the group and the expected calm ojou-like character who handles the girls day to day chores, she\'s your expected Sachi.

It would've been an excellent anime on its own but since it's a sequel to Grisaia, the expectations become extremely high and that's the primary reason why the score on MAL isn't so great.It was inferior to the Kajitsu/Rakuen series when it came to darker and more tragic stories covering psychology and deeper meanings but it also had its own merits with a lot of unique characters and action going on. One thing I missed was the ecchi moments the prequels had and not enough Kazuki was...definitely a downside for me.I recommend this if you're fine with experiencing a new storyline with a different cast. But if you're watching this expecting a continuation of the Eden of Grisaia with the same story, this may not be what you want. definitely a downside for me.I recommend this if you're fine with experiencing a new storyline with a different cast. But if you're watching this expecting a continuation of the Eden of Grisaia with the same story, this may not be what you want."", 'Typically, if a franchise changes out the old cast and swaps them with a group of strangers, it isn\'t that good. In, ""Phantom Trigger"" — however, they restored the roster of characters with style: great designs, more acclaimed voice actresses than the ones that starred in the original series, a high artistic design budget, and a narrative that could have been written for an American action flick. I think ""Phantom Trigger"" is good at being its own thing, but is still recognizable as a ""Grisaia"" title!⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️The first series of Grisaia was more focused on interpersonal issues, self-actualization, and absurd,...militaristic scenarios. While the ""rule of cool"" thumbprint is still noticeable on this series, it\'s less about the psychological aspects of the story, and more of a beat \'em up rumble with special agents in antithetical factions. And even though, I liked the writing-style in the original series, I respect a series that\'s less of a thought-provoking, literary piece and more of a wanton exploration into the espionage and fieldwork of each combatant.There\'s a little bit of character development, like the rivalrous friendship between Rena and Bucks, two impoverished orphans, that ended up on opposite lines — ""Code Geass""-style. The sensation of watching this short, crowd-funded OVA is less to come away in deep-thought, and more to be wowed by how cool the fight scenes were.

Excellent work!Conclusively, ""Phantom Trigger"" works really well as an action-packed, man-at-arms bonanza of an OVA, but it isn\'t much more than that. If you\'re looking for more than the cool fights and cute girls, this probably isn\'t the series for you. Since there is an entirely new cast of characters and seldom references to the original series, you can watch this two-episode special, without having to sink time into the original cast of characters — though, I would recommend that you, at least, give ""The Fruit of Grisaia"" a shot.

Her performance as Tōka Shishigaya in ""Phantom Trigger"" is a very coy, but also a bubbly lolita-type of character. I would compare the characterization of Tōka to her roles as Hijiri Kuina (""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"") and Kaisei Ebisugawa (""Uchōten Kazoku""). Excellent work!Conclusively, ""Phantom Trigger"" works really well as an action-packed, man-at-arms bonanza of an OVA, but it isn\'t much more than that. If you\'re looking for more than the cool fights and cute girls, this probably isn\'t the series for you. Since there is an entirely new cast of characters and seldom references to the original series, you can watch this two-episode special, without having to sink time into the original cast of characters — though, I would recommend that you, at least, give ""The Fruit of Grisaia"" a shot. ""Phantom Trigger"" gets a 5/10, would have probably rated it a 6/10, if there had been more of a concrete conclusion!Rating:Grisaia: Phantom Trigger ★★★☆☆Other Rankings:The Fruit of Grisaia (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") ★★★★☆The Labyrinth of Grisaia (""Grisaia no Meikyū"") ★★☆☆☆The Eden of Grisaia (""Grisaia no Rakuen"") ★★☆☆☆', 'My first review was deleted because I was explaining how bad it was and someone thought it was impossible.This is the story of a new teacher supposed to teach a group of overpowered anti-terrorist loli.

So the two seasons before had a lot of backstories for each student whilst this tells us that these guys had terrible lives so I guess we didn't really need a backstory for all the girls in the school like last time which is fine as there was like one back story for two girls and that really helped out to the story a bit.Art 7/10 and Sound 6/10- The art this time seemed to be a lot better than last time since it was more bright and drawn a lot better for some reason which looked really well.

Endro~!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38062/Endro,"['Personally, my AOTS (and an underrated gem) of Winter 2019. The anime that I had no expectations whatsoever going in, and it certainly delivered in all its cuteness and ""Girl Power"" aesthetics, that left me laughing and crying all at the same time. Regardless of how much the anime worked and/or sucked, without much ado, let the Endro~ (End Roll~) begin!Every CGDCT anime will always be cited in one of two camps: either it will have a beginning point that is further developed as time goes, or the latter in which the story is given, but is only emphasized at the very last moments. Clearly,...it showcases the former first as means of a backstory, but once the aforementioned story passes, it End Roll~s into the latter, where majority of the slice-of-life elements come in with no drama and depth, just casual times for the main characters to do their daily stuff.And this is the part where it determines whether you\'ll love or hate this show. If you\'re the type looking for drama that\'s filled with the fantasy-action vibes, then this is most certainly not the show for you. Otherwise, for those who just love the slice-of-life comedic moments that the CGDCT trope is known for and the non-seriousness atmosphere that\'s worth taking a relaxing sit back to watch, then keep reading.The story starts with the Yuusha Party, consisting of 4 girls: Yulia ""Yuusha"" Chardiet, Ellenoar ""Seira"", Fai Fai (just call her Fai) and Mather ""Mei"" Enderstto. They start off their journey in the school of adventurers, then proclaim their plan to defeat the Demon Lord. But...with a twist of luck (or unluckiness), their claim to defeat the Demon Lord goes awry when the incomplete magic spell turns back time for both the Yuusha Party and the Demon Lord (plus her golem servant too).From here on, the episodic timelines to flesh out the main characters plus the adorable Demon Lord Mao-chan, shrunk down to her chibi-form and then disguising as a teacher in their Adventure School to stop Yuusha from her Hero status before the entire situation happens again.For an original series, this has some good pointers from the get-go. Directed by Kaori (Yuyushiki, Miira no Kaikata) with character designs by the one and only Namori (Yuru Yuri), this anime is certainly wonders at what it does best, and it manages to flesh out its storytelling through the Hero Party\'s 4 central loli girls, along with their own character-driven episodes:Yuusha, for one, her dim-wittedness and stupidity makes absolutely no sense, but with that over-zealous cheerfulness of her, she is able to entertain her party of friends and keep the momentum going. Moreover, her hero duties are nothing more than just regular people saving others\' lives. No wonder she\'s the spokesperson.Seira, she is a very simple-going elven, always having to safeguard Yuusha and others, but the one thing that she does badly is in her cooking! That\'s too bad since she can be mother-material, oh well. She loves nature as well.Fai Fai (I\'ll just call her Fai) is an interesting charcter. Raised in the woods as a warrior, her skills made for the wilderness are certainly no slouch. Not to mention that she is a big glutton, someone who loves eating, but most of her mischievousness in being hungry...is nibbling on Seira\'s ears like a mouse. How cute.Mei the obssessive girl with Cartado cards, magic cards in all ranks that holds powers of all kinds. Her obsession sometimes drive her crazy, and even to an extent where in the presence of any Cartado, both rare and common, she becomes a know-it-all.Along with their mascot Chibi Dragon, I\'d swear this dragon always has me laughing at its small-sized prowess at consuming even the gods, it is one voracious living being.Last but not least, both Princess Rona and the Demon Lord Mao. The ever-so-loving princess that have always wanted to marry a hero, doesn\'t shy away from even girls like Yuusha, creating that Yuru Yuri vibe. And Mao, even though she is made to be the antagonist, for the most part she serves her purpose well both as a teacher first, then Demon Lord second, often colluding with the Female Knight for off-day drinks.Along with the VAs that represent these girls, Kaos-chan from Comic Girls is back to voice Yuusha, and the ever graceful-but-cunning Inori Minase back to voice Mei. Great choice and diversity of characters that help make this show more appealing to the masses.There\'s always an off-the-hooks thing about Studio Gokumi originals. For one, they have a promising premise right at the start, but as time passes the true light is shed upon of the ""expectations vs. reality"" expression, that the true substance inside the shell is nothing more than just a series of occasional hits and misses, and Endro~! is no different. However, what they have done here is more than just the tip of the iceberg alone. The art really looks pleasing to the eye, giving it the watercolour-pastel looks that resemble a child\'s drawing. Animation-wise, for a series without much action, it is decent and still looks good. Not that it\'s great, mind you, but if that is what the producers wanted, they have efficiently succeeded.Music and sound-wise, I absolutely love and adore the OP song, so much so that it is one of my top favorite OPs of the season. So much cuteness overlord, so much interaction and overall a blast to enjoy listening to. Inori Minase\'s ED is no slouch either as we are sent off every episode in a caravan full of wonder. OST has been good and it never has failed once for me.In the end, this is a show that will divide people based on storytelling and perceptions alone. Like I\'ve already mentioned, avoid this show if you have been burnt by the lesser action and fantasy-drama, and for those who just want the times of refreshing to sit back and enjoy this show, then come on in, because this Iyashikei, SoL magic fantasy series is truly worth the watch.I highly, highly recommend for fans of the Iyashikei or even SoL genre-themed anime to NOT pass on this! Loved it at the beginning, and still loving it even now. it showcases the former first as means of a backstory, but once the aforementioned story passes, it End Roll~s into the latter, where majority of the slice-of-life elements come in with no drama and depth, just casual times for the main characters to do their daily stuff.And this is the part where it determines whether you\'ll love or hate this show. If you\'re the type looking for drama that\'s filled with the fantasy-action vibes, then this is most certainly not the show for you. Otherwise, for those who just love the slice-of-life comedic moments that the CGDCT trope is known for and the non-seriousness atmosphere that\'s worth taking a relaxing sit back to watch, then keep reading.The story starts with the Yuusha Party, consisting of 4 girls: Yulia ""Yuusha"" Chardiet, Ellenoar ""Seira"", Fai Fai (just call her Fai) and Mather ""Mei"" Enderstto. They start off their journey in the school of adventurers, then proclaim their plan to defeat the Demon Lord. But...with a twist of luck (or unluckiness), their claim to defeat the Demon Lord goes awry when the incomplete magic spell turns back time for both the Yuusha Party and the Demon Lord (plus her golem servant too).From here on, the episodic timelines to flesh out the main characters plus the adorable Demon Lord Mao-chan, shrunk down to her chibi-form and then disguising as a teacher in their Adventure School to stop Yuusha from her Hero status before the entire situation happens again.For an original series, this has some good pointers from the get-go. Directed by Kaori (Yuyushiki, Miira no Kaikata) with character designs by the one and only Namori (Yuru Yuri), this anime is certainly wonders at what it does best, and it manages to flesh out its storytelling through the Hero Party\'s 4 central loli girls, along with their own character-driven episodes:Yuusha, for one, her dim-wittedness and stupidity makes absolutely no sense, but with that over-zealous cheerfulness of her, she is able to entertain her party of friends and keep the momentum going. Moreover, her hero duties are nothing more than just regular people saving others\' lives. No wonder she\'s the spokesperson.Seira, she is a very simple-going elven, always having to safeguard Yuusha and others, but the one thing that she does badly is in her cooking! That\'s too bad since she can be mother-material, oh well. She loves nature as well.Fai Fai (I\'ll just call her Fai) is an interesting charcter. Raised in the woods as a warrior, her skills made for the wilderness are certainly no slouch. Not to mention that she is a big glutton, someone who loves eating, but most of her mischievousness in being hungry...is nibbling on Seira\'s ears like a mouse. How cute.Mei the obssessive girl with Cartado cards, magic cards in all ranks that holds powers of all kinds. Her obsession sometimes drive her crazy, and even to an extent where in the presence of any Cartado, both rare and common, she becomes a know-it-all.Along with their mascot Chibi Dragon, I\'d swear this dragon always has me laughing at its small-sized prowess at consuming even the gods, it is one voracious living being.Last but not least, both Princess Rona and the Demon Lord Mao.

And I am on the group which likes it for reason because you can just sit back relax watching it. The story goes something like this, Demon king was defeated by the hero's party with powerful magic spell but the magic spell was not perfect and hero slipped the incantation which caused the time to reverse and demon king was transformed into a loli (10 or 11 years in age...). From there the shenanigans start and story takes really comedic turn and becomes slice of life anime. There are four main characters and each one has its own charm and quirks unique to them, I for one really like the stupid and cheerful hero. Hero is the one who keeps the anime entertaining and makes me want watch it beyond the just first episode. And the elf girl has her own unique charm too, like can you believe it she can not use the arrow, I mean whats up with that,I mean were elfs not supposed to use arrow, like one elf on the Goblin Slayer uses the arrow all the time. The story balances each character very carefully which I like so much because it keeps the characters fresh and fun to watch. If you liked K-ON then will like this too. I am glad this anime exists this season because there are not that many slice of life anime this season. ).

Endro feels like a JRPG except here, we have an absurd set of characters united together for defeating the great Demon King. Wait, does this sound familar to anyone?Now I’m a bit of a sucker for cute girls doing cute things. Yes, it gets repetitive sometimes but everyone needs a dose of that cute and fuzzy feeling sometimes, right? Every season has one in some shape or form. Endro focuses on a more unorthodox way of showing its ‘cute girls doing cute...things’ formula by taking on a high class fantasy theme. It’s not truly an isekai so don’t expect truck-kun to appear in the first episode. Rather, I see Endro as an interactive JRPG style adventure about a group of charming characters.There’s no official rule but most viewers could probably find one particular character they enjoy watching more than others. The term ‘best girl’ would be used. Taking place known as Naral Island, we are introduced to a small yet colorful cast of adventurers – Yulia Chardiet (Yuusha), Ellenoar Seiran (Seira), Fai Fai (Fai), and Mather Enderstto (Mei). They make up the bulk of the main cast while we are also told about the Demon Lord, a character named Mao who became a small girl after a complicated spell goes wrong. Taking the job as a teacher at school, she makes an immediate impression with her cunning personality. But don’t be alarmed. This really isn’t some fantasy war story that involves bloodshed, revenge, politics, or anything complicated like that. It’s a slice of life with each episode containing a misadventure of its own. Watching Endro reminds me of how simple a fantasy slice of life should be.From the first episodes, there’s probably going to be a make or break depending on how you approach the style of this series. The comedy is evident with the silliness and naivety of the main cast. Yuusha and the others aren’t aware that their arch nemesis is right in front of them. Meanwhile, Mao continuously plot to get these girls expelled but often somehow end up in failure. The show also takes a good amount of time to show its fictional themes that you would find in any JRPG game. Armor, weapons, spells, character class, dungeons, you name it. Anyone who has ever set foot into a JRPG game should be familiar with these mechanics although Endro makes more of a parody out of it. Still, I have to really have to praise the character cast as they are not only able to carry the show with their personalities but also made the show much more entertaining than it should be.Starting off, Yuusha is the vibrant girl with a ton of energy and spirit. My first impression of her is that she is capable of being a leader despite being a bit airheaded. She is determined to defeat the Demon Lord and takes it upon herself to be a “hero”. Next, there’s Mei, my favorite character in the show for her unpredictable nature and knowledge of magic cards. You know, a party can’t survive together without her skills. Fai has the role of the warrior class and she isn’t afraid to demonstrate it. Serving as the “muscle” of the party, she’s the one monsters should fear in their adventures. Finally, we’ll come to understand Seira, the knowledgeable elven priest who is perhaps the most cautious of the group. Combining their skills together, this seems like a formidable party. However, it’s obvious the show wants to explore the slice of life content with its social aspects. Outside of their quests, the main girls interact with each other with high quality dosage of appealing character chemistry. I say this with strong confidence because each character in Yuusha’s party stands out on their own. Whether it’s for pure comic relief or with witty dialogues, I never once grew bored just watching these characters be themselves. On the other hand, I also find it quite hysterical to see Mao’s ambitions that sometimes jump way over her head. Nonetheless, there’s no doubt that you’ll find a special character bond between the main characters.You may asking yourself it this show is so lighthearted or ""plot lacking"", then what’s really the point of watching? I actually asked myself that originally but then realized it’s for the pure enjoyment. Seriously, don’t overthink yourself when watching Endro. It’s a show that’s built with humor, parodies, JRPG gags, and variety. I emphasize all these as you should watch the anime with an relaxed mind. The criticism can easily be directed to the underdeveloped characters and weak “plot”. But when I watch Endro, I never really focus on that as the show didn\'t advertise itself so.Fantasy JRPGs are hard to embrace for some fans and it’s no surprise. In our world, we are too enticed by overly complex storytelling shows or those that made an influence in others.

But this show gave them some nice little quirks that makes the character interaction seems to be more interesting in some way.Enjoyment: It\'s not deep and the humor\'s can fell short in someway, but the whole show\'s cuteness and its overall expansive adventures and settings can make it very worthwhile in a wholesome and light way. (Though the humor can feel pretty dry and repetitive in some way.)Overall: By looking at this objectively, I can fairly say that this anime isn\'t just for anyone.

Providing the players with the greatest of jubilation.The show is kawaii. And as I was watching the show, I felt contented. It felt like an adventure brimming of everlasting happiness. An adventure that I will never forget no matter how much I try to forget about it. A group of cute girls trailing the hero-demon lord cliche route with convulsing comedies.

The show was still very fun and meant a lot to me.This show is highly recommended for those who enjoy CGDCT.

But profits must be made, so the show, regrettably, must go on.  Endro~! is the type of show that’ll make you think that Naruto is a masterpiece.  Four, colorful girls destroy an unstoppable demon by using forbidden magic, ending credits roll, and then they go back in time to be taught by Mao...(i.e. the demon), who’s body transformed into a cute little girl (her cuteness is an exaggeration).Juulia Charldetto — that’s one too many ""u\'s"" for my liking — is the “hero” of Endro~!, because  she perpetuates the ""Pink Heroine” anime trope.  Like her compatriots, she exudes positivity and a ditzy personality.  Thus far, the story has revolved around the girls either training or embarking on a quest to increase their skills/powers to eventually fight the demon.  A significant portion of the show includes the addition of trope-y, comedic moments to offset the paper thin characters and the lackluster plot.  Unfortunately, the comedy is rather paltry, with no singular moment sticking out as memorable.

By itself that\'s not really a problem. The characters are just fleshed out enough to not feel like cutouts and the framing is done decently; however, there\'s really not a lot going on at the end of the day.This is basically a slice-of-life show with a fantasy coat of paint with a dash of magical girls thrown in for good measure. The first few episodes do the framing fine, but once that\'s set up nothing is expanded on. This is an excuse plot through and through and used to set up silly scenarios. I...would liken this show to Konosuba in that regard, but that show had its own glorious level of intentional awfulness with its protagonists and I simply can\'t find this group\'s quirks or antics nearly as funny.I also had a few issues with the art. Characters always had some kind of blush no matter situation. Blush stickers, blush lines, luminescent blush, drunk blush- it all all there and sometimes it was stacked which just looked weird. I didn\'t find any of the designs or art particularly interesting which really made the already mediocre cute things going on only mildly enjoyable.I wouldn\'t say no to this show being put on the TV as background noise, but it\'s not really anything worth putting any investment in. would liken this show to Konosuba in that regard, but that show had its own glorious level of intentional awfulness with its protagonists and I simply can\'t find this group\'s quirks or antics nearly as funny.I also had a few issues with the art.

I don’t think I generally lean towards the “fantasy” side of anime (although there are exceptions), this show definitely uses the cute girls to make it feel just different enough from other fantasy genre anime. I think the blend of the two certainly felt fresh in it’s...own respect. Although I have not seen it at this point, Konosuba takes this approach, but from what I understand has more fantasy leaning intentions as compared to this show. It is a lot more focused on the cute girls aspect and they just happen to be in this fantasy world.Story: 6/10 - I’m kind of conflicted on the score of the story as it was warm, but there wasn’t too much going on and felt a bit generic as much as it can. I felt if anything was lacking from this anime, it would have been the consistency of the story aspect (although it tried to cover it up in the last episode, but that’s okay because it was super effective). Not bad, just nothing notable in my mind.Art: 9/10 - What I like about the art in this show is how it impacts my interpretation of the show. You could have thrown in the art from another fantasy show like Konosuba, SAO, or Shield Hero from this season and it would just not have the same effect. As this is more light-hearted, I think the art style had to be different. I think other anime in the fantasy genre tend to lean towards the style of the shows I mentioned earlier as it makes you feel more like you should be there and it is relatively more realistic. The art style found in Endro almost seems like a picture book or a children’s book, like a fairy tail. It felt like I was reading one of those books myself which allowed me to take a different interpretation of the show which had its own charm and appreciation to it. There were some small things that I didn’t like all that much, but definitely not taking away big points from the amazing work it did.Sound: 10/10 - The music in this show was incredibly fun and I would definitely walk away from an episode with one of the songs from the OST in my head. Definitely throwing it up there in my top OSTs of the season. I think the emotions and actions that followed the music was done incredibly well and the mood was set for a fun-filled adventure every time. The OP and ED are both really good and have definitely added the full versions of them to my playlist. The OP feels like a generic CGDCT OP with some hints at fantasy. There’s one part I really enjoy where it shows Princess Rona and has a cool harmony with the main melody and it feels very adventurous. The ED has a very Baroque sense to it. It is light, playful, and really captures the image of a castle and the fantasy idea of the time. It was a touch that I appreciated.Character: 8/10 - The characters were pretty generic and “trope-y” but I liked it. I mean, at this point, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. I know what I enjoy, you know what you enjoy, and nothing stands out too much in this category (with the exception of the main antagonist who actually has some cool plot points). Just trust yourself in this category.Enjoyment: 9/10 - My enjoyment of this show was kind of unstable about 60-70% through the season. It kind of got to a point where I was unsure if it was all leading somewhere (although this kind of attributes to the story score), but it ended just right for me and I was happy with what I saw in the show. I got a comfy show that I could relax to and leave with a smile on my face. A comfy show is an enjoyable show in my opinion.Overall: “Comfy show made me comfy” 8/10 own respect.

The beginning events felt to me as if they just happened just for the sake of it. The demon lord time traveled and the story shifts to the hero’s party. The events that occur just.......feel too much like a PowerPoint presentation slideshow, where events come slide after slide. There are multiple time skips in the year just so the “desired” events come onto the screen faster. Also, this story is centered around the 4 girls in the hero party, not the demon lord time traveler exacting revenge, which was quite a disappointment.The art is fair, not much to say about it. The art style is okay. However, I have this nagging feeling that the art palette for this series just seems a little off. In the end, art is nothing really worth mentioning.The problem with the sound is that it is easily ignorable. Over the course of the four episodes I watched, I only noticed 3 times where a soundtrack played (disregarding OP and ED). For the rest of the time, I only thought that there was silence. This might be due to the fact that I was very bored and I may zone out but this is still bad. Also, the soundtracks that I heard are nothing to really compliment about.The characters are, to me, boring. The interactions, to me, are boring. As stated in the beginning, I didn’t have any reaction towards the humor. I could understand it as humorous but not really react to it. The characters themselves just aren’t good in my opinion. Watching them go on and on is quite taxing for me. I don’t want to think more about this subject.This was tasing to watch. I dragged myself for these 4 episodes, hoping for something good. I think I was trying to cheer myself up after ending Nichijou. I guess I achieved that in a way, since I am now full of disappointment with the fact that I wasted my time with this show. I couldn’t get this show at all.I was deceived. I thought that this would be a humorous revenge story about the demon lord time traveler stopping heroes before they grow. I was right.... before I was wrong. The demon lord is NOT the main character; that title belongs to the heroes. The demon lord is NOT exacting revenge; she was before she realized its futility. Honestly, I believe this show had wasted a ton of potential going down the path it chose.Some people may like it. I don’t. Some people may laugh. I didn’t.In the end, I think I would’ve still rated this show relatively low, even if I wasn’t  in this unfortunate watch order.I won’t recommend this.

Started watching this anime because I like these types of fluffy, silly cute girls doing cute things animes for some breaks after reading some serious stories.I thought that, hey, 7/10, that\'s a pretty decent score for an anime like this, must be good enough, right? Usually shows like this rarely get anything but a score below 7/10 even if they\'re watchable enough.But no, it\'s truly amazing how stupid this anime was. It was so stupid that I felt like just dropping it halfway into episode 1. But I gave it a chance and ended up having it on in the background while reading something...else(you know, one window with a novel and another with the video side by side). Being good at multitasking, I didn\'t miss much and it would\'ve been hard to miss anything substantial in an anime like this.I must say that I\'m very surprised by how far some people could go in their pathetic attempt to make money from some special audiences. I like cute girls doing cute things animes, but this is another thing altogether. They\'re no longer cute girls doing cute things, they\'re morons doing retarded things and acting in obnoxiously cutesy ways, as if trying to rub it in our faces that they\'re soo cute. It ends up being so overdone that it feels excessively forced instead of somewhat natural. It\'s clearly that none of the characters in this anime has an IQ above that of a roadside rock, though at least the rock has the decency of not being in your face, instead lying quietly by the side of the road.The writers of this little brain cell killer masquerading as a proper anime seems to be making a sport out of thinking up the best way in which to make the characters act incredibly stupid and ""cute"". Things like them sticking out their tongues for no reason, smiling and jumping around, saying stupid shit, acting out and pretending to be cute in excessive ways is standard fare here. They do incredibly illogical and forced things to seem cute, which ends up making them obnoxious instead as it\'s just too overdone in a way that it feels very unnatural. As if the authors didn\'t care at all, just trying to throw in whatever stupid idea they thought of at the moment to make them act cute. It\'s cringeworthy to say the least.Seriously... Also, can someone tell me how the big monster/demon with a male voice and pretty much male body and face somehow turned into a tiny little loli after being sent back in time? What do you have to do to turn from a loli into that?Really, things are so damn stupid in this anime. It\'s not an enjoyable experience to watch it at all. Please don\'t watch it if you feel like normal cute girls doing cute things anime are kinda overdone and stupid even if they\'re enjoyable nonetheless, because this is even more overdone and stupid, to the point where I almost found it offensive, it felt as if the creators were trying to taunt me and insult my intelligence by pretending that this is watchable. Truly pathetic how they even released this thing.But who knows, maybe you just like things that are incredibly moronic and has no sense whatsoever with characters that makes stupid people look like geniuses. Or you\'re a kid, then go right ahead. It\'s fully of nonsense that doesn\'t need any understanding, colorful artwork with hyperactive girls going gyaa gyaa over everything. else(you know, one window with a novel and another with the video side by side).

I mean, story wise, it's not the greatest thing, aside from the premise, that is certainly interesting in and of itself, you don't have much to set the anime apart from, fantasy hero and her friends are preparing to fight the big bad guy (or, in this situation, girl I guess).It's because Endro~! is all about the feels good moments. Whether it be the colorful animation, the cheerful soundtracks or just the hero team and the demon lord being absolutely lovely, this show transpires...with positive energy.All in all, the only thing that could be considered a downside is a story that barely makes the cake, which, in the case of Endro~! isn't really crippling, as it was intended to be a show where you can turn off your brain, and simply enjoy yourself while the cast shows you the wonders of a world that may not hold a candle to most of the fantasy genre, but is still enough to bring you 12 episodes of pure joy. with positive energy.All in all, the only thing that could be considered a downside is a story that barely makes the cake, which, in the case of Endro~! isn't really crippling, as it was intended to be a show where you can turn off your brain, and simply enjoy yourself while the cast shows you the wonders of a world that may not hold a candle to most of the fantasy genre, but is still enough to bring you 12 episodes of pure joy."", '""It\'ll be a hundred years before a weakling like you has the skill to slay me""---Demon LordFirst thing this needs to be bumped to an R-15 instead PG-13 it has a LGBT (and pedo) agenda to it which is a real shame because otherwise it would be fantastic down to a G rating. As it stands if you are watching it with your kids you may well be having conversations you\'d just rather not have.On the other hand the instances where it does try to interject the current political zeitgeist are useful for explaining to kids how propaganda works and how to protect themselves.Second it\'s...not a really a 7 it\'s more something north of a 6.5. While it\'s a really fun take on Japanese Fantasy/ RPG tropes. Think Fairy Tail, Magic Labyrinth, Record of Lodoss, Slayers but with a cast of nothing but really cute girls winning by sheer cuteness. As nice as that may be, by about the 6th episode it gets really tiring. You make a comparison to say black clover where everyone is trying to be better to this where no one is and you can understand why I give it a ding for this. Plot armor just gets to be bad writing after awhile.Thirdly there\'s expectation failure. I was really expecting more demon lord.  Turns out the demon lord isn\'t even a main character, despite having the only story line that is even vaguely interesting. Yuusha is boring as the hero. The other three even less interesting. They could have been better but the opportunity wasn\'t taken.Finally there\'s the art, which if you\'re being charitable is at best crude. Not Dr. Katz or Home Movies crude but still significantly below current standards.All told the problems knock endro down from a 9 or a high 8 to a mid to high 6.

The first few episodes were worthless, but the more I watched, the more it became pleasant and cool to see.The characters are quite normal, except Meiza, who is the best character in the whole anime, for being funny and creative. The scenes are sometimes very funny, especially after the eighth epistle, which was when the anime began to improve.Overall, Endro ~ was a fun anime with medium characters and crazy moments that can even make you...laugh. laugh."", ""Endro started off pretty promising, with a plot that's also pretty unique, and made correctly, would have been a great work.

The comedy and writing is just horrifying. The way the characters go through an objective, the transitions, the monologues, pov's, dialogue between characters, animating of certain sequences are just all bad.

From the beginning to the end you follow it with a pleasure.- Brilliant sense of humor, without exaggerating fan-service.- Enjoyable soundtrack.Watching this episode, I felt like in childhood when I watched Bugs Bunny.

To describe this OVA I can actually use two quotes from it that provides no spoiler and yet give you the best reason to watch it.1- 'a saintly soup stock'.2- 'because I had to endure the image of a gigantic woolly mammoth trunk being burned into my eyes!'.Those alone should give you enough reason to realise just how funny this is. Turns out Hermes isn't the only male god that is truly god-tier, Miach welcome...to the club.As you can tell from the poster it is a hot spring episode with the normal traditions of milk afterwards. That however doesn't do this any justice since from start to finish it is hilarious.

Music used at the most heroic times in the main season here being used in the funniest moments was an absolute delight that really set the scene.The characters are all very established and I would advise watching this once you have seen the main show in order preferably but if you must season 3 at least. Everyone acts accordingly with their characters and you get some great moments. Welf has some pretty funny moments with Hephaestus and you see Bell being his usual.

Now the whole series has been a hit or miss for me, but I can gladly say that this, this is one of the hits! The whole episode is just one big trashy, onsen fanservice, and I enjoyed it, because I know what I was...getting into.Nothing special can really be said about the art and the characters, since they didn't really change. And the story is also alright, following a basic storyline of our characters going around doing some stuff while also being treated with some fanservice moments all throughout.If you like your fanservice, if you like DanMachi, and if you just want to burn some time for some cultured entertainment, then I could safely say that you will enjoy this OVA.

Great spotlight on the Miach Familia. The OVA gave more respect to the supporting characters than the season itself did.Lot's of amazing references; and especially loved the plot revolving around the 'Gamer Girl' reference, if you know who I'm talking about...;)Laughed like crazy, Great OVA!! ;)Laughed like crazy, Great OVA!!"", ""If you're reading the reviews on the OVA then power to ya. I assume anyone watching an OVA for a third season of a show is probably just seeing if it's worth their time. Well I'll lay it out simple for ya: I love this show, it's not a masterpiece or anything just hits all the right buttons so my little monkey brain goes brrrrr. HOWEVER, I usually will only parse through OVAs since they don't usually do much for world building or moving the plot along.And let me tell ya, I'm glad I gave this one my full attention. Probably one of the best...OVAs I've watched in years, it hits the comedic tone of the show perfectly. I actually laughed out loud multiple times during it. That being said, let's break down the categories:Story: (8/10)It's a simple enough one-shot: Bathhouse hijinks, we've all been there before. You won't be getting any moving character moments from this, but honestly that would've been a disservice to the episode if they did try shoehorning that in. It's popcorn entertainment; turn your brain off and have fun with characters I assume you like since you're this deep into the series run.Art: (8/10)Not much to say here, it's the shows regular style. You;re getting the same quality and it's pretty serviceable. Fan service gets a little...forced at times - but it's a hot spring OVA are you REALLY surprised at that fact? Another eight out of ten, anime titty was cool.Sound: (8/10)Again another no brainer. Sound design overall was good and the VA's really bring their A-game to the booth for the episode. The reactions were over the top but the situations they were in were over the top, it fit perfectly.Character: (10/10)You know these characters, and you know how well the show has worked in comedic beats over the last few seasons. This episode really shows how the writer knows how to incorporate the characters to fit into the framework of pure comedy. Obviously with a huge assemble like the show has a lot of characters usually front and center take a sideline bc it's an OVA, but Belt and especially Hermes really do some heavy lifting in this episode. Hermes had me at least grinning every moment he was on screen, a class act.Enjoyment: (10/10)I liked it, if ya couldn't tell from my above points and paragraphs. It was a refreshing take on the story that I just really enjoyed. It's nice to have characters you like just go off left field in a dumb plot every once and awhile, especially when they're handled as well as this.So there's my review, if you like the show watch the OVA - I guarantee you'll at least like it. It's nothing ground breaking, but it's a better way to kill an odd 20 minutes than most. My total score is gonna be an 8.4/10!

Since the action takes place in a public bathhouse, one would expect there to be a lot of fanservice. An fanservice there was, indeed. But that was not the only thing that turned out to be memorable.Story 7/10The story itself is quite shallow, but the overall absurdity of the plot has its own charm. The episode looks more like a comedic fanfiction piece, which features familiar characters, that doesn't even try to pretend to be serious. Hence, it's just fun and enjoyable to watch, nothing more, nothing less.Art...8/10The art and animation is quite good. I liked it even more than the original Season 3 at some moments. The slow-mo moments were particularly memorable. There was also many an occasion of scantly-dressed females on screen (sasuga fanservice episode), and I have to note that the bodies were decently drawn. The 2 new characters were decently designed.Sound 8/10All the sounds and voice acting were decent and immersive. Nothing really special or outstanding except for the ending song (performed by Hestia and Ais's VA, if I'm not mistaken), which was quite good.Characters 9/10This episode excelled in pitting different characters with different personalities against each other to achieve a comedic effect. For example, angry girls vs peeping boys. The episode also brought out long-forgotten characters, such as Syr. She definitely hasn't seen a lot of action in the series lately and now was her time to 'shine'. The 2 new characters were perfect for a filler episode, especially the older god - stereotypical, somewhat memorable and easy to introduce. No real character development was present.Enjoyment 8/10I laughed a lot while watching the episode. I recommend it to everyone who looks for a straightforward and funny way to spend 25 min. 8/10The art and animation is quite good. I liked it even more than the original Season 3 at some moments.

That said, this takes a lot of the same elements.I feel like after Sword Oratoria in terms of chronology the series took a really steep turn towards drama in general. I felt like a lot of the comedic elements were totally lost. Since Bell leveled up a bunch in season 1 there wasn't any logical progression but adding and removing unnecessary characters, which really bothered me. This was a lighthearted return to what the series, in my opinion, should have been. The plot twists were funny and clever, and even...though all the ecchi elements were cliched but not unbearably over the top. If you're watching this show and expecting something else then I don't really know what you're doing.Either way, I enjoy this approach to comedic writing infinitely more than when the characters take themselves too seriously.If giving I'm hot takes, this was better than seasons 2 and 3 for general but that's my opinion which is all totally subjective.If you're not sure if you want to give this a watch, it's only 30 minutes so you're not losing a lot of your time anyway.

At first I thought this would be another OVA with nothing else to add to the plot. However there is vital lore in this OVA. For my one spoiler, I announce the God Ganesha, is absolutely hung.This is vital lore information, not once is Ganesha\'s ""elephant trunk"" mentioned in the books, at least...to where I\'ve read up to volume 14. Yeah Ganesha is physically well built, he\'s got nice muscles but I want to know what he\'s really packing, what\'s his stamina like?. No homo though.This is another silly OVA, if you\'re the typical male viewer and like anime cleavage and anime curves, look forward to this OVA.

As if approving what he\'s just seen... give you a few guesses who it is, but judging by the shape of his glowing spectacles, you\'ll only need one.This was an attention getting preview that appeals to people who live off an L diet of caffeine and sweets and need something to match the pace of their elevated heart rate and high blood pressure.

Voice acting wasn't it here, very few snippets from various contexts all over the parent series with no particular juxtaposition, not one that's painfully obvious that is.The music wasn't that good either, should I even call it music? A bunch of random noises trying to make some sense.- Enjoyment (5/10):I'm very picky when it comes to short duration guilty pleasure. And “Hellsing: Psalm of Darkness” reminded me of the reason why.

I haven't seen Saikano myself, but this one gave me a mental breakdown; much less than Iriya herself experienced in the anime, but more than what I experienced after watching any anime (except for Now and Then, Here and There, perhaps) so far.The 2005 vintage anime is a both sweet and dark love story, intermeshed with sparse humor and lingering suspense that draws you into the story. From episode 1 to 6, the mood changes dramatically, from somewhat ecchi humor in the first, to a quite of a heartbreaking finale. However, the speed is just perfect, not too fast to cram...in the plot, but not too long that it bores people. The remarkable thing is the abrupt changes in mood. In one moment you have a sweet scene where Asaba and Iriya is together, and suddenly Iriya collapses with blood pouring out of her nose, along with a seizure to boot.To tell the truth, I was expecting something like Yukikaze, with a fast-paced combat scenes. However, the main attraction is the love story; all combat you get is in the OP scene. That said, all the CG animations is very smooth, while the hand-drawn parts was constantly beautiful, with some noticeable quality drop every now and then.PlotWasn't the most original, but has a lasting impact.GraphicsConstantly very good, with the CG animation excelling everything. However, some parts are just...subpar; thankfully, none too often. Character designs are quite moe, which adds to the enjoyment.CharacterizationStock characters (eg, the over-the-top club president and the bratty imouto) are used sparingly yet effectively, without negative effects to the plot. All the main characters are round characters though, and most characterizations are always done subtlely. Though some traits are idealized, in general, the casts are round and realistic characters.AfterthoughtsI'm quite a softy, but I really feel I'm about to cry seeing the end of the last episode, having throughly absorbed in the atmosphere. I couldn't believe they wouldn't add a happy end, but for the sake of the plot, it might be better this way. Still though...Why bother at all?If you really need that anime that gives you sweet and dark love story with a sci-fi touch and beautiful character design without an unnecessarily deep plot, this one's for you. Casual UFO fans will also find the subtle UFO theme quite pleasing. Beware the bittersweet tragic ending though.TriviaLike Yukikaze, this story is drawn from a series of novels that is nominated for the Seiun Award (Japan's prestigious sci-fi award; Nausicaa anime and Dirty Pair novel won this award).

However there were bad parts, but thankfully not very often.SoundExcept for the awesome OP, the sound was so-so. The voice actors did their job, but sometimes their performances were pretty bad. There's not a lot of BGM, which could have been used more to enhance some scenes etc.CharacterThe characters were the best aspect of the show. The two main characters, Iriya and Asaba are great together, and the supporting characters did a great job; the over-the-top club president, the feisty little sister,  the strict military guys and so on. All the characters were realistic and made the story easy to watch.EnjoymentI have to say that I enjoyed this anime a lot. Sure, it's short, but the impression it gives you is pretty damn strong. The genres were all over the place; at on second you have a sweet scene with Iriya and Asaba, and the next you have a totally hilarious hand-to-hand combat scene involving two minor characters. The story isn't rushed even though the entire anime is about two hours long. Everything progresses slow and steady, from the beginning to the climatic ending. I'm not sure to whom I should recommend this, since it's such a different kind of love story, with dark sci-fi influences. I guess you have to be into the romance parts to enjoy this fully (like me).Overall: 8/10Don't know what more to say. If you decide to watch it, be ready for a good ride. :D the very dramatic finish.

I enjoyed watching this series very much.Story: Its a sci-fi kind of romance story, that I dig, so some people arent into the romance thing, and its up to them if they wish to watch. One thing is that since there are only a few episodes, they didnt do very much explaining, some things are left completely in the dark.Art: The art was very good, usually pretty colorful and rich, especially in those memorable moments where you feel kinda warm and fuzzy inside.Sound: Not a bad opening and closing for...this kind of anime, and there were no objectionable bgms either.Character: They didnt have much time to develop the characters, however, the main characters were quite memorable, especially Iriya.Enjoyment: I have to say that im a big fan of romance anime so I enjoyed this series very much, however if you dont really like romance, then there isnt much else that may get you hooked, so its a kind of love hate thing. this kind of anime, and there were no objectionable bgms either.Character: They didnt have much time to develop the characters, however, the main characters were quite memorable, especially Iriya.Enjoyment: I have to say that im a big fan of romance anime so I enjoyed this series very much, however if you dont really like romance, then there isnt much else that may get you hooked, so its a kind of love hate thing.', '""Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu"". I saw this was recommended to people who enjoyed Saikano, so i thought i\'d give it a try. Even though the story seemed awkward from the synopsis, i was actually looking forward to it.My first impression was ""Oh, i hate how the main character is drawn"". I decided to let it be, that i wouldn\'t let such a minor detail smuther my enjoyment, since i had heard and read good things about this. Fortunately, he was the only eye-sore. The art was pretty well made, and in the end it was one of the best qualities of this...anime.The setting was the average cliche school drama anime. Girl/boy meets boy/girl under peculiar circumstances, and the next day boy/girl transfers to girl\'s/boy\'s class.  This didn\'t bother me at all, i actually didn\'t even think of it as cliche until now, while i\'m writing this. The story was rather unique, and was another of the animes better selling points.What wasn\'t so appealing were the characters personalities. Some of the characters seemed more like they were created for the sole purpose of creating humorous situations. Let\'s take the club-president (i forgot the name) for example. An overly eccentric UFO-maniac who doesn\'t seem to have much relevancy to the plot. This wasn\'t the biggest problem with the characters in this anime, however. What i found more disturbing were some of the characters actions and responses, that reaked of irrationality, and wich i would deem unnatural and melodramatic. Often even unlogical, but that can be swept under the carpet due to the reasoning of ""actions caused by feelings are rarely logical"".""Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu"" is an anime with a unique plot and great potential, wich is ruined by badly made characters, and their badly made personalities.This anime deserved a 3, but i gave it a 4 in the end due to the pretty graphics and unique story.This was a tacky review made by me.

No really, I\'m not all that sure myself. Something about fighting aliens? I really don\'t fucking know. There were too many unexplained events to make any sense of it all. Everything seemed to just happen, without any reason as to why it happened. The plot seems to just go all over the place, the characters are a mess, and nothing really makes sense. I can\'t even describe this show\'s problems accurately since there\'s nothing to really even go off of.Much of the show seems to just exist as filler.

Indeed both animes share the same plan.Yes  it is a Love story, yes it is quite dramatic,and yes it  is spiced with a sience-fiction background. This is where the similarity ends however. Both animes are quite good actually, but they just follow their own routes to achieve a common goal. That is to make the viewer cry.- The story : not that much original. It's just a love story between a girl used as a weapon to save the world, and a boy falling in love with her and yet confused because...he wants to help her and yet he can't do anything to save her. Yetwhat makes it realy good, is infact the way that it is told. In that matter i will say, it is a master piece. To make things clear, if you expect action, crazy mecha/spaceships battles, than this is not the anime your looking for. The sci-fi plot is nothing more than a set where the plot takes place. And the plot is all about emotions, and sadness.- Characters : they are beautifully rendered, but we might argue on the lack of background to some non-main characters.

"", ""I had Iriya no Sora on my list for a long time. Having greatly enjoyed HanTsuki, six episodes isn't a flaw to me, so I was looking forward to it. What I found was an interesting anime to analyze, one that's deeply flawed yet touching.Story 6: The story is jumbled towards the beginning. The scene is never truly set, characters react to extreme events and statements far more matter of factly than if it were set in modern time. A large part of this is it being only six episodes so it did not have much of a chance for story development. It feels slightly...set in the future, but for the most part the main character is largely in the dark as to what's going on as well, which is why you learn as it goes on. However, there are multiple points in the story where it's easy to tell parts are missing, and it causes it to feel disjointed at times.Art 7: The art is pretty standard for an anime from 2006 or so. It's nothing that stands out overly for good or bad. For it's time though, it's fine.Sound 8: The opening is very nostalgic of the openings from that same time, such as for Air, or HanTsuki. Otherwise the ending was rather unremarkable, and the sound in the anime aren't overly impressive, but again for an old anime that's pretty standard, so for me the op bumps up the score.Character: 6 From the start, as much as I wanted to like the characters, and I did, it was still easy to see their flaws. Far too easy. The main character is pretty standard. Overly polite and pushover and nice. The girl is also pretty bland. A lot of their interactions are him just talking at her. She is a pretty character, and the development of her backstory does explain why she is. Part of that was due to the story and the lack of time to develop characters. However then I look at anime like HanTsuki, with very tight, consistent development. It was still easy to get attached to the characters, however there are times when they act contrary to their personalities. Obviously characters don't always act the same, but when it's a change on the spur of the moment, completely out of the blue that the nice main character acts like a jerk, it's still grating and shows the characters needed to be fleshed out more first.Enjoyment 8: In spite of its flaws, I did enjoy the series. It's emotional, touching, even if it's nothing truly special. But for six episodes, it is worth it. However it's also easy to see that if someone would get irritated by the two main characters not having much for personalities, then it would not be for them.Overall 7: It's a good anime, touching on the subjects of love, protecting one another, and how far you can let loved ones go, with a heartbreaking twist. However, its flaws are far too pronounced, even if I try to dismiss them, to rate it higher than this. Solid, and one that I certainly don't regret watching, but that could certainly be better and to some extent is a husk of its true potential. set in the future, but for the most part the main character is largely in the dark as to what's going on as well, which is why you learn as it goes on.

However, the element of mystery is perhaps the best element of the entire anime, yes because the rest is even worse. This anime tries to forcibly insert too many subplots within its only 6 episodes available, which makes everything a mess, a continuous confusion, an alternation of scenes, actions for which there is no build-up and sometimes not even an after-scene, so you get the impression of seeing a series of almost disconnected scenes from each other.But there is also worse in this anime, even wanting to ignore all the useless things that do not lead to any conclusion or development and focus exclusively on what in the last 2 episodes is understood to be the central point of the plot, one is still amazed by the incredibly poor execution with which everything happens. The most glaring thing and what annoyed me the most (and something I often notice in other anime), is how characters are theoretically extremely important (In this case, it seems that Iriya is so important that the fate of humanity literally depends on her), but at the same time extremely neglected or treated badly. Yes, Iriya has an undercover staff keeping an eye on her but... a staff that keeps an eye on what could be the salvation of humanity, but who gets tricked by a stupid teenager who manages to escape with the girl for a few days and lose their tracks, ok, fine, no, actually, not fine at all.As practically always happens in these anime, those who should be the “Adults”, the guardians, those who should guide/help the teenagers, behave like teenagers themselves and do not seem to have a behavioral discipline worthy of mature people.Iriya then has clear mental problems that are also perfectly understandable given her situation, but she also has several physical problems, episodes of random bleeding that it is not clear what they are due to or what caused them, which give more weight to the impression that this girl with the fate of the world on her shoulders is practically left to herself, alone with a teenager to live her adolescence despite all her problems.There is a mini cast of secondary characters who practically do nothing useful in advancing the main plot, which is normally not a problem in a longer anime since it is still something that helps with world building, but when you only have 6 episodes you can’t afford the luxury of wasting time with secondary plots that don’t lead anywhere.The main (male) character then is not even worth mentioning, he is the classic very bland character with almost no personality, with a predisposition tending towards the positive/generous without any particular facets.Only during the last episode are some clarifications made in the plot, it is explained what one of the initial scenes was, what the intentions of the team that supervised (with poor skills) Iriya were, but it is not exactly clear what happens to Iriya herself in the end, it is known that she went to fight in the “Final Battle” and that (presumably) she won in the end, whether she survived or not is not clear, however.Oh yes, I forgot to mention the entire sub-plot of the fight against the aliens and the war that is often mentioned in the anime but never takes center stage in the story, it remains a vital thing in the plot but remains in the background - you never see what happens on the battlefield or exactly what is being fought, not that this would have been particularly necessary, indeed it would have only weighed down the already confusing plot, however something so important should have remained more in the background and been less prevalent in the plot, because then it seems like you want to tempt the audience with a possible action scene but it is never shown.Like many other anime, this is an anime that potentially could have been a nice experience but for various reasons, including its duration, direction and even its characters themselves make it a mediocre viewing to be avoided... only stands because everyone is stupid.

Kyousogiga is a mess, that\'s not to say it\'s bad though. It\'s just so random and jumbled up that you really don\'t know what is happening, and to be honest with you that\'s what makes it so damn good.Kyousogiga follows the main protagonist, Koto, as she chases after a rabbit that she thinks will get her out of this fantasy-like word  and back to the real world where she can reunite with her parents... The...only problem with this not everyone wants you to leave.The only problem I really found wrong with this anime was the fact that it didn\'t explain exactly who Koto was and how she ended up in that world known as Mirror Kyoto , and for that I can see how people can give such a low rating, but you\'ve got to remember that 25 minutes isn\'t much to work this.. Especially with a story like this one.Overall, I found it really enjoyable and I\'ve already seen it two times.

That is all.', ""Kyousougiga is the absolute epitome of when anime attempts to be far too ambitious and subsequently obfuscates every piece of its content.  While I can't say I wasn't entertained while watching the short ONA, I also can't say that I have the slightest inkling as to why the anime was condensed down to nearly an unintelligible level.If there is one thing (besides viewer confusion) that definitely stands out in Kyousougiga, it's definitely the art.  Fast-paced and colorful, the animation really complements the chaotic nature of the ONA but only to the point of adding a visual level to the acid trip that is...the story.  If the rest of the aspects that make a good show were executed properly, Kyousougiga would have been an extremely good watch.Despite the outrageous visuals, the story was too dense for its allotted time.  Because of this, the viewer is left with vague ideas and general plot directions that are not terribly easy to follow. Honestly, Kyousougiga's story feels like the climatic moment in a longer series with no rising action or conclusion.Like the story, character development, due to the length of the ONA, was very much lacking.  We're pretty much forced to take all characters at face value because that's all we really see of them.To add on to the fire-pit, the soundtrack was pretty awful.  There were several moments where a musical score continued way after it should have and didn't even try to correlate to the moment in the show at all, although, considering the rapid sequence of events, it would probably have been just as chaotic to change scores between moments, too.While I'm necessarily hard on the show for its obvious faults, it's hard to say that it wasn't enjoyable.  Clearly, the problem with Kyousougiga was not that it didn't have the ambition to create something great, it was that it tried to do so in far too little time.  Even if given three or 4 times the amount of time it allowed itself (roughly the length of a movie), the show would have been spectacular.That being said, Kyousougiga is probably still worth giving a watch if you have 20 minutes and are in-between series, and especially if you liked FLCL or Dead Leaves as the nature of the three is very much similar. the story.

Magic Tree House,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10690/Magic_Tree_House,"['First of all, you should not watch this if you are expecting a mature, serious movie, this here is a movie to a series of books for children. So this movie is directed at children. I will write this review (which is actually my first, but i\'ll try my best) with that in mind.Story: 6I would say that the story is a typical moden fairy tail of a boy and his sister who find a magical tree house and do magic things with it. There were a lot of things that you could expect but after all it is a story for children and as...such, it did a good job. It reminded me a lot of some other movies that i watched when i was younger. The only thing i really disliked was the end but i wont spoil anything here, you just have to see for yourself.Art: 9I personally loved the art. In the first minutes i was already thinking to myself ""well, this looks pretty good"". The animations were pretty good, i loved that scene at the beginning in the classroom (you will know what i mean when you see it).Sound: 7I dont really know what this category is all about, if it\'s just about the soundtrack or the voice actors too. I will just write down my thoughts on both.The soundtrack was not that special but there were scenes when i thought that the music was pretty cool. It also reminded me of some other movies, sometimes it even reminded me of some soundtracks of movies from studio ghibli.In my opinion, the voice actors did a good job. At the beginning i was thinking that Annie\'s voice was a little strange but i learned to love it while watching the movie.Characters: 6The characters themselves were nothing special, either. They were just some mainstream characters in a story for children. (I don\'t really know what to say to this)Overall i liked it. I don\'t think that i liked it because of a unique story or anything (because there is no such thing here) but because i felt really nostalgic while watching it. In a way it was like those movies i used to watch all the time while i was a kid. And i bet, if i had watched this when i was younger, i would have loved it.I hope i could help anyone with this... such, it did a good job.

It takes the first quadrilogy (the Mystery of the Tree House arc), but replaces Mummies in the Morning with a loose adaptation of Vacation Under the Volcano, which is unfortunate as Mummies was always one of my favorites. It also includes a really needless B-plot about a classmate of Jack's who has a crush on him and wants him to star opposite her in Romeo and Juliet (totally a play every third grade class puts on).It also takes several other elements of the series and weaves them in - Peanut from the...second quadrilogy, Teddy from Tonight on the Titanic, Merlin from much of the later series - which was enjoyable to see. It's not a precise adaptation of the books, but aside from the B-plot, it made perfect sense, and was a really charming throwback to my childhood. I'd like to see it dubbed and released here in the US for the children's movie market, but that'll never happen, given the level of violence in the Pirates Past Noon section (the pirates frequently aim guns at Jack and Annie, and at one point try to shoot them). Still and all, it's a nice throwback for American weebs like me who want to relive their childhoods. second quadrilogy, Teddy from Tonight on the Titanic, Merlin from much of the later series - which was enjoyable to see.

While adults are too over occupied on the happenings and goings of the real world and have their thoughts rooted down to a sense of realism, the power of imagination of children is a powerful belief that can bring about miracles and sometimes transcend the boundaries of time. Magic Tree House is based on a collection of children\'s book written by Mary Pope Osbourne in 1992 and after 2 decades has found a way into the Anime world.It is set in a town of Frogs\' Creek and centers on 2 siblings Jack and Annie who one day stumble upon...a tree house filled with books and upon pointing at a location in a book it is able to transport them there. A problem i had with this is the inability to control time, they are teleported to a location but dont have control over the time period but since this is an anime they always end up right where they need to be. Their objective is to gather 4 medallions which will inact a \'miracle\' when brought together so they have to travel through different locations to find these medallions, unfortunately it is never pointed out what they stand to gain from this and are purely driven by a sense of justice, to do right, curiosity and to help someone in need.The Art and Animation was quite decent, not too much sakuga animation was used, character designs were generic and had a kind of experimental feel to them because it seemed the studio attempted to mix both Eastern and Western animation together. An outstanding and probably the main standout point for me was the art directing. Locations were done outstandingly well, the different cities were designed very well and really made up a big back bone of the show.Seiyuus did exceptionally well, especially Ashida Mana who plays Annie, although originally a singer this was her debut in voice acting and i have to say she did a wonderful job in bringing out the boyish and adventurous side of Annie. Soundtracks were decent enough, it was nice to see them use a dynamic soundtrack that changed depending on the time period.The personalities of the characters were nicely depicted, they depicted what you\'d see in most children put into situations such as this, a sense of wanting to discover and adventure. Jack plays the part of bookworm here, his knowledge on the time period helps to try to keep the audiences on route with the story. Annie however is somewhat hyperactive, and has a somewhat unorthodox lack of fear in the face of great danger and she has a strong sense of justice and of course a strong sense of adventure. Her escapades do warrant them getting into trouble atimes but that is essential in order for the story to progress though, so we can overlook it.The Magic Tree House is a story of adventure, magic and the power to make miracles happen by simply believing in yourself. It bases strong ethics on friendship, adventure and a need to believe in one self which unfortunately we all seem to lose as we grow up. a tree house filled with books and upon pointing at a location in a book it is able to transport them there.

The books have done very well, having been translated into over thirty languages. In 2011, Ajia-do animation works produced the first film based on the series. I'll be completely honest, I haven't read these books. I'm not going to know if the film version stays true to the original. I'll be looking purely at how well it stands on its own. With that in mind, let's take a look at Magic Tree House.Story:We open with a sorceress helping some children in a library. Once they're on their way out she's attacked by a...mysterious wizard and turned into a mouse. We cut to a more recognisable world where our heroes, Jack & Annie experience an incident at school involving chasing a frog. Apparently their teachers are very bad at maintaining order. On their way home, the two stumble across a tree house filled with books that can take them through time and space based on where they want to go from the books. They discover that there are four hidden medallions that they can find to make a miracle happen. While in pursuit of the second they encounter Morgan Le Fay, who tells them of her troubles and enlists their aid. Can they find the medallions and return Morgan's powers?The big failing of the narrative is that their visits to the various locations while they're searching for the medallions aren't that interesting. Most of them involve the kids wandering around, locating the medallion and getting chased by something. It gets pretty repetitive for a film that doesn't even run for two hours. There's also a lot of bluster surrounding whether or not Jack will play Romeo in a play but there's no reason to get invested in it since there are no real stakes to whether or not he does. Really, the whole thing amounts to a kind of heavy-handed illustration of his whole character arc and how he's learning to be more adventurous. There's also the whole de-powering and transformation of Morgan that kick off the adventure. The most intriguing narrative aspect throughout is wondering why. When the answer does come out it's a big let-down.That being said, the whole concept is a good one. The disparate settings are also interesting, even though most of them follow the same basic formula.Characters:The cast doesn't have that much to them. Annie is adventurous. Her brother is more reserved and bookish. They're character types we've seen before but there's nothing really wrong with the portrayals here.Art:The artwork is a bit mixed. I'll use the dinosaur setting as the big example. When they travel to the world of dinosaurs the flora looks good, the scope is grand and the dinosaurs themselves look like they didn't have much effort put into them. Even ignoring the fact that they forgot the feathers, the dinosaurs have blank looks and just look like they were drawn in five minutes. The same holds up throughout the film. You have some stuff that's nicely detailed and others where the art team doesn't seem to have tried.Sound:The acting is perfectly passable. The kids are voiced by Ashida Mana & Kitagawa Keiko. They aren't the best performances but there's also nothing really wrong with them. I could say the same basic thing about the music. It's fine.Ho-yay:There isn't any, nor would I expect a children's film to have any.Final Thoughts:That's Magic Tree House. How does it hold up? Well, I can't call it a good film. There are much better out there, including films made for children. That being said, I also wouldn't call it bad. In terms of kids' films it's pretty average. While it has an interesting concept and the visuals can look nice at times, the story is also kind of dull. The characters are over-used tropes and there are just a lot of points where they decided not to bother putting in much effort. My final rating is going to be a 5/10.

I had over 20 books (probably more) in my bookshelf. So when I discovered they made an anime almost a decade since the last time I read one of books, I was really surprised.   Watching this series, I couldn't help but have the nostalgia come over me.Characters:  We got Jack, a bookworm of a sort, who doesn't have much confidence in himself.  Annie, the courageous little sister who seems to have a good connection with animals.  and Morgan Le Fey,...an enchantress from Camelot who is Merlin's sister.   They're not exactly SPECIAL, but what can you expect, this is aimed at kids.Story:  The story is based off 3 books from the first arc of the book series + 1 book from another arc.  Then there was a mix of the problem from the first 2 arcs of the book series.  It really worked out for them.  There are parts that made me cringe a little though cause of how Morgan said she did not know the obvious solution of the problem, but I kind of think it was more to test Jack and Annie. Was the story deep and groundbreaking?  No, just really simple for children like I expected, since it IS based off a kids book series.Art:  I liked it.  Animation looked pretty, though when they showed Annie crying...it looked a little odd.  I liked Morgan's design a lot.Sound:  I'm not too great in judging the sound, but....the voice actors were good at least.  They fit the characters well.If you don't want to know the very basic of the plot don't read pass this:Morgan was turned in to a rat by Merliin.  Annie and Jack find mouse-Morgan and follow her to a tree house.  The tree house is full of books.  The power of the tree house is that it can take you to the world/time in the book by pointing to a book and saying you want to be there.  Annie and Jack have to find 4 medallions, to turn Morgan back to normal, in different time eras using the power of the tree house to get to each destination. an enchantress from Camelot who is Merlin's sister.

Perhaps, that was the point to learn as the story progressed. But realistically that rather brutal for a simple lesson. Some coins simply scattered in the entire world and perhaps only available in certain time zones all of which needs to be collected before one returns. That is tough, now include the person undertaking the task can't do it themselves and has no realistic way to insure one helps them rather than hurts them is quite risky/dangerous. Perhaps, i am over analyzing plot but i think it would make more sense for a villain rather than a...sensei.With introduction aside the presentation was rather encouraging a little. There was some mini adventures and when there wasn't one might be wishing there was. Thus, allowing for some moment of rest and anticipation.Conclusion was the best by far. Regardless, the fact that vulgarity is taboo in movies for children but do go through all that and not blow your lid is admirable.

Kurogane no Linebarrels,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3653/Kurogane_no_Linebarrels,"['""An anime whose overall excitement level can be mathematically modeled by the Gaussian distribution function.""As with many other GONZO production, Kurogane no Linebarrels is loosely based on its manga original. Readers from the manga will find the anime not exactly following the story and in some cases the anime is loaded with fan servicing fillers. Please note that this review will judge Kurogane no Linebarrels solely as seen from the anime perspective.GONZO started the series with a very rare approach, to bastardize the main protagonist (aka Hayase). Countless people turned away from the show after the first few episodes simply because of how much everyone...hated Hayase. I strongly advise viewer to not get irritated by the early episodes and push forward as the show will get infinitely better starting around episode 4. In fact, the Gaussian distribution curve is a very fitting description for this anime. Average beginning, average ending. I had very high hope in this show around the midway point but sadly the intensity did not carry over to the end. As a long time mecha anime fan (with particular interest in super robots), I find the concept to the story (more on that below) fairly “fresh” thus I was hoping for some serious story development. Unfortunately I set my expectations too high.The basic concept of the story was actually quite interesting. A teenage boy trying to be the ""hero of justice"" by piloting a mecha (known as Linebarrel) from another dimension. Viewers were informed in the beginning of the story that a universe/dimension exist in parallel to our own. While that dimension obviously differs from ours in virtually everything, we do share some common ground. The background theory of how the alternate dimension may be formed after the Big Bang was briefly discussed along the way. The story then proceeds to talk about the typical terrorist-taking-over-the-world stuff, leading to some heart-breaking betrayal and thus the climax to the story.""WARNING, weird looking characters alert! This is not a false alarm. I repeat, this is not a false alarm!"" Don\'t know if Hisashi Hirai (the character designer for Heroic Age, Infinite Ryvius, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed/Destiny, and Soukyuu no Fafner) hit his head or what, but I had a higher expectation from him. The faces of the main characters look like they have been put on TV from a sketch book! They look perfectly fine in magazines or any galleries you may come across, they are just horrible in the animation.Many viewers also complained about the CG battle animations, especially the first few battles in the series. While personally I have nothing against CG animations (I am actually glad to see something different for a change once a while), this also seem to be another fatal blow to Kurogane no Linebarrels. But with all that being said, the actual animation quality and scene to scene transitions are acceptable. So hopefully viewers can eventually get accustomed to the weird looking faces and CG battles and be able to enjoy the anime.Perhaps one of the obstacles the viewers have to get accustoms to is the OP by ALI PROJECT. Frankly, after learning that ALI PROJECT is responsible for the OP I decided to skip the OP whenever possible. However, the two ending themes by Maaya Sakamoto are worth your time (hell and heaven when compared to the OP).If you are familiar with seiyu (as most otaku do), you may want some info as to who is the CV for who. Yuichi Nakamura (Tomoya in Clannad, Alto in Macross Frontier) is voicing Moritsugu which I find very different from his past roles. Hayase is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara (Simon in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). The lovely Kizaki is voiced by the also lovely Mamiko Noto (Kotomi in Clannad, Hecate in Shakugan no Shana). There are many other award winning BIG names including Jun Fukuyama, Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, and many many more.The most noticeable character development without a doubt is Hayase\'s view of the ""hero of justice"". He matured overtime seeing how real world battles are fought and what he truly needs to protect and fight against (a very big change from the little punk he started out acting as). Unfortunately, after he “upgraded” his view of the justice system midway through the series, we see little to no change in his character thereafter. A lot of viewers have probably forgotten Yajima half way through the show, but his impression on me was extremely important and he played an irreplaceable role throughout the first half of the anime. Many mysteries were answered slowly overtime concerning certain characters’ past and why he/she end up being who they are in the show. Among many other things, Kizaki’s lost memory, and Ishigami’s past with Katou were the most interesting. Character relationship-wise, Kurogane no Linebarrels could have done some more work for the supporting casts. Many characters left hanging at the end with no satisfactory conclusion. Taken as a whole, the character department is definitely one of the weaker areas of the anime.While I agree there were many changes to the manga, it did not bother me much throughout the course of the show. After all, this show is about parallel dimensions, so why don’t we just treat the events in the anime and in the manga separately (perhaps treat them as they are in two different universes?). Lastly, I have to point out that GONZO must have enjoyed producing Strike Witches a lot. The production crews end up incorporating quite a bit of fan service in a mecha series and that could be disturbing to some viewers. hated Hayase.

So hopefully viewers can eventually get accustomed to the weird looking faces and CG battles and be able to enjoy the anime.Perhaps one of the obstacles the viewers have to get accustoms to is the OP by ALI PROJECT. Frankly, after learning that ALI PROJECT is responsible for the OP I decided to skip the OP whenever possible. However, the two ending themes by Maaya Sakamoto are worth your time (hell and heaven when compared to the OP).If you are familiar with seiyu (as most otaku do), you may want some info as to who is the CV for who. Yuichi Nakamura (Tomoya in Clannad, Alto in Macross Frontier) is voicing Moritsugu which I find very different from his past roles. Hayase is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara (Simon in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). The lovely Kizaki is voiced by the also lovely Mamiko Noto (Kotomi in Clannad, Hecate in Shakugan no Shana). There are many other award winning BIG names including Jun Fukuyama, Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, and many many more.The most noticeable character development without a doubt is Hayase\'s view of the ""hero of justice"". He matured overtime seeing how real world battles are fought and what he truly needs to protect and fight against (a very big change from the little punk he started out acting as). Unfortunately, after he “upgraded” his view of the justice system midway through the series, we see little to no change in his character thereafter. A lot of viewers have probably forgotten Yajima half way through the show, but his impression on me was extremely important and he played an irreplaceable role throughout the first half of the anime. Many mysteries were answered slowly overtime concerning certain characters’ past and why he/she end up being who they are in the show. Among many other things, Kizaki’s lost memory, and Ishigami’s past with Katou were the most interesting. Character relationship-wise, Kurogane no Linebarrels could have done some more work for the supporting casts. Many characters left hanging at the end with no satisfactory conclusion. Taken as a whole, the character department is definitely one of the weaker areas of the anime.While I agree there were many changes to the manga, it did not bother me much throughout the course of the show. After all, this show is about parallel dimensions, so why don’t we just treat the events in the anime and in the manga separately (perhaps treat them as they are in two different universes?). Lastly, I have to point out that GONZO must have enjoyed producing Strike Witches a lot. The production crews end up incorporating quite a bit of fan service in a mecha series and that could be disturbing to some viewers.', ""Alright, this anime finished recently, and I have to say I actually was anticipating for the last episode.In brief I'll just say, I was on the verge of rage-quitting this anime after the first 3 episodes - and if it wasn't because I started late (so that I didn't have to wait in between weeks) I probably would have dropped this anime.This is why I gave character the lowest scores, because the main character really annoyed me at first.But despite that, I pulled through and the anime really is good.I'm not a Mecha-anime fan, other than Full Metal Panic! I normally don't watch Mecha-anime (I...haven't seen one episode of Gundam before). So despite that, it really was good and kept me looking forward to each week.Although it's not GONZO's best work, the story was well done, and the art was brilliant - especially on High Resolution!Loved the use of the music in key points.So overall, it's definitely something to watch I reckon :)Just fight the first 3 episodes! haven't seen one episode of Gundam before).

Watch Linebarrels. Kouichi is a vicious, self-absorbed prick with delusions of grandeur and nary a whit of empathy, and his very presence makes the first four episodes of the series nearly unwatchable. There is a train-wreck fascination to watching a series with such an utterly vile lead, and there\'s no denying that the poisoning of Kouichi\'s mind by constant humiliation and the consequent brutality of his reaction to empowerment ring a lot truer than happier takes on the same material do. But so repulsive is he that the series is intolerable so...long as he holds sway. Not even the show\'s knowledge of exactly when to kick him in the balls can change that.Only when Kouichi himself changes, thanks to a vicious little plot twist, does the series get sufferable. Unfortunately it also loses its spine, giving itself over completely to soggy harem comedy and unelaborated us vs. them warfare. Excruciating as they were, the episodes where Kouichi rampaged his hateful way across the screen had ambition and a sort of unpleasant magnetism. With Kouichi sanitized, the series becomes nothing more than another fan-service-laden save-the-Earth mecha bore. It gains a sense of humor, albeit one dependent on tentacle monsters and ""oops I saw *insert name here* naked"" snafus, and dabbles amusingly in romance, but it\'s still a snoozeful letdown. Not that the show had much in the way of options. The choice between a series that\'s an object lesson in the need for a sympathetic lead and a series made flaccid by an ambition vacuum is truly a rock-and-hard-place kind of choice. And even if you wish the series had chosen the rock, if only because it has character, you can\'t really blame it for settling on the hard place.If relative effort is anything to go by, Linebarrels\' animators weren\'t enamored of either option. Hisashi Hirai\'s typically precise character designs are sloppy and poorly differentiated throughout, Gonzo\'s 2D animation is even more careless than usual, breasts balloon and shrink, faces fluctuate drunkenly, and after episode one action sequences are slapped together with little concern for comprehensibility. After a small post-debut dip Gonzo\'s trademark 3D mecha remain consistently sharp and fluid (if not particularly pretty) and the exploding stuff is sufficiently neat, as are the urban settings, but that\'s as far as the animators\' enthusiasm goes, regardless of which stage—boring or painful—the series is in.Musically it fares little better, though its auditory woes owe more to messy eclecticism than to a lack of artistic engagement. Some musical snippets are good (generally when Kouichi is thumping something) but many are bad, layering on dopey 50s sci-fi noodling, ill-considered techno, and ascending strings that are intended to communicate mecha coolness but sound instead like musical escapees from a Murder She Wrote climax. The opening by the Ali Project, like everything in their unique oeuvre, grows on you, and Maaya Sakamoto\'s closer is so easy on the ears that it may go right through them without imprinting the gray matter in between.Through a combination of scenes mildly mussed in translation and Josh Grelle\'s well-meaning rounding of Kouichi\'s more abrasive edges, Funimation\'s dub manages to soften the opening episodes, bringing them more in line with the duller, easier to swallow later ones. Lost in translation is the passive-aggressive disdain in Kouichi\'s exchanges with Yajima, along with much of his self-satisfied grandiosity and self-pitying petulance. Which makes his rampages much easier to watch, but also throws the tone of the opening act slightly off and weakens the contrast between pre- and post-episode-four Kouichi. Other characters have similar shifts in personality, but being non-essential have less impact on the series. The comic episodes for their part are played fast and loose (just the way I like \'em) and Barry Yandell\'s boisterous take on Kouichi\'s unhinged boss is great fun, but the dub still leaves less of an impression than the original—Grelle\'s excellent wigging out notwithstanding.Amidst the usual extras detritus (clean OP/ED, trailers, promos) is a commentary track for episode six featuring ADR Director Caitlin Glass, Grelle, and Alexis Tipton (Emi), all of whom get along boisterously well. Fun and info abound, though some will bristle at the comparison of Linebarrels to the infinitely superior Godannar. (Grr).Messy, ugly and mercurial, the potential for sudden change is never far from Linebarrels\' surface. In a series that is only interesting when it is impossibly unpleasant, that potential is one of the few things to inspire hope.

But overall, I enjoyed the show for what it\'s worth.Story/CharactersThe story starts off with the main character (Kouichi Hayase) being smashed by a giant mecha named ""Linebarrel."" He is brought back to life with super human abilities (Super strength, speed, etc.) by the power of Linebarrel called ""D-Soil."" With the mecha and new found abilities, he also finds a girl inside the robot named Emi Kizaki.Linebarrel is in a special rank of mecha (called Armas) called Machinas. (C wut day did thar? Deus Ex Machina/god out of the machine)....Hayase and Emi then join up with a top secret organization, masked on the outside as ""JUDA,"" who also have Machinas. JUDA\'s main goal is to take down the Katou Organization, an evil organization with mechas as well.Meh, the main problem with the story is that it doesn\'t actually pick up until half way through the show.What they ""try"" to do with the show is fuse a harem with a mecha show which doesn\'t work very well.Whenever the show would bring in these filler episodes it just seems to drag on, and I would just be watching for the hopes of a mecha battle to show up. So the harem parts are not done very well, and are only there to provide unnecessary fan service. As for the mecha portion of the show, this is the main meat of the show and is the best part. The story at this point is also filled with a few plot twists that actually caught me off guard at points. The ending though....Uggg the ending...So generic...As for the characters, they are also well done in my opinion. You\'re pretty much bond to find someone you like and most of them developed nicely. Not much to say besides that.PresentationThe music in the show is pretty good and fits nicely. The animation is also decent with the best part about the show being the mechas. At first, I hated how the mechas were animated using CGI. But over time, I found myself enjoying it, mainly because of how well they stick out. The mechs themselves are also nice and fairly unique. The main point I hated about the presentation was the fan service.It just got a little to random and unneeded at points. Cheesus, I\'m watching a mecha anime for the mechas, not for the girls’ panties.All in all, the presentation was nice.OverallOverall, I\'d say this is worth a look into.

Now that being said Kurogane No Linebarrels is a much shorter series with less twists and turns, a more simplified plot, and a less complex lead character.  Nonetheless the series had a good entertainment value and pretty good action sequences.The plot though pretty simple does keep its interest through a twist or two, character growth, character relationships, and the looming battles between mechs (Machinas and Armas).  I found myself looking forward to Hayase’s...growth in particular as he grew through his relationships, and battles, though as a character he was on the dumb side his nature to never give up somehow keeps you rooting for him and looking forward to his conquests.  Due to these reasons the plot was overall average.The art was clean and had good depth, however lacked orginality.  Orginality to me makes all the difference from a good anime to a great anime, that being said I was not turned off by the artwork, it just wasent a masterpiece in my opinion.  I was quite happy with the battle sequences and the clean transitions of lighting and affects.  To me this made the artwork good overall.The characters each had their own appeal, however their ability to truly connect to the audience and Hayese greatly lacked.  As I watched the series I felt that Hayese was an outsider, even though they worked together and had relationships he did not match up with the other characters.  I would site more specific examples however it would lead to spoilers for the series.Despite its flaws I was very entertained in the simplicity of this short series.  Due to this fact of sheer entertainment value I would still recommend this series…if other similarly related animes have already been watched that is.Rating 5/10POSTED BY @GameJok3r growth in particular as he grew through his relationships, and battles, though as a character he was on the dumb side his nature to never give up somehow keeps you rooting for him and looking forward to his conquests.

It looked like they did a bunch of drugs and got drunk and then did the script while hallucinating."", 'tl;dr: A mech anime with a pretty great character arc for the protagonist but that is lacking in most everything else.This anime is one that’s greatest strength, it’s protagonist, started out seeming like it’s greatest weakness. It starts with the standard premise of a random student suddenly gaining powers and becoming a hero, in this case with Hayase Kouichi becoming linked to the mech Linebarrel. What makes this anime unique is that unlike most anime with similar premises where the protagonist is just luckily inherently heroic and capable of acting as such, Kouichi is anything but. He starts off incredibly self-centered and immature, wherein even...though he rants on and on about being a hero of justice, he’s clearly just doing whatever he makes him feel cool without any regard for the effect his actions would have on anyone else, basically just going on a complete power trip and reacting violently to anything that hurts his fragile ego.There is background given on why he became the way he did, and though I’m sure many will disagree, I felt it was written reasonably well and justified properly. In general power corrupts even strong willed individuals. Thus, I definitely don’t think it’s unreasonable that a lot of power abruptly and without any explanation or structure being given to someone that’s always been powerless to the point they have a psychological complex about how powerless they are would result in how Kouichi acts. I mean, that’s a pretty typical trope really, just one that is usually used with antagonists or side characters and not the main protagonist, but I think that’s what makes it interesting.Over the course of the anime, Kouichi definitely changes tremendously. There are a few major events that result in massive sudden changes, but just as importantly is that there’s a pretty slow and subtle shift that manages to stick over time. That in and of itself isn’t that unique, but what I liked was how much he changed while also staying mostly the same. He’s just as obsessed with being cool and acting like a hero as he was at the beginning of the anime. However, what he perceives as cool and as just has changed tremendously and now he actually does seem cool. He’s still pretty self centered and does whatever he wants without really listening to others, but what he wants to do actually feels like what a real hero would do. His growth isn’t that of his actual core character changing at all, rather its more in the direction of him originally only talking the talk but eventually being able to walk the walk. His character arc is straight up him just gaining experience and practice. That’s it. But that simplicity still resulting in such a massive change is what makes it impressive and overall I think it holds up the anime reasonably well.Unfortunately, nothing else in the anime really managed to do all that well. There are attempts at giving character arcs and depth to the rest of the cast but ultimately I don’t think any of them worked and there weren’t any other characters that felt well fleshed out. There’s various relationship development as well, but outside of the romance between Kouichi and the main heroine Emi which was tied intrinsically to Kouichi’s character arc, that was all incredibly lacking too. That’s not to say they didn’t try. There clearly were attempts made to give at least something to pretty much every character. However, there just wasn’t enough content and in the end nothing really landed. The same applies to the combat, wherein it just doesn’t explain abilities or power ups properly and thus everything just seems sort of random.The plot was also kind of a mess. Firstly, the pacing is all sorts of weird, especially in the first half. It’s strange how much happens without anything happening at all. It feels a lot like long running shounen that are padding things out with fillers and such in order to not catch up with the manga, but that makes no sense for a two cour anime that seems to be trying to tell a complete story. That’s not to say that these parts are bad, the random humor and such are definitely amusing. But in the absence of what felt like much more critical content needed in regards to fleshing out characters and such, it felt like having so much was incredibly unnecessary.Secondly, what the plot ultimately builds up to was way too messy in too short a period of time. The majority of the plot of the anime is simple enough that there aren’t really any major plot holes, just a lot left unexplained. But towards the end the final twists get kind of ridiculous that they result in a level of dissonance that’s hard to ignore, and that’s coming from someone that’s really good at ignoring plot holes and inconsistencies. If things were more spread out amongst other plot events, or if there was a stronger emphasis on characters that the anime had successfully built into investment in, it would probably have been a lot easier to just gloss over things. But here it pretty much just feels like it’s giving you a straight infodump with loads of clear issues that are right in your face and that makes it kind of hard to pretend they’re not there.The ending is pretty standard and has the typical ride of emotional beats you would expect from such an anime. They don’t hit as hard as they should due to the aforementioned lack of proper development in most of the cast, but overall I think it worked well enough and almost hit all the right notes. There’s one incredibly major exception to that in that the ending doesn’t give closure at all on Kouichi and Emi’s relationship, even though it would have been so easy to do so. I thought that was because it was going to go in the epilogue OVAs, but nope, that left things hanging awkwardly as well. Whyyyyyy? Just kiss already damn it.The visuals were very much a mixed bag. The animation was pretty good and the art quality was also decent enough. However, the art style just straight up didn’t work a lot of the time, especially when an emphasis was put on characters faces or expressions, and thus despite it not really feeling budget, it still didn’t look very good. The mech fights had pretty great choreography, however the fights were all CGI, and this anime is from 2008 when mech CGI was nowhere near as good as mech CGI is these days, so it looks pretty bad. The soundtrack was solid, the use of insert songs in the last third was especially great. The OP has a pretty hype song that fits the anime well so I’m fine with it being used for the entire anime. The visuals for it are also solid, and they have some minor changes as the anime progresses to reflect the changing plot, but they’re so minor that it makes it feel off that it didn’t change more. The EDs had solid enough songs, and decent enough visuals, though I would have to say I preferred the first over the second in both regards. though he rants on and on about being a hero of justice, he’s clearly just doing whatever he makes him feel cool without any regard for the effect his actions would have on anyone else, basically just going on a complete power trip and reacting violently to anything that hurts his fragile ego.There is background given on why he became the way he did, and though I’m sure many will disagree, I felt it was written reasonably well and justified properly.

When the main character develops his first powers, he becomes wicked and rather mentally disturbed. At that point I thought I could prepare for a character outline similar to the idea used in Death-Note and Code-Geass, the I\'m-Evil-But-I-Do-Good style.however, after a few more eps, he completely drops this character and becomes a harry potter good guy, so I kind of lost the feeling there. the thrill was active for a few eps,...and in my opinion, it almost looks like the writer thought, ""nah, who needs thrill"" and in my opinion, it almost looks like the writer thought, ""nah, who needs thrill""', 'Overall I\'d rate Kurogane no Linebarrels 6 out of 10. There were numerous basic ideas lined out, but no major, developments occurred further on.Review may contain minor spoilers, but nothing that will affect viewability of the show. (KnL = Kurogane no Linebarrels)First off, the art used in this series was good. Nothing outstanding, but no shortcuts seemed to be taken. Every aspect from characters, through environments and special effects were easy to understand and I personally had no problems seeing what any of the displayed aspects were.Next up were the filler episodes. No surprise here, seems like most of series tend to have some at...one point or another. However thing I liked about filler in KnL is that it pinned very nicely into main arc of the series which is a rare phenomenon.When it came to character performance in the story, there were many clichés, but they were fairly enjoyable. Constant changes and twists in character standpoint may have been exaggerated, but I wouldn\'t say that they interviened in overall image of KnL.Now here\'s several things I disliked in this series. First and foremost, this isn\'t a spoiler of any sort, but repetition of ""Hero of justice"" throughout entirety of this series, was quite a nuisance. Phrase tossed around everywhere and used to fill dialogue gaps and reason character actions became quite repetitive and truly became rather annoying after some time. Nonetheless there were some background put to support this \'catchphrase\' eventually.Another aspect of KnL is its\' interpretation of ecchi. In comparison to other parts of the series this didn\'t take up too much time or was significant in any way, but overall seemed like a tool used to keep viewer watching the show. Personally didn\'t mind it, but the timing, and reasoning for it all, was just ridiculous and appeared almost as a desperate technique.Story wise there isn\'t much I can write about without adding spoilers. However few developments throughout most of series made episodes quite dull and repetitive. Although ending was quite informative and interesting. Most of questions I\'ve had stored up have been answered and surprisingly, it made me wanting to watch a short sequel or something of such basis.Lastly there were few things that I found quite dumb about KnL. Beginning with the group of people series is following (Read synopsis). Even putting their age into consideration, average intelligence level is nothing impressive. Character group importance is quite big taken everything story presents into examination. Thus I was expecting intelligent people dealing with situations in distinct manner. Which as you may understand now did not happen. At least not in my eyes. Moving on, creators made an attempt at spicing up the relationship between the characters. Some of those attempts worked well and others were a pathetic flop. Now when it comes to this point, it is difficult being subjective and I\'m sure different viewers will perceive this differently. But from me, I\'d say effort was there, but it was overexerted on wrong occasions.To conclude the review, just like I wrote in the beginning, I\'d give KnL 6 out of  10. The negatives outweighed the positive aspects, but thats not to matter. I did enjoy watching Kurogane no Linebarrels, although repetitiveness, and certain parts might have made it a drag to watch the series. I\'d say that you should watch KnL yourself to see whether you\'ll like it or not, but a definite recommendation is something I would not personally give. one point or another.

In this sense, this series accomplishes its goal perfectly, and it's fun and entertaining all the way through its 62 episodes runtime, with the last twelve being an expansion of the original run of the first 50 and, incredibly enough, very reminescent to me of Ultraman Tiga. It's colorful and vivid, the...music is entertaining, the voice acting as well as the singing numbers by Mami Koyama are very good, there is nothing particularly bad to point out except my personal qualms about the way Momo's secret identity and the link between Fernasinara and earth are treated (I excused it in Mahou Tsukai Sally because it's an older series, not here) but still it's a good series nonetheless. As an ending note, A shout out to Inka-Subs for providing the fansubs for the first 25 episodes before Crunchyroll took the reins is due, I think.

Like we've seen time and time again just how pathetic their life is and how little meaning they seem to have in their privacy.

Pokemon Movie 04: Celebi Toki wo Koeta Deai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1119/Pokemon_Movie_04__Celebi_Toki_wo_Koeta_Deai,"[""quite honestly, i know the pokemon movies have been getting some eh reviews but i personally think they are pretty good.i understand that they aren't directly related to the shows but that's okay in my book really, this one is no different. the story does remind me of princess mononoke but i rather liked the nature feel of the whole thing. i enjoyed the art, a new yet familiar design to how i remember pokemon to be. i liked all the voice acting and characters..well lets just say i got a surprise with one of them. i enjoyed the use of the original group and...i would say this movie is pretty good for anyone who is a pokemon fan and has some free time. i would say this movie is pretty good for anyone who is a pokemon fan and has some free time."", ""Pokemon 4EVER is not only the worst English Pokemon title, but also the worst movie among the original five. Shallow in every way, there's not much good you can say about this movie. Frankly, the only positive constant throughout the movie is the gorgeous art. In a few of its quiet moments you really feel like you've been transported into a heavenly forest. There's also a single fun sequence consisting of a fight with a pokemon trainer and the ensuing battle against time, as Ash runs to an already departing ferry. If that sounds like very little, that's because it is.On a more critical side...of things, the cringeworthy introduction of the main antagonist is hard to watch. As his terrible (in both dub and sub) evil laugh spreads throughout the forest, your brain hurts - how did he invent pokeballs that turn pokemon souls evil and have an effect of leveling them to level 100? As you wonder, he suddenly pulls out an awkward spider mech. Movie, can we please go back to Ash?Another poor victim of the movie is the dialogue. After the pretty good (subbed) dialogue in the first movie, servicable dialogue in the second and some really good lines in the third, this movie treats us to really cringey writing period. Beyond that, the whole plot is filled with contrivances and nonsense in general. Following the bad choices from the second movie, all science and logic are thrown out of the window. Nothing makes sense and nobody tries to explain anything. The movie presents us with the first braindead Pokemon fantasy ride instead of a realized Pokemon world.Character development doesn't happen. There's no complexity to anyone and there's a single forced designated character development scene, which, frankly, doesn't work. The movie feels like a made for tv production aimed at kids aged 3 to 5, inducing only cringe in anyone older when it turns to self parody as Ash graciously flaunts Celebi's dead body towards the screen as a cheap way of making us care (before reviving him because you can't have death in a Pokemon movie).In conclusion, there's not much good in here. It simply exists. I can only tentatively recommend it to extremely hardcore pokemon fans who watched the whole anime series and after all of that have no standards left whatsoever. If that's you, you might enjoy some comfy moments it offers. For a few minutes at least. of things, the cringeworthy introduction of the main antagonist is hard to watch.

Though halfway through, with Celebi being possessed, things did get real, and it got interesting from that point.And aside from the weak story, it was great. Sam and Ash\'s friendship was really cute, and there was a lot of nice, cute bonding moments. The animation was beautiful, and there was a number of drop-dead gorgeous scenes. Celebi was very cute, and there was some good humor especially...from Team Rocket.But once again, what secured it\'s grade was the direction. Things really pick up halfway through, and it keeps getting better and better until the climactic scene, which is possibly the single definitive moment of the series.As a whole, a big step down but a good movie overall. from Team Rocket.But once again, what secured it\'s grade was the direction.

The sound are the usual, and fit the film very well.The plot takes its time, but no matter how deep and touching it tries to be, all that's really accomplished is a good attempt to connect emotionally with the characters. That is where the movie fails most.For a change, it is nice to see there is someone in Team Rocket that gets the job done. And yet, like in all children's stories, the evil must not win. The good will prevail....No matter how strong and impressive the opposition, how desperate the situation, there is no way the good guys will lose.Maybe I'm a bit old for this film and those alike it, but it also weakens the general structure of the film because they ruin the strong premise with something illogical that would never work in reality.

The themes of friendship, courage, and the timeless battle between good and evil. Celebi\'s ability to traverse time adds the little spice that was needed to get the plot going.In conclusion, ""Pokémon 4Ever"" is more than just a movie; it\'s a nostalgic trip that rekindles the joy and excitement of being a kid growing...up with the games and movies.

Even I could easily give this movie a much better title, and I'm so high on sugar right now, that you don't even know! I know, that I'm not supposed to have such a high expectations towards this movie, since the first three movies were awesome to me - if humbly flawed, to some degree - but this... Argh! This is not a good time, to be called a pokemon fan, spoiled by the awesomenes of Mewtwo, Entei and Lugia! To be honest, I'm not sure, what to call this movie. Technically, this should be rated as a...bad anime, but I can't really call this a shitpie-level bad, so... Yeah. Let's call this movie, with its real name. Pokemon 4Ever: The Fanservice - because, seriously... there's not much else, what this movie can really offer, even for a fans of the series!My biggest problem with this movie, is the story, which is suprising, since the premise to this movie is actually quite decent - at best - with time traveling, sacred forests, ever-so-japanese springs of life, new legendary pokemon, and all that good jazz. But, to follow that all-so-tired 90's trendmark of enviroment vs man, why oh why did we need that very same shtick pastered into this movie too?! We didn't - Blinky Bill took that part to the ludicrously preachy levels ages ago! Why not keep it nice, and simple for just a once, you guys, and let the story have conflict, without third-hand-policy?! Humans are boring, as a villains, if they're not correctly motivated, and this villain, is not - is he even a villain, I honestly cannot say! All he wants, is money, and power, but he's also so stupid, that he refuses to sell those 'dark' pokeballs of his, that will exhalirate any pokemon potential to the fullest possible point, thus turning them into... evil? Kay! Hook some brother in with those, and you'll have a mint in no time! Boring as hell, and just... stupid, as hell! And let's not talk about our favourite terrorist group, Cobra... no, the Team Rocket, because let's face it... they're not doing anything worth mentioning!And Suicune... why was he there? No, seriously... why was he there - it is a 'he', right?! He kinda just... was there, and now he is there, and no... he isn't there. Really? That's it?! Really?! Seriously, what a wasted potential! What this movie desperately needed, was some serious re-writing, and better CGI - it hurt my eyes! Hear me out... If Celebi was this... protector of the forest, or what not, and Suicune was... also there, then why couldn't there be some sort of power strugle, between two legendary pokemon - with epic proportions, 'course! - of who's got the right to be the true protector of this... sacred forest, that no one truly really exactly cares anyway? And... Ash being there, for... some reason, because... he doesn't age? That would have been so much more interesting to watch, than this wild goose-chase, with this washed-up loser-bad guy, with stupid name - his name is Vicious, btw - with no real motivations, absolutely hollow and pointless plans, and a personality of a wallpaper! Kinda the same, what they did with the second movie, but... second movie was good! And this time, Ash wouldn't have to be this messiah, or martyr, or anything like that - just be there, and your MC-powers will prevail! And the ending... oh my Grisaia the ending! So stupid... so very, very... stupid! Ouch!For what this movie actually was, it felt more like a Captain Planet episode, mixed in with pokemon, and I didn't like that! Usually, pokemon movies are very personal at their stakes and consequenses, when saving the world, and learning something new about the world, about themselves, or something like that, but this... I couldn't find any of these things, from this movie. Nothing was learnd, nothing was changed, and all that needed saving, was this stupid forest, that no one cares! Theres nothing for Ash to do, so... why was he even there?! And those steam-punk pokepalls... I'm not even going there - all the missed possibilites hurt my very soul! The story itself, isn't even that strong to beging with, so that no real stakes, consequenses, motives or themes can't really occure, when compared to the first three movies - expecially the third! - and Celebi... is just a another Mew, but less with personality. Lucky him... Suicune had absolutely nothing to give!Giving this movie a solid 5, almost seems too high into my critical eye, but I must be honest... I actually quite enjoyed this movie. To the degree, with flaws and all! It was, what pokemon fans can expect it to be, but nothing else, really, and that poor CGI... ugh! Let's not talk about that! If only this movie could have gotten itself out of the woods - no pun intented - then this movie, could have been on the par, with the first one, Mewtwo strikes back, but, since we really got just this wattered-down 'movie-special' about professor Oak, and better explanation for his undying trust to this goofball-Ash - yeah, spoilers, again - theres really nothing special to celeb-r-a-t-e. This movie is a solid for a hardcore pokemaniacs, and some of the regular fans might find this somewhat decent, but for a not-fans... try to find something else.And hey... who has a charmeleon, and makes it use a headbud, in a battle?! Or a water-type, against electric-type?! Now that's just... wrong!Story: 4Art: 7Sound: 5Characters: 3Enjoyment: 6Overall: 5 bad anime, but I can't really call this a shitpie-level bad, so... Yeah.

I guess I'm the only one who literally didn't find this enthusing. I have not seen much of Pokemon so I don't know if the story's kept interesting, the characters in-character or the art being changed, but let me review.Story: The plot takes place in a forest, much like movies like Princess Mononoke or Castle in the Sky. But these kids find this monster who happens to be a time traveler. But then they run into this vicious guy who tries to make the monster turn from good to bad and it's up to the team to turn him back into a good monster.The...art is alright, I guess. There were some computer-generated animated scenes, but I guess it's pretty decent. Not the best out there though, could've been better. Can't say anything about the sound, but from what I remember, it's pretty much kept as usual.As a matter of fact, my cousins are obsessed with Pokemon and used to watch it all day and I used to watch it with them ever since I was like 5-7. But got tired of it, watched a Jiggly Puff special at eight-years-old, found that to be good, but I found this film to be very disappointing.I used to watch Pokemon when I was little, but not very much. I guess I'm pretty much grown out of it now and I heard that there's a lot of hate out there for this show, Naruto and Bleach (mostly the old, kiddish anime shows). art is alright, I guess.

Like, the first three movies were all deep and moving in some way. This one was just dark and sad. I'm not sure that there was any real message it was pushing. Kind of just a generic villain looking to abuse Pokémon for his own gain.Celebi annoys me. I'm sure that plays a big part. And something about the way the movie looks makes it hard for me to stay focused and pay attention. Visually, it's very...dark. Like, the animated equivalent of filming every scene of a live-action movie on a cloudy day. Even the 'bright' scenes have this muted look to them.But for some reason, I remember watching this one over and over as a kid. The time travel element is kinda cool, and I actually really liked the Professor Oak connection and the tiny insight it gave us into how technology in the Pokémon world has advanced over time. Now that I've got something down for a review, it's probably safe to say that this is the last time I'll watch 4Ever, but it was a pretty big part of my childhood, and I was surprised as I was rewatching it to realize that I remembered just about every scene pretty vividly. dark.

Even though pokemon as a whole is truly marketed towards kids and I have caught a few episodes of the anime series here and there I do appreciate the fact that when pokemon enters the realm of making incredibly compelling films they surprisingly put enough effort to make the films not only enjoyable to kids but also enjoyable to adults as well. Before I watched this title, I had only...ever seen the first pokemon movie and I did enjoy what they did for the first movie.First of all, you can't go into a film like this for high expectations. It is a pokemon movie after all, but while it's not nor will it ever be the most engaging piece of cinema it actually excels on what it tries to do. There are a lot of boxes you have to check off in order to make a pokemon movie engaging and fun and Celebi: Voice of the forest certainly does the majority of them with a few minor flaws.Celebi: Voice of the forest focuses on a pokemon trainer by the name of Sammy who encounters and protects Celebi from a pokemon hunter. Celebi who is a mystical pokemon uses it's power to whisk itself and Sammy 40 years into the future where he meets Ash Ketchum and his friends who travel in the mystical forest in search of rare pokemon. They end up meeting and partnering up with Sammy in order to stop Celebi from being captured by a man and and a member of team rocket by the name of the Iron Masked Marauder who wants to capture and control Celebi by using a special type of pokeball called the Dark Ball that has the ability to capture a trainers pokemon, turn them evil, and max out their power to the highest level. He also enlists the help of team rocket favorites Jessie, James, and Meowth who are still on their never ending crusade to capture pikachu but they serve more as comic relief than anything else which is not really any different from their presence in the world of pokemon.The one thing I will really priase this film is the quality of animation. I do love the fact that you can see such a huge upgrade in the animation when seeing pokemon make the transition from a television series to a film. The animation is absolutely breathtaking especially when you see Celebi flying around in the forest and in some of the many battles you'll see against different pokemon there is some really great attention to detail albeit miniscule to the untrained eye about how intricate some of these pokemon battles are. When ash's pikachu battles a croconow during the opening credits and it's not as simple as each pokemon just performing a single attack against each other. It's a lot more detailed than that because there are actually a lot of playful wrestling and attacking from each pokemon but the animation is so fluid it feels so different yet so rewarding from any other pokemon battle that you ever seen. This style of battling and the fluid animation that comes from it is also seen in other pokemon battles as well especially when Ash and Sammy takes on some of the pokemon that the Iron Masked Marauder unleashes through this dark pokemon balls.The movie in itself doesn't have the most diverse cast of pokemon. Since this pokemon film takes place mostly in the forest your going to see a wide array of bug and ground type pokemon but there are cameos of flying and water style pokemon as well. Beyond Celebi we also have the appearance of another mystical pokemon by the name of Suicine who is integral to the story because he helps Ash, Sammy, and the rest of the gang defeat the Iron Masked Marauder. For as basic as the plot may be, the final third of the movie is a battle of a very epic scale where they take on a dark corrupted Celebi who has taken residence in a giant forested golem wreaking havoc on the forest.The music is incredibly fun with some really good English tracks and I have a lot of fondness for the opening track born to be a winner. The film does manage to have some very heartfelt sad moments and even though it doesn't have the most in depth character development, one theme it does showcase is that the concept of time plays an important part on how a friendship can be established and strengthened because by the very end the story manages to come full circle in the world of pokemon and you'll be amazed on how this film connects to the very first episode of the pokemon tv series because it shows great care with regards to respecting the source material while retaining the positive qualities of what makes pokemon enjoyable to begin with.The film is very brisk 75 minutes so your not given a lot of time to flesh out the story as much as you would like to be but it does get the job done adequately enough. There is not much in the way of humor and team rockets antics might be funny to your average child but it kind of falls flat if your watching this as an adult because if you've watched any aspect of pokemon we get so use to watching Jessie, James, and Meowth fail so many times nothing really feels new and inventive. For as evil as the Iron Masked Marauder he is truly a shallow one dimensional villains that only seeks to overthrow Giovanni as the leader of Team Rocket and try to take over the world with his Dark Pokemon. That is pretty much hum in a nutshell.With a simple story, some heartfelt moments, beautiful animation and a great attention to detail when it comes to  pokemon battles - this film is still a solid entry in the world of pokemon. It may not give you biggest emotional heartfelt punch like the first film and the overall setting is very narrow minded but despite the tight time crunch of the overall film it manages to cover a lot that would make any pokemon film enjoyable to begin with. ever seen the first pokemon movie and I did enjoy what they did for the first movie.First of all, you can't go into a film like this for high expectations.

This time around we\'re looking at the fourth film from 2001. So, this was during the time of the best game generation, 2. Let\'s have a look.Story:We open with Celebi being chased by two counters, Houndoom and Scyther. Surprisingly for the anime, the type advantage seems to actually matter and Celebi seems to be in trouble. Until a young boy, Yukinari, comes to the rescue and the two go forty years into the future to escape. We enter the present day with Satoshi, Kasumi & Takeshi taking a ferry...to explore deeper into the Johto region. They go to a treetop village in search of interesting Pokemon and they just so happen to see a bright light and find the young boy from the past. The group then has to contend with a Team Rocket Pokemon poacher who\'s using special Dark Balls to turn Pokemon evil. So, kind of the plot of Colosseum but before that game existed.The big problem with the film is that the environmental themes get overly preachy. It really wants to emphasise the importance of protecting the woods. And, like many environmental works geared towards children, they undermine their message by having the damage that gets caused be easily fixed for a happy ending. You don\'t need to protect the environment, Kids, the fairy magic can fix any damage that gets done. Literally the most counter-productive way to discuss environmental issues. It\'s also a little weird that the film goes out of its way to put Celebi against type counters but doesn\'t worry about type matchups at any other point. I mean, Satoshi puts a Bayleef against a Scizor and multiple protagonist Pokemon are shown as having good matches against opponents they should have no problem with. So, I really don\'t know why they\'re going out of the way to use type matchups against Celebi and nowhere else.On the positive side, the pacing is pretty solid. The film has some slow, quiet moments to showcase the beauty of the forest and allow the atmosphere to build. It\'s also pretty good about introducing its important elements early. There are also some cute scenes of Celebi just playing around that are reminiscent to the scenes in the first Pokemon film with Mew while also being their own thing.Characters:The characters are barely worth mentioning if I\'m being honest. The main cast is the same boring trio we\'re already familiar with. The only thing semi compelling about Yukinari is the twist that you get at the very end and it\'s very much a case of ""if they\'d leaned into it earlier and actually gone somewhere with it it might have been interesting."" The antagonist is just a one note arsehole who couldn\'t get hired as a CEO and decided to join Team Rocket as a backup.Art:OLM did a pretty good job with the artwork. The Pokemon look good. The nature scenes are very nice. The animation is pretty well done. The character designs aren\'t the best. The antagonist looks really dumb. The side characters are just kind of boring looking and I\'m including Yukinari.Sound:The acting is fine. Matsumoto Rica, Hayashibara Megumi, Iizuka Mayumi, Ueda Yuuji and all of them deliver decent enough performances. They\'re just kind of limited based on how dull their characters are. The music is fine as well.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any.Areas of Improvement:1. If you\'re going to have environmental themes, don\'t go over the top with them. I get it, trying to keep the planet habitable by ourselves and dogs is very important. But when you go over the top, it hurts the message you\'re trying to convey. It makes it seem like environmental villains are these over the top caricatures and makes it difficult for people to recognise the more subtle, actual environmental villains who are usually causing damage for expediency or profit.2. If you want your message to stick, you can\'t have everything undone through magical means. And I understand that that means you can\'t have a fully happy ending but sometimes a bittersweet ending just works better.3. The characters really need more development. I understand that your main trio along with Musashi, Kojirou & Meowth aren\'t going to change ever but at least do something with your side characters and the film\'s antagonist.Final Thoughts:This film is pretty mediocre. Its ideas have some potential and seeing Celebi play around happily is cute but those ideas ultimately fall short through underdevelopment and it ultimately doesn\'t do much. My rating is going to stand at a 5/10. to explore deeper into the Johto region. They go to a treetop village in search of interesting Pokemon and they just so happen to see a bright light and find the young boy from the past.

Chekov's Gun is a great writing tool, and s2 doesn't use it at all; drop a couple hints that something is gonna happen before it happens, otherwise it feels completely out of left field.

Aniplex\'s continued mismanagement of COVID, which saw this show (and Ayakashi Triangle) infamously delayed by almost half a year, and the worst offender of all: VA Tatsuhisa Suzuki\'s BIGGEST scandal of his life being ousted from the AniManga scene altogether, replaced by Yuichiro Umehara as the gigachad\'s new VA...that doesn\'t sound quite right.Back in Summer 2020, when the anime...adaptation of novelist Shu\'s Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha a.k.a The Misfit of Demon King Academy was released, I LOVED the hell outta everything that made the source material gain the notoriety that it did with humongous sales of the LN. It had the classical tropes of an OP MC in the form of Anos Voldigoad (who would become the gigachad GOAT of the fantasy genre); a harem based off sisters of the same blood through Misha and Shasha Necron (that at least acknowledged that Anos cared for the both of them like his own kin); the hilarious but momentful Anos Fan Club of female classmates that would at times be the shining light in the darkness; as well as the Hero Kanon in the form of his reincarnation Lay Glanzudlii with his etched lover Misa. Maou Gakuin was, simply put, a firehouse of awesome (as heck) fantasy for the ages. Despite the aeons of people hating this show, I am still the greatest advocate that Maou Gakuin was a sight to behold back in the day, and I stand by my ludicrious, whack review published 3 years ago.Fast forward to Winter (or rather, restarted in Summer) this year, and we continue with the adaptation of Volumes 4a and 4b of the LN that comprises the rather large story that is the Great Spirit arc, and this is definitely where Maou Gakuin took a full nosedive here. Considering the element of the story that was the epilogue of Volume 3 a.k.a the ending of Season 1, which prompts Anos and the gang to go back 2,000 years in time to learn of what comprised the reveal of the biggest enemy: the fake Demon King that was Avos Dilhevia. This, essentially, brings them back to the mother of their appointed affair: the Great Spirit Leno and Anos\'s right-hand man, Shin Reglia. Taking classes in the spirit realm, headed by the Great Spirit Teacher Enyunien, Anos and the gang go back to being schooled one more time to uncover and unravel the sequence of events that led to the scenario of the present day.Needless to say, I truly got bored in the whole teaching aspect as it was cumbersome to sit around and see Anos and gang try to learn new things, as well as the history of the places they\'ve been, and more importantly, those who are in rebellion against Anos to dethrone him and make Avos the true Demon King, say the main villain of this arc, NousGalia. As a whole, the Great Spirit arc was both a blessing and a curse to the author, as Shu had to somehow continue the story by pacing it within the same aspects as his/her first 3 volumes a.k.a Season 1, but due to the magnitude of the arc having to be split into 2 volumes with the aforementioned Side A and B, both the pacing and the feels dropped off significantly, which if you add Aniplex\'s COVID mismanagement,which caused the entire run to be postponed 6 months to August, the story indefinitely would have been forgotten to time, and I had to dig my brains just to remember where we left off with the story. That alone is a double whammy to the anime\'s production, and with no thanks to the somewhat overly convoluted plot, is no consolation to the testament of the anime at this stage of the story.It\'s a BIG shame having to lose Tatsuhisa Suzuki for his misforgivings, but no matter the outcome, we all can agree that he is scum for being in an affair after being wed to one of AniManga\'s biggest music artists (LiSA). Definitely not the kind who is a big 180 from the gigachad\'s personality. And for the most part, Yuichiro Umehara does a decent job on Anos, though thanks to Season 2\'s 2nd cour airing next year, we all still have to get used to his voice for yet another 12-episode seasonal run. One of Maou Gakuin\'s shining moments was definitely with Tatsuhisa Suzuki, and his being ousted means that the anime has lost a critical part of its quality.With the Domino Effect of Aniplex\'s mismanagement comes Silver Link\'s production woes, which, despite being still headed by the studio\'s chief director of Shin Oonuma and his mentee of fellow director Masafumi Tamura, have shown quite the drastic change in quality in becoming inconsistent, which they got too comfortable with after the impressive showing of Season 1. It\'s not wrong that Season 1 gave them a lot of footing to work on for Season 2; it\'s just that the priorities were shifted around when the anime got suddenly postponed and came back 3 months prior for the TV broadcast\'s restart. And while Season 2 didn\'t look awful by any means, it was clearly a step down from its predecessor, which was made worse thanks to the delay from COVID.My woes with Part 1 of Season 2 continue onto the OST. Obviously, new songs are added to the roster of the OST, and this time, I felt nothing about Lenny code fiction and Momosumomosu\'s OP and ED respectively. Considering that Season 1 hit it out with Civilian and Tomori Kusunoki\'s OP and ED songs that are good and banger, respectively, the noticeable downgrade always caused me to skip both songs (albeit a few for the ED) that held nothing of the flare that I remember from Season 1.When all is said and done, the word ""disappointment"" is truly an understatement to call Part 1 of Season 2 by. Everything was clicking out of place, from the ""cannot make heads nor tails"" story beats to the lacklustre production, made worse by the decision from Aniplex to postpone the anime, throwing everyone out of whack. It\'s quite the forgettable 1st half to a sequel season that has its predecessor held to a very high regard, and I pray that Part 2 of Season 2 will hopefully bring us back to the levels of greatness that graced Season 1.Right now, at this very moment, Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha hits a snagging fluke, but will it have a glorious comeback?

When so many try to be a serious anime, with an OP protagonist, that falls flat on it's face with a boring concept, a bland as all hell MC, that tries to be a great character in every stretch of the word, but Anos isn't that. He'll break every mold, every generic trend in half like he is the god damn terminator, cause honestly. Badass can be slapped on him, more so than any of these lame generic messes you'll see each anime season. It's the type of power fantasy to sit...back and enjoy, rather than loathe and dislike.Story and characters: 8Wile the story is good in it's own right, much like the characters stand out in their own right. Let's face it. We mostly wanted to see our big gigachad just come in, and wreck shit. It's so good to see it back too, as hell. If it wasn't for it going in this direction, I doubt the story, or other characters would be interesting to this level. Props to those who made it this way, as even the VA, it makes Anos sound great, look great, and drives attention and interest compared to a typical cookie cutter type of OP protag story.To touch upon the story more, there is a lot still to uncover, which also helps drive interest in it's contents. Even if you know full well, that Anos will take one huge dumb on it, the world building and such is really well done, and for a good moments, the treats do seem quite serious. They'll getcha, pull you in, and then you realize it's impossible, as they're with Anos. Which for this show, isn't a negative point at all.Art and sound: 8Is it just me, or does the art seem better? No, I won't be talking too much on episode 3, or well. I'll let you see that for yourselves. But if you look at the general art, from character movements, to backgrounds, to how the attacks and magic look. It's a stand out, and looks brilliant. To be matched with a great sound, that really fills the atmosphere of each and every scene that comes about.Our Gigachad is welcomed back with open arms, and I can't wait to enjoy more of him. back and enjoy, rather than loathe and dislike.Story and characters: 8Wile the story is good in it's own right, much like the characters stand out in their own right.

It went from pretty good Overpowered MC anime to just nonsensical in season two.  The whole rumors and traditions thing seems confusing and arbitrary, and in the end really seems like it was more created to drive the plot than to plausibly explain how an entire race works. It\'s possible that this is the reason that the spirit race appears to only actually be a handful of entities, though there is no explanation for why only those rumors and traditions were personified.They spend a TON of time in the time travel...arc, most of which feels wasted.  It\'s a significant number of the total episodes, just to start one rumor so that they can lean even further into this implausible idea that spirits can just be erased from existence if you tweak their rumor, or if they deviate from it at all.  Similarly, they can pop right back if you tweak it the other way, apparently.  Again, zero explanation for how this works on a societal level for an entire race of people, who should essentially be popping in and out of existence non-stop in a chaotic and utterly unsustainable maelstrom of endless creation and destruction, except...there are only 5 of them? (mother, tree, misa, 3 little flying spirits, that\'s it)The Gods make no sense.  Either there is no reasoning behind the Father God\'s desire to destroy the world, or it\'s incredibly poorly explained.  Also, where are the other gods?  The only other one is the God of Destruction, which is apparently a sword...except it\'s also a castle?  And it doesn\'t switch, it\'s apparently both at the same time?  And it can destroy anything even reality...except when it can\'t, with no explanation?  Also, Anos could have claimed it at almost any time he just...lets Avos have it anyway?  I guess it\'s fine, because despite being all powerful, it\'s actually meaningless?  Also, can the Father god please make up his mind?  He\'s trying to destroy the world, while complaining that Anos is going to destroy the world because he stopped the father god from destroying the world?When Anos\' minions turn against him it was because...why?  I guess it was just time for it to happen?  A few people resisted, because of their belief/faith in Anos, except...his most powerful and closest lieutenants didn\'t?  It\'s either not explained, or poorly explained.Also, don\'t they have an army of killer clone girls?  Why didn\'t they use them?  Whatever.No explanation also seems to accurately describe all the various powers and power levels in the show.  There was some mention of the fake demon king having some kind of innate power, but it was immediately forgotten.  Other than that, powers appear to just be floating circles that either work or don\'t based on...something.  I mean, yeah, we know Anos is going to win, but the battles meant absolutely nothing, because none of the attacks meant anything.  It was just random color that accompanied the small amount of conversation.  Shin has a bunch of swords, but I defy you to tell me what their significance is, since they all seem to do/not do the same thing, which is nothing, most of the time.  There\'s a whole lot of mind control, with little explanation for how it works or why it stops or why a few people are immune to it despite not being near Anos, or why he can\'t break it, until he can, etc.Season two pretty much turned into 12 episodes of ""this happens because it\'s time for it to happen and none of it needs to make any sense or be explained.""  I can\'t really explain it properly, but Anos went from ""not worried about what other people did/thought because he was so incredibly powerful that nothing mattered"" in Season 1 to ""wandering aimlessly and not really doing anything, or doing random things for no real reason"" in Season 2.  Obviously he\'s never in any danger, and he can win at pretty much any time, but there is very little explanation for why he wanders around doing various things this season instead of just fixing the problems, which he obviously can do (and DOES, at the last minute).  While it is hard to really explain the difference, it FEELS different.  Season two just didn\'t have whatever season one had.Disappointing.  Though it\'s kind of appropriate that they spend the last few minutes of the season with the characters literally telling each other that they don\'t understand what happened and can\'t remember how they got there.  Yeah...me neither. arc, most of which feels wasted.

There\'s a whole lot of mind control, with little explanation for how it works or why it stops or why a few people are immune to it despite not being near Anos, or why he can\'t break it, until he can, etc.Season two pretty much turned into 12 episodes of ""this happens because it\'s time for it to happen and none of it needs to make any sense or be explained.""  I can\'t really explain it properly, but Anos went from ""not worried about what other people did/thought because he was so incredibly powerful that nothing mattered"" in Season 1 to ""wandering aimlessly and not really doing anything, or doing random things for no real reason"" in Season 2.  Obviously he\'s never in any danger, and he can win at pretty much any time, but there is very little explanation for why he wanders around doing various things this season instead of just fixing the problems, which he obviously can do (and DOES, at the last minute).  While it is hard to really explain the difference, it FEELS different.  Season two just didn\'t have whatever season one had.Disappointing.  Though it\'s kind of appropriate that they spend the last few minutes of the season with the characters literally telling each other that they don\'t understand what happened and can\'t remember how they got there.  Yeah...me neither.', 'I dont know i just said it pure my opinion and how i feel about the show. First, Character is like jojo for some kind reason, they copy all jojo like character with big muscle and talk with very loud noise is kinda annoying for me, character also feel like so generic, nothing stand out especially new character introduce in S2, character in S2 just there to make plot move, nothing really invest right here, also dont forget that main cast of this anime feel like noone, they are just appear there, talk a single word then move on to mc, thats all. Second because...character S2 kinda generic, also plot kinda generic, plot is mess up everywhere, leftover without answer (i watch till episode 4, this is how i feel, probably the answer later episode but i just point out whats wrong here, so dont judge me). Third, this is season 2, it should be at least 1 or 2 episode aftermath, something like  that, but nah, they just immediately jump to conflict again which confuse me really hard, first episode, its FLASHBACK, who begin first episode of anime with half of flashback, second episode, its back to school then suddenly getting attack by group, i mean why the hell they do that, No Conclusion or just calm before storm thing, they just jump to conflict in very early episode.Conclusion, its hard to watch for me, feel overwhelming with everything, it should at least calm before storm thing first then u can jump to conflict again, and then didnt like how S2 character feel like jojo character in other way.Again, its my opinion, i will continue watch and see what happened, i put it Mixed Feeling, reason? i like this anime but i dont like how s2 run so far character S2 kinda generic, also plot kinda generic, plot is mess up everywhere, leftover without answer (i watch till episode 4, this is how i feel, probably the answer later episode but i just point out whats wrong here, so dont judge me).

A concoction so horrendous and repugnant that it defies comprehension. It is with great reluctance and a heavy heart that I must describe to you the most abysmal, the most contemptible, the most sickening piece of fiction that has ever had the audacity to rear its ugly head. This wretched story is not just a slap in the face of the medium, but an outright declaration of war on the very concept of art itself.This so-called ""story"" is an appalling and ghastly abomination that no human should ever be subjected...to. It is a catastrophe on a scale that even the most masochistic of individuals would find unbearable. The plot, if one could even call it that, is a labyrinthine mess of incoherence and absurdity. It\'s as if the creators gleefully threw logic and reason out the window, opting instead to cobble together a Frankenstein\'s monster of nonsensical ideas and disjointed narrative arcs.The characters that inhabit this hellish landscape are an insult to the very notion of character development, with personalities so shallow and insipid that they make cardboard cutouts look like Shakespearean masterpieces. Their motivations are so unclear and convoluted that they appear to be the product of some meth-fueled fever dream, where coherence was sacrificed on the altar of mindless debauchery. One could liken these characters to the malformed spawn of a malfunctioning AI, riddled with errors and glitches, yet somehow even less appealing.Visuals and animation are no saving grace either, as this monstrous anime assaults the viewer\'s eyes with an aesthetic that could only be described as a steaming pile of excrement.The soundtrack, a cacophony of dissonant noises and grating melodies, is akin to having one\'s eardrums mercilessly pummeled by a horde of infuriated, tone-deaf banshees. This auditory assault reaches such a level of annoyance that it makes nails on a chalkboard sound like a soothing lullaby.This vile excuse for entertainment is the only anime I have ever given a genuine 1/10. This isn\'t just a real stinker; it\'s a crime against humanity, an affront to all that is good and decent in the world. It is the antithesis of creativity and imagination, a veritable black hole that devours joy and leaves behind only a bitter taste of despair.It is my sincerest hope that this abhorrent creation will be consigned to the deepest, darkest depths of obscurity, never to be spoken of again. To even utter its name is to risk unleashing untold horrors upon the unsuspecting masses, and we as a society cannot afford to gamble with such a potent force of pure, unadulterated evil.In conclusion, I implore you, dear reader, to avoid this ghastly monstrosity at all costs. It is a malignant tumor on the face of artistic expression, a hideous blight that threatens to consume all that is good and noble in the world of storytelling.

Characters are non-existent. Story makes zero sense. This is main hero D riding distilled to its pure form. There is absolutely no reason to watch this. If you do, then you'll forget about this waste of human labor in a month at most.The first season had some actually funny moments at the start, considering how ridiculous it was in handling literally everything, to the point that it made me think it's a parody.

The 'cheerleading squad' is left behind so we get a tighter focus on the characters, and many of the still expansive cast of characters that do still follow along for the ride don't get much screen time anyway so that it focuses on the main story, the new characters, and still having the small core group members to tie it all together.As for the series itself, it started strong, you normally expect events to build up, but this just threw out that convention and announced its arrival. after that, it did start to go off the rails when they went to the land of the spirits, for me this felt like the weakest part of the series.After that we got to the time travel part, and I seem to be in the minority in that I liked this part of the series, in fact I would go as far as saying that for me, this was the strongest part of the series.This is where it actually focused on the story, on unravelling it's 'mystery' which some of it you could see through anyway, but... The focus here was tighter as it got away from a lot of the background noise and the excessive cast roster, instead for a good portion of it we focused just on the two main characters.It's easy to see why a lot of people don't like this part however as Anos tends to take a backseat and isn't the main focus, and also as a result of that, we don't see him be OP and Deus Ex his way out of every situation with a condescending wisecrack.But for me, this section was worth it because it allows you to have that 'pay off' at the end.And then we get to the end, and I won't spoil it, but I can understand why some people got confused with some of the things that happened, the different terms and concepts that this series brought in or expanded on, but it probably helped that I binge watched this series across two days, otherwise I might have forgotten a lot of the jargon and otherwise seemingly meaningless details if I had watched it over a period of weeks.In short, this in my opinion is better than season 1 as it was able to stand out more from the crowd, but it still has its flaws, and I don't think anyone would consider it a masterpiece.If you liked Season 1, you should like this, although judging by some of the reviews, I wouldn't take that for granted.

Season 2 aside of voice actor swap was really good it was a season dedicated to show Anos right hand man's tragic story and how Anos casually destroyed gods in mythical age as well as who is the fake demon lord Avosand it's goals.

The first season had me entertained throughout the entire watch. Everything seemed to hit. Comedy, although it gave off edge lord vibes, hit most of the time. The characters were funny and somewhat interesting. Even the animation wasn't terrible. And that's why I gave it a rating of 8/10. Now if we look at this season, a downgrade can be seen. Animation doesn't seem to be of similar quality, the characters are oh so slightly worse, the plot doesn't hit the same......BUT I still love it. It's one of those shows that, for the most part, doesn't seem to take itself seriously until an important moment arrives. That's what I also appreciated in season one. Because it is open for jokes it doesn't end up cringey like arifureta, even tho they are similar. All in all, I would recommend it to fans of the series. If you've been waiting for this release like me,  I can only tell you to go on and enjoy the show. BUT I still love it.

Expectations were betrayed, and it's filled with some random crap. It could have been better if the author maintained the flow of the first season. When the first episode came out, I was super hyped, but as I progressed, it became bad. The last four episodes were too cramped. The only good thing was the animation quality. The usage of power by Avos delhevia was very disappointing. Also hero canons actions were a disappointment as well.

Similiar to how in OPM, the bit is ""saitama can literally kill gods, but is unable...to get around mundane inconveniences"", its so repetitive and overdone, it ceases to be a bit, and becomes the theme.

I imagine we will see more of this kind of delays down the line, because there\'s more and more new anime released each season, but there\'s only so many slots on the TV. A lot of people, for some reason, are very offended by shows being delayed, and are lowering the scores of such anime, which is something I cannot comprehend myself. How does a delay make a show better or worse?Let\'s get back to The Misfit of Demon King Academy II though. This is a solid continuation of the first season,...it mainly keeps the same pace in telling the story. Which is alright, however the pace was a bit faster than I would consider ideal even in the first season. As such, it\'s very easy to lose track of what\'s happening. One episode you\'re watching a revolt happening in the Academy, and a couple of episodes later the MC and his squad are taking a magic exam under the supervision of a talking tree. When the 7th episode aired after half a year of waiting, I found myself being lost, honestly. I didn\'t have solid memories of what happened in the past 6 episodes, only a vague image of it. Sticking to the ""If you forgot, then it wasn\'t important"" rule, usually I just proceed to finish the show and don\'t think much of it, because the show had 10+ episodes (usually) to catch my attention, and if it hadn\'t done so, the show is just not for me. But this wasn\'t the usual case with The Misfit of Demon King Academy. It was one of the very rare times, where I took my time to watch through the previous episodes once more, and I don\'t regret it a smallest bit. If anything, it made me like this show a bit more than before.The story is pretty straightforward, just like in the first season. No fillers, no arcs, just one main storyline, which can\'t be taken for granted nowadays even for single-season 12 episode shows. There\'s nothing too complicated about it, although it\'s not as linear as most storylines are. In this season we get to peek at the events of the past, much like we did in the beginning of the first episode, but a little more broadly, as MC spends several episodes time-traveling to the past to uncover the events that happened between his reincarnations.The art is pretty good, although there are some moments where the animation is subpar. But overall, there is anime with much worse animation. The key frames are well done, so it doesn\'t look like a low budget product.One more thing that I\'ve seen many people rant about is a different VA of Anos Voldigoad. And if those people liked the voice if the pervious VA more than the one from this season, it is somewhat justified. However, I believe that this is a change for the better, as Suzuki Tatsuhisa (VA from season 1) sounds cocky and less serious to me, while Umehara Yuuichirou\'s (VA from season 2) lower voice and slower speech seem to fit the Demon King better.I couldn\'t decide if I want to give this show a 7 or an 8. Ideally, I would give it something like 7.7/10, but we only have integer scores on MAL and 7 feels a bit lower than this season deserves, so I decided on an 8. It\'s a pleasant watch, pleasant voice actors, and they added a goth version of Misa.

The first half was pretty subpar in terms of pacing and story, but episodes 7-12 were a massive improvement and probably the best the series has been. The time travel arc had several emotional story beats that just really worked well. The pacing and action were really good, and the character development that side characters like Shin and Reno got was impressive.I’m not sure how...much of the first half’s issues were just weak writing or how much was based on production issues, but it is a bit of a slog to get through the first half. I’d say it’s very much worth it for the story we get in the second half of the season, though. Just keep that in mind as you’re watching that it is indeed building up to a satisfying payoff.The big antagonist in this season is pretty OP and even poses issues for Anos. The issue with series like this is that oftentimes it’s difficult to create a compelling villain because the MC is so damn strong himself. To address that in Maou Gakuin, they created an antagonist who could really target a few of Anos’ weaknesses. Instead of just a straight up test of strength, it’s a test of wits and personal relationships. This serves as the driving force behind the growth of several characters in the season.The big elephant in the room with this season of Maou Gakuin is the change in seiyuu for Anos. It is very noticeable. No, I never fully got used to it, but after a certain point it stopped impacting my enjoyment. His original seiyuu just brought a unique charm and swagger to the character that I don’t think this one has. That’s not a put down on Umehara-san. I just primarily associate him with other types of characters.So then, is Maou Gakuin II worth checking out? Well for me, yes. Even with a sluggish first half, the payoff that episodes 9-11 have is worth sitting thru a couple hours of mid in my opinion. Hell, you might even enjoy the talking CGI tree meme. That said, because there is that sluggish start, I can’t rate it as highly as I’d like. Had the first half been as good as the second half we’d be talking about this in AOTY discussions, it was just very inconsistent and a tale of two halves.I am very much looking forward to the next cour of this and to finally reading the books. I hope the next season isn’t plagued by the same issues and can tell a consistently good story from start to finish.Maou Gakuin II gets 7, out of 10. much of the first half’s issues were just weak writing or how much was based on production issues, but it is a bit of a slog to get through the first half.

Yes, I have a cheap taste i know, but whatever. I\'m really looking forward to some more!I loves everything about this anime, now now, I know this anime isn\'t the perfect anime, but still. It\'s so fun to watch, and it feels like it\'s only 10 mins of watching, that\'s how fast the anime is going when...you watch it.Story: 9Now now, I\'m still kind of confused on the Story, maybe if I re-watch it again, maybe I\'ll understand it more! but so far all i know in S1 is... 2000 years ago Anos Voldigoad sacrificed His life to make a peaceful world like any other animes, and 2000 years later, He reincarnated and find himself on a peaceful world that He wanted. but until then, someone by the name of Jerga somehow still has a Grudge against the Demon Race, when Anos had managed to make a peaceful world. But now, this is a new story yet to come!Characters: 10Anos isn\'t that one of a hell cringe characters on some animes, in fact.

Misha on the other hand, is so freaking cute and kind, She was Anos first friend after 2000 years. and not to mention I kind of like Anos\'s old VA more than this one.

But now, this is a new story yet to come!Characters: 10Anos isn\'t that one of a hell cringe characters on some animes, in fact.

It’s the kind of show that survives on power fantasy as a way to both hook and maintain an audience, and I thought it worked pretty well S1. The humor was pretty solid, especially when it came to reactions to our lead character Anos Voldigoad. But the cracks were starting to show even then as the opponents ramped up and absurd abilities became increasingly more absurd. That’s kind of the point, but there’s only so far you can take it before it all starts to...run together.And that’s the note S2 starts on. Admittedly, it’s not a bad start, with some pretty solid mind games to push our characters in a different way before a series of “I knew you would do that so I had this planned from the beginning!” starts and just… doesn’t end. It becomes really monotonous. I wouldn’t mind so much if the answer to every issue was “Anos will solve it.” To some degree, it lets other characters fight their own battles, but even then it only feels like the end result is either going to be some BS table flip or Anos saving the day.That would only push this so low (I knew what I was getting into), but then they had to throw in a series of episodes that took place in the distant past and use them to… confuse the fuck out of everything in order to set up more table flips. It really did not help that this portion of the anime was interrupted while it was airing and continued only recently in this season without any recap, so I was lost immediately at the start of episode 7. The ending few episodes are just more of the same overpowered characters fighting ridiculous battles with a couple of visually striking scenes, but beyond that aspect, I can’t say I enjoyed this season. Doesn’t help that some CGI trees with faces make the damn Deku Tree from the N64 Ocarina of Time look good.There came a period in this season when I was sitting there wondering why the hell I was still watching, and that’s a bad sign. I was bored well before it ended. I’m sure if I rewatched these episodes back to back and really thought about all the absurdly long-term setups of the time travel portion (2000 years in the past), I would appreciate more of the ways in which they made this happen. But I don’t, and I won’t. Last time I remember being this frustrated with a sequel season of a series I previously enjoyed was Log Horizon S3, and while it’s not that bad (now THAT was a slog of a season), it’s not great that that’s the comparison that springs to mind.

It’s not great. That’s not to say it’s bad. It’s just not great. There’s nothing really new or interesting added, all the same conflicts and tropes from the first season get rehashed and reused, which wouldn’t even be that big of a deal if they were somehow still kept fun, à la Die Hard 2 or Taken 2, but what we get instead is something more along the lines of Speed 2 or...Zoolander 2. Ok, that’s perhaps a little harsh – ok, fine, extremely harsh – but you get my point. It’s more of the same, but worse, while lacking the novelty and mystique of the first. Think Obama’s 2nd presidential campaign and you’ll have the right idea.You get the impression at the end of S1 that the whole conceit of the show has been resolved, everyone now acknowledges Anos as the Demon King. Wrong! Not even 5 minutes into S2, his red-coated classmates are once again flaming him and treating him as if he were a random peasant, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, if for no other reason, then just in the interest of self-preservation. Even if we accept it as reasonable that they still don’t believe him to be the actual DK, they still can’t deny that he is nonetheless a being of transcendent power, i.e. not the kind of dude you gratuitously shit talk to his face. Alas, it is what it is. Much like The Rising of the Shield Hero doesn’t know what to do with its story unless Naofumi is perpetually oppressed, so can Misfit seemingly not exist unless Anos is treated as a perpetual misfit.Really, there’s no other way for me to say this. It’s just mostly the same. Defenders of the sequel are sure to claim that I’ve no idea what I’m talking about, that Misfit II has loads of new content! Loads! Sure enough, by the end of the first episode, you’ll have been introduced to some 12 new characters and 2 new realms of existence. Fantastic! Unfortunately, it’s the kind of novelty that’s akin to what the Terminator: Dark Fate director was boasting about. Oh, yes, it’s all new and different. Instead of a male robot with human skin protecting the savior of mankind, it’s a female human with robot skin protecting the savior of mankind. Ingenious! Instead of a white male leader of the human resistance, it’s a brown female leader of the human resistance. Inventive! Instead of a female evil Terminator with a metal endoskeleton and liquid metal skin that can shapeshift, it’s a male evil Terminator with a metal endoskeleton and liquid metal skin that can shapeshift. Resourceful! Instead of a rogue AI that gains self-awareness and turns against humanity causing a mass-extinction event called Skynet, it’s a rogue AI that gains self-awareness and turns against humanity causing a mass-extinction event called Legion. Imaginative! Like I said, it’s all so very new and different.Much the same can be said about Misfit II. I saw a lot of people fret early on about the sheer number of new characters and concepts introduced in episode one. How can one keep up with all of this new information? The truth is that you simply don’t have to. You get a lot of new faces, yes, but they’re literally just reskins of the same dudes with the same conflicts and same talking points. None of them, bar one, make a difference to the plot.Then again, in other regards, Misfit II doesn’t even try to pretend that anything has changed. The 7 Elder Demon Emperors get brainwashed into opposing Anos… again for some harebrained reason, but they’re unsurprisingly completely irrelevant and easily defeated… again.You get some pay-off with characters like Revest, Historia, and the military commander dude from S1 now recognizing Anos for who he is, but it’s underwhelming.Perhaps the one element that caused the single most amount of wariness among the fans turned out to be the most adequate. Just in case you’re not in the know, Tatsuhisa Suzuki, the voice actor of Anos from S1 was in a relationship with LiSA. You might know her as the singer of the first SAO opening. Why am I telling you this? Because he cheated on her, the whole thing morphed into a very public scandal, and as a result, he has, to a significant degree, withdrawn from public life. I don’t know if he has retired from voice acting altogether, but he has at the very least not returned to the second season of Misfit to voice the protagonist. In his stead, SILVER LINK. has chosen Yuuichirou Umehara to replace him. You might know him as the voice of Goblin Slayer, Portugal from Hetalia, Seiya from Cautious Hero, Siegfried from the Legend of the Galactic Heroes remake, and Gorou, the omegacuck from Darling in the FranXX. He does a perfectly fine job as Anos, and had I not known of the change, chances are I wouldn’t have noticed it unless I binged the two seasons back to back. Think of it like the difference between Coke and Pepsi, and if you’re one of those people who’ll sit there and argue that there is a meaningful difference between the two, then your opinion objectively does not matter.To make a long story short, if you enjoyed season 1, are invested in the characters, and are curious to see what else can be done with the story, by all means, watch it. You’ll have a decent enough time. I know I did. But if you thought S1 was just alright, then you can safely skip this – no point. Zoolander 2.

Anos remains the driving force of engagement I have in this series, so I guess I'll see if the anime gets better."", ""The way I assess materials of anime or manga remain at my foundational explanation and input on my profile which is too long to include everytime.I believe the person who enjoys having an MC being overpowered, enjoys forms of unity, has a feeling for fantasy and for this particular season enjoys romance should consider giving this anime a go.It is not often that I listen to the OP or ED of an anime and instantly click and react to it personally. Given context that the last one was probably Chainsaw man's OP alongside Oshi No Ko OP ect...Regardless also in terms of...ED it is sometimes much trickier ( Music is not there just for the sake of it, it is there to complement the anime whether foreshadowing or in-transition.)This ED hits extremely hard and already brings an incredible sense of nostalgia and melancholy even after episode 2 without much information we foreshadow a very romantic plot/arc.The plot isn't too stressful as a main bigger picture, but we are focusing on another arc which later connects to the timeline of the MC in current time.If you enjoy watching anime and ignore the minor details then you should watch this one accordingly to what has been said above.Spoilers Alert Again.In terms of harsher criticism, I do not advocate comparison towards standards especially in the previous season.That said, I do believe that there is this strange gap of transition between Shin (MC Arc) and Anos (MC) where there can be better depth in the chronology towards each other.I find it controversial in my understandings where we advocate this idea of the overpowered MC but in this regard we never reach an actual obstacle or issue in fact there is an underlying feeling that things will always be resolved. Some Side Character gets bad wounds and they can be healed or yet alone revived. By bringing about the concept of revival this creates an external paradox in the potential of the plot's climatical moment. To me the climatical moment is actually the event and arc of Shin's interactions with Leno. In fact if I were to capture the time capsule of this event alone it was very moving scene and is why I rate this anime as it is. The irony is through the contrast of No obstacle to then an obstacle indirectly rises a sensation very strong and emotional.In terms of anime I do not think and expect an anime to deliver every sense of the way as that is most unlikely to happen especially given the particularities of a genre. With romance you only get one chance to uphold a climatical moment after which repetition cannot happen instantaneous yet alone in exact replication. The second chance in retrospect requires plot advancement, reason, setting, another build up... in this regard the script would become complicated but should be credited if tried.In terms of the follow through I would think there are multiple ways to end something and what the anime chose to end was with a positive happy ending. It is possible that certain real life circumstances pushed out the better judgement of the more impactful ending. In choice however, this ending suits well for the child watching it on the tv. However if the anime decided to keep Leno dead even if she was able to say her final good bye I would think this much more impactful but this then obstructs the envisioned idea of the MC being absoloute omnipotent. Believe it or not by the way the construction of the anime has gone even in the previous season we have now built a paradox of how can we end it even if we chose such a path. So in this regard I am still pleased and accept the ending that was given however this paradox will continue to be a thorn as that is the personality of the MC and is near inevitable to avoid. ED it is sometimes much trickier ( Music is not there just for the sake of it, it is there to complement the anime whether foreshadowing or in-transition.)This ED hits extremely hard and already brings an incredible sense of nostalgia and melancholy even after episode 2 without much information we foreshadow a very romantic plot/arc.The plot isn't too stressful as a main bigger picture, but we are focusing on another arc which later connects to the timeline of the MC in current time.If you enjoy watching anime and ignore the minor details then you should watch this one accordingly to what has been said above.Spoilers Alert Again.In terms of harsher criticism, I do not advocate comparison towards standards especially in the previous season.That said, I do believe that there is this strange gap of transition between Shin (MC Arc) and Anos (MC) where there can be better depth in the chronology towards each other.I find it controversial in my understandings where we advocate this idea of the overpowered MC but in this regard we never reach an actual obstacle or issue in fact there is an underlying feeling that things will always be resolved.

By bringing about the concept of revival this creates an external paradox in the potential of the plot's climatical moment. To me the climatical moment is actually the event and arc of Shin's interactions with Leno. In fact if I were to capture the time capsule of this event alone it was very moving scene and is why I rate this anime as it is. The irony is through the contrast of No obstacle to then an obstacle indirectly rises a sensation very strong and emotional.In terms of anime I do not think and expect an anime to deliver every sense of the way as that is most unlikely to happen especially given the particularities of a genre. With romance you only get one chance to uphold a climatical moment after which repetition cannot happen instantaneous yet alone in exact replication. The second chance in retrospect requires plot advancement, reason, setting, another build up... in this regard the script would become complicated but should be credited if tried.In terms of the follow through I would think there are multiple ways to end something and what the anime chose to end was with a positive happy ending. It is possible that certain real life circumstances pushed out the better judgement of the more impactful ending. In choice however, this ending suits well for the child watching it on the tv. However if the anime decided to keep Leno dead even if she was able to say her final good bye I would think this much more impactful but this then obstructs the envisioned idea of the MC being absoloute omnipotent. Believe it or not by the way the construction of the anime has gone even in the previous season we have now built a paradox of how can we end it even if we chose such a path. So in this regard I am still pleased and accept the ending that was given however this paradox will continue to be a thorn as that is the personality of the MC and is near inevitable to avoid."", ""I seriously cannot recommend this anime. It fails in story-telling.The anime certainly does fine in the art department and combat. But, the biggest problem is the extreme fast-paced approach in storytelling throughout the two seasons, especially the second.If you have not read the light novel, you cannot follow the story line. Perhaps you can do well in this respect in the first season, but in the second season, this is not possible.The second season drops in multiple characters on the get-go as if the viewers know and understand them. There's no introduction, most do not have a backstory given. The story progresses so fast that...you just don't know what is going on. You would have to rewind many times, interrupting the viewing flow, just to understand or try to.I do think the story is intriguing, but it's unfolded like papyri fragments.

I couldn't tell the difference and I genuinely enjoyed the complete and utter “Did you really think stopping time is enough to stop me?” nonsense of Anos Voldigoad.Unfortunately, season 2 answered my question and the answer is mediocre light novel bollocks that the viewer must take very seriously because this is now...a serious story for serious people. The charm of the first season has been replaced with po-faced melodrama and a mystery plot involving a mysterious hooded character and a mysterious armed knight made so obvious I could feel my intelligence being insulted in real-time. Okay, real-time is a strong term of phrase considering it took over a year for studio Silver Link to deliver a twelve-episode season due to covid circumstances.I’m not entirely against the idea of fleshing out the world and exploring the origins of the false demon king, Avos Delhevia. I’d argue that was one of the first season's biggest strengths. Someone had messed with time over the two-thousand-year period it took for Anos to reincarnate himself and we were naturally introduced to world-building elements during the time Anos was beating dudes up with just his heartbeat. Exposition dumps were made interesting in the first season because it was usually Anos delivering it whilst correcting someone, usually a pure-blood demon supremacist, who just assumed something about the world or the magic system.However, a good portion of season two is dedicated to flashbacks between a great fairy spirit and your average shut-in Redditer and the exposition being dumped over the viewer delivered by the generic “God” villain. Anos is barely involved and when he is, instead of picking up a castle with one hand, spinning it on his finger and then lobbing it across a field just to prove a point, he's sitting and taking a test given by an ugly CGI Deku tree.Now I will admit, the spirit's power system and how not only their powers but their existences are governed by the lore that is written and shared about them is unique and interesting. I also liked how the story explores the system whether that be writing new lore to create or fix spirits and the complications that come with creating a hybrid. But none of that involves Anos punching the metaphorical symbol of racism in the face whilst his backing choir sings about how great he is, does it? And there's a lot of racism again this season which Anos spends most of his time hiding from.That's the difference between something like One-Punch Man and The Misfit of Demon King Academy. If your main character who can win a fight or solve a problem by flicking his finger isn’t in the spotlight, you need to have a supporting cast who can carry the story and unlike One-Punch Man, Misfit doesn’t have that. Honestly, I don’t even know what his circle of waifus were even here for this season. The harem could’ve been cut down by two or three people and nothing would change.I think I knew deep down The Misfit of Demon King Academy was another mediocre light novel fantasy series in reality, but chose to believe that it was actually satire due to how fun it was to watch Anos beat the snot out of racist demons or humans with all the bravado of chunibyo light novel protagonist.

Okay, I lied- I\'m mad AND disappointed.Season 1 is one of my all time guilty pleasure favorite animes. I gave it 10/10 because I\'m a degenerate who loves OP MC, pretty girls, magical worlds, and baddies getting their just dessert. It was simple. It was effective. It was unique. And it was legendary.And now...now we have THIS.Season 2 of The Misfit Demon King Academy. I usually don\'t write spoiler reviews, but fuck it- this season is so trash that no one is gonna watch it anyways.The shows starts off by throwing a bunch of names of grunts from the new...bad guys. And they\'re invading, because who the hell knows. There\'s like, 4 battles going on, but it\'s nothing like the first season. It\'s really poorly animated. And of course- absolutley no story is given on these guys, so no one gives a shit about the battles. Anyways, the good guys win by some unexplained magical reasons. Then they\'re go to Spirit Land. There might be a new Son of God (I think that\'s what they call it). So they go to Spirit Land...WHO KNOWS WHY. They want to meet the Spirit King, so they go through some of the dumbest fucking trials I\'ve ever seen in my entire life. And some shit that makes no sense happens- and it turns out MISA IS AVOS! And she was born from the legend that Kanon spread after Anos died (this part is actually really cool- if they could just focuse on this from the start). And now Avos commands all royals to kill everyone non-Royal, so Team Anos has to stop Avos. So they travel back in time- why? I don\'t know...Yeah...that\'s the plot through season 6. It\'s such a half-ass convoluted plot that makes no goddamn sense. Actually, I did some research, and it turns out they tried to fit in like 10 story lines (from the novel) into these 6 episode so far. Which makes sense, cause they reeeeeeeaaaallyyyy don\'t explain a lot of things. A lot of episodes are basically just giving you information. Anos will say ""Hey we need to go here cause X is here and we need to do Y"" and someone will say ""Why is Y important"" then Anos will say ""Cause aslekaosriues I don\'t know but just do it"" and then they do it.Listen....don\'t do this. These are the worst type of shows. Take your time. And you know what? If you want to get to the juicy main plot of the series- that\'s fine too. You can skip and cut out parts and re-arrange them so that it fits the entire arc better. Do not throw in tidbits of information that makes no sense just cause the main source had it.Okay- so the plot and pacing sucks balls. How\'s the action? What action??? There\'s like, 3 action scenes and they\'re all terrible. They\'re not even funny like season 1. Okay, VA and music? VA is find. Anos has a new VA, but I can accept it. The rest is fine.How about the characters? Any development? LOL.All in all, I cannot believe that the same studio is animating this season. It\'s beyond my belief. Complete opposite direction of season 1. All that said, I know I\'m being harsh, but I also do want to apologize for some of my words because I heard the studio is going through a tough time due to COVID. Honeslty though- I rather they just not release the series if it\'s gonna be like this.Anyways, it stops at episode 6, and episode 7 is set to resume in July. Because I love season 1 so much, I might continue just to see how the story turns out, but most likely not when I can just read up with, recaps and it would do the same.You\'ve been warned.

Extending the show and novel/manga was a money grab so far up in the ass that everyone that expects this to be good will be disappointed because it will be a shit show just like boruto.""]"

ReLIFE: Kanketsu-hen Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37921/ReLIFE__Kanketsu-hen_Specials,"['This is a short, 4 minutes long special for Re Life anime that contains 2 stories.The first story centers around a hidden camera. The main Re Life employee duo is spying on Kaizaki\'s daily life as a high school boy. This one is pretty funny because Kaizaki is really acting his ""supposed"" age in it. There is also bunch of birds that confirm the video feed is live in a rather comical manner. Overall it\'s pretty fresh.The second one centers around a face cam/video phone call where Arata has a chat with Ooga who is hanging out with Kariu and awkwardly asking advice regarding...what he is supposed to do on a date. Kariu spots his lame phone call, the screen turns black and we get some hilarious couple interactions going on in the background in the form of dialogue. Hella cute.This entire thing is executed with smart phones and smart phone screens. There is literally just 2 phones on the screen the entire time, the first story plays from the other and second from another like they are vertical videos. Creativity and low budget I guess, but it end up being quite memorable.I quite enjoyed watching this because it was a warm, wholesome experience and I like the characters and the original manga.

Obviously not much can be done in 4 minutes, but it does relate well enough to the main cast, and gives us a look into Ryo and An’s point of view, which I really liked.Art - 10I’ve always loved the art style, it’s the exact...same as in the original anime. It is quite small to watch since each special is presented on half the screen, but this isn’t an issue.Sound - 10I liked the cute little sound before each special began! That was pretty much the only use of sound.Characters - 9Wish we could have seen Chizuru!! But I love the other characters! You see pretty much everyone else, so it is still worth watching.Enjoyment - 9Wish it could have been a little longer. The “story” for each short was still complete, but I just wanted more content with these characters haha.Overall - 9Short, sweet and cute!Exactly what I want from a special.

"Ququ Bucai, Zaixia Yeguai",https://myanimelist.net/anime/54772/Ququ_Bucai_Zaixia_Yeguai,"['First off let me start by saying I like the isekai genre very much, a bit too much perhaps, so take this review with a grain of salt.So it\'s the typical MC transports to the VRMMORPG he plays a bit too much. Where this is different from a lot of other isekai who follow the same general plot are two small points, the obvious gimmick ""he\'s now the weakest monster in the game"", and one I found to be a bit more intereresting: He\'s the only one with this problem, the world he\'s in is still the same old game he\'s familiair with and still...has the MMO players doing their own things, and he\'s able to interact with them for that reason.The animation is not 2d, but 3d but honestelly it doesn\'t look too bad, although it can be a bit offputing to somebody who expects something more traditional. The characters are likeable enough and I did enjoy watching the episodes. Although this show establishes an overarchicing story with some long term objectives and episode 1 and 2 don\'t have this problem, at times it suffers from what I can only describe is a failure to establish an interesting enough cliffhanger that makes you want to watch more, with the endings of episodes 3 and 4 repectively feeling like halfway through was could have been a decent joke and ending the episode the first paragraph into a new chapter.tl;dr: The show has it\'s issues but it\'s still an isekai and if you\'re isekai trash like me it you will probably like it, but I wouldn\'t recomend this to anyone outside of hardcore isekai fans. I don\'t dislike it so I feel like I can\'t wholeheartedly give it a failing grade, but it can feel stale at times so I can\'t give it a good one eighter. has the MMO players doing their own things, and he\'s able to interact with them for that reason.The animation is not 2d, but 3d but honestelly it doesn\'t look too bad, although it can be a bit offputing to somebody who expects something more traditional.

I\'ve seen the formulae a thousand times, so that being said.This one is fun. It\'s a pretty standard Video Game incident. MC is trying to figure out what happened, but thats like an after thought to the \'holy crap I\'m in my favorite video game for real"" theme. Which, is fun.  It takes different things seriously through the relationships of the characters as well as a few standard troupe responses/situations.So, I say watch it for the ""Ha!.....what a jack-ass/genius."" moments to the usual scenarios. They\'re worth it. what a jack-ass/genius."" moments to the usual scenarios. They\'re worth it.', ""This was a fairly entertaining take on the isekai genre. The characters were simple, but they managed to be pretty entertaining. The MC in particular could be quite clever at times, using his knowledge of how the video game world works to trick the other players. The story was fun for the most part, although the section where they hunted down marten pelts for a few episodes around the middle of the season was kind of boring. (Minor Spoiler) I would have preferred if they kept the MC as a skeleton monster the whole time. Giving him a powerful human form after the first few...episodes made the story a bit less fun and unique, plus it kind of defeats the purpose of him being reborn as the weakest monster, which was the initial premise of the show.Some viewers may not like the CGI visuals, but I think it was pretty well done. The visuals didn't bother me at all, and it worked quite well for some of the character designs. I also liked the music in the ED, it had a nice beat that synced well with the visuals. episodes made the story a bit less fun and unique, plus it kind of defeats the purpose of him being reborn as the weakest monster, which was the initial premise of the show.Some viewers may not like the CGI visuals, but I think it was pretty well done.

With the strategies and memories of his experience intact, he quickly evolves and musters up allies to help him find a way back to reality. Dongdong meets a clumsy and airhead player Paopao (Bubble) and they embark on the journey in the fantasy RPG world.Story & Character: 5/10 & 6/10The series started off strong with an attractive proposition: Main character is stuck in the game world as a mob and tries any method to getting stronger and allying...himself with other mobs. It has potential to develop the game world and introduce new characters this way which it does well but after that the story becomes very predictable in terms of its major arcs and characters. Instead of exploring the world, the characters get sucked up in the same boring academy entrance exam/tournament and try to stand out among competitors which easily takes up 80% of the series. Only when the story begins to finally get address interesting plot events regarding Dongdong’s situation and others with similar experiences does the season end. It felt very lacklustre in terms of its story, but I feel it was the easiest way to introduce many characters in such a short duration especially with the sheer contrast they have in terms of traits/personalities.Characters were better polished in Monster But Wild with a lot of characters having ulterior motives of unpredictable actions like Sein or Gu Ling of the two major factions in Azure Sky. There were some throw-away characters like the white knight who is used for comic effect but having his appearance in the show at different stages also feels like he’s developing as a character especially after every encounter he sees Paopao. The skeleton army could have a more active role in the series instead of spectating or side characters because they are a menace together with Dongdong. There were a lot of characters introduced this season but many of them still remain somewhat mysterious like Ye Wu, Luyue and even Quyiu; They all have knowledge that Dongdong seeks but nobody answers him explicitly it’s always riddles or hints - one of the worst ways to create suspense in my opinion.Art & Sound: 6/10The art is reminiscent of Genshin Impact especially character designs, it’s not necessarily a bad thing considering its quality. The animation does feel choppy by modern standards but it’s a trade-off for using 2.5D in comparison to CGI or 2D. I enjoyed the typographic animations; they really made the scenes pop but I noticed it less as the series progressed. The awkward character faces and expressions made for good comic effect; Paopao somehow had the most expressive character. Overall, the visuals were palatable enough to watch and not be a hindrance.Sound is alright, there weren’t any memorable soundtracks, but the character lines threw me off a lot while watching. So many pieces of dialogue I wasn’t expecting in this series added to the comic effect as well as the sound effects.Overall & Enjoyment: 6/10I enjoyed Dongdong’s character, he was witty and calculative making sure he never lost in a bet which added to the unpredictability of the smaller scale plot points. I didn’t like the entrance exam arc since it felt like a waste of time with no concrete development beyond the new characters. In the end of the arc the important story development were given which made it feel like a waste of time. Overall, it was an enjoyable watch but I hope they stick to the same style of comedy as they did in the beginning. himself with other mobs.

That aspect is great, how he has these funny underlings and they work together to level up, teamwork and screw some noobies over. Then as he levels up and has his job promotion, he is able to completely turn into a human.It then becomes a more generic fantasy (chinese) RPG. I don't like how they just decided to kinda dump this anime's entire appeal and premise (for me) for something else. Sure, he can turn back, but he does not do very often. It would have more potential...if it just sticked to the premise.The animation is perfect for that too, I've heard it is like Genshin Impact, and from what I've seen, it is true. But yea it is a chinese dub and honestly if you decide to not give it a change just because of that then I'd say you are and will miss out on some great chinese anime. It may take like 2-3 episodes to get used to it for most but I did not mind it at all and got used to it after 1. Only a 6 because it did not stick to its premise. Some may enjoy it, but for me, I'll just stick to recap-kun for this one. if it just sticked to the premise.The animation is perfect for that too, I've heard it is like Genshin Impact, and from what I've seen, it is true.

Although Monster But Wild has a fairly basic story, in regards to its writing, comedy, and art style this show takes itself very seriously. Monster But Wild is an inherently an unserious show which can be binged in a day or two. It's a fairly quick watch which I found to be incredibly enjoyable, the main characters are pretty likeable unlike certain other isekais, (looking at you SAO) and has pretty good animation and scenery dispite its 3d art style. Monster But Wild is an enjoyable watch for anyone looking for something quick. ""]"
Prince of Stride: Alternative,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31559/Prince_of_Stride__Alternative,"['There\'s no real explanation to it, so let\'s just assume that ""alternative"" in the title of Prince of Stride implies that you should watch an alternative show.So, anyone willing to tolerate sports anime thought this would be pretty cool. Running with some parkour elements? Shit, parkour’s awesome, this oughta be good. But instead, we’ve been given a thoughtless, soulless, utterly boring show with no point in watching to completion unless you really, really like sports or writing yaoi fanfics.Fortunately, Stride conveniently makes all of its fuck-ups clear within the first episode, so this doesn’t require a lot of work. Every major character (with the exception...of a couple that won’t be introduced until later because reasons) gets introduced within the first ten minutes. It’s too much too quickly, like going to your parents’ favorite hangout and having to suffer through all the introductions to their stupid friends who only talk to you to ask about how school is going. But, don’t think about it too hard, look alive because the plot’s coming through!A school with a famous stride club (whatever that is) is now close to disbanding because they don’t have enough members for official matches because no one likes stride. Wait, what? I thought this was famous? Where did everyone go? That doesn’t matter now, because Riku (whose name I only remember thanks to my fifteen years of playing Kingdom Hearts) joins the club and fills the deficit, and now the almighty Honan Stride Club is ready to go. The whole school sets up a course for the club because they’re all so excited to see stride return that they didn’t even remember the club existed five minutes ago, because no sports anime would be accurate without a bunch of bandwagoners! Go Royals!Wait, aren’t we forgetting something…………? Oh yeah! WHAT THE FUCK IS STRIDE?Stride, the sport, is introduced to us after giving an incredibly vague explanation of just a few things about it. You know, it’s not really the audience’s job to put more thought into your own work. We’re expected to figure the rules of the sport out for ourselves because the authors were too lazy to do it themselves. But after a couple episodes, you can see that stride is just some relay racing with parkour with a coordinator from the sidelines, with some specific details that won’t be necessary. See how easy that was?But some questions still remain. Why do we need the gimmicks? What’s the point in the end? One guy did a run while completely skipping the obstacles and nothing really happened, he still had a great run. If they’re there just to make the runs look flashy, it’d be good if you could actually implement flair into the rules of the sport, even making it part of some score. It’d be even better if the parkour was naturally part of the course and not just some shit they threw in the middle of the road. People racing over rooftops and over fences would be pretty badass. They could at least put more shit in the road. But my point is that I’d like it if the parkour had a bigger focus and speed wouldn’t be the only thing necessary.Then you have the relationers, who coordinate the runners from the sidelines via headset. One team told their relationer to fuck off and one of the runners did all the work while the actual relationer was there as a formality. If the runners can control things themselves, what’s the point of the relationer in the first place? Shouldn’t this be illegal, at least? Why isn’t anyone even watching this race, like a referee? Does ANYONE care about what’s going on??? WHY AM I ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS?Ignoring the dumb sloppiness of the sport itself, we have the actual story. Yes, I care about a story in a sports anime, at least to an extent. It’s a sports anime so you can only expect so much, but as long as you write better than a 10-year-old then I can accept it. But when Stride tries to incorporate some human drama, it just gets idiotic.Prince of Stride being about some high school sporting event just won’t cut it, so we need some DEEP and COMPLICATED backgrounds or something. The reason why Honan’s stride club was low on members in the beginning is because of an incident that caused most of the team to quit. This incident is one of the most bafflingly brain-dead events ever conceived. To not spoil it specifically, the old relationer got rekt by the other team’s, and that caused the runners to crash and lose the race. The relationer and another member then act like complete fucking idiots and escalate the situation way beyond reason, and the knight in shining armor, the only person with a brain, the one who breaks it up, is then blamed for it without anyone trying to communicate like human beings. I am laughing so hard while writing these very words right now.The other sort of incident involves the main character not knowing how to get gud and then quitting stride for a while. That’s it, that’s his backstory.Having some human drama is nice, definitely. I’ll admit that at least the last few episodes had some sort of weight and tension, but all of this is just so stupid, man. But I could at least respect the nerdy guy, he had some actual problems and characterization that wasn’t dumb. Maybe as a token of my appreciation I’ll go look up his name on the database when I’m done.Beyond that small number of characters and their dumb stories, the rest of the cast is incredibly flat, boring, uninteresting, generic, and other synonyms, no matter how many memes they try to force. Their only chances of being likable come with how many of their stupid, annoying LOLSORANDOMXD jabs they throw at you. Nice try, Dr. Meme. Oh, whoops, that’s a SIGNATURE PHRASE!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111!!1/1?11/1Shoving away that nonsense, the characters include Leg-lover, who’s the only yaoi bait you’re gonna get, unless you got a kick out of that one guy who had to dress up like a girl. I felt like kicking myself in the nuts just for putting up with this. No one else has anything worth mentioning (except nerdy guy who eventually drops out of relevance anyway) except the girl because she’s a girl and she’s voiced by Hanakanamanahawamawallama, which really isn’t a compliment because she doesn’t have a personality either. The only thing she’s good at is being really worked up over what the other relationer is doing. DO YOUR JOB, IDIOT.The woman who directed No Game No Life was told she couldn’t make everything purple in this, so instead she used normal colors and brightened them up about a thousand times. Okay, it’s not unbearably bright, but it really isn’t pleasant to look at, even deep into the anime where you’re expected to be used to it by now. The animation itself isn’t that big of a deal, either. In fact, it’s pretty lackluster, especially given that Madhouse used the same budget as One Punch Man. Maybe they spent it all on memes to try and recreate the magic. I dunno. Anyway, doing cool parkour shit is okay. I guess. But the running is often poorly framed--I don’t give a shit about people moving their arms around really really quickly, you run with your L E G S. LEGS, MAN! Some clever angles would’ve made this pretty interesting to watch, but I guess no one cared as usual.Hey, remember Overlord? That one anime about Mr. Skeltal trying to take over the world? That opening song was incredible, right? Well, the same guys came back to do Stride’s, except not nearly as loud, exciting, cinematic, catchy, or even enjoyable. Which still makes it a decent song because Clattonia was just pure awesome, but the song doesn’t have a lot of punchiness or flair, and it’s marred by some pretty goofy lyrics. The art accompanying it has some style, at least, even if the runs presented look confusing. The rest of the soundtrack has a number of insert songs, which are pretty intelligible when used amongst the action, but I thought the non-inserts were surprisingly good. Not crazy good, but they have a smooth style and presence and are just exciting enough to make you keep your ear out for them without distracting you from what’s on screen. Not a bad ED either. I only listened to it like twice, though, because I wanted to move on as quickly as possible.The last thing I wanna talk about are the guys, because this show is supposed to be yaoi-bait and I need to make this clear. These fuckboys don’t even look that good.

Oh, whoops, that’s a SIGNATURE PHRASE!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111!!1/1?11/1Shoving away that nonsense, the characters include Leg-lover, who’s the only yaoi bait you’re gonna get, unless you got a kick out of that one guy who had to dress up like a girl. I felt like kicking myself in the nuts just for putting up with this. No one else has anything worth mentioning (except nerdy guy who eventually drops out of relevance anyway) except the girl because she’s a girl and she’s voiced by Hanakanamanahawamawallama, which really isn’t a compliment because she doesn’t have a personality either. The only thing she’s good at is being really worked up over what the other relationer is doing. DO YOUR JOB, IDIOT.The woman who directed No Game No Life was told she couldn’t make everything purple in this, so instead she used normal colors and brightened them up about a thousand times. Okay, it’s not unbearably bright, but it really isn’t pleasant to look at, even deep into the anime where you’re expected to be used to it by now. The animation itself isn’t that big of a deal, either. In fact, it’s pretty lackluster, especially given that Madhouse used the same budget as One Punch Man. Maybe they spent it all on memes to try and recreate the magic. I dunno. Anyway, doing cool parkour shit is okay. I guess. But the running is often poorly framed--I don’t give a shit about people moving their arms around really really quickly, you run with your L E G S. LEGS, MAN! Some clever angles would’ve made this pretty interesting to watch, but I guess no one cared as usual.Hey, remember Overlord? That one anime about Mr. Skeltal trying to take over the world? That opening song was incredible, right? Well, the same guys came back to do Stride’s, except not nearly as loud, exciting, cinematic, catchy, or even enjoyable. Which still makes it a decent song because Clattonia was just pure awesome, but the song doesn’t have a lot of punchiness or flair, and it’s marred by some pretty goofy lyrics. The art accompanying it has some style, at least, even if the runs presented look confusing. The rest of the soundtrack has a number of insert songs, which are pretty intelligible when used amongst the action, but I thought the non-inserts were surprisingly good. Not crazy good, but they have a smooth style and presence and are just exciting enough to make you keep your ear out for them without distracting you from what’s on screen. Not a bad ED either. I only listened to it like twice, though, because I wanted to move on as quickly as possible.The last thing I wanna talk about are the guys, because this show is supposed to be yaoi-bait and I need to make this clear. These fuckboys don’t even look that good.

I like the first few episodes and thought the races were exciting and nice to look at, with a killer soundtrack. Upon watching the next episodes up the the sixth that has aired I\'ve lost interest, with a super melodramatic plot that makes zero sense, backed up with paper thin characters.The sport itself does not even take the least amount of effort to make any sense. It is a race based on speed, but people waste time doing flashy parkour moves. Would it not have...made sense to give credit for style points if it is an integral part of the sport? They could have added in a number of explanations for the sport to make it a little more plausible, but there was none.Speaking of implausibility, there is the plot. It\'s full of melodrama with the characters over reacting to everything like their life depends on it in stand anime fare. The backstory of the stride club and the reasons surrounding people\'s reluctance to join is completely laughable. It is the standard annoying anime logic sort of thing where the good guys get bad press in the eyes of the public, but really they didn\'t do anything wrong. Such bad press could be avoided by reasonably explaining the situation, but common sense does not exist here. All this serves as set up for the scenes with cheesy inspirational music, inspiring speeches and some nonsense about ""connecting emotions"" as the stride club works to redeem itself.The characters are all one note which makes the dramatic plot points even more lame. It is fine when all they are doing is racing and having fun, but they do not go together with a plot that asks me to sympathize with them. They are also all pretty boys making some of them look downright goofy because of how out of place they are on the stride courses instead of posing for magazines. There is some of that as well; a boy band concert, photo shoots and such show up to appease the fujoshits.Visuals: The reason I started watching this in the first place. Unfortunately, you do not get to see as much running as bobbing torso. Not that much of the running gets animated. It was most apparent to me when a big, surprising parkour move was performed, and we don\'t get to see any of it. It is all conveyed by implication.One aspect I did enjoy was the soundtrack. It got me pumped up for the races and fit well with the artstyle. I\'ll be looking forward to the ost release. made sense to give credit for style points if it is an integral part of the sport?

It was also among the first ones to be aired in the season, much to the build-up that was added to it. With one of the masters in the industry working behind it, i.e. Studio Madhouse, Prince of Stride: Alternative was well worth the hype it had accumulated thus far, but as the season progressed, it quickly started to fade away. Why? Let\'s look into it in detail.The show brings no creativity at all to begin with. It has been done countless time in...sport anime\'s before. Famous high school club now in ruins and desperate for new members. Atleast try to be a little more creative. The game of Stride does bring a sense of freshness to the show. Basically its a sport where you run all the while competing with the another \'Strider\' within your block. It consists of five different members running from start to finish as all the five team members play a part in the whole sequence and give a touch for the next teammate to continue running. One of the problems with the show is that twelve episodes were always not enough to begin with. There are have been countless other similar shows being successful solely based on the fact that they run for a longer time. Time was an important asset to them and they had plenty to utilize it with the execution. This is something Prince of Stride: Alternative lacked big time. On a side note, I cannot understand why there\'s a \'Alternative\' in the title. I\'ve come to light that the source material was a visual game and the show can be taken as a spin-off of that.The characters on the show do it no good, with all honesty. All of them are like a basic stereotype with nothing to set them apart from any other generic characters. The MC is a light-hearted and silly guy with a dim-wit personality who just likes to run and is aiming to be on as many of the high school clubs as possible. There\'s the very cold looking teammate who acts as a direct rival for our MC and who doesn\'t talk much, and of course, does not get together early with our MC. Then there\'s the only girl in the show who\'s in fact the very first characters to be showcased and is another main character in focus in every sense who is inspired by the Stride club\'s achievements in the past and is aiming to be in the team as a manager. She eventually acts as a Relationer in the team who serves as a guide to the running teammates offering guidance with a speaker directly to the Striders. Then there\'s always a trap in the group along with a nerd who isn\'t interested being with the club to begin with. Two more senior characters are there in show, one\'s a cool, handsome looking guy who seems to be a senior worth relying on, and the other, literally having nothing worthy of praising, in my opinion. The manager however, was an interesting characteristic with his regular inspirational proverbs with a traditional discipline to them. Sad that he didn\'t get called a ""King"" when someone who only afterwards in the show arrived got to be called one.The art totally makes the show cool, and the aesthetics are on the positive aspect of this show. The OP/ED sequences with the music, too, do justice for the show but no OST\'s or background musics or other character songs worthy to be talking about. But all in all they\'re on the better side of the show. The frequent use of English in the show, as for the club names and the outfits, really make them appealing to the western audience too.Prince of Stride: Alternative also suffers from the problem of not being able to convey the story properly in my opinion. It could\'ve have become a good show even with the distinguishable flaws it had, if it had put more effort in giving the concept of Stride a little more spotlight. The sport is cool by all means, but for me it fails to properly deliver some important stuff to the viewer. For example, the tournaments the Stride Races take part in are a little difficult to understand. They do time-trials at times but nothing on the opposing team is showcased (And trust me there are some) on how they got so far. This is where as I said the time limit plays a huge part in. Stride races also offers a lot of cool moves and spectacular jumps, if they had put on something like additional points for that, then I think the games would\'ve become a lot more enjoyable.Prince of Stride: Alternative was never a profound show to begin with, as is the case with most of the sport shows. But what make them great is the reality aspect and the execution for it, that\'s where Prince of Stride: Alternative won and lost 50-50 for me. With the pacing and time limit the show had been given, I could see the ending being like that from a mile away, still Prince of Stride: Alternative has the little charm that\'s the beauty of every sport show, even if it was a short anime with just twelve episodes. sport anime\'s before.

Advertised as a sports series, yet it’s obvious that the show appeals to the female audience with its cast of pretty boys. What is striding? It’s basically a fictional extreme sport of running similar to that of parkour but with unique obstacles.Produced by Madhouse studio, the show runs pretty fast on its feet, literally. The first episodes introduces the main characters in standard fashion. Nana Sakurai, the main heroine transfers to Honen Academy and quickly becomes the manager of the Stride club, a club...dedicated to striding. The members of the group consists of a variety range of characters and personalities ranging from the cheerful Riku Yagami to the cool Takeru Fujiwara. Each member of the club also possesses individual skills and characteristics that makes them unique on the team. While this is all good and dandy, the show doesn’t capitalize on their traits but instead follows a generic route of competition. Yes, there’s risks and strategy that is adapted into each race. However, the ending result usually is predictable. And that’s honestly something that isn’t so admirable.The story structure is designed as more carefree although striding is the main course of the plot. Other times, the show feels like it’s taking a breather such as fashion shoots, hot springs, and even the infamous beach episode. In general, the story turns into a mixed affair of comedy and competitiveness. If that makes any sense, the series also takes every advantage of the boys to make them stand out as bishounens. There’s nothing wrong with that except the show focuses perhaps a bit too much on it for the first half of the series. It takes the serious nature of the striding when the boys are presented more as fan service rather than athletes. On the other hand, the show does take its game mechanics seriously. Every relay race is designed aesthetically and never the same. In addition, the show adds commentary to explore the physical aspects of the obstacles, short-cuts, and potential strategies runners can use to their advantage.However, the story isn’t the main problem with the show. The main problem lies with the characters. It’s hard to feel attached to any of them. Takeru is like a Free clone of Haru but hardly has a strong relationship that can be relatable. Riku adds a bit more of casual atmosphere that people can get used to quickly but it’s hard to accept his character. He’s just too damn carefree. Heath Hasekura, the half-man, half-model is probably Mr. Fan service and there’s little depth about his character at all.  Finally, Hozumi Kohinata exposes almost all the weakness of the show with his non-existent characterization, girly face, and weakly timed jokes. Luckily, there’s some characterization and background storytelling through mid-story but the overall execution lacks steam. Don’t expect Honan Academy’s rivals to be memorable either. They have cliché written all over them with easily forgettable characteristics.If you’re interested in some fun excitement, then Prince of Stride might be a show for you. While the storytelling and characters are easily forgettable, the relay races themselves lives up to the hype on most occasions. Stride is apparently a fictional sport so the rules and risks are a refreshment to any sports fan. It invites speculations on what strategies can work and what may fail. The risk is also realistic as well that includes near fatal injuries. Furthermore, the show does a clever job highlighting the body movements of the athletes. Each episode is choreographed consistently whether it’s jumping across shortcuts, bypassing obstacles, or just running against the wind.The artwork is like colored rainbows. Bright and flashy are just few of many words that can describe the background visuals.  It also has a sense of flamboyant feel as each relay race has a different style unique to each competition. And of course, who can forget about the boys? They are the main stars not just for being athletes but an eye candy for the female audience to see.Soundtrack is surprising attractive with a good amount of psychology mixed in. There’s good timing during crucial points of each relay race to capture the thrill of competition. It’s also creative enough to be legitmently entertaining to the ears. Character voice mannerism is moderate although I personally find them lacking with the exception of Riku. Meanwhile, the OP and ED theme songs are rather mediocre in respect.In essence, Prince of Stride is more of a show that seems to appeal to a certain demographic and advertised for the audience to play the game. It isn’t an entirely awful show despite the lackluster story or mild characterization. Rather, it doesn’t deliver with the premise and each episode seems to lack more and more steam as time drags on. I find it hard to also get attached to many of the characters and in the end didn’t really find liking any of them. Blurring the lines of fictional sport and modern man service, this is a show that easily feels like an advertisement. dedicated to striding.

Blurring the lines of fictional sport and modern man service, this is a show that easily feels like an advertisement.', ""Introducing Stride: an extreme high-thrilled sport where parkour and endurance running collide together!The rules of Stride are really simple: you form a team of six people and you compete against one other team. Five of you run across the race course as a relay, avoiding obstacles, and staying on track. The fastest team who crosses the finish line first wins.It’s definitely a very interesting concept straight from the get-go. So why can’t I rank this show any higher?Well, for one, whenever you introduce a sport, it is imperative to consider your audience: they have no clue what the sport is about or never...even heard of anything like it before. Furthermore, sports often incorporate a lot of new terminology that can lose the audience quickly. As a result, the screenwriters must absolutely take the time to explain these terms well.This is where Prince of Stride begins to crack. In the first few episodes, terms such as “relationer” will be thrown at you and leave you second-guessing until you actually see it in action. Techniques associated with parkour or the relationing process itself, too, are never properly explained. And, most importantly, the rules of Stride are very open, and this is a recipe for disaster. For instance, shortcuts – what exactly constitutes an acceptable shortcut? Couldn’t you technically just “shortcut” an entire leg? Since this rule and others like it are never thoroughly explained, viewers who are making an attempt to understand what is happening are more than often left hanging and utterly confused. And mind you that this is just one rule  – there are plenty of others that don't make any sense either.The other issue is the characters themselves. As you probably know, Prince of Stride centers on the members of the Honan Stride team. The characters on this team had serious potential but were never given ample time on the show to have enough depth. Some characters were given no time at all and honestly were not a significant factor in the show (e.g. Hozumi). They could have been left out from the story and the plot of the entire show would not have changed much (minus the fact that you would have an incomplete team, oops). Others are what I like to call half-baked: some characterization but somewhat forced. A good example of this is Nana. Nana’s true colors begin to show when her father shows up back in Japan, but since her father was never mentioned up to this point, it seems as if his entire purpose was to elicit some emotional response from her. Thus, her actions and thoughts come off as a little unbelievable. I would argue that the only decent characterization was of Riku (see episode 11), since we later learn that he uses Stride as a way to dissociate his own identity from his more talented brother’s.As for the plot, there isn’t really anything remarkable about it. As with all other sports anime, Prince of Stride: Alternative tries to balance Honan’s training and the tournaments that they participate in. In the first half of the show, there is more training and other trivial things that they do (e.g. obtain a sponsor) than there are actual tournaments, and some of these training sessions do not produce anything fruitful other than heightened, excited emotions. Towards the end of the show, however, the plot finally gets somewhere when the Honan team comes face-to-face against two of their toughest, most challenging rival teams during the End of Summer semi-finals and finals.For the art, let’s just say it’s different. The color palette that Madhouse chose to use in this show often comes off as overly bright or pale. It’s not oversaturated as in the colors of No Game No Life but will take some time to adjust to. Despite this, the animation and artwork is very consistent. Sound and voice acting are also of high quality, albeit none of it really stood out.So, just to summarize, I wouldn’t say that this is one of the better sports anime out there. Its premise had a lot of potential but unfortunately the plot does not build off from it at all. If you’re looking for a more balanced story or characters with more depth, you won’t find them here. I felt like too often this show came off as a little dry since nothing is really explored well, and it’s likely that you will think this way too.Overall rating: CAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion.

(it\'s a free anime joke)Story:10This show goes above and beyond what it would have to do to deserve a great rating for its story. Everyone has a unique story that is connected to at least three other people in the main group of the stride runners. There\'s not really any backpedaling with flashbacks so it\'s...very fluid. All the main stories are pretty interesting however a lot of them don\'t gain momentum until towards the end of the show so hold out if you feel a lack of story in the beginning. While it doesn\'t come off as one originally, Prince of Stride has great comedic elements that made me KEK so KEKING hard that I KEK\'d until my sides hurt.Art:10If you\'ve seen any clips from the show or maybe the PV\'s you\'ll know what I mean when I say this show is vibrant and beautiful. The color scheme is very pleasant and the animations are smooth throughout the entire show. Not much else to say in this area.Sound:10I\'m not an expert on what makes a soundtrack great but the songs were catchy and did a great job of expressing the themes that weren\'t visible.Character:All of the characters are pretty interesting in their own ways. The show doesn\'t feel like it has a lot of forced emotions and the characters stay true to themselves throughout. There\'s a lot to say but it would spoil the show and I want to make sure this remains spoiler free.Pros and cons:Pros-No fanservice-Great OSTs-The fucking KEKsCons-No second season very fluid.

However, there are a lot of plot holes, they skip a lot of the parts that would be interesting to see and the problems they face have a tendency to be really stupid. They don\'t really get to any solutions, and there was only one time when we actually saw how they trained. All in all, it\'s not bad. Continue reading for more details.Story (6): The story begins, like many other sports related anime, with a character introducing themself and explaining that they went to this particular...school because of their team in a certain sport. Turns out that this team has been facing difficulties, and they would have to find more members to get the club working again. The first episodes are really slow and steady, you get the information you need, though probably not all the information you want. Later, the time skips start, so you go from one Stride match to another with a small training segment in between (the training is usually along the lines of running a little and jumping over some stuff and suddenly improving a lot). There are always a lot of details lacking, which I guess can\'t be helped when every second episode is an actual match, and there are still episodes that seem to serve no purpose to develop the plot at all. When it actually gets down to it, the scenes that are included are really good, and considering the fact that it\'s from a game, you can\'t really expect too much thought into backstory and such, since it\'s literally based on just the running part. The sport itself is really interesting, basically a baton style race one a track with lots of obstacles, bringing in acrobatics as a theme.Art (7): The art is actually very nice, it\'s a clean style with no obvious flaws. All the characters look very distinct, with individual eye shapes, noses and body types. It\'s very detailed in that sense. The way the clothes are drawn on the characters sometimes looks slightly off, though. The backgrounds are slightly over the top sometimes. It catches the feel of the situation, but the colors have a tendency to be extremely bright. Most backgrounds are repetitive, with some exceptions. There are also a lot of sceneries in this show that look absolutely stunning.Sound (7): The opening and ending themes really fit the show, it\'s particularly cool that they use the idol group from the show to create a theme. The soundtracks in the show are really good, I don\'t know what their names are so I\'ll describe them like the sound, the light sparkly tone is really... Light and sparkly, which makes it perfect for those tensionless middle scenes. The ""end of summer"" track is really upbeat and tells you something is about to go down... That is, if the scene on the screen wasn\'t enough.Characters (8): The characters are all very individual, they all have their own respective facial traits and body types. All the characters also have their own personalities, and rather than the standard ""everyone is super friends with everyone"" kind of style, there is a very realistic parting in who gets best along with who. The characters also have roles in the story that makes them important, which isn\'t seen way too often. Of course, it doesn\'t get a perfect score, mostly because all the characters seem to suffer from being way too emotional about things, to the point where it doesn\'t make sense. The comic relief characters also get annoying after a while.Enjoyment (7): It\'s a really light watch, since it doesn\'t dig into the past of the characters and the story behind what is happening a lot. It focuses solely on the sport itself, and you won\'t see any of the problems outside of it. Except for one single character in the main characters\' class, there is not a single person not related to Stride that we see more than once. This is probably a great ""middle ground"" anime, a perfect next step after finishing something that leaves you empty, wondering what you\'ll do with your life from now.Overall (7): I personally really like this anime, since it does have a line going through the scenes, even though there are some huge time skips here and there. It definitely kept me from not being bored, so it served it\'s purpose. The best way to explain it is ""interesting enough."" school because of their team in a certain sport.

It is a light-hearted sports series centred around the world of Stride, a fictional parkour/relay race. While Stride is somewhat different to those common sports seen within the genre, it still fits the mould expected. So what does PoS have to offer?The story centers around the Honan Academy Stride team, a once elite stride team, which has dwindled after an incident two years prior. Two first years join the team, expecting to find a thriving Stride team, however they are shocked to find the club only has three members. The basis of the story isn't groundbreaking...or revolutionary, but it is a solid, well-crafted plot which is really enhanced by the sport of Stride. What Stride does well however, is create realistic connections between the main cast. Stride definitely isn't a character driven show, hell, most of the side characters aren't memorable, but it's these relationships within the main cast which makes the drive of these characters powerful.The art of this show is beautiful and it is really one of the highlights. The world of stride, especially in competition, is bright and colourful, which really fits the atmosphere of the show.  The character designs, even for one-off rivals, is unique for every character. The action sequences are high quality and one of the best things of Stride. Watching the characters play Stride is nail biting and entertaining, but predictable.My biggest gripe with this show is the ending (no spoilers ahead). It's abrupt and sudden, which bothers me. It doesn't tie up any loose ends or provide any closure. It's an ending that makes sense, but it could have been so much better.Character development is there, but not significantly. There isn't enough time to fully explore all of the main cast within the twelve episodes given. It is based off a Otome Game, which I have heard does explore the main cast and even the side characters thoroughly. However it's impossible to condense 60+ hours of gameplay into twelve 20 minute episodes.Just to reinstate, Prince of Stride is no means a masterpiece, nor is it a revolutionary series. But, it IS a fun series. I binge watched it all in a day. It had me so hooked I couldn't stop watching it. It follows all the same tropes you would expect out of a sports anime, but it follows them well.

But rather I got a lackluster character art, mediocre OP and ED, and did not see romance between the female lead and the other guys.It should be stated that being based on a BL (Boy's Love) game is more appropriate for this anime since the only romantic development in this anime where between the guys. The touching of hands were rather dramatic since it is the theme of the show.Story:If you watched Yowamushi Pedal, the story is like that, wherein the club...compete on tournaments and beat schools. It is very straightforward. There's also the issue of a backstory between the main leads that came out of nowhere.Character:Though I did like the comedy of the show and the antics. The characters are flat though and their opponents beside Gal-Stan and Kakyoin are so flat since they weren't explored properly.Music:The OP was upbeat but it wasn't my type. I really couldn't remember the ED.Art:I had high expectations since watching Death Note and Chihayafuru that I will get atleast a artistic anime, but what I got were characters who put too much powder in their faces. The character art was so poor but the background and how they executed the stride animations were spectacular though.Overall, I did enjoy the anime because it was fun and I like sports anime. compete on tournaments and beat schools.

She decides to attend the school in hopes of managing the Stride Club. Stride is an extreme sport involving running and navigating obstacles on an uneven course. Nana meets two boys named Takeru Fujiwara and Riku Yagami and convinces them to join the club in efforts to compete in the ""End of Summer"" tournament. Together, they learn that Stride is about so much more than just running; it\'s about connecting with each other....Or so Madhouse would have me believe!As someone who has willingly jumped into [and stayed in] sports anime hell over the past...year or so, I\'d like to think I\'m fairly experienced in critiquing sports anime. I\'ve seen all kinds of tropes, some good and some bad, but through it all, I believe the there are a few things all sports anime try to achieve. Whether a sports anime\'s characters have hyperbolic, unrealistic personalities or are more well-rounded, whether the sports skills resemble stunts you\'d see at Hogwarts or actually seem humanly possible, all sports anime have two common goals in my opinion. The first is to teach viewers about the particular sport in question. And the second is to show how the sport in question changes its characters, typically for the better.Prince of Stride fails to achieve either of these goals.Stride is never really explained well. We get it, there\'s running. But why all the tricks and acrobatics? Can you get extra points for jumping all over the place, or are those tricks simply to get fans screaming? And if the latter is true, then why don\'t acrobatic tricks affect a team\'s final score? Because they should! In addition, the main characters are never shown to really improve. Aside from Yagami changing his posture, none of the characters evolve in their sport.Nearly all of the main characters are flat; they embody one-dimensional stereotypes. Yagami is the angsty teenager going through an emo phase. Takeru is the Furuya of PoS; he\'s good at everything just because, and he doesn\'t know how to communicate. Sakurai is in the anime simply as a formality, since the anime was adapted from a video game. Kominato and Kadowaki are the comic relief, Heath is the reliable senpai hunk, and Kuga is the strong, silent weirdo who likes to stare at the sky and won\'t shut the fuck up about the wind. None of these characters have depth, aside from maybe Yagami, if you\'re willing to qualify his struggles as ""depth.""Multiple episodes repeatedly emphasize Yagami\'s inferiority complex, but each episode ""resolves"" his issues by the end with no believable sequence of events. Prince of Stride attempts to convince us that Yagami truly loves running deep down, but despite it TELLING us that, it SHOWS us a very different message. Yagami seems to hate Stride. He hates his brother, he hates running, and he hates Takeru. But somehow, every episode ends up with him smiling into the sunset, only for him to repeat the same angsty routine in the next episode.So here\'s the problem: Without dynamic, developing characters, and without even a proper education on Stride, what\'s left in this anime? All that\'s left are ridiculous amounts of drama, cheap tricks, filler episodes, training montages, the same stupid insert song, and characters on the sidelines yelling ""HASHIRE!!!"" at the top of their lungs. And oh, so much drama. All of which lead up to a finale that frankly, these characters didn\'t earn. Unfortunately, none of those things is enough to make an anime compelling. There are many scenes that attempt to hype up the audience, and they do succeed at first. However, those scenes get old without any connection to the characters, and the anime very quickly becomes stale.The art of Prince of Stride is a little jarring, mostly because of the weird color scheme. The shading and coloring of the anime definitely didn\'t help promote a ""real"" feeling to the show. It could have been a strong point, had the plot and characters been up to par. Similarly, the music for this anime was pretty good, but it didn\'t have nearly the impact it could have because of the plot and characters. What\'s more, many victory scenes used the same annoying insert song until, again, the effect was lost and the song became an annoyance.I have always thought very highly of Madhouse, but they kind of missed the mark with this anime. Between the bad character development, misplaced music, and lack of proper exposition, a lot went wrong.

Stride is a running sports with parkour. yea... they are running while doing some parkour stuff. tbh, personally, i like the concept of the sports, and even running is one of my fav sports. that is the reason why i got interested in this anime.For the first episode, first impression, to me, it was a really cool, awsome episode. i really really like the way they start the series. looks awsome and cool to me, and i thought it would become a great series, but......a little bit dissapointment to me.A story about a guy who in the past has...quit playing stride because of his brother, but now, in highschool, a girl and a boy invite him or more like force him to join a certain stride club without knowing the fact that he has already quit playing stride.And that where everything began. but it was a little bit dissapoint me.Why?because this show is focused more on the character problems and development more than the action on the sports. and the result; they didn't put much action in the final episode, final race, and that one kinda dissapoint me because i was looking foward to the action. i didn't mean to say the character development and the problems is bad, i like some of them, and some of them i think it was okay to me, but i don't like the fact that they focused more on the character rather than the action. it wasn't balincing in my opinion. AND! the race was too predictable to quess who will win. in sports, that supprosed to be the main problem, the author musn't let any viewer predict or know who will win. because that will the climax. it is pointless if the viewer already know who will win. it's not like i don't like it, it's just okay to me. i just want to say it's a shame, a great looking sports like that is too obvious to see who will win. Basically it lacks of impact.From the character, they really did a good job in my opinion. they really put their effort to executed the development, problem and conclusion even tho i found their relationship a little bit weird. to me, it wasn't really bother my enjoyment. to me the pacing was okay. i don't see anything wrong nor even bother my enjoyment. just the fact that this show is lack of action is dissapoint me.The soundtrack was pretty good overall, especially the OP. really like the op. but the ED..... i wish i will never heard it again. well this anime is originally for girls, so obvious some of the song will be something like that. i can't blame the director but still for me, i don't like the ED song at all.On the other side, good animation for a sports anime. really fit well, especially the soundtrack they used for the action, really good imo. but there is one thing that really pissed me off. some of the character design almost look like a girl and that really pissed me off for some reason. why ? because i almost turn into a gay for a second. it was really a shame, a beautifull character design, the truth is, he is a guy. i really hate that tbh. like i wish that guy is a girl so i can put her in my fav list XD but well, whatever. i don't give a fuck with it anymore XDOverall, not really enjoy it that much but i still enjoy it. i mean i enjoy it but not really 100% enjoy it. well, like i said, i didn't enjoy it because lack of action. i don't really like the fact that they focused more on the relationship rather than the action. dissapoint me a little bit. so i'm gonna give it a 7/10. probably never watch it again, BUT! i wouldn't mind a second season. at least more action.I don't know if what your taste is, but if you like sports, try 1 or 2 episode of this series, the sports is really great imo, but it just didn't have that many action, and it was kinda predictable.Sorry for bad english.Hope my review can be helpful to you all.Thanks. Have a nice day quit playing stride because of his brother, but now, in highschool, a girl and a boy invite him or more like force him to join a certain stride club without knowing the fact that he has already quit playing stride.And that where everything began. but it was a little bit dissapoint me.Why?because this show is focused more on the character problems and development more than the action on the sports. and the result; they didn't put much action in the final episode, final race, and that one kinda dissapoint me because i was looking foward to the action. i didn't mean to say the character development and the problems is bad, i like some of them, and some of them i think it was okay to me, but i don't like the fact that they focused more on the character rather than the action. it wasn't balincing in my opinion.

I became so hyped up about sports series that I decided to try ""Prince of Stride: Alternative"". I can\'t say I\'m disappointed, but compared to aforementioned ""Haikyuu!!"", ""Prince of Stride: Alternative"" looks bland and, on the whole - average.The story is as generic as it could get. It revolves around the new extreme sport called ""Stride"" which is similiar to parkour. ""Stride"", however, is not new, neither it is extreme. Sadly, the runners just run, sometimes they jump over some obstacles and somehow, this attracts large crowds and makes runs a big city event.As with all school clubs...in anime there is a girl, and a boy and another boy who have always dreamt of running in ""Stride"". They join the ""Stride"" schoolclub which, obviously, is running out of members and our protagonists miraculously save the club. Then, all of them are training and running. Also, in each episode there\'s someone talking about how ""Stride"" connects people with a mandatory, super-cringeworthy shot of high-five of the runners in the background. And that\'s pretty much the story, or what supposed to be the story. Very predictable and unoriginal.The art is mediocre. It has its ups and downs but there\'s nothing particular in it. The characters\' faces seem really weird as they look like they have different shapes in different shots, but overall the characters are nicely drawn. Run sequences are fairly well animated, although there is too little running and too much thinking-while-running shots.There\'s also nothing particular in sound. During the run sequences there\'s always some music but in my opinion it is there only because it would be awkward to listen to the boys\' gasps for a few minutes.When it comes to characters, there\'s absolutely nothing original in them. There\'s the female protagonist, who is there only to be a narrator and has no personality whatsoever, then there\'s the overly enthusiastic guy, the manly guy, Haru from ""Free!"" and even Sephiroth from FF7 - pretty much the characters we\'ve all already seen elsewhere. Each character is pretty much one dimensonial and is involved in some backstory which is absolutely forgettable and is meant to add depth to the characters but unfortunately fails to do so. On the other hand, some of them are sometimes funny.Having completed the whole series, I can say I generally enjoyed it despite its flaws. There definitely are better sports series, but also there are definitely worse sports series. ""Prince of Stride: Alternative"" is by no means a masterpiece, but it\'s not a bad show either. This anime just doesn\'t shine in any way. If you have some free time, give it a go. Don\'t expect too much, though.(This is my first review and I\'m not native English speaker so there probably are lots of mistakes, so sorry for that.) in anime there is a girl, and a boy and another boy who have always dreamt of running in ""Stride"".

Positive because the director of the series Atsuko Ishizuka, did such a great job with No Game No Life. Which stood out last year for its art design and color palate. However, Stride’s source material originated from an otome game (romance games targeted at women). This fact had me worried that the show would become a clone of a certain...swimming show involving men from a commercial.The art and style of this show is on point. The styling of the races and OP are reminiscent of Air Gear and Persona, using different textures to create a vibrant background involving all of the characters that filled the screen. Anticipation for each race is a result of how clean and polished the environment was. Everything from the obstacles, to the design of the large scaled font on the sides of buildings created some wonderful scenes. Making me yearn for more action in each race.But that excitement was doused upon by Strides inability to present a race coherently. In early episodes, it was hard to understand the scale of the objects the runners were maneuvering around. Mainly due to the editing and the abundance of tight shots on the runners clearing the objects, the distortion that it created was frustrating. In later episodes this issue is less frequent, but the secondary annoyance is the decision to not provide the audience a layout or map or distance or anything really, to convey basic information about the area where the teams are running. There are quick cuts to a top down map on a screen, but the issue is unresolved because the shot follows the runners instead of pulling out to show them in relation to the map as a whole. The best that Stride can muster is the time difference between each leg of the race as members prepare to relay with their partners, but that information is slightly useless due to the fact that the audience is rarely given overall times or even the average time of each member.All of that should make it obvious what the show is concerned with. _Stride _is a show that puts the relationships first and the competition second. There is nothing wrong with that focus in a sports themed show. One of the common tropes in sports anime is the childhood promise to win a big tournament, stating that you compete for your friends and not yourself, and the clash of two rookies who end up working well together. Stride hits all of those beats and more, but the balance of the show feels distorted.It is hard to justify viewing Stride as sports show about running. While there is a framework for that is in place the running and training is just a device used to enable the students to participate in various antics, whether the students are modeling for a sponsor or going on a trip to their rivals -Galaxy Standard- training facility and throwing a beach party. Even though Stride doesn’t seem to fully embrace its otome game origins, it does not shy away from the potential male/male romantic pairings that are occasionally implied. Making the show awkward at times to sit through.Stride in general is plagued with an attempt of trying to please a wider audience, but wounded itself in the process. There is the generic sports show about running, along with the romance (or “bromance”) created from the winking subtext of the relationships between members of the team. In simpler terms, it’s hard to enjoy the show as a whole if one of these aspects doesn’t appeal to you. Potentially leaving certain members of the audience disheartened when the show is unable to earnestly present enough of a race, or move away from the dreamlike world of male teenage bonding.It is just fine if you enjoyed the show, I know there will be some individuals out there who did.

So when I heard that Mad House was making a sports anime, I was hyped. That coupled with the amazing voice actor cast this anime has, and I honestly had no doubts that I would at least enjoy it even if it turned out to...not quite meet my standards.I was wrong and I\'m saying this as someone who did low-key enjoy Free! as a guilty pleasure.The first half of this anime feels incredibly tedious. I was bored whilst watching and didn\'t find any of the comedy stuff funny at all. The first half focuses quite heavily on characters since there are quite a few character introductions. Usually I wouldn\'t have a problem with this but when your characters are pretty much cardboard, it\'s just a waste of screen time. I think it was around episode 8 for me when I realised that I was so apathetic towards all the characters that I actually didn\'t know any of their names. Obviously this is a major problem for any anime, but especially a sports one. An aspect which makes a sports anime so enjoyable to watch, is that you want to root for the characters/teams because they\'re likeable and you want to see them achieve their goal of victory. An especially good sports anime in my opinion will also have the side characters developed so you don\'t know who to quite root for... but in both regards, (of having both the main and side characters developed), this anime completely failed. After just finishing the anime, I can only recall the names of 4 characters max and that\'s probably me stretching it to be honest. I didn\'t root for anyone and I didn\'t care about anyone. The characters are quite literally just their character designs - \'pretty boys\' so fujoshis can ship them together and probably write fanfiction about them.Also, I\'m not someone to question \'anime logic\' but the realism of some the stunts displayed is practically non-existent. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m quite the fan of Prince of Tennis and KnB and both of those can be pretty ridiculous at times, but the ridiculous things which happen in those series can sort of be accepted because of how they are set up. In those series, the special moves which some of the characters do are sort of justified by, (all be it - complete bs), stretched physics logic/explanations. There is none of that here. A dude jumps from what looks like some cliff edge and lands on both his feet without breaking anything and continues to run without any sort of explanation? Oh he also swings around a flag pole a couple of times even though he\'s seemingly only ever been in the track club his entire life, not gymnastics or whatever. Sure anime sure. (Me nitpicking but it\'s something which personally bothered me.)There were also some emotional conflicts some of the characters went through and some pointless backstory sort of crudely thrown in half way through which I felt didn\'t really add anything at all except maybe help some of the ships sail. Didn\'t care for these plot points at all and again, I was bored whilst watching these parts.That being said, towards the end of the anime, I was getting some sort of enjoyment out of it. The races in the last few episodes I found myself actually getting a little hyped and I was actually looking forward to the final race... but then they ruined that too. How you think it\'s justified to NOT show half of the final race in favour of some shitty monologue is absolutely beyond me. Honestly I was appalled with how that final race was showcased and how the anime ended. When the entire goal of the characters, (and thus the anime), is to complete the End of Summer race and you don\'t even show HOW the race ended just the end result in a magazine? Absolutely dreadful.Okay so on to some of the few positives of this anime - nothing wrong with the voice acting. Just look at the seiyuu cast and that\'s not really a surprise. The OST was fine too and the track played during the races did it\'s job in getting me hyped. Not really a fan of the OP or ED but I don\'t think they\'re particularly bad, just not to my taste.It\'s mad house so the animation is fine. Honestly, the blues and greens in this anime look absolutely beautiful to me. I\'m not really a big fan of the sort of \'white-wash\' look they have going on with the character\'s skin tones though... but again that\'s personal preference and possibly me just being nitpicky. Character designs are fine. Nothing too special about them but they\'re clearly suited for the demographic this anime is obviously aimed at - fujoshis.My personal ratings for this anime:- Story: 3- Art: 7- Sound: 8- Characters: 2- Enjoyment: 3So overall I would give this anime a 4. not quite meet my standards.I was wrong and I\'m saying this as someone who did low-key enjoy Free! as a guilty pleasure.The first half of this anime feels incredibly tedious.

For half of the time, it is about the main characters competing in a sport named “Stride”. The other half of the time is used to show interactions between the main characters and relationship with one another. At time, it does both of those work well enough. However, for most of the time, the two parts of this anime do feel lacking. The anime used a fair share or sports clichés to get the job done. Still, Prince of Stride manages to be an okay anime despite...its flaws.~{Story}~In Prince of Stride, the main premise is about a group of students who form a club/team that competes with other teams in a sport called “Stride” (which really is just relay with parkour). However, this is just the backbone of the anime as the main focus is really the relationship between the characters. The whole Stride aspect is used to keep the content fresh. At times, the whole slice-of-life moments can feel like a drag, so the Stride moments do keep your interest. The plot isn’t anything special, due to the fact that this is a by-the-books sports anime. It’s just like any other sports anime you’ve seen; main characters are practicing to get better at a sport, wins some, loses some, practices to get better, flashbacks are given to the characters to give “depth”, gets better and proves to be the best. The plot has a fair share of clichés and they end up pulling down this anime.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~For the most part, Prince of Stride takes a slice-of-life approach. Most times, the main characters are either fooling around or training to get better. The tone-shifting at times can be pretty noticeable. At times, you’ll get some serious competition, next, you’ll be seeing the main characters chug a bucket of shaved ice… yeah! It starts to get irritating when you get something that seems very filler-y when you should be receiving a tension. However, when they’re consistent with the tone, the lighthearted parts do work, but the more suspenseful moments (such as the Stride races) are even more entertaining. The buildup is okay and the way they incorporate flashback during more intense situations work well enough, except in the last episode. Also, this anime feels like a combination of shounen (getting better at something, the power of friendship) and shoujo (strong bromances, slight shounen ai vibes) tropes. The direction in the end episode felt lacking as there was absolutely no tension at all and it felt very melodramatic.Presentation: 5/10~{Character}~For an anime that primarily focuses on the main characters and their interactions with each other, it is important to have good characters. Prince of Stride is mixed bag in this. The main protagonist of Prince of Stride is Sakurai Nana, who is the relationer (someone who signals the racers on their team when to start running, in order for two racers to make contact with each other) of the team. She ends up being one of the blander characters of the anime as she doesn’t have any traits that makes her stand out much. Next is Yagami Riku, who follows most of the clichés of an energetic, carefree character. However he stands out in the cast of characters well due to his more energetic personality. Next is Fujiwara Takeru, who is one of the more organized and quiet ones on the team. Then you have other characters like Hasekura, Kadowaki, Kohinata and Kuga, which don’t play that big of a role except for doing their best during stride races. Most of these characters, if not all, follow a fair share of clichés as mentioned before. And their character relationships are the cliché “nakama powers” for most of the time. At the end, the characters are enjoyable at times, but they are very, very cliché.Character: 4/10~{Art}~,The art is pretty good for most of the times in Prince of Stride. Character designs (though you’ve seen designs like these before) end up being decent. The backgrounds do feel a little lacking at times, and the architectures (though for style) looks very simplistic. Many objects are just given a plain color texture and it’s a little disappoint, especially when Madhouse is behind this. However, the art style is great. It has this sort of vividness to it, but at the same time, the art looks bleached out. The color palette is purposely limited to those bleach out colors. This unique art style adds to the effect and works really well during Stride races. Although, the art style may not be the ideal one during its slice-of-life-y moments.Art: 6/10~{Animation}~Probably one of the better aspects of Prince of Stride, the animations for the most time is great. During the laidback scenes, the animations quality is just as good as your average school anime. However, when the Stride scenes happen, the animation quality boosts up. Even though in these scenes, for the most time you just see the racer’s torso moving around, but it done really well. The character movements are really well depicted and it really does feel they’re running their fastest. And when they do their parkour movements, it’s really fun to watch being the animations are top notch. The fluidity between character and object movement is very good. However, the animations in the final episode felt a little weak, since it took the easy way out.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~The cast they got for this anime is really impressive, as it’s filled with A-list seiyuu. Hanazawa Kana does Sakurai well. Her character isn’t very special, but she manages to do a good job with was she has. Then you have other well-known seiyuu, like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Ono Daisuke, Shimono Hiro, Ono Kensho, Suwabe Junichi, and Kimura Ryouhei, which all do a fine job at what they need to do, even if their characters are clichés. The seiyuu make the characters better than what they originally would be. Even the supporting cast is filled with well-known as really loved seiyuu, such as Sakurai Takahiro, Miyano Mamoru, Suzuki Tatsuhisa, Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Hanae Natsuki, Okiayu Ryotaro, Eguchi Takuya and Ishikawa Kaito and they all do a good job… obviously! In the end, the great cast manages to do a good job with their characters, even though they could have done something great.Voice Acting: 6/10~{Music}~The music is probably the strongest point in Prince of Stride. The OP, “Strider's High”, is fantastic. It’s super upbeat and catchy. It really sets the mood for the anime. It ends up being one of the best OP of the season. If you’re not going to watch the anime, at least listen to the OP. The ED, “Be My Steady”, really good as it’s really funky and catchy. Who doesn’t want to hear popular seiyuu sing together? The background music used is really good, especially the one used during the Stride races. The music used during those races are catchy, upbeat, and set up a tension and excitement for those scenes. Also the placement of those background music is great. Even the more slower music used for the “emotional” scenes are good too.Music: 6/10~{Enjoyment}~At times I really do enjoy Prince of Stride, but only at times. The Stride races are pretty enjoyable at times, because who doesn’t want to see a parkour version of relay? However, the final Stride race was very lackluster. The more slice-of-life moments, with the main characters interacting with each other is at times entertaining and at times frustrating, because in the end, all you’re seeing is clichés interacting with more clichés. The music and animations helped a lot, but they couldn’t cover the content much. The melodramatic scenes didn’t work well either, as it was hard to care about these characters.Enjoyment: 5/10Prince of Stride is something that you’ll like depending on your preferences. Prince of Stride is cliché heavy, and isn’t very unique. It does stuff you’ve already seen many, many times from this genre. The characters have overused traits, filled with so many tropes. The art and animations stand out and the Stride scenes are pretty fun for most of the time. The music and voice acting is also really good. However, the ending is very lackluster due to poor direction. The epilogue hit too early and the final Stride scene couldn’t be more pathetic. And the melodramatic scene didn’t help either. In the end, Prince of Stride is all style and no substance.+ Good art and animations and most of the Stride scenes are really interesting+ OP and ED are catchy and the background music is energetic and well-placed+ Good voice acting due to a large A-list cast of seiyuu- The story isn’t anything new and is cliché heavy- The characters are filled with common tropes and are uninteresting- Ending felt lackluster due to poor directionOverall: 5.4/10 its flaws.~{Story}~In Prince of Stride, the main premise is about a group of students who form a club/team that competes with other teams in a sport called “Stride” (which really is just relay with parkour). However, this is just the backbone of the anime as the main focus is really the relationship between the characters. The whole Stride aspect is used to keep the content fresh. At times, the whole slice-of-life moments can feel like a drag, so the Stride moments do keep your interest. The plot isn’t anything special, due to the fact that this is a by-the-books sports anime. It’s just like any other sports anime you’ve seen; main characters are practicing to get better at a sport, wins some, loses some, practices to get better, flashbacks are given to the characters to give “depth”, gets better and proves to be the best. The plot has a fair share of clichés and they end up pulling down this anime.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~For the most part, Prince of Stride takes a slice-of-life approach. Most times, the main characters are either fooling around or training to get better. The tone-shifting at times can be pretty noticeable. At times, you’ll get some serious competition, next, you’ll be seeing the main characters chug a bucket of shaved ice… yeah! It starts to get irritating when you get something that seems very filler-y when you should be receiving a tension. However, when they’re consistent with the tone, the lighthearted parts do work, but the more suspenseful moments (such as the Stride races) are even more entertaining. The buildup is okay and the way they incorporate flashback during more intense situations work well enough, except in the last episode. Also, this anime feels like a combination of shounen (getting better at something, the power of friendship) and shoujo (strong bromances, slight shounen ai vibes) tropes.

Look up the rules of Stride (the fictional sport in this anime) before you watch this because, otherwise, you\'re gonna be confused for like the first two episodes.Well, this is yet another sports anime to add to my list. Can you name a few sports anime? Haikyuu!!, Free!, Kuroko no Basket? Well, have I got good news for you! Nearly ALL of the seiyuus in Prince of Stride: Alternative have been in at least one of those aforementioned sport anime staples.Also, the ONLY reason that this anime isn\'t ranked as a 10 is because the storytelling was bit shoddy and the art made everything...look super washed out. The story itself was fantastic. I love the elements that were a part of it, such as: Riku and Takeru\'s backstory, Riku\'s issues with his brother, and the history of the Honan Stride Club. However, the anime didn\'t give these plot elements enough time to grow. Had the season been 25 episodes long instead of 12, it would\'ve been nice because those things could\'ve been elaborated on more. As it stands, you kind of get told something through a couple lines of dialogue without dwelling on it. So, the story kind of expects you to fill in the blanks of your emotions when it should be giving you those emotions. Make sense?That being said, I actually did get a little teary eyed at the end. This brings me into the characters. I absolutely loved them. Not only do I love the familiarity of the seiyuus, but I love the relationships the characters have with each other. Again, I wish they could\'ve been dwelled on a bit more because there were some really beautiful moments in this anime. It would\'ve been heightened had the anime taken the time to develop the individual characters and their relationships to everyone before trying to shove in a meaningful scene. I did still cry though. So, it wasn\'t a total failure on their part. Just putting that out there.The music was simultaneously emotional and badass. The music that plays when the characters are running is either something that\'s jammin\' and that gets me hyped, or it\'s this one song that conveys all of this emotion that these characters are feeling. Both are really good, so I\'m very happy with the music in this anime. I don\'t usually talk about music in anime, so that tells you something.This anime doesn\'t deserve the flak it gets at all. Like, yeah, it should\'ve been stretched out and the story and characters should\'ve developed more smoothly instead of like ""BAM, take this thing we didn\'t explain properly before this!"" But at the same time, I had such a good time watching Prince of Stride: Alternative. If I\'d trusted some of the more negative reviews on here, I would\'ve missed out on a really good time. If you\'re super picky about a streamlined story, then don\'t bother, but if you just want to kick back with some funny characters and have a bit of a cry, then this anime is amazing! As far as pure enjoyment goes, this gets a 10/10, hands down.I actually really wish that this anime finds itself in another season. If they slow down the story pacing, I think these characters and this world has a lot of potential. Give this anime a go because it\'s honestly really awesome. look super washed out.

It was my favorite part of the show. With bright colors and more realistic looking characters, you could really see the story in HD. I can't watch animes with odd styles (it distracts me from the story and characters), so this was tailor made for me. I really loved the character design for Riku. On the other hand, Hozumi looked too much like Armin from 'Attack on Titan', and Takeru was practically Haru from 'Free!' If you're trying to prove the likeness to 'Free!', you've got it.Kuga and Heath's story was intriguing. They had a lot of backstory. And I loved...it. Their friendship and determination. The connection between the two. If anything, these two were 'connecting emotions', not anybody else. Throw in Hozumi's distrust and there's a hot pot of backstory.I described 'Prince of Stride: Alternative' as parkour on crack. Though, it's more like free running. Free running follows a more artistic approach compared to parkour. Parkour's goal is to get around as fast as you can. That's why they have wall climbs and whatnots. It's easier than walking around the wall. This anime has all the basics of parkour or free running with double the running. It's an obstacle course really. The first episode really caught my attention with the jumps and flips the runners did. It was exhilarating. Live vicariously, you know?Dislikes:Takeru, Nana, and Riku all knew each other. And all have connections to Stride. But act like they don't. When Nana and Riku meet in episode one, they acted like strangers, but they knew each other. I felt like the creators just threw in the promise at the end to make you feel more for the trio, but all it did was annoy me. It was a subplot that no one cared to expand on. The quick shots of fireworks on the beach meant nothing. If you're adding this in, at least give it some depth.The plot revolves around the End of Summer games. If you look closely, there is a lot of time between each round. A few days would be fine, but a week or more is insane. You're giving the revived Honan Stride Club too much credit. If they were that good, they'd have practiced before. Anyways, didn't the show start at the beginning of the school year? They had more than enough time to get ready for the End of Summer games. They didn't need all the between EOS games training. I get the emotional block for Riku, but everyone else was in tip-top shape. Or did we skip the training between the beginning of the school year and EOS?Nana kept saying that Stride is all about 'connecting feelings'. Can I just say that's a bunch of baloney? Stride is about stamina and skill and balance and timing and about everything but connecting feelings. I didn't know why they needed a Relationer anyways. They could have handed off batons or even just high fives each other. Why did they need the Relationer, and by default, Nana? I thought that the creators wanted a female (because all the runners are seemingly male) who didn't run because that would take away the need for Kuga or someone. So the Relationer job was born. Nana was highly useless and didn't even need to be in the anime for the show to go smoothly. If you're trying to add in a girl, do it successfully or not at all.And if we're talking about useless characters, take a good, long look at Ayumu. The cheerleader. He started out as a runner, but he ended up being a cheerleader and Hozumi's bae. (And that's another parallel to Free! Gay characters. Or, at least, fanon gay characters.) He had no use. I was getting tired of seeing him. Just take him out. Geez, is that so hard? it. Their friendship and determination. The connection between the two.

At the beginning you think the girl is gonna be the main character and she ends up being a secondary one. The story revolves around the two main boys and their drama. Mostly the blonde one (I can't even remember his name) and his inferiority complex with his brother. They participate in this competition of stride, which is some kind of parkour sport, and after they solve the inner turmoil of the blond one, we are surprised to find both guys and the girl were childhood friends and they had made the promise...of winning that competition. Not cliche at all.So, to sum it up, the whole story is one giant cliche after another. The sport looks interesting but the story is more focused on the boy and his brother.Art: 3/10I'm actually confused with the animation of this series. At some points the characters look nice, and others you just want to take your eyes out because they're completely out of proportion and in general terribly drawn.

It\'s not the best (it\'s pretty generic, actually) but it\'s a funny and exciting anime that you can watch mindlessly just to pass time. In other words, it\'s a sports anime.Like most sports anime, the story was not this anime\'s forte. A bunch of guys start a sports club in high school, participate in a tournament, fight and bond over some backstory drama and eventually win the tournament. This was just a summary of the entire plot of the series and anyone could have predicted this much based on the first episode alone, because this...plotline has been done to death. But in cases like this, the execution of the show is what makes all the difference, and the show had that part down. Running always makes things feel intense, so stride really fits the concept of this anime well. This kind of stories tends to be a safe bet, since there isn\'t much to mess up, so the story was predictable but good and well executed overall.This anime is a visual novel adaptation, so I expected the characters to be just tropes, with the main heroine having almost no characteristics and being used as a blank space for the viewers to insert themselves into. This wasn\'t exactly the case. The characters did fall into certain archetypes (sometimes to the extreme) but they had a little more depth to them and most characters could not be described in one sentence (at least not without using the word ""but""). But even though the characters still weren\'t great on their own, the interaction between them made the show a lot more fun to watch. The lighthearted shenanigans the characters did together were some of the funniest moments of the show and seeing them hang out with their rivals when they weren\'t racing was very refreshing. There was no actual villain in this show and it was really nice to see a truly friendly rivalry in an anime for a change. Also, the lack of romance actually benefited the show. It made the main heroine stand out a bit more as her own character and prevented the anime from becoming too cliched. There wasn\'t much character development in this anime, but when it comes to anime like this one, I\'m satisfied with what we got.The animation in this show was pretty average most of the time. It was very free-flowing during the races, which looked amazing and very intense. On the other hand, some frames were just plain bad sometimes. I did like the strong bright colors, the bold designs and the strong black outlines and shadows that made it look like the frames were inked by hand, but the animation wasn\'t a big standout overall.The soundtrack was very good, actually. It supported the show well while not standing out too much, which is what I expect of an anime soundtrack. It was very fitting for the show and gave off the right vibe. The opening and ending songs were very upbeat and catchy. The random english words in the opening were really out of place, but the song was still fun to listen to and I didn\'t skip it once. The ending theme is sung by the rival team (who are also idols, for some reason), I thought it was quite nice.The voice actors did a very good job portraying their characters and it sounded like they were having fun. The biggest standout, in my opinion, was Kana Hanazawa as Nana Sakurai. Her portray of Nana was so realistic and it sounded like she meant each and every line. This further contributed to making Nana stand out as her own character.To sum up: this anime might not have the best or the most original story, but the characters and the animation are decent. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, but still very satisfying. It was a very entertaining show to watch overall and if you\'re looking for an anime to watch mindlessly when you\'re bored, I recommend checking it out if you have the time. plotline has been done to death.

This wasn\'t exactly the case. The characters did fall into certain archetypes (sometimes to the extreme) but they had a little more depth to them and most characters could not be described in one sentence (at least not without using the word ""but""). But even though the characters still weren\'t great on their own, the interaction between them made the show a lot more fun to watch. The lighthearted shenanigans the characters did together were some of the funniest moments of the show and seeing them hang out with their rivals when they weren\'t racing was very refreshing. There was no actual villain in this show and it was really nice to see a truly friendly rivalry in an anime for a change. Also, the lack of romance actually benefited the show. It made the main heroine stand out a bit more as her own character and prevented the anime from becoming too cliched. There wasn\'t much character development in this anime, but when it comes to anime like this one, I\'m satisfied with what we got.The animation in this show was pretty average most of the time. It was very free-flowing during the races, which looked amazing and very intense. On the other hand, some frames were just plain bad sometimes. I did like the strong bright colors, the bold designs and the strong black outlines and shadows that made it look like the frames were inked by hand, but the animation wasn\'t a big standout overall.The soundtrack was very good, actually. It supported the show well while not standing out too much, which is what I expect of an anime soundtrack. It was very fitting for the show and gave off the right vibe. The opening and ending songs were very upbeat and catchy. The random english words in the opening were really out of place, but the song was still fun to listen to and I didn\'t skip it once. The ending theme is sung by the rival team (who are also idols, for some reason), I thought it was quite nice.The voice actors did a very good job portraying their characters and it sounded like they were having fun. The biggest standout, in my opinion, was Kana Hanazawa as Nana Sakurai. Her portray of Nana was so realistic and it sounded like she meant each and every line. This further contributed to making Nana stand out as her own character.To sum up: this anime might not have the best or the most original story, but the characters and the animation are decent. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, but still very satisfying. It was a very entertaining show to watch overall and if you\'re looking for an anime to watch mindlessly when you\'re bored, I recommend checking it out if you have the time.', ""Prince of Stride talks about a very original sport to the anime world, different from the common volleyball/basket/baseball, but let's give it a look to each of its parts:Plot [5]Well, when we talk about plot in a spokon we don't really have to think to something too complicated since it usually follows the standard of a team competing in a tournament and this show doesn't make an exception, so why have i considered this plot a bad one?There were some episodes which could have been deleted and none would have noticed that, or better, they could have payed less attention to some events...and more to some others.Also, the final was something unwatchable but i won't spoil it.Characters [2]Characters were the thing i hated the most about this series, they were flat as hell and never changed their behaviour throughout the series, Sakurai Nana is the biggest example of this problem but also the main character was the same.One of the few, if not the only one, thing i liked about characters is that supporter characters weren't forgotten, any character will play an important role in almost every episode but..yes, since they were so badly developed i didn't consider this as a remarkable thing.I blame this point to Prince of Stride because i think in a spokon characters are always the most important thing to make well and this anime failed overall in this.Art [7]Madhouse did a nice job with Prince of Stride, the competitions were well represented by the direction. The thing i didn't like much was the chara design.Sound [7]Also here we have a good technical equipment with a very energic opening and some very good OSTs which were one of the thing that made me enjoy this anime a bit more, the bad side is that we miss good ones for the common events but competitions won't miss them at all.Enjoyment [6]I won't say Prince of Stride was horrible, i followed it without any problems but, as i said above, characters are the thing i care the most in sports animes and because of the poor development i couldn't relate to any of them nor make any of them like to me so i felt like they were acting just because they had too, for that reason i didn't enjoy it very much.Overall [5]As a conclusion, this anime is something you can skip without any problem but if you really like spokons then try to take a look at it since it also talks about a very uncommon sport that is new to the anime world, just don't expect any kind of deep plot/characters because you won't find them here and more to some others.Also, the final was something unwatchable but i won't spoil it.Characters [2]Characters were the thing i hated the most about this series, they were flat as hell and never changed their behaviour throughout the series, Sakurai Nana is the biggest example of this problem but also the main character was the same.One of the few, if not the only one, thing i liked about characters is that supporter characters weren't forgotten, any character will play an important role in almost every episode but..yes, since they were so badly developed i didn't consider this as a remarkable thing.I blame this point to Prince of Stride because i think in a spokon characters are always the most important thing to make well and this anime failed overall in this.Art [7]Madhouse did a nice job with Prince of Stride, the competitions were well represented by the direction.

The art style looked amazing, but I didn\'t have time to watch it back then (I think it was around the time when it just aired). Then my friend asked me if I saw it yet, the answer was obvious.I finally got around to watch it yesterday. The art style didn\'t dissapoint me at all, went past my imagination even. The characters seemed so lovable and relatable to me. I know that Riku\'s struggle with his self esteem was a widely discussed theme her, but I can see why. He was against...joining their club the second he found out what club it was. I sure would have complained if the reason wasn\'t explained. His low self-esteem is also justifiable. As the younger sibling, I can relate, the non-stopping strive(or stride if somebody wants to insert a pun here) to be better or at least as good as your older sibling. It is very hard to best your older sibling at anything, beacause they have more experience, especially in something they enjoy doing. Besides, that is usually called character development that thankfully happened in this anime.I also have to say that it was well paced. There were no boring parts as well as not those that went by too fast.I am content saying that I watched this anime in two days with a break for sleep. In my eyes, it really deserves recognition, because I have the tendency to drop the anime I am watching midway (or just after a watching session), then come back to it a few months later or forget about it. This anime made me want to watch each episode, not in the style of ""I want to just finish this"", but ""I really want to see it"". My rating for this anime is 10/10. joining their club the second he found out what club it was. I sure would have complained if the reason wasn\'t explained. His low self-esteem is also justifiable.

My rating for this anime is 10/10.', 'I will admit, even though I don\'t watch a lot of sport-related animes, I\'m extremely glad I decided to sit down for a bit and watch Prince of Stride and I\'ll share why I enjoyed it so much. Just a warning, some minor spoilers may exist below, but nothing that will ruin the anime for you or give away any major plot points.To start, one of the weakest parts of Prince of Stride is the story. While I\'m not saying that its bad, it leaves a lot to be desired and is overall somewhat predictable when comparing it to other animes, regardless of...genre. The Honan Stride club, the main group in the story, is a struggling team with dreams of becoming the best stride team, but of course, they lack members and talent. As the series progresses, they gain more members and each character has their own set of problems that ""prevent"" the team from truly coming together and conquering the other teams, which all gradually get resolved throughout the story. As said, it is rather predictable, but it is rather rewarding to see the team eventually come together to race together.Speaking of the characters, one of the best parts of the anime is the characters, specifically the main group, which all receive their own satisfying development, something that was rather surprising for me as I went in fully expecting each character to be rather shallow cutouts of a specific anime trope. On the contrary, each one manages to showcase rounded personalities, especially Hozumi Kohinata, Ayumu Kadowaki, and Riku Yagami, who are able to carry the anime on their narratives alone. The only real exception to this is Takeru Fujiwara, who stays rather the same throughout but is still enjoyable to watch.It was also interesting how each character\'s struggles felt relatable. Feeling like you\'re inferior, living in someone\'s shadow, showing jealousy, being vengeful, conquering your own fears, and defying expectations are just a few of the problems that these characters encounter. It becomes enthralling to see how these problems persist throughout the anime and how the characters are able to take their own struggles and turn them into strengths.As for the music, this anime has both beautiful and intense music mixed together for an all around great listening experience. I\'m gonna be honest and say that the music in the background during the races actually made my heart pump, as I was in suspense waiting to find out who was going to end up winning. The opening and ending are also great and fit the tone of the show perfectly.The art flows well, and while there are some repeated frames during the races, nothing sticks out badly and everything seems to fit in perfectly. The art is also crisp, and nothing is stiff or looks badly, especially with the vibrant world around them.The only real complaint I have about the anime is the second half of episodes compared to the first. The first few episodes have this intense atmosphere about them that really seems to die down near the second half of the series, especially the ending, but no spoilers here.Overall though, the anime was thorougly enjoyable and if you want a consistent story with relatable characters, especially if you\'re a fan of sport-related animes, then you should definitely give Prince of Stride: Alternative a watch. genre.

Personally I thought it was a good anime. So normally sports anime over exaggerate the sport and how people feel about it and this one was no exception. They made the high five seem like the biggest deal ever like it was all about connecting feelings which it was just it was a little too dramatic. The characters in this story were nice. I love how they didn't make a fussy little female mc like they normally are. She was...always trying to improve herself for the team, but it wasn't to the point where you would want to slap her in the face.Art- It was pretty good. It was colorful and bright and it set the mood of the anime really well.Story- I think they kept Riku's whole internal struggle going on too long. It was like they were using it as an excuse every time they got into a fight which was a little annoying.Sound- It wasn't that noteworthy, not really good but not really bad either it was just kinda average.Character- It had nice character development in the end anyways. They really grow up and finally Riku accepts all the hard facts and everyone has a nice ending/Overall- I loved the ending since they tied it up. All the popular anime try to keep you hooked by saying 'oh no we lost lets have another chance in the second season *wink wink* you should watch it and see if they win' this one they were just like ok this is this. It's the end. I read online too that this anime was actually a dating sim and normally anime based off of dating sims are super annoying since the mc is obnoxious af, but this one was focused more on the actual team, the players, and the sport and less about them all dying for her attention which was good for me anyways. So basically this anime had good humor, good characters, nice pacing, and decent art. If you like sports anime that they don't forcibly drag out and you can deal with the losses and internal struggles you'll probably like it.That's all thanks for reading ^~^ always trying to improve herself for the team, but it wasn't to the point where you would want to slap her in the face.Art- It was pretty good.

Initially I didn't want to watch it but I was kind of forced to and actually enjoyed the first episode but as I was going along with it, then, well, the every hole starts to pop out.Story (6): Fair enough the story of Stride is pretty decent. It's your typical friendship through sports sort of show. Unfortunately, it's trying to show some sort of fanservice, with beautiful men and amazing legs. I dunno. The saving grace of the story would have to be its random bursts of...comedy and recurring gags. The friendships were cute too but it didn't make me burst to tears or wipe away any snot from my nose. Sports anime should be riveting through its story. This didn't make it happen.Art (8): The art is definitely the reason why this show makes quite the impact.  It's beautiful, colorful with hints of cool tones and how can you not like beautiful bishie boys. The stride animations, the running and the tricks were pretty solid and I think that they pushed to make it at least work in order for it to be appealing to sports fans.Sound (6): If we're talking voice actors, this show is peppered with all of my favorite seiyuus... Well, I LOOOOVE ALL OF THEM! But it was the only thing that was memorable. I don't remember the background music. SFX didn't seem to be a huge deal and I'd skip the OP and ED, though the OP is kind of nice.Character (7): The characters of this show are weird. Dedicated to their sport though and bloody entertaining, Ayumu and Kohinata. You know what? The reason I even finished this show was because of these two adorable cuties. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have survived it. It's either I'll drop it or give it a really low score. But yeah. Like I said, there's so many seiyuus in this and so there are tooooons of characters because teams. you know. but they don't necessarily leave a mark. I'd be screaming when I hear a character speak because their seiyuus are my fave but other than that, I'd be disappointed by how little they actually got to do. They couldn't leave a proper impact.Enjoyment (6): There were moments were I would enjoy the show and then skip to certain parts. It's such a waste of time to be honest, so just skip some of the parts. I only enjoyed the running parts and the Ayumu x Kohinata duo but more than that, I'd say, it's a pretty shallow show.Overall (6): I think I've rated this pretty fairly. It was okay. Maybe you'd still like it. Personally, I didn't like it as a whole but there are bits and pieces that worked for me so I survived. comedy and recurring gags.

It fits right in with all the others like it, but that\'s not a bad thing.While the story is like any other sports series where we focus on the team practicing and getting into drama amongst each other, the concept of the sport is unique. If anyone realized already, ""Stride"" is a fictional sport (a mixture of relay and parkour). One of the more positive things I can say about the show is the execution of the sport, which is also its strong point.Other than that, the backstory and drama has been done...before, but it still fits in this case. Though, I will say some of these recycled plot elements felt like they are added there only to get emotion from the viewers. One in particular (which I will refrain from mentioning), brought onto us during the last few episodes, gave me that notion. Also, the series suffered from a rushed ending that had not much of an impact that it could have had.For characters, I could only vouch for the Honan team (our main set of characters), because they are the ones we focus on the most. We also get their backstories, why they are on the team, as well as their personalities. Their opponents, not so much, save for one that appears more than the others.The animation, at best, is adequate. It might come as a shock to many when they see that this is a Madhouse production. Still, I will not point fingers for not making the greatest animation (there\'s at least one with every studio). However, much like how the races are the strong point of the story, it is the same in regards to the animation.In the end, like I said before, the series doesn\'t really stand out, even amongst all the other sports anime out there. Again, this doesn\'t make it a bad series, nor does it make it a good one. Despite that, I would still recommend this to people who are into sports anime.

The sport is running in the streets like a quasi-stunt person in a relay style, with perfectly timed “passing of the baton” communicated by a Relationer.The art style:It’s borderline blinding but makes the sport itself cooler by a factor of 100. As edgy as it may look, it puts the show into a “this is ridiculous and can’t be taken seriously” territory.The characters:I guess a huge plus is that none of the characters seem to have annoying tendencies, but these characters can be summed up fairly easily too: they seem nice. With the rushed backstory and introductions,...it can’t be helped that they feel one dimensional.The story:We have teams that run in a relay fashion with a Relationer that ultimately connects each of them. However the basics and techniques of the sport are never explained. I appreciate that the show tried to add some soul into running, but then it’s weak writing from there. For example, when we learn the reason why Kyosuke lost the right to be a member of the Stride club and his dark past- the reason was lame. This was made worse when it took like five minutes of the episode for Heath to man up, to give a supposedly deep speech, and for Kyosuke to join the club again. Zero tension built. I didn't even have time to be sad, haha.The runs:Only the two main characters have characteristic running styles, but everyone else? They. just. run.The music:The music score is comparable to elevator music- without it there would probably be some very awkward silences and even drier conversations.Overall:Despite all I’ve said, I realize this was adapted from a game so expectations must be low. Is it totally watchable? Yes, yes it is. I can see this as something for guilty pleasure. I mean if the guys and nice/easy music are what you like- then whatever makes your fries crisp! That’s probably enough of a reason to watch, cause why not! it can’t be helped that they feel one dimensional.The story:We have teams that run in a relay fashion with a Relationer that ultimately connects each of them.

Or, more specifically, a relay race involving five people, combined with parkour and obsactles through various enviroments.Story;3Strides story is a simple one, three people meet on the first day of high school. Two, with the intention of joining the renowned Honan High Stride club, and one who was forced into joining. These three are our stories main characters, and throughout the 12 episodes of this series, we see them grow as athletes, as people, and as friends. EXTRA emphasis on the friend bit. Advancing this group\'s friendship is a massive part of the story....as they work to their goal of winning the renown ""End Of Summer"" tournament. On their journey the race many times, getting just a little bit better every run. now if I made it sound better than I rated it, here\'s why. Strides story is ONLY what I said, there\'s not much to it. Race, get rivals, get better, repeat. And every god damn episode they spend half the time talking either about Yagami\'s (the character who was forced into it) brother who is the king of high school stride, friendship, or running. While all of these plot points are what drive the characters, it gets a bit too repetitive.Art:7it looks decent usually, which is 75% of the show. But, when stride kicks in the art gets quite good, not amazing stuff but it took time and effort to make all of those complicated race courses, tracking shots, and a seemingly 3D environment. You can tell that plenty of time was spent animating this show, and none of it spared by CG characters. The character design is, well its good but its very cliche. however, it does fit the character types they set out, and everything looks pretty good so no real complaints here.Sound:4The opening was... well it was pretty good and got the tone set for the show well, but the use of English was. Interesting to say the least, and i found it kinda broke the mood of what\'s actually a pretty good op. Background tracks, none of them really stood out to me, I didn\'t actually notice them there to be honest, which is a good thing! They blend in well and didn\'t break immersion. Actions scene tracks, there was one particular one that when listened to actually brings back the emotions of the show with it. which I consider to be a success in a musical sense. The ending track, it had a good groovy feel to it and showcased everyone\'s favorite rivals, Saisei High. The track had stylish animation to boot, and I would listen to it again.Characters:3Like I said previously the characters a VERY cliche. You\'ve got your upbeat comedy relief duo who are more emotional than they show of nerd in glasses and a girly boy. A manly captain who cares more for his team than he lets on. Your long haired mysterious cool guy alumni that talks about the wind constantly. Your overly cheerful girl who always says Ganbare! And tries her best to ""keep up."" Then your have your two main characters, the competitive rivals that get better because of each other. All very cliche and not much in the unique department is shown here.Enjoyment:6Now while I wasn\'t a fan of most of the stuff this series did, and admittedly, I texted through half of it. But when everyone was running at their best, I\'ll admit I couldn\'t take my eyes off the screen. While the concept is unique, everything that was stride was just blah. But if you\'re into shows that showcase nice animation and rivalries, I actually think its worth a try.Overall:5I kinda already did an overall in my enjoyment sections. But I think that I liked this show, even though I hate super cliche shows like this it wasn\'t THAT bad. give it a shot, but be warned, the show gives off some pretty god damn gay vibes. be careful.With that i end my review, i hope i helped in some way on whether or not you decide to watch Stride. Thanks for reading if you got down this far and sorry for it being so long! as they work to their goal of winning the renown ""End Of Summer"" tournament.

And every god damn episode they spend half the time talking either about Yagami\'s (the character who was forced into it) brother who is the king of high school stride, friendship, or running. While all of these plot points are what drive the characters, it gets a bit too repetitive.Art:7it looks decent usually, which is 75% of the show. But, when stride kicks in the art gets quite good, not amazing stuff but it took time and effort to make all of those complicated race courses, tracking shots, and a seemingly 3D environment. You can tell that plenty of time was spent animating this show, and none of it spared by CG characters. The character design is, well its good but its very cliche. however, it does fit the character types they set out, and everything looks pretty good so no real complaints here.Sound:4The opening was... well it was pretty good and got the tone set for the show well, but the use of English was. Interesting to say the least, and i found it kinda broke the mood of what\'s actually a pretty good op. Background tracks, none of them really stood out to me, I didn\'t actually notice them there to be honest, which is a good thing! They blend in well and didn\'t break immersion. Actions scene tracks, there was one particular one that when listened to actually brings back the emotions of the show with it. which I consider to be a success in a musical sense. The ending track, it had a good groovy feel to it and showcased everyone\'s favorite rivals, Saisei High. The track had stylish animation to boot, and I would listen to it again.Characters:3Like I said previously the characters a VERY cliche. You\'ve got your upbeat comedy relief duo who are more emotional than they show of nerd in glasses and a girly boy. A manly captain who cares more for his team than he lets on. Your long haired mysterious cool guy alumni that talks about the wind constantly. Your overly cheerful girl who always says Ganbare! And tries her best to ""keep up."" Then your have your two main characters, the competitive rivals that get better because of each other. All very cliche and not much in the unique department is shown here.Enjoyment:6Now while I wasn\'t a fan of most of the stuff this series did, and admittedly, I texted through half of it. But when everyone was running at their best, I\'ll admit I couldn\'t take my eyes off the screen. While the concept is unique, everything that was stride was just blah. But if you\'re into shows that showcase nice animation and rivalries, I actually think its worth a try.Overall:5I kinda already did an overall in my enjoyment sections. But I think that I liked this show, even though I hate super cliche shows like this it wasn\'t THAT bad. give it a shot, but be warned, the show gives off some pretty god damn gay vibes. be careful.With that i end my review, i hope i helped in some way on whether or not you decide to watch Stride. Thanks for reading if you got down this far and sorry for it being so long!', 'Prince of Stride: Alternative is an anime produced by Madhouse and was released in Winter of 2016 with 12 episodes. The premise is about Takeru Fujiwara voiced by \'\'Nobuhiko Okamoto\'\' and Nana Sakurai voiced by \'\'Kana Hanazawa\'\' trying to recruit members to their Stride Club of Honan Academy. What is Stride?, it\'s an extreme form of running and parkour involving 6 runners running relays throughout the town. Takeru and Nana request help from Riku Yagami voiced by \'\'Ryouhei Kimura\'\' to compete in the ""End of Summer"", thee top school competition for Stride in Japan. This anime adaptation is based off an otome visual novel and...it shows!.Now LA will note immediately that LA isn\'t much of an anime sports fan, LA goes with some of the more ""irregular"" ones such as \'\'Saki\'\' or \'\'Walkure Romanze\'\' though LA watched \'\'Free!\'\' and it\'s second season. What a person who doesn\'t look at sports anime looking at Prince of Stride?, well there was one element that LA gotten into to watch the entire series but that will be for later.The plot by all means is a typical ""underdog"" team with the goal to win a huge competition, from the asshole teams to the friendly rival teams they meet in one or two episodes to bringing us the team dynamic of the main cast from some of the team member\'s past and backstories to their own ""character development"" episodes are there, how they USE it however is actually an entirely different matter. LA says this as although it is focused and \'\'dramatized\'\' when it NEEDS to, the story does tend to fluff around during the middle of it and resolves \'\'some\'\' obstacles as quickly as the episode ends sometimes leaving no room for development. Ohh sure the entire main cast of Honan Academy gets focused and developed hugely both as a team and individually but by the near ending (for LA) you tend forget even some of the main characters NAMES and why they are there besides ""winning the competition"" as ""they are in the team so of course they have to participate"", but LA gets it, it\'s about the team...and three of your main characters, but the team nonetheless.Well LA is rambling on, let\'s actually move to the characters. The characters are by in large feels like an otome visual novel characters just mixed in with the typical characters you usually see in a sports anime. LA won\'t fault this anime for trying something like this and for the characters who get the most development get to be the most memorable thus Nana, Takeru and Riku are seriously the only characters LA remembered by the end of the anime as for the rival school characters?, besides the one or two that really matter to drive the plot forward, you\'ll forgot about most of them due to either the huge cast of characters as a whole for this series or the lack of ANY development outside their likes and quirks.Well you want to know why LA wanted to watch this anime all the way through?, the animation and to be more precise the animation when it goes into a match, that is the main reason why LA watched it, typical of Madhouse to make even running both fluid and exhilarating at the same time and LA loved watching it merely for that, on speaking of the animation, the character designs do look slick and fits into consistency when it needs to although some of it\'s animation do get slightly lower quality at times.The ending actually felt lackluster and again LA will say that word again ""typical"" and what\'s worse is that considering that the match in question is built up so much, the ending result although heartwarming didn\'t leave the same as when LA first started getting into the Stride matches, what\'s the word ""rushed?"" is best. This anime does have some pacing (drum beat) issues from handling the drama when it occurred to just having filler episodes here and there, sure at least the comedy is the typical running gags from the main cast, but LA got bored from all the development, drama and filler shove into the anime and just wanted what the anime\'s focus was...the god damn Stride matches.Overall, this sports anime DID still entertain LA, it has it\'s faults and some faults were actually a GOOD thing (heck we all need character development and drama for the characters and plot no?) but La will say this about \'\'Prince of Stride\'\', if ya want to see an otome-ished typical sports anime involving running and parkour with Madhouse\'s animation, then this anime is something to run for, if not...best to walk this one out. it shows!.Now LA will note immediately that LA isn\'t much of an anime sports fan, LA goes with some of the more ""irregular"" ones such as \'\'Saki\'\' or \'\'Walkure Romanze\'\' though LA watched \'\'Free!\'\' and it\'s second season.

My friend suggested this to me, and it even exceeded his expectations. I refused to watch it at first, one because I thought it was yaoi, two because sports anime is specifically the one genre I haven't watched. That should tell you how good it was. I didn't refuse to watch it at first because of the trivial reason other people did, the people who gave it low ratings are just being oppositional. The music was was upbeat, it made me feel the determination of the characters. The opening was good...as well. The art was good, only complaint is how thin the characters were. I felt a connection with each individual characters, I rooted for all of them in overcoming their struggles throughout the anime.I think the opposite of all the haters of this anime on another thing too. They said the first few episodes were good, then they gave up because it became boring. That means they didn't even watch it all the way through, and gave up when a boring part appeared. I thought the reverse, the first few were slow and from about ep 6 on were perfect. After episode 6 I binged it, planning on changing to another anime by ep 8.I loved this anime, I am glad it was my first sports anime. This might be the thing that leads me to watch Haikyuu, and Free! I mean, I don't know about Free! Looks too yoai for me. as well. The art was good, only complaint is how thin the characters were.

Although it may seem that the characters may be a bit flat, and that this sort of sport anime has already been done, it is good to enjoy nonetheless. The combination of track and parkour is actually very interesting. I didn't expect a sport like that to be created! Additionally, the characters are lovable in their own way, even if they are just stereotypes/tv tropes. What gives them their uniqueness is how they treat their sport and running styles. Although the animation is not top quality, the art is very bright and colorful....I would definitely see this as a TV show being aired somewhere, and if you're not nitpicky on what to watch, stick with an episode or three and see how you like it.

If you\'re a sports anime fan, you\'re probably used to all the cliches and have seen them a million times in all sorts of different sports anime, well let me tell you, Prince of Stride: Alternative was no different. It uses almost every cliche in the book. Not in an oh-this-is-kinda-refreshing way but in a haven\'t-I-see-this-a-million-times-? sort of way. Honestly. However, the title doesn\'t lie when it says \'alternative\'. Prince of Stride is an anime centered around a COMPLETELY FICTIONAL and MADE UP sport, throwing any chance of being compared with an anime about...the same sport out of the window. Now that\'s novelty. I personally had high hopes in - only - this aspect of the anime; after all, how often do you get an anime that invents a sport completely for itself? The execution of the races themselves were actually acceptable (I\'ll go into detail in the enjoyment section) but I think the producers missed a teeny-tiny detail: If you\'re going to invent a sport, how the hell do you expect the viewers to know what it is?! I just binged all 12 episodes of the anime and I quite frankly still don\'t know the rules or point system of the sport. Heck, I didn\'t even know if there was a point system (A character mentioned \'extra points\' but I didn\'t even know there was a point system in the first place! and it was never even mentioned again. Unless they meant it metaphorically but reeeaaallly now). Okay, like I said before, the idea of a completely new sport was what made me watch Stride and I believe that with more time to elaborate (I would suggest between doubling the number of episodes or even doing that and making another season on top of it by splitting the content in the first season up), it could have been a masterpiece and could maybe even have made it all the way up to Kuroko no Basuke and Haikyuu. But unfortunately, that\'s what they lacked: elaboration. One more new-ish feature in the anime is that it dives straight in to the thick of the plot and you can tell they didn\'t mean to do it when the timeline was planned out. It starts with the typical fallen club looking for members - the show decided to give less than an episode\'s worth of screen time to this but that was okay. What I mean is that there\'s practically no training. Well at least at the start, it plunges straight into the plot because what the hell\'s practice anyway and instead, puts it\'s practice into the second half of the plot, instantly killing the albeit forced momentum gathered by the dive at the start. I felt like the halfway point actually killed my excitement for the show. But that\'s enough of my ranting about the story.Art - 4So the art. Nothing special. Looked like a cheap reverse harem anime (sorry!), to be perfectly honest. The style was bland and the characters lacked the realism that sometimes carries appeal (refer to any sports anime where everyone doesn\'t have idol-group hair). The background art was as plain as can be, especially when they should\'ve had a lot of freedom in developing the settings because of the nature of the sport used in the show. In quite a few ways, the style for the characters reminded me painfully of an extremely washed out version of Free (refer to characters section). To be perfectly honest, I can only say that it didn\'t stand out as anything special like Doukyuusei, it didn\'t have amazingly drawn and choreographed action scenes like Haikyuu and it wasn\'t plain but enjoyable like Kuroko no Basuke. In short: It\'s bland. Probably like what it feels like to eat a tissue (don\'t question it). The best part of Stride\'s art is its action scenes, and even those sometimes don\'t really hit the spot.Sound - 4The voice actors were actually decent although they didn\'t really strike me as anything special. The soundtrack, like the background art, is just kinda bland. The opening was actually catchy and I quite liked it and the song, along with some of the other soundtracks, fulfilled their purpose of getting the viewer pumped up (I guess). The sound was not at all memorable (I can\'t remember any of the songs, including the opening) and they don\'t leave an impression, and there are even parts where I felt that a good OST would have boosted the scene by miles but it just wasn\'t really like... I don\'t know... Just kinda mediocre I guess? As a sports anime fan, I love soundtracks that really get your blood pumping as you watch your team score that point; or kick that goal; or shoot that hoop. But this just... I don\'t know... I was pumped sometimes but I don\'t give credit to the soundtrack or voices for that.Characters - 2Okay. I feel mean but at the same time I just couldn\'t being myself to rate this section any higher. I, however, don\'t blame it on the character designs (although I didn\'t like those too much) but on the lack of time instead. There just simply isn\'t enough time in the space of 12 measly episodes to make viewers become attached to characters. Of course, this anime just used the usual cliches: the forced crossdresser, the reluctant one, the emotionless genius and the emotionally unstable in the character you\'d ""least expect"" but I was sooo annoyed at some of the characters plainly because I felt like they could\'ve been better. I didn\'t understand the logic more than half the time and sometimes I even caught myself thinking: ""What could possibly possess a person to (insert whatever this rant is about)?!"" A bunch of family members do pretty confusing things and the character\'s reactions sometimes JUST DON\'T MAKE SENSE. There\'s a lot of forced bonding and friendships that only feel that way because they didn\'t get sufficient time to develop. None of the characters got a satisfactory backstory so in the end, instead of having one or two likable and developed characters, we end up with about 25 odd bland, shallow, uninteresting and unrelatable characters. Now onto character designs in terms of art: they all had weird hair was my first thought. Second thought: Wait... Didn\'t I just see this character?? But anyways, to be honest, I felt like they ran out of character design ideas because of all the replicas I seemed to see where ever I looked. Actually... Wait a sec... Maybe everyone was a twin... Dun, dun, dun! Oh wait a sec... There was a pair of ACTUAL TWINS. But anyways, like I said, the art was bland and this didn\'t exactly affect the characters in a good way. In many ways, the characters were quite obviously made in a feeble attempt to appeal to the female audience, with the cute neko boy, the long haired stoic one, the emo kid, the glasses dude. Just generic. for those that enjoy shipping, there really isn\'t much inspiration and there are technically ships but they feel forced. But yes: lacking develop and design creativity. Any humour also falls so flat I don\'t even know. I hardly even smiled throughout the whole duration of the series, the jokes weren\'t bad they were just kinda like: Oh, that was a joke? Okay..?Enjoyment - 7Okay, to tell the truth, despite all the technical and story faults in this anime, I did legitimately enjoy it at some point; maybe I wasn\'t exactly in paradise most of the time, but there were still times when I had liked the show when watching it. This is where I say: I reckon this section of my review would be biased. So basically, I\'m in high school and I run in competitive track events - 100 m, 200 m, relay and 3000 m. Do we get it? The thing is, there\'s a high possibility that my enjoyment of the show stems from having some sports background to connect with the characters. To tell the truth, the reason I enjoyed the show as much as I did were the races. It certainly wasn\'t a mistake to invent this sport because I was sweating when they were running and I was trembling as well as I heard the \'go\' being said. For me, this really reminded me of all the \'ready, set, BAM\'s I\'ve heard during my own races and I was SO PUMPED UP after watching the races. The show is a majority of tournaments so if that\'s what you feel like - a show where you don\'t really pay attention to the characters but it would get your blood pumping like in a real race, then this wouldn\'t be a bad choice as most sports anime focus on the characters more so that you grow attached to them and because of the characters, it gets you pumping. Other thing with Stride: I didn\'t have any worries about who would win. I usually always have a team/s but this time, I didn\'t feel frustrated no matter which team won because I just loved the races themselves (and because I could hardly remember the names of everyone because of the lack of character development). But a warning, the first races will probably be adrenaline full but the novelty of watching a fictional sport soon wears out when they put the training and stuff in the second half. This actually really ruined my enjoyment of the show because the second half was all about fitting in training that they didn\'t seem to need at the start of the show and character development that couldn\'t have been more forced, pointless, or fallen more flat. But my enjoyment of the races was still there and I wouldn\'t say no to re-watching the anime if a friend wants to watch it with me, just so I could feel that rush as I watch the races.Overall - 4This anime was... Okay? I guess the characters sucked, the art was mediocre, the soundtrack was anything but outstanding and the story was poor. In the end, I gave this show a \'decent\' overall score because of the novelty of the sport and because of my enjoyment of the races.Recommendation rate - 3It really depends on who it is. I would love to recommend it to people who have a track background and like sports anime, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone who doesn\'t have a prior connection to elements in Stride. I wouldn\'t recommend it to modern sports anime fans where the characters really take the main focus of the viewer\'s attention. So... If you\'re wanting to watch something \'alternative\' and sporty, I guess it wouldn\'t kill anyone to watch this if you are desperate for a sports anime, but, take it from me, this is no masterpiece. But I definitely recommend watching some clips of the races beforehand (don\'t watch spoilers!) so you can get an idea of how much you like them (I had previously dropped this anime after not even finishing episode one, which means I didn\'t get to see a race, but then I watched an AMV and I thought, this looks really good, so I gave it a second try), if you thought, this is really cool! Then watch the anime. If you watched some of the races and thought: meh, this is fine. Then don\'t watch it. Because again, the races are really the redeeming feature of this show, the characters and the story aren\'t gonna boost it but actually drag it down so... Yeah.If you\'re gonna watch it, have fun! If you decided it\'s not your thing, well good luck in your pursuit of another good sports anime! Thanks for reading my review ;) the same sport out of the window. Now that\'s novelty. I personally had high hopes in - only - this aspect of the anime; after all, how often do you get an anime that invents a sport completely for itself? The execution of the races themselves were actually acceptable (I\'ll go into detail in the enjoyment section) but I think the producers missed a teeny-tiny detail: If you\'re going to invent a sport, how the hell do you expect the viewers to know what it is?! I just binged all 12 episodes of the anime and I quite frankly still don\'t know the rules or point system of the sport. Heck, I didn\'t even know if there was a point system (A character mentioned \'extra points\' but I didn\'t even know there was a point system in the first place! and it was never even mentioned again. Unless they meant it metaphorically but reeeaaallly now). Okay, like I said before, the idea of a completely new sport was what made me watch Stride and I believe that with more time to elaborate (I would suggest between doubling the number of episodes or even doing that and making another season on top of it by splitting the content in the first season up), it could have been a masterpiece and could maybe even have made it all the way up to Kuroko no Basuke and Haikyuu. But unfortunately, that\'s what they lacked: elaboration. One more new-ish feature in the anime is that it dives straight in to the thick of the plot and you can tell they didn\'t mean to do it when the timeline was planned out. It starts with the typical fallen club looking for members - the show decided to give less than an episode\'s worth of screen time to this but that was okay. What I mean is that there\'s practically no training. Well at least at the start, it plunges straight into the plot because what the hell\'s practice anyway and instead, puts it\'s practice into the second half of the plot, instantly killing the albeit forced momentum gathered by the dive at the start. I felt like the halfway point actually killed my excitement for the show. But that\'s enough of my ranting about the story.Art - 4So the art. Nothing special. Looked like a cheap reverse harem anime (sorry!), to be perfectly honest. The style was bland and the characters lacked the realism that sometimes carries appeal (refer to any sports anime where everyone doesn\'t have idol-group hair). The background art was as plain as can be, especially when they should\'ve had a lot of freedom in developing the settings because of the nature of the sport used in the show. In quite a few ways, the style for the characters reminded me painfully of an extremely washed out version of Free (refer to characters section). To be perfectly honest, I can only say that it didn\'t stand out as anything special like Doukyuusei, it didn\'t have amazingly drawn and choreographed action scenes like Haikyuu and it wasn\'t plain but enjoyable like Kuroko no Basuke. In short: It\'s bland. Probably like what it feels like to eat a tissue (don\'t question it). The best part of Stride\'s art is its action scenes, and even those sometimes don\'t really hit the spot.Sound - 4The voice actors were actually decent although they didn\'t really strike me as anything special. The soundtrack, like the background art, is just kinda bland. The opening was actually catchy and I quite liked it and the song, along with some of the other soundtracks, fulfilled their purpose of getting the viewer pumped up (I guess). The sound was not at all memorable (I can\'t remember any of the songs, including the opening) and they don\'t leave an impression, and there are even parts where I felt that a good OST would have boosted the scene by miles but it just wasn\'t really like... I don\'t know... Just kinda mediocre I guess? As a sports anime fan, I love soundtracks that really get your blood pumping as you watch your team score that point; or kick that goal; or shoot that hoop. But this just... I don\'t know... I was pumped sometimes but I don\'t give credit to the soundtrack or voices for that.Characters - 2Okay. I feel mean but at the same time I just couldn\'t being myself to rate this section any higher. I, however, don\'t blame it on the character designs (although I didn\'t like those too much) but on the lack of time instead. There just simply isn\'t enough time in the space of 12 measly episodes to make viewers become attached to characters. Of course, this anime just used the usual cliches: the forced crossdresser, the reluctant one, the emotionless genius and the emotionally unstable in the character you\'d ""least expect"" but I was sooo annoyed at some of the characters plainly because I felt like they could\'ve been better. I didn\'t understand the logic more than half the time and sometimes I even caught myself thinking: ""What could possibly possess a person to (insert whatever this rant is about)?!"" A bunch of family members do pretty confusing things and the character\'s reactions sometimes JUST DON\'T MAKE SENSE. There\'s a lot of forced bonding and friendships that only feel that way because they didn\'t get sufficient time to develop. None of the characters got a satisfactory backstory so in the end, instead of having one or two likable and developed characters, we end up with about 25 odd bland, shallow, uninteresting and unrelatable characters. Now onto character designs in terms of art: they all had weird hair was my first thought. Second thought: Wait... Didn\'t I just see this character?? But anyways, to be honest, I felt like they ran out of character design ideas because of all the replicas I seemed to see where ever I looked. Actually... Wait a sec... Maybe everyone was a twin... Dun, dun, dun! Oh wait a sec... There was a pair of ACTUAL TWINS. But anyways, like I said, the art was bland and this didn\'t exactly affect the characters in a good way. In many ways, the characters were quite obviously made in a feeble attempt to appeal to the female audience, with the cute neko boy, the long haired stoic one, the emo kid, the glasses dude. Just generic. for those that enjoy shipping, there really isn\'t much inspiration and there are technically ships but they feel forced. But yes: lacking develop and design creativity. Any humour also falls so flat I don\'t even know. I hardly even smiled throughout the whole duration of the series, the jokes weren\'t bad they were just kinda like: Oh, that was a joke? Okay..?Enjoyment - 7Okay, to tell the truth, despite all the technical and story faults in this anime, I did legitimately enjoy it at some point; maybe I wasn\'t exactly in paradise most of the time, but there were still times when I had liked the show when watching it. This is where I say: I reckon this section of my review would be biased. So basically, I\'m in high school and I run in competitive track events - 100 m, 200 m, relay and 3000 m. Do we get it? The thing is, there\'s a high possibility that my enjoyment of the show stems from having some sports background to connect with the characters. To tell the truth, the reason I enjoyed the show as much as I did were the races. It certainly wasn\'t a mistake to invent this sport because I was sweating when they were running and I was trembling as well as I heard the \'go\' being said. For me, this really reminded me of all the \'ready, set, BAM\'s I\'ve heard during my own races and I was SO PUMPED UP after watching the races. The show is a majority of tournaments so if that\'s what you feel like - a show where you don\'t really pay attention to the characters but it would get your blood pumping like in a real race, then this wouldn\'t be a bad choice as most sports anime focus on the characters more so that you grow attached to them and because of the characters, it gets you pumping. Other thing with Stride: I didn\'t have any worries about who would win. I usually always have a team/s but this time, I didn\'t feel frustrated no matter which team won because I just loved the races themselves (and because I could hardly remember the names of everyone because of the lack of character development). But a warning, the first races will probably be adrenaline full but the novelty of watching a fictional sport soon wears out when they put the training and stuff in the second half. This actually really ruined my enjoyment of the show because the second half was all about fitting in training that they didn\'t seem to need at the start of the show and character development that couldn\'t have been more forced, pointless, or fallen more flat. But my enjoyment of the races was still there and I wouldn\'t say no to re-watching the anime if a friend wants to watch it with me, just so I could feel that rush as I watch the races.Overall - 4This anime was... Okay? I guess the characters sucked, the art was mediocre, the soundtrack was anything but outstanding and the story was poor. In the end, I gave this show a \'decent\' overall score because of the novelty of the sport and because of my enjoyment of the races.Recommendation rate - 3It really depends on who it is. I would love to recommend it to people who have a track background and like sports anime, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone who doesn\'t have a prior connection to elements in Stride. I wouldn\'t recommend it to modern sports anime fans where the characters really take the main focus of the viewer\'s attention. So... If you\'re wanting to watch something \'alternative\' and sporty, I guess it wouldn\'t kill anyone to watch this if you are desperate for a sports anime, but, take it from me, this is no masterpiece. But I definitely recommend watching some clips of the races beforehand (don\'t watch spoilers!) so you can get an idea of how much you like them (I had previously dropped this anime after not even finishing episode one, which means I didn\'t get to see a race, but then I watched an AMV and I thought, this looks really good, so I gave it a second try), if you thought, this is really cool! Then watch the anime. If you watched some of the races and thought: meh, this is fine. Then don\'t watch it. Because again, the races are really the redeeming feature of this show, the characters and the story aren\'t gonna boost it but actually drag it down so... Yeah.If you\'re gonna watch it, have fun! If you decided it\'s not your thing, well good luck in your pursuit of another good sports anime! Thanks for reading my review ;)', ""Prince of Stride Alternative. I truly loved this anime. With fantastic themes of friendship, connecting emotions, and never giving up, it's truly wonderful.I've seen that a lot of the reviews for this anime are pretty bad, and I really don't understand why.

Watching the stride-races was undoubtedly exciting and enjoyable.The lovely animations and character designs are the main strength of this anime. Very smooth and dynamic movements plus unusual strong, sometimes cartoonlike colors express an unique charm.By using powerful music the overall atmosphere of the anime is mirrored pretty good. While I liked the opening best because it set me in the right mood for the episode following, the ending rather appeared to be average and didn\'t really stand out.The main topics of ""Prince of Stride: Alternative"" are quite similar to most of sports anime, since it\'s all about team spirit and faith and I think those topics are quite well implented. Another important part of the plot is ""running"" and ""running away"", which should be considered on different levels.What we deal with here in the end is an overall solid anime that is able to tell its story within only a few episodes.

I\'m pretty pleased with it.Story: For those of you who have not looked into this anime at all, it is basically a story centered around a group of guys involved in a made-up sport called Stride, which from simple assumptions after watching the show, is basically a sport where a team of 5 runners race against another team relay-style, and are coordinated by another person called a Relationer. A lot of people have complained that...the anime does not really go into detail about what Stride REALLY is and the technical details regarding it, and I can understand why that is a bit frustrating, but it being only 12 episodes and based off of a game, I wouldn\'t worry too much about it.Aside from that, the story is just a mediocre sport anime story: A once great team for said sport, somehow loses all their reputation from an incident among the players, and the spunky freshman characters are the ones who bring everyone together in the pursuit of rebuilding the team. Overall, nothing bad, but nothing good either. I mostly just watched it for the racing.Side note: I have heard people complain about the fact that the actual races do not have much running shown in them, and more jumping and flipping over obstacles. You CAN say that they only do that for the racing scenes to look cool and actiony, but I think it\'s the fact that Stride isn\'t supposed to be your regular track&field type race. I think Stride was intended to be a sport that fused traditional relay racing and free-running/parkour.  If you have seen free-runners, the way they run is pretty close to how they run in the show. High steps and very powerful arm movement, and of course, running through obstacles. This isn\'t really something too important, but I just thought I\'d mention it before anyone might criticize that aspect of the show.Art: The art I thought was very good! The colors are very bright and vibrant, and it can even be a little overwhelming, but the characters were drawn pretty and the animations of the running were also very well made.Sound: Like the art, the sound also caught my attention. I really liked the opening of this anime. It had a very ""get pumped"" kind of feeling when listening to it, very similar to openings like from Haikyuu or Hajime no Ippo. Sports animes tend to do a pretty good job with that. Overall sound effects and BGMs were good. Nothing to complain about. They did a good job simulating the sounds of the runners.Characters: Much like Free, the characters seemed kind of one dimensional so to speak, but were good looking! Each of them held their own personalities, following classic tropes (i.e. the Strong type, silent type, cute/loli type, etc.). I don\'t want to give too much away, but the characters do have very brief backstories and drama that adds a little bit more substance, but there wasn\'t too much depth to the characters. They\'re likable. Nothing too special.Enjoyment: Honestly, I really enjoyed watching this anime every week. As mediocre as it may be, I\'m a sucker for awesome action/sports scenes, and I thought the idea of free-running relay races was really cool too!Overall: I would recommend this to someone who is just looking for an anime where they can enjoy more so the action than the story. There isn\'t all that much character development, but it does have great art and sound. Like I said before, I mainly just watched it for the racing.

I was waiting for that super intense, heart pounding race to occur; maybe in the second season?Story: 5/10So the main thing you need to know about the show is this; highschoolers get together to run in “Stride” races against other highschools. The main characters Nana, Riku, and Takeru form the main core for the show to present itself with. The supporting cast is there and does a decent job but...it's obvious that the show is appealing to a demographic that I'm not a part of. The bromance aspect of the anime is almost suffocating which would not be a huge issue IF it did not impede on the story of the anime. Literally after every race there is a plethora amount of bromance crap that clutters the closing minutes of every episode. Also the whole “We have to get better” aspect of the show was in my opinion not done very well. It seems like the Honan (main school) team just gets unbelievably awesome in the last 2 or 3 episodes out of nowhere.I wanted to like the show because the other elements seemed so great but all I was left with was an uninteresting friendship story that had lots of running in it.Animation: 6.5/10I feel that I have to rate this harder than normal because it is MADHOUSE we are talking about. The studio that has brought us No Game No Life, One-Punch Man, Chihayafuru, and so many other breathtakingly beautiful anime have come up pretty short in the animation department. The scenes are fluid which is important in an action orientated anime but the art quality seems pretty disappointing. Character models and scenery seemed pretty lackluster especially when comparing it to No Game No Life (which I just finished re-watching). MADHOUSE can do so much better than this.Sound: 8/10The music, soundeffects, and voice actors are pretty good in this show. Music seemed to hit the mood right on the tee, voice actors did a pretty good job expressing their characters, and the sound effects were very impressive. The element of wind, running on different surfaces, and landing on platforms/rails was spot on.Characters: 6/10The characters melded well with each other but unfortunately I just could not get myself to give any s***s for them at all. It's not that they were generic it's just the whole package of the anime just didn't hold my attention.Overall: 6.4/10It's an average anime to be honest. It has a very predictable outcome, average character development, and sadly average action scenes. I was hoping that the ending would blow me away but the final race is quite the disappointment. If you are expecting something great like with other MadHouse anime then I would skip out on this one.Enjoyment: 4.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

However, the plot seemed extremely shaky and was rushed way too much.The anime makes the sport of stride to be about connecting with your teammates all while running, doing parkour and relaying to the next person. Sounds cool right? It sure would have been if there was slower character development, more build up, and a better plot line.The basic idea of this anime is good but the followthrough is poorly conceived.The plot line is rushed. A large amount of...critical events happen in the very first episode, all shoved together one after the other instead of spreading it out, putting in more effort and building up to it. It makes the dramatics seem almost silly given the amount of time the team has been together. This is the case a lot of the time. The dramatics wouldn\'t seem so stupid if there was more build up and more struggle from the characters. If they had gone through a harder time and experienced more loss before honing their skills the dramatics would seem completely justified.The soundtrack to this anime I found was very well done. The song, ""Gotta Show Me"" is a really great choice while seeing the characters running and connecting with each other. It really provides a certain energy that translates to the viewer and gets them pumped up about the competition. Many of the songs have a similar effect in this anime. I also found the intro song, ""Strider\'s High"" very enjoyable. Overall, very good choices.The characters personalities are stereotypical and mostly unexplained. The main character, Riku Yagami is an all around nice guy, very silly and athletic. His foil is the stoic Takeru Fujiwara whose only interest is stride. Like hardcore, he thinks of almost nothing else ever, though it is only vaguely explained why later. Nana Sakurai is the only girl on the team and joined a school because she thought the stride team was cool. She\'s extremely eager but only touches briefly on why she likes stride and never fully understands it herself until about midway through.The three original members, and our main characters senpai\'s are, Heath Hasekura (Captain), Kyousuke Kuga, Hozumi Kohinata. I find Kyousuke\'s \'delinquent with a heart of gold\' personality the most irritating. He gives no reason as to why he likes stride, we are given no explanation of his background, and he says very little overall. He comes in to replace Ayumu Kadowaki, a character I felt could have developed a lot more if given the chance. Instead they replace him with Kyousuke the first chance they get, whose skills are already fully formed rather than pursuing Ayumu\'s character anymore. Ayumu still participates in his own way, more as the comic relief and cheer squad but overall his character was wasted.The most enjoyment I got out of this show was watching the races, seeing the characters push themselves harder and successfully pulling off their parkour moves. Although I feel if there was more parkour training and more gimmicks successfully carried out in their competitions it would have been way more fun to watch.I still believe this show had potential, it was just not carried out well and was rushed too much. I think had their been more episodes it would have been a better build up, that way certain characters could have had an arc in which they evolved and grown as an athlete and as a person in order to get a better understanding of themselves and their team as a unit. It would have made for a better payoff later on had it not been so squished together. More character development is imperative, and a more steady pacing when it comes to critical events. Overall not a complete waste of time, but not exactly good either. critical events happen in the very first episode, all shoved together one after the other instead of spreading it out, putting in more effort and building up to it. It makes the dramatics seem almost silly given the amount of time the team has been together. This is the case a lot of the time.

She\'s extremely eager but only touches briefly on why she likes stride and never fully understands it herself until about midway through.The three original members, and our main characters senpai\'s are, Heath Hasekura (Captain), Kyousuke Kuga, Hozumi Kohinata. I find Kyousuke\'s \'delinquent with a heart of gold\' personality the most irritating. He gives no reason as to why he likes stride, we are given no explanation of his background, and he says very little overall. He comes in to replace Ayumu Kadowaki, a character I felt could have developed a lot more if given the chance. Instead they replace him with Kyousuke the first chance they get, whose skills are already fully formed rather than pursuing Ayumu\'s character anymore. Ayumu still participates in his own way, more as the comic relief and cheer squad but overall his character was wasted.The most enjoyment I got out of this show was watching the races, seeing the characters push themselves harder and successfully pulling off their parkour moves. Although I feel if there was more parkour training and more gimmicks successfully carried out in their competitions it would have been way more fun to watch.I still believe this show had potential, it was just not carried out well and was rushed too much. I think had their been more episodes it would have been a better build up, that way certain characters could have had an arc in which they evolved and grown as an athlete and as a person in order to get a better understanding of themselves and their team as a unit. It would have made for a better payoff later on had it not been so squished together. More character development is imperative, and a more steady pacing when it comes to critical events. Overall not a complete waste of time, but not exactly good either.', 'This anime was overall good and fun.The pacing could\'ve been slower, the character developed could\'ve been more action based/experience accumulation rather than dialogue/flashback heavy. Their skill development could\'ve been more defined too, technical wise it wasn\'t clear how they improved other than improving their speed. No tricks/techniques were really established, as there weren\'t many training sessions to begin with. In terms of hurdles - I felt like they were not really well drawn out? Difficulties concern being slower than the other team and not winning, but other than that there\'s pretty much nothing else. There were personal struggles, but rarely does it span for more...than 1-2 episodes.The character are also quite flat. The MC\'s backstory was fine - typical overshadowed by sibling trope - understandable, but for the other characters there\'s not much explaining for their personal motivations or wants or backgrounds. Most flashbacks propels relationship development - perhaps on theme with the whole ""connection"" motif. I only know they like doing stride with friends, want to win, full stop.Relationships are pretty well developed though, albeit quite cheesy at times the dynamics and interaction were cute and wholesome enough that they work (at least for me).The art style on the other hand - amazing. Reminds me of the film ""Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop"". Can\'t believe that the anime is published over 8 years ago (as of the writing of this review). The races and environment looked very vibrant and packed - the racing scenes are well-drawn overall but at times i just feel like there\'s just guys running without any anime aspects going on (like real life...).Final note - this anime is not top tier and have many flaws, but it was a fun ride.

That being said...it's not that great a show.I think the parts where the characters are actually competing are quite nice, but most of the character development and whatnot in between is meh. The biggest detractor imo is Riku, as I find him incredibly annoying throughout at least 80% of the show. The rest of the cast are generally fine, but no one is really great.Plot wise, just take what happens in almost every sports anime and change it...to parkour relays. I'm sure you can guess how things will play out through the show.Show is basically Run With the Wind with parkour and worse characters. It's watchable if you like sports anime, and decent if you're big into running. But if you're a runner honestly just go watch/rewatch Run With the Wind. to parkour relays.

Prince of Stride is severely underrated and deserves more hype for sure. The characters are honestly so good! I was surprised how interesting this sport was too. I had no idea this kind of sport even existed and I definitely don't think it does in America, but it's ten times more interesting than the standard basketball or volleyball.The art is great... a bit pale in the coloring, but you get used to it. I loved how the show actually depicts all the races in detail. I was so excited watching...them race and go through all the parkour. Even if you don't necessarily love the art, I think you'll want to watch for the racing alone.Check this anime out!!! No one talks about it enough!!! It deserves more attention, even  years later. them race and go through all the parkour.

It deserves more attention, even  years later."", ""I watched Prince of Stride: Alternative, which is an otome-game adaptation by Madhouse. Here are my thoughts:For context, this show revolves around an imaginary sport that is kind of like a relay-race version of parkour but with a leader who coordinates everyone. It is very entertaining to watch, actually.The animation quality is good, but much more importantly the visual direction is absolutely terrific. I really like the way colour and brightness effects are used in this. It's difficult to explain but this anime was so bright during some scenes I felt like I needed to wear sunglasses just watching it. It was sort of like...they played with the exposure settings on a camera or something like that. It looked great. Art style too I really liked. I liked the character designs. The visuals for this anime are a major strong point. I enjoyed them enormously. Especially for a sports anime, having awesome visuals like this really was a pleasure. Cinematography was also well done and made the sporty scenes enjoyable to watch. There are also lots of really cool sound effects that enhance the running scenes a lot. The running scenes look, feel, and sound AWESOME. Overall the production quality is excellent. The OST is good as well and enhances the mood of a variety of scenes.In terms of characters, there is a self-inserty team-leader girl character and there are her male team members. You might anticipate that this would result in a typical reverse-harem situation, but actually shounen-ai between male team members is the only romantic subtext, and even that is mild. Apparently in the VN there is a lot more hetero romance involving the MC. The male characters are fairly likable, and each have unique personalities which mesh together for some good chemistry within the team. Takeru was my favourite character. Beyond the characters themselves, the drama is handled fairly well, which leads me to my next point.This anime has great direction. They had to introduce an entirely new sport and do some world building, but I never felt like I was being forcefed information. Exposition was handled well. There's also a good balance between sporty scenes and slower, more dialogue-heavy scenes. There is some comedy, but it's sprinkled lightly and not used inappropriately. The anime actually has a consistently serious tone (and feels that way to the viewer). Maybe that was an artistic risk because someone might find the sport they're doing to be absurd, and it might be easier to just load up the comedy. I'm glad they didn't take that approach. The series feels competitive, dramatic and exciting. You could really feel the emotional highs and lows. I felt excited every time I queued up an episode to watch.If I had to identify a weak point in Prince of Stride, I would say it's the plot. Although well executed, the story at its core is kind of mediocre. Sometimes it can be kind of 'melodramatic' as well, however this is hardly surprising for an otome-game adaptation.Overall rating: 9/10Shockingly underrated anime. Really well directed and exceptionally entertaining. I will definitely be rewatching this.I really hope that someone makes a high-quality Blu-ray rip of this (I couldn't find one). It seems like this franchise got disproportionately less recognition in the West relative to its popularity in Japan. There is little evidence of any kind of western fanbase. I think the combination of sports and the otome aspect is a major reason for the anime's lukewarm reception. The average person watching it for the sport appeal was likely put off by the otome elements, and conversely the otome audience often didn't enjoy the sports focus. I think that the anime as a whole appealed to very few people — most people were probably only drawn in by specific aspects of the show, not the sum of its parts. This might explain the mixed feelings that so many people seem to have. I'm probably unusual in that I found most dimensions of the anime appealing. Hopefully the rumours about a second season are true.UP UP SPEED UP they played with the exposure settings on a camera or something like that. It looked great. Art style too I really liked.

Punch Line,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28617/Punch_Line,"['I had to write a review for Punch Line because the current score (7.11 as of 6/25/15) is far underrating this surprise favorite.Punch Line is a show that many people dropped within the first few episodes and honestly, I don\'t blame them. It harbors an absolutely ridiculous premise and while the first episode is action-packed, the next four episodes focused more on (admittedly) lackluster comedy. However, those that stuck around to episode five got on a train ride with no stops.The art and sound production were one of the main draws to the show for me and for many others that initially picked...up the show. It has unique character designs, bursting with personality. The soundtrack isn\'t extremely memorable, but it always did a good job at setting the mood and drawing me into the story. The voice actors all portrayed their characters amazingly well.But more importantly, let\'s get to the story. Punch Line\'s premise, again, is ridiculous. What\'s amazing about Punch Line is that it manages to make its premise MAKE SENSE. From episode 5 onwards, almost every weird and ridiculous thing in the show is explained in a way that makes logical sense within the confines of this universe. There are a few plot threads left open at the end of the series, some of which I really wanted a conclusion to, but for the most part, everything that we see in episode one comes together by the final episode.That is the single biggest reason to watch Punch Line, in my opinion. Watch the first episode and observe the wacky premise and wonder to yourself, ""How the hell does this make any sense?"" Then watch the rest of the show and be impressed at how it comes together. Punch Line, although its first half is rather weak, comes together in the second half to become an absolute must-watch for any anime fan. up the show.

Many around you proclaim that it\'s ""original,"" "" bold,"" or ""expressive,"" while they point at the rectangle of incomprehensible shapes and sloppy paint. While they might see something praiseworthy, from where you\'re standing, it looks like a kindergarten arts and crafts project, where the kids ate a little too much Elmer\'s paste.Punch Line gives me that feeling, but instead of paint being thrown randomly at a canvas, we have themes and concepts instead. It felt like the creators just threw a bunch of ideas into...a hat after one too many drinks and began selecting random slips of paper from it to form the finished product. A string of loose thoughts, unsupported themes and underutilized concepts that somehow made it past the rough draft stage of some drunken editor\'s desk, where it was prematurely approved to become a final script. It\'s a tumultuous mess that tried to contain as many elements as possible and ended up imploding as a result.Organized chaos isn\'t impossible to obtain, there has been countless of shows that have proven itself in accomplishing that. As long as the \'chaos\' is guided by some kind of subtext or uniformity in each aspect\'s inclusion, it should turn out fine. However, if there\'s little in the way of connective tissue to hold the madness together, it doesn\'t take long before onlookers notice the shortcomings. With elements that do little to nothing to mesh together, it\'s hard to feel like there\'s any semblance of being behind Punch Line\'s existence. It\'s a project that confuses quirkiness with creative merit. There\'s no coherency between any of the show\'s plethora of flavoring, just a bunch of ""whys"" that are never properly explained. Why cinnamon? Why a bear for a pet? Why super saiyan? Why ghost cats? Why super sentai? Why panties? Why do panty-shots cause the world to explode outside of an obvious innuendo? Why body swaps? Why paradoxical time-travel? Why witchcraft? Why moe robot girl? Why anything? All these needless aspects that the show continuously tosses in felt like it was only there to distract from what little plot it was working with. A dribble of ideas thrown together, hoping a few would stick. And for the occasional instances where the show attempted to answer some of it, thematically it was as conclusive as the writers saying ""just because."" Punch Line brings up more questions than it answers, a trend that finds itself bleeding over into the main story-line.For the most part, the show tries to tell a straightforward story about our protagonist, Yuuta Iridatsu, who has to travel through time to stop the impending destruction of Earth by ways of a meteorite strike. While it seems simple enough, it\'s the inclusion of the aforementioned elements that makes a fairly ordinary tale into a muddled mess. With plot twists and reveals that do absolutely nothing for the show\'s overall story or the characters involved, these tacked on tidbits ended up being questionable content instead of tasteful flavoring. Flavoring isn\'t bad by itself, but it needs to be used in moderation, or at least add something to the overall dish. A little dressing on a salad will enhance the taste, but adding too much would just make it into a repulsive swampy soup. Punch Line became that swampy soup, by effectively drowning out its content with too many unwarranted aspects.Many of the plot points introduced during the show\'s run-time ended up not mattering in the long run since it was all negated by the ""save the world"" storyline that was introduced later on. The pointless elements discussed did nothing but further the issue, by taking time away from the narrative to travel down several detours that had no conclusion. It felt like a bait-and-switch from an over-the-top comedy/parody of super sentai, to an angst filled character drama along the lines of The Butterfly Effect. This was made even more jarring from the show\'s constant tonal shifts. Serious moments were often followed up by comedic gags, that not only downplayed the situation but also negated any tension that was supposed to arise from it. It destroyed any substantial weight behind incidents before it had time to sink in. There are times where serious moments that endangered the characters\' lives were built up, only to be resolved by a flash of a girl\'s panties. It\'s not funny and it certainly isn\'t dramatic. The show\'s constant tonal shifts just kept on butting heads with each other. It made any conflict the show was trying to sell to feel pointless since it was easily washed away by the next scenario. When there\'s no consequence for life-threatening events, it\'s hard to get invested in a show\'s outcome.But perhaps the biggest misstep of Punch Line was its use of time-travel. Time-travel is something that needs proper measure taken in order to stay relevantly coherent but the time-travel in Punch Line was beyond contrived and paradoxical. Every half-assed attempt to make sense of it only backfired. Since the theory of time-travel is riddled with paradoxes, to begin with, it\'s hard to put all the blame on the show. There are always loopholes whenever it is used in stories but there are some things that any iteration of time-travel tends to follow. Cardinal rules if you will. May that be the ""butterfly effect"" commonly found with linear travel or the ""grandfather"" paradox that\'s commonly shared with most iterations. Punch Line doesn\'t follow any of them, which causes it to make little sense when viewed as a whole. The closest thing to the type of time-travel Punch Line used would be parallel world jumping similar to what\'s used in TV shows like Sliders. But here\'s the problem, the protagonist already exist in this universe and even interacts with the other version of \'himself\'. This should cause a rift in time or an anomaly to form but that never happens... and why you may ask? Well ""just because"", since it\'s something the writers seem to have no explanation for as usual. This lack of common sense was perfectly summed up with what I can only describe as the writer\'s not so subtle explanation via expository dialogue during the show\'s final moments. Our protagonist tries to explain and tie up the Gundam size plot holes by addressing the audience through the conversation \'he\' had with the rest of the side characters. This laughable attempt to bring everything full-circle only shined a light on how improperly put together it was. All the explanation did was bring up more questions that would never get resolved.If the show had anything going for it, it\'ll be the art and animation. It was vibrant and energetic. Similar to 2015 Winter season\'s Rolling Girls, it looked like a child\'s imagination brought to life. If you weren\'t watching this with any set standards it would be passable as visual entertainment. Being brought together by the relatively new studio MAPPA, Punch Line is yet another example of their visual prowess. The character designs were all very pleasant and felt well incorporated with the show\'s art choices. While they weren\'t all unique, it did have a trademark look about it that help to differentiate itself from other titles.While it was well presented, for the most part, there were still times where the animation was stilted and stiff. This was more evident towards the middle portion of the show and the earlier slice-of-life episodes. The inconsistency from episode to episode can\'t be overlooked and hindered it from being better. But thankfully it made up for it by the 3/4 mark where the episodes maintained proper form and MAPPA strutted their stuff.The soundtrack for Punch Line is your typical J-pop/rock musical selection, with the added bonus of a few keyboard synthesizers and electronic instruments tossed in for good measure. This gave the music a vibe similar to the Euro House music scene, which worked in unison with the visual flare presented throughout the show. While nice for what it was, most of it wasn\'t used to its fullest potential and could have been incorporated better. Some standout tracks included ""Concentration"", ""Crisis"" and ""MUHI."" It\'s nothing new and undoubtedly the kind of OST you would have heard many times over, but still did the job nonetheless. The opening theme ""PUNCH LINE!"" by Shokotan ♥ Denpa Gumi was a very catchy idol-heavy musical number. Like the OST, it worked well with the show\'s visual presentation. Again, nothing new but still a nice toe-tapping ear-worm.Overall, the presentation of Punch Line was good and helped to make the nonsensical script more bearable than it would have been without it.Now, what little appraisal I could offer Punch Line presentation-wise, the same can\'t be done when addressing the character lineup. With no memorable characteristics or features to speak of, each character was given a basic archetypal role and simple personality quirk to substitute for actual personality. They\'re no better than the cast of children shows like The Care Bears or Teletubbies, where it seems like their color palette and character design directly corresponded to their simplistic portrayal. They\'re more like caricatures than actual people.Yuuta Iridatsu being our protagonist was the only one that was somewhat easy to relate to. Notice I said ""somewhat,"" as there was not much done to flesh out \'his\' character. \'He\' would most likely be remembered for a plot twist that I dear not spoil here than for \'him\' as a person.Also, the ghost cat was probably the show\'s way of flipping the bird to the audience. For the entire run-time, he was presented as a guide for our protagonist that seemed to have an ulterior motive. There was no direct focus on the cat\'s actions but it always felt like it was meddling in the shadows. But it just turned out that the cat was just an expository mouthpiece for giving the audience painfully obvious info dumps, as well as serving as a plot-device for whenever the show(writers) needed to move the story along.The antagonists for the series was also a let down since, like the rest of the cast, they had no proper characterization or personality to speak of. They were simply bad because the show demanded it and again was another pointless plot twist that didn\'t matter in the end.Also, expect A LOT of troll character ""death flag"" scenes.As a whole, the cast was a disappointment and forgettable almost immediately after completion. And while the show had some memorable moments, as a whole, it was a title that left me with more of a headache than anything satisfying.Enjoyment: 5/10With an inviting 1st episode, I thought I was getting ready to watch a fun super sentai journey with batshit insane presentation and over-the-top altercations but what I got instead was a show that quickly lost steam,  a comedic gag that lost its novelty and a plot that went up its own ass. Visually, it was fine but the tonal shifts and misuse of concepts brought my enjoyment down.Overall: 4/10The presentation ultimately saved this anime from being completely unwatchable. Where it could have worked as a satirical outlook on fanservice and super sentai flicks, it ended up going a more serious route, while not having the appropriate tone or pedigree of writing needed to back it up. It was an ambitious undertaking that fell short of the mark and squandered its chances of being better by trying to do too much at once. An idea was there but unfortunately, it was poorly realized. a hat after one too many drinks and began selecting random slips of paper from it to form the finished product.

But thankfully it made up for it by the 3/4 mark where the episodes maintained proper form and MAPPA strutted their stuff.The soundtrack for Punch Line is your typical J-pop/rock musical selection, with the added bonus of a few keyboard synthesizers and electronic instruments tossed in for good measure. This gave the music a vibe similar to the Euro House music scene, which worked in unison with the visual flare presented throughout the show. While nice for what it was, most of it wasn\'t used to its fullest potential and could have been incorporated better. Some standout tracks included ""Concentration"", ""Crisis"" and ""MUHI."" It\'s nothing new and undoubtedly the kind of OST you would have heard many times over, but still did the job nonetheless. The opening theme ""PUNCH LINE!"" by Shokotan ♥ Denpa Gumi was a very catchy idol-heavy musical number. Like the OST, it worked well with the show\'s visual presentation. Again, nothing new but still a nice toe-tapping ear-worm.Overall, the presentation of Punch Line was good and helped to make the nonsensical script more bearable than it would have been without it.Now, what little appraisal I could offer Punch Line presentation-wise, the same can\'t be done when addressing the character lineup. With no memorable characteristics or features to speak of, each character was given a basic archetypal role and simple personality quirk to substitute for actual personality. They\'re no better than the cast of children shows like The Care Bears or Teletubbies, where it seems like their color palette and character design directly corresponded to their simplistic portrayal. They\'re more like caricatures than actual people.Yuuta Iridatsu being our protagonist was the only one that was somewhat easy to relate to. Notice I said ""somewhat,"" as there was not much done to flesh out \'his\' character. \'He\' would most likely be remembered for a plot twist that I dear not spoil here than for \'him\' as a person.Also, the ghost cat was probably the show\'s way of flipping the bird to the audience. For the entire run-time, he was presented as a guide for our protagonist that seemed to have an ulterior motive. There was no direct focus on the cat\'s actions but it always felt like it was meddling in the shadows. But it just turned out that the cat was just an expository mouthpiece for giving the audience painfully obvious info dumps, as well as serving as a plot-device for whenever the show(writers) needed to move the story along.The antagonists for the series was also a let down since, like the rest of the cast, they had no proper characterization or personality to speak of. They were simply bad because the show demanded it and again was another pointless plot twist that didn\'t matter in the end.Also, expect A LOT of troll character ""death flag"" scenes.As a whole, the cast was a disappointment and forgettable almost immediately after completion. And while the show had some memorable moments, as a whole, it was a title that left me with more of a headache than anything satisfying.Enjoyment: 5/10With an inviting 1st episode, I thought I was getting ready to watch a fun super sentai journey with batshit insane presentation and over-the-top altercations but what I got instead was a show that quickly lost steam,  a comedic gag that lost its novelty and a plot that went up its own ass. Visually, it was fine but the tonal shifts and misuse of concepts brought my enjoyment down.Overall: 4/10The presentation ultimately saved this anime from being completely unwatchable. Where it could have worked as a satirical outlook on fanservice and super sentai flicks, it ended up going a more serious route, while not having the appropriate tone or pedigree of writing needed to back it up. It was an ambitious undertaking that fell short of the mark and squandered its chances of being better by trying to do too much at once. An idea was there but unfortunately, it was poorly realized.', '**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Punchline is a fascinating and ambitious, but ultimately failed experiment by Studio MAPPA to tell unique, non-chronological, wacky, plot-twist filled story much in the same vain as Haruhi Suzumiya. What went wrong? To make a long story short: incompetent writing. This anime introduces a plethora of confusing and poorly explained plot devices that turn out to be completely pointless, totally nonsensical, and/or dead ends, making the show a ridiculous comedy at best and an incomprehensible mess at worse. But let’s talk about that:Synopsis: Whenever out protagonist, Yuuta Iradatsu, sees a girl’s underwear, the world explodes. How? I don’t know. Why? Not important apparently....Does this ever become a necessary plot point? No. Just roll with it. Anyway, Yuuta’s soul has become separated from his body, and his goal is to save the world, his friends, and himself by observing a particular series of events over and over again in spirit-form, with each iteration ending in a time reset.Explaining exactly why a show doesn’t make any sense is not an easy thing to do to somebody who hasn’t seen it, especially without spoilers, but I’ll do my best. If I had to sum up the reason Punchline’s plot is absolutely awful in a single sentence, it would be this: Everything is pulled out of their ass. There is NO logical consistency or flow to the events of the show. Things that have no good explanations behind them just appear out of nowhere at random intervals as if the viewer is supposed to understand what is going on when nothing is being explained. I guess they were hoping that people would overlook the lack of explanation in favor of the fun factor, but that did not end up being the case because it’s TOO vague and TOO “out-there”. Most anime fans are willing to overlook minor or even major discrepancies if the rest of the show makes sense, but very few were willing to tolerate the sheer amount of incompetence that Punchline vomited onto our screens. If ever there was an example of throwing shit to the wall to see what sticks, this anime is now the quintessential case. To reiterate once more, since I can’t stress it enough, this show makes NO sense, and the very limited amount of mindless fun that it occasionally provides is not nearly enough to compensate for that.Perhaps the main reason Puchline fails to connect with the audience is because its characters are so flat and one-dimensional. Any semblance of a backstory or motivations that a character receives are always the barest of barebones, not to mention that they don’t even make sense more often than not (have you spotted a pattern?). In fact, every time this show attempts to answer a question about one of its characters, it just raises three more. The show really banks on the fact that the viewers get attached to these basic archetypes and feel the chemistry/friendship that they have with each other, but they simply never give us a reason to. I didn’t care about these characters because I had no idea who any of them were, and that includes the protagonist, who is on screen over 90% of the time. That’s a major, MAJOR issue. Oh, and the pointless plot devices that have no reason to exist that I mentioned earlier? The characters have a ton of those. All I can guess is that they are an attempt to make the show seem more “crazy” and “fun”, when really they just serve to make it even more incomprehensible. I don’t remember any of their names; that’s how truly unmemorable and uninteresting they are. Oh, and I’m still pretty confused about who the villain was supposed to be and what his motivations were. This show is just one big giant clusterfuck of disorientation.Being animated by Studio MAPPA, Punchline is not totally without its strong points. The art, art direction, cinematography, and animation in general are easily the highlights of the show. Actions scenes are made more fun with unique and experimental angles as well as over-the top choreography that can be pretty entertaining at times. MAPPA continues distinguish themselves with their stellar visuals. As for the use of sound, it’s pretty standard. The OP and ED themes are catchy, but I’ll forget them in a month. The OST is also pretty run of the mill and sound design was pretty hit or miss for me. To sum it up, Punchline has above average animation and average sound.If you’re looking for an over-the-top, mindless-fun sort of show, Punchline tries too hard to have a plot. If you are looking for a complex, Suzumiya-eque, intertwining story, Punchline is too confusing and nonsensical. As a result, this anime gets caught somewhere in the middle to these two target audiences, satisfies neither of them, and fails to establish any positive identity of its own. All things considered though, I must applaud the attempt at creating an original, multifaceted show. I truly hate the fact that I have to bash this anime because I really wanted to like it, but writing was simply too awful to tolerate. I do not recommend Punchline to anyone.

I do not recommend Punchline to anyone.', ""I have lusted after a good ecchi for years. My friends at MAPPA and Uchikoshi, the author of the Zero Escape video games series collaborated together to bring us just that. Like it's spiritual predecessor Kill la Kill, which virtually allowed the market for shows like this to be created once again, it is ecchi parody. The whole concept of the show is ecchi, the gag of reflexively destroying the world when chancing on panties immediately feels too obtuse. Why the hell would anyone ever watch something so blatantly dumb? Probably because if the narrative wasn't daringly original it would have been definitively the worst...show to be made in quite some time.With that said, the ecchi portions of the show are absurdly flashy and basically so in-your-face jokes that there is no ecchi at all. Punch Line is not an arousing show. It was not created with the purpose of being arousing. It was a slice-of-life mystery from episode one. It's a riotous comedy that inverts all sorts of terribleness from the known-to-all loved-by-none (or degenerate) genre of ecchi. It has everything; a zany premise, harem situation, super powers, nose bleeds, the promise of sex jokes, robots, time travel, ninjas, mascot characters, archetypal cast, forgettable lead, low-budget setting, and the list goes on. We are given the direct dose of horrible ecchi setting, but Punch Line just wants to shake you up a little bit. What if the ecchi setting was used for something other than... vapid and lustful entertainment?We are dealt a handful of hilariously offbeat slice-of-life episodes and then as audience, MAPPA knocks in the head a few times. Were you paying attention? If you haven't seen Punch Line yet, look out - There's no men in the main cast.The music arrangement in Punch Line is standard issue for the most part. It's electronic and it's ambient and retains some of the doujin and sugar coated feel that the opening brings. The opening theme is really an anthem though, a real stupid, a real catchy, and really bizarre anthem. An ecchi show is all about the assets. It does everything to get your attention. Yet where ecchi shows usually begin to shy away from sexualizing after a certain point, resigning that the audience either gets it or won't watch, they throw together a sloppily and hastily made opening and ending theme. Punch Line does the opposite. Since the show itself is barely about seeing panties or having perverted moments linger, the opening does that in a 90 seconds full salvo. The ending is the opposite, an innocent and childlike fantasy. This ending theme is often at odds with the shows rather dark themes of imminent destruction and isolation.And that's actually what Punch Line is about. It's about a group of people with actually very little in common, living in the suburbs of Japan, in small rooms all right next door to each other. What do a bullied hikkikimori, annoying land-owner, a drunk floozy, and an ordinary school girl all have in common? Is it possible to live in such proximity to people and have no connection with them? The story of Punch Line is absurd and starts and ends promising, quite literally, the destruction of the world. And we get the destruction of the world. A couple times actually. But what Punch Line is a good flex of narrative muscle, bringing together originally stereotypical characters into a community that gives them just a little more innovation than the rest of the industry can do right now. Ecchi is a whole genre built on absurdism - how far can the label be pushed until the audience doesn't want to watch anymore and how far can the program go before the government axes production clean off the air for indecency. It is a totally unconventional place to actually enjoy a cast of characters, but Punch Line does it. Punch Line ends up being a believable story of unlikely friendships.This completely absurd show with no boundaries and just an handful of troupes that the scriptwriter wanted to toy with actually manages to make you care. That is Punch Lines charm.When you get down and dirty with Punch Line you end up with a more riveting and somehow believable conclusion than the finale of Steins;Gate. The finesse it takes to bring such a lurid and stupid premise and breathe life into a genre devoid of any human dignity makes for a grand display, one you can't believe. I have to seriously congratulate Punch Line for managing to show that Kill la Kill wasn't just a one and done thing. It takes a lot of lace to tie together a show this buoyant. show to be made in quite some time.With that said, the ecchi portions of the show are absurdly flashy and basically so in-your-face jokes that there is no ecchi at all.

It takes a lot of lace to tie together a show this buoyant."", '(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Carl Sagan, a famous physicist, once said, “Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.” Whether we are conscious of it or not, our lives are filled with numerous instances of us simply trying to survive. Having a healthy diet keeps our body working well whereas wearing a seatbelt in a car provides immeasurable safety. Even something as simple as looking both ways when crossing the street could potentially save our life. We do these things – increasing our chances to live – because we do not want to die. Sounds rudimentary, but there is not...a whole lot more to it than that; we all want to experience a “supremely happy future.” Punch Line is apocalyptic aversion incarnate, that’s random in nature but not quite memorable.STORYPunch Line starts with a bang, not a punch. After the super hero “Strange Juice” prevents a bus hijacking, young Yuuta Iridatsu has his body taken over by another soul, forcing him to find a special book capable of getting him his body back. But as the tale unfolds, strange events and mysteries come to the forefront.When a dice is tossed or a coin is flipped, the outcome of either scenario is random. Sure, there are specific outcomes attainable – a number one through six, heads or tails – but if the experiment is carried out with no bias, then the dice or the coin will provide a completely random “answer” on each use. This is Punch Line’s approach during the first half of the anime. Everything involved is absolutely random with no sense, direction, reason, or otherwise rationality placed behind it. There are talking, perverted, ghost cats, invisibility cloaks in the shape of squids, and power-ups provided through panty peeking; cinnamon makes poltergeists stronger, bears that have been genetically modified to further an organization’s plans, and a giant robot that shoots fireworks; and there is even a weird, therapeutic dance that involves putting on a pigeon-head mask.The randomness is silly and initially seems to have zero purpose, and to an extent that is correct. Punch Line intentionally leans on the wacky and ridiculous to keep the narrative shrouded in the mystery it boasts. It doesn’t want the audience to understand what in the world is going on because part of the fun is trying to put the pieces together while dealing with the zaniness, and the randomness aids in that endeavor. Think of it like the dice or the coin – the randomness encountered is impossible to predict but there is a set amount of “answers” regardless of the probability involved. Besides keeping everything hidden plot-wise, the randomness is at least used for one thing: comedy. Looking at the first half compared to the second half it is clear that the random bits are meant to bring laughter to those watching. This type of comedy is often received well due to the uniqueness it brings and its quick-paced nature, both of which appear here.In the second half of the anime, randomness gives way to coherency and the comedy is replaced by dramatic elements. What once was unknown becomes common knowledge through the show’s gradual connection of the dots. That robot that shoots fireworks is used by Ito because of her amazing video game skills; the invisibility cloak shaped like a squid is worn to stealthily defeat some bad guys; and the pigeon-head dance finds use when summoning spirits. All the while the show’s smaller plot mysteries are revealed due to the shift in perspective; instead of Yuuta missing specific days or not being able to see certain scenarios, he takes on a more active role in the festivities. Now, not all of the randomness is used to the anime’s advantage – Muhi, the regenerating bear, is apparently incredibly important but is hardly utilized and Chiranosuke, the talking ghost cat, is little more than a guide post – but it manages to cover the majority of its bases.Also of importance is the time-travel aspect which rests comfortably among the rest of Punch Line’s randomness. Something paramount in any time-travel tale is making absolutely sure that there are no plot holes to speak of. It’s a lot easier having them in narratives that use time-travel because of the paradoxical and cyclical nature of them. For Punch Line, it’s not a vital part to the anime, but it is there nonetheless. To that end, it successfully avoids any massive errors in its timeline near the end through Yuuta’s final actions, making everything as logical as possible.Beyond the randomness, mystery, and time-travel, there are a few problems that the narrative as a whole maintains. Thematically speaking, there isn’t much; the idea of fighting for the future and the need for friendship is barely explored and essentially lost among the random moments. The actual plot with “W” and the “Qmay Group” is handled poorly since the audience never really sees or learns much about them besides what is said in passing. But worst of all is the timing of the plot twist and the execution of it. Having to wait so long, and thereby needing to sit through so much incoherency, makes the narrative less of an adventure and more of an obstacle before it really gets going.ANIMATIONPunch Line takes place primarily in one area: the boarding house where the cast members reside. As such, there isn’t too much diversity when it comes to the locations visited, but it is present within the house itself. Each character has their room and subsequently their own themes attached to them. Rabura’s is purple and filled with weird objects to match her divination powers. Meika’s is green, mechanical, and futuristic. And Ito’s is dark and blue due to her recluse status, with cluttering rampant. The anime also employs stylistic eye-catches at the break between parts A and B. They often feature the women in nothing but their underwear (panties and bra) but the old-school look to them makes the pictures quite refined.The character designs are not amazing but at least provide a good sense of individuality. Like their rooms, the characters often have a specific color attributed to them – Ito wears blue-striped socks, Mikatan is all pink, etc. – but they each have their own nice amount of detail on top this. Meika has her glasses and large headphones whereas Rabura has her earrings, sexy dress, and teal-bun hair. Their colorings coincide with their personality: Meika is yellow for happiness, Mikatan is pink for girly, Rabura is purple for beauty, and Ito is blue for sadness, all of which demonstrate the attention their designs received.Actual animation for the show is roughly around average. There’s surprisingly quite a bit of action involved for the majority of the show, but it isn’t too extravagant. Hand-to-hand combat is the norm, with jumping, floating, and clothes ruffling being located here and there. The characters often have overzealous reactions as well that adds variety. But the greatest sequences come near the end, where the finale involves missiles, tanks, robots, brawls, and swords that increase anything the show did previously.CHARACTERSPunch Line’s weakest link is by far the characters that traverse it.Of particular note is the antagonist; Ryuuto – who is really Guri in Pine’s original body – acts as the main adversary, but this is not explicitly known until much later. For whatever reason, though, even when he is introduced, the show continues to keep his motivations a secret. She wants her friends to join her on the ark that will escape the meteor’s blast, but why she is so bent on murdering nearly all of humanity is not explained. That is, until right near end in an attempt to make her plight a bit more relatable or at the minimum understandable. It makes sense, that she wishes to enact the “same” pain on the people who did this to her or anyone else in the future, but her development comes too little, too late to be meaningful.Interestingly, Narugino – who is really Chiyoko in Guri’s original body – doesn’t fare much better. Growing up, she was slated as being a “hero of justice,” due to her overwhelming powers through Uberfication and training at the hands of Meika. When the anime gets underway, she does not do much outside of attempting to conceal her identity, and even then, when she is revealed to be “Strange Juice,” nothing really comes of it. In essence, her character is there to expound on parts of the past; her, Pine’s, and Chiyoko’s younger days, what she went through following their separation, and what led her to the point she is at now.She is not an incredibly deep or complex character which would not be a bad thing, and is even handled nicely, except at the finale. There, she rather selfishly goes against orders and indirectly kills her best friend. The idea was to create a scenario in which Guri “atones for her sins,” Pine, who has lived literally 6 billion and more lives, completes his duty, and Chiyoko follows her “hero of justice” mantra by sacrificing her person to protect Pine. But her actions were quite unnecessary considering what happened and even contradictory because of the results.To make matters worse, Yuuta – whose soul is actually in Chiyoko’s original body (confused yet?) – is quite the lame main character. As was briefly talked about earlier, the first half has him taking on a passive role; the second half an active one. But throughout the whole season, it is difficult to determine what he wants or what he wishes to accomplish. Through him, it becomes quite evident how story-driven the anime is; his character is all comedy and information gathering without granting him much in the way of development. The anime attempts to make his drive more personable through a few situations involving all of the residents, but he never comes off as “one of the gang” and subsequently his reason for fighting to save the world – protecting his friends – is rather weak. This in turn makes the ending a moot point, since his decision does not have much of a basis nor was there enough focus on his actual character to make him worth caring about.The rest of the main cast – Meika, Rabura, and Ito – likewise find themselves sitting low on the totem pole. At least with Ito, the anime gives her a transitional phase, where she moves away from shy and lonesome to determined and friendly through the experiences she has at the house. As for the other two, Meika is a robot and Rabura works with ghosts, but that is the extent of who they are. If anything, they all have one commonality: an everlasting bond.SOUNDThe opening theme is pretty good, with various tempos filling the piece to make it a very fun listen. The various vocalists, combined with the strange instruments and catchy beats, create quite the random arrangement, which is undoubtedly fitting given the anime’s content. The ending theme also manages to be well-composed, with the first half having some nice guitar playing while the second half has an easy-to-follow beat.As for the rest of the soundtrack, it’s mostly filled with electronic instruments (such as in “Pressure” and “Agility”), tracks consisting of otherworldly sounds (such as in “State of Tension” and “Invisible Fear”) that, like the OP, find themselves fitting snuggly within the confines of the show’s randomness and dooms day setting. Others, like “Victim,” are signature to the anime – it’s the song that plays when Yuuta is viewing some panties. Others still, like “Deep in the Past,” are very melancholic, rounding out the depressing moments poignantly. While some of the tracks blend together, it is still an interesting OST that does its job.Voice acting for Punch Line is somewhere above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Mikatan for her girly voice and Marina Inoue as Yuuta for giving a more androgynous voice to match the character’s predicament.ENJOYMENTI can’t say that I liked this one. Part of me wished that the show focused solely on the “ecchi” elements, since the panty viewing was not as critical to the plot as it was originally made out to be. This became quite evident when the second half had nothing to do with the first half’s problem of Yuuta seeing said panties; no longer was it about avoiding them entirely but instead only seeing them now and again when the plot demanded.At the same time, super random comedy like this one had is not up my alley. I do not mind a bit of randomness, but events like the pigeon-head dance and especially Chiranosuke the talking ghost cat were not funny to me in the slightest. Along these same lines, I was not too fond of the characters themselves. Mikatan could be cute, but Yuuta was not comical, Ito and Meika were somewhat annoying, and Rabura did not have nearly enough screen-time to make her relevant.Punch Line is completely random and, oddly enough, simultaneously not. The art and animation is good, as are certain musical pieces. But the story’s minor flaws, the poorly executed characters, and the stale comedy prevent the anime from being something more.

But as the tale unfolds, strange events and mysteries come to the forefront.When a dice is tossed or a coin is flipped, the outcome of either scenario is random. Sure, there are specific outcomes attainable – a number one through six, heads or tails – but if the experiment is carried out with no bias, then the dice or the coin will provide a completely random “answer” on each use. This is Punch Line’s approach during the first half of the anime. Everything involved is absolutely random with no sense, direction, reason, or otherwise rationality placed behind it. There are talking, perverted, ghost cats, invisibility cloaks in the shape of squids, and power-ups provided through panty peeking; cinnamon makes poltergeists stronger, bears that have been genetically modified to further an organization’s plans, and a giant robot that shoots fireworks; and there is even a weird, therapeutic dance that involves putting on a pigeon-head mask.The randomness is silly and initially seems to have zero purpose, and to an extent that is correct. Punch Line intentionally leans on the wacky and ridiculous to keep the narrative shrouded in the mystery it boasts. It doesn’t want the audience to understand what in the world is going on because part of the fun is trying to put the pieces together while dealing with the zaniness, and the randomness aids in that endeavor. Think of it like the dice or the coin – the randomness encountered is impossible to predict but there is a set amount of “answers” regardless of the probability involved. Besides keeping everything hidden plot-wise, the randomness is at least used for one thing: comedy. Looking at the first half compared to the second half it is clear that the random bits are meant to bring laughter to those watching. This type of comedy is often received well due to the uniqueness it brings and its quick-paced nature, both of which appear here.In the second half of the anime, randomness gives way to coherency and the comedy is replaced by dramatic elements. What once was unknown becomes common knowledge through the show’s gradual connection of the dots. That robot that shoots fireworks is used by Ito because of her amazing video game skills; the invisibility cloak shaped like a squid is worn to stealthily defeat some bad guys; and the pigeon-head dance finds use when summoning spirits. All the while the show’s smaller plot mysteries are revealed due to the shift in perspective; instead of Yuuta missing specific days or not being able to see certain scenarios, he takes on a more active role in the festivities. Now, not all of the randomness is used to the anime’s advantage – Muhi, the regenerating bear, is apparently incredibly important but is hardly utilized and Chiranosuke, the talking ghost cat, is little more than a guide post – but it manages to cover the majority of its bases.Also of importance is the time-travel aspect which rests comfortably among the rest of Punch Line’s randomness. Something paramount in any time-travel tale is making absolutely sure that there are no plot holes to speak of. It’s a lot easier having them in narratives that use time-travel because of the paradoxical and cyclical nature of them. For Punch Line, it’s not a vital part to the anime, but it is there nonetheless. To that end, it successfully avoids any massive errors in its timeline near the end through Yuuta’s final actions, making everything as logical as possible.Beyond the randomness, mystery, and time-travel, there are a few problems that the narrative as a whole maintains. Thematically speaking, there isn’t much; the idea of fighting for the future and the need for friendship is barely explored and essentially lost among the random moments. The actual plot with “W” and the “Qmay Group” is handled poorly since the audience never really sees or learns much about them besides what is said in passing. But worst of all is the timing of the plot twist and the execution of it. Having to wait so long, and thereby needing to sit through so much incoherency, makes the narrative less of an adventure and more of an obstacle before it really gets going.ANIMATIONPunch Line takes place primarily in one area: the boarding house where the cast members reside. As such, there isn’t too much diversity when it comes to the locations visited, but it is present within the house itself. Each character has their room and subsequently their own themes attached to them. Rabura’s is purple and filled with weird objects to match her divination powers. Meika’s is green, mechanical, and futuristic. And Ito’s is dark and blue due to her recluse status, with cluttering rampant. The anime also employs stylistic eye-catches at the break between parts A and B. They often feature the women in nothing but their underwear (panties and bra) but the old-school look to them makes the pictures quite refined.The character designs are not amazing but at least provide a good sense of individuality. Like their rooms, the characters often have a specific color attributed to them – Ito wears blue-striped socks, Mikatan is all pink, etc. – but they each have their own nice amount of detail on top this. Meika has her glasses and large headphones whereas Rabura has her earrings, sexy dress, and teal-bun hair. Their colorings coincide with their personality: Meika is yellow for happiness, Mikatan is pink for girly, Rabura is purple for beauty, and Ito is blue for sadness, all of which demonstrate the attention their designs received.Actual animation for the show is roughly around average. There’s surprisingly quite a bit of action involved for the majority of the show, but it isn’t too extravagant. Hand-to-hand combat is the norm, with jumping, floating, and clothes ruffling being located here and there. The characters often have overzealous reactions as well that adds variety. But the greatest sequences come near the end, where the finale involves missiles, tanks, robots, brawls, and swords that increase anything the show did previously.CHARACTERSPunch Line’s weakest link is by far the characters that traverse it.Of particular note is the antagonist; Ryuuto – who is really Guri in Pine’s original body – acts as the main adversary, but this is not explicitly known until much later. For whatever reason, though, even when he is introduced, the show continues to keep his motivations a secret. She wants her friends to join her on the ark that will escape the meteor’s blast, but why she is so bent on murdering nearly all of humanity is not explained. That is, until right near end in an attempt to make her plight a bit more relatable or at the minimum understandable. It makes sense, that she wishes to enact the “same” pain on the people who did this to her or anyone else in the future, but her development comes too little, too late to be meaningful.Interestingly, Narugino – who is really Chiyoko in Guri’s original body – doesn’t fare much better. Growing up, she was slated as being a “hero of justice,” due to her overwhelming powers through Uberfication and training at the hands of Meika. When the anime gets underway, she does not do much outside of attempting to conceal her identity, and even then, when she is revealed to be “Strange Juice,” nothing really comes of it. In essence, her character is there to expound on parts of the past; her, Pine’s, and Chiyoko’s younger days, what she went through following their separation, and what led her to the point she is at now.She is not an incredibly deep or complex character which would not be a bad thing, and is even handled nicely, except at the finale. There, she rather selfishly goes against orders and indirectly kills her best friend. The idea was to create a scenario in which Guri “atones for her sins,” Pine, who has lived literally 6 billion and more lives, completes his duty, and Chiyoko follows her “hero of justice” mantra by sacrificing her person to protect Pine. But her actions were quite unnecessary considering what happened and even contradictory because of the results.To make matters worse, Yuuta – whose soul is actually in Chiyoko’s original body (confused yet?) – is quite the lame main character. As was briefly talked about earlier, the first half has him taking on a passive role; the second half an active one. But throughout the whole season, it is difficult to determine what he wants or what he wishes to accomplish. Through him, it becomes quite evident how story-driven the anime is; his character is all comedy and information gathering without granting him much in the way of development. The anime attempts to make his drive more personable through a few situations involving all of the residents, but he never comes off as “one of the gang” and subsequently his reason for fighting to save the world – protecting his friends – is rather weak. This in turn makes the ending a moot point, since his decision does not have much of a basis nor was there enough focus on his actual character to make him worth caring about.The rest of the main cast – Meika, Rabura, and Ito – likewise find themselves sitting low on the totem pole. At least with Ito, the anime gives her a transitional phase, where she moves away from shy and lonesome to determined and friendly through the experiences she has at the house. As for the other two, Meika is a robot and Rabura works with ghosts, but that is the extent of who they are. If anything, they all have one commonality: an everlasting bond.SOUNDThe opening theme is pretty good, with various tempos filling the piece to make it a very fun listen. The various vocalists, combined with the strange instruments and catchy beats, create quite the random arrangement, which is undoubtedly fitting given the anime’s content. The ending theme also manages to be well-composed, with the first half having some nice guitar playing while the second half has an easy-to-follow beat.As for the rest of the soundtrack, it’s mostly filled with electronic instruments (such as in “Pressure” and “Agility”), tracks consisting of otherworldly sounds (such as in “State of Tension” and “Invisible Fear”) that, like the OP, find themselves fitting snuggly within the confines of the show’s randomness and dooms day setting. Others, like “Victim,” are signature to the anime – it’s the song that plays when Yuuta is viewing some panties. Others still, like “Deep in the Past,” are very melancholic, rounding out the depressing moments poignantly. While some of the tracks blend together, it is still an interesting OST that does its job.Voice acting for Punch Line is somewhere above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Mikatan for her girly voice and Marina Inoue as Yuuta for giving a more androgynous voice to match the character’s predicament.ENJOYMENTI can’t say that I liked this one. Part of me wished that the show focused solely on the “ecchi” elements, since the panty viewing was not as critical to the plot as it was originally made out to be. This became quite evident when the second half had nothing to do with the first half’s problem of Yuuta seeing said panties; no longer was it about avoiding them entirely but instead only seeing them now and again when the plot demanded.At the same time, super random comedy like this one had is not up my alley. I do not mind a bit of randomness, but events like the pigeon-head dance and especially Chiranosuke the talking ghost cat were not funny to me in the slightest. Along these same lines, I was not too fond of the characters themselves. Mikatan could be cute, but Yuuta was not comical, Ito and Meika were somewhat annoying, and Rabura did not have nearly enough screen-time to make her relevant.Punch Line is completely random and, oddly enough, simultaneously not. The art and animation is good, as are certain musical pieces. But the story’s minor flaws, the poorly executed characters, and the stale comedy prevent the anime from being something more. While the cast members might have achieved a “supremely happy future,” the whole package certainly did not.SUMMARYStory: Fine, the randomness is used effectively, the time-travel aspect makes sense, but issues such as little thematic presence, a lackluster plot, and poor timing on the twist weaken the experienceAnimation: Good, nice art style, nice character designs, about average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Ryuuto (Guri), Mikatan (Chiyoko), and Yuuta (Pine) are all rather weak, with Rabura, Meika, and Ito barely being passableSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, interesting soundtrack, above average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, the “ecchi” moments are boring, the random comedy is a huge miss, and the characters are largely forgettableFinal Score: 5/10', 'It\'s Time For Another ""I Don\'t Always Do Meme""I Don\'t Usually Do Airing Anime Reviews But When I Do It\'s Because I Like ItSo Punchline Just Finished Airing It\'s Last Episode Some Hours Ago And Now Here Comes The Reveiw Of It.Story: 9/10 The story started slowly with ecchi as the main focus in the 1st episode and then the story as the main focus in the later episodes  = the first few episodes were just for entertainment.

I certainly do not regret it. This anime was one of the most ""didn\'t-see-it-coming"" I\'ve ever watched. It\'s a good fun even though the main theme might sound weird at first. Panties? Saving the world? Huh???I don\'t want to get too much into storyline, but this anime will most certainly surprise you....After a few slower episodes of really mediocre gags it grasps you and doesn\'t let go. I would suggest watching it in one shot to catch all the little things that are in it. It really gets much better with time.It is not a very sophisticated title, it doesn\'t really take on character development or moral issues, it rather focuses on ways to resolve the current problem using all available means, which sometimes gets slightly crazy. But the idea is good, execution is decent, plot twists are awesome!, the characters likable and not really obvious, and I wasn\'t really feeling like it\'s a bunch of weird ideas put into one, it rather mended together pretty well and gave me much enjoyment :)Art is really nice, cute, but darker at times, gets better with every episode. I was not really convinced with using 3D at the beginning episodes, but later on it blends in well.Definitely worth watching, especially since it\'s not really long, so I\'d suggest giving it a try.

Perhaps some might not get this type of reaction but the first episode literally feels like it drops you in the middle of nowhere. So, a question that pops up would be: how exactly can Punch Line be described as? Long story short. It’s like a certain kind of twisted fun.As an anime original show by Noitamina, there’s not much to go on except for the main premise. Uemura Yutaka direct this series as his second anime project....However, it’s not anything like Dantalian no Shoka. Punch Line is a standalone show that has no connection to any franchise. The premise is exactly what it sounds like. We have this young man named Yuuta Iridatsu with his peculiar habit. And to quote “When he sees a girl's panties, he gets so excited he faints!” The reality is that it affects him so much to the point where his spirit is separated from his body. However, a show like this also isn’t without its mishaps. A major part of the story involves Yuuta trying to save the world because according to the series’ tagline…“If he sees underwear, humanity will be destroyed!?”In a nutshell, Punch Line is more of a misadventure. The series chronicles Yuuta’s daily life that involves ghosts, time travel, idols, terrorism, tragedies, heroes, and of course panties. While most series use it more of as an advertising gimmick, Punch Line actually uses it as part of its plot device. When Yuuta sees panties, he literally gets a big nosebleed. Oh and then, there’s the whole big apocalypse that he brings with him in the form of a meteoroid hitting the Earth. While this setup really sounds deadly, it mostly plays it for laughs for the first few episodes. Then somewhere down the road, the show decides to shake things up a bit with some startling revelations. Along the way, there’s also a bit of tragedy. Now, I do give some credit to the series’ ability to actually mix its ideas of death and comedy together. Although the series seems like a parody or gimmick, it actually does take itself seriously, to a point where death really does result in death. However, it’s hard to convince the audience to accept all of this until we learn more of the truth. And that’s something to remember in Punch Line. The series really builds up its story by showing rather than just telling. In fact, it does both while throwing bits of foreshadowing and red herring along the way. In retrospect, patience will be a key if you plan to finish this series as the first few episodes is nothing more like insane.At some point of the series, I think people will wonder what the purpose of Punch Line really is. Is it a punch in the face for comedy? Is it a serious misadventure of craziness? Or is just about saving the world? Maybe it’s more about the characters themselves rather than the story. Admiringly, the character cast is small yet colorful with a diverse range of personalities. The main protagonist has a hot-blooded personality although he is generally helpful towards the people he meets. Then we have characters like Mikatan with her energetic personality, Ito with her timid behavior, and Rabura with her curiosity. The show even takes time to fill in background stories for certain characters such as Ito to really give the audience an idea at what they are in for. Punch Line’s character cast is perhaps one of the strongest attributes of the show as it has the courage to show off its characters. It also embraces its panty gimmick and while silly at first actually makes the show more fun to watch as part of the story. Every now and then though, it can seem more like a repetition. It knows its shamelessness and exploits it at times to a degree that may be distracting. I guess it’s really a hit or miss to people with such a premise. The more detailed parts of the show comes in later and by foreshadowing, it also adds a bit of thrill for the audience to interpret or analyze ahead to what may come. Pieces of the story connect and come together as in the end, it knows its intentions. Along the way, you may even find the comedy to be appealing with the small doses of shenanigans going on.Studio MAPPA is in charge of this series. And although I praise them for some of their latest works such as the fantastic visual features of Shingeki no Bahamut, Punch Line doesn’t live up exactly to its hype. The artwork seems goofy most of the time and although it’s on track, it’s really hard to take the show seriously. Character design is decent for most of what’s worth although still lacks a sharp edge. I think the most prominent aspects of the show are the facial features. Each episode seems to be clear on what it’s doing when it comes to character reactions and expressive tones. On the negative side, the setting and its backgrounds are hardly noticeable with diehard action scenes. The show clearly isn’t drawn to show action as most of it just spells silliness.Soundtrack brings in a variety of ways to showcase this series. Although the OST works well, I’d say that most of the successes comes from the character voice mannerisms. A small character cast such as Punch Line really needs to connect with the audience so it can keep the viewers at bay. Thanks to our characters’ voice expressions and tones, that was easily achieved. Emotional scenarios, lighthearted moment, or hyperactive scenes are performed all at above standards by the voice actors/actresses. Even the cat Chiranosuke (voiced by Yuri Yoshida) has this amusing voice tone that is convincing. On the other hand, OP and ED theme songs are easily forgettable.This isn’t a show like X-Men or some parody such as the “Superhero Movie”.

Should you be critical and hateful towards it because it doesn\'t make sense in the natural realm of one\'s understanding?  Or should you congratulate it for being stand out and different from amongst the rest of the lot?  If something is considered unique, should we dismiss it for being too odd and too experimental?  Or should we congratulate it for going such a direction?  Aw fuck it, screw the philosophy.  Here\'s a review of Punch Line.  Ready, set, go.Story (6.22/10): Our protagonist Yuta is...could in a rather...peculiar situation.  For one thing, he was just in a bus crash.  For another thing, he\'s a ghost who is now away from his physical body.  And third, according to the ghost cat that he finds himself hanging around, if he sees a girl\'s underwear twice in a row, his excitement level will cause the world to end, thus creating the apocalypse.  Well, uh...that\'s...that\'s quite a predicament.On the surface, Punch Line seems to be nothing more than a slice of ecchi, as the main grab from the show is apparently this ghost guy now trying to be careful in his dorm filled with girls to not try and see their underwear twice in a row.  But when you really get into it, not everything is as it seems.  The plot for Punch Line is one that I feel is one that is one that requires a lot of attention.  You see, the show itself has very different first and second halves, basically saying that depending on which part of the show you\'re on, you\'ll be watching something that differs greatly from what you would be seeing previously.  You see, there really is no consistency in Punch Line itself on account of every episode being something different, both answering and asking new questions at the same time as the plot unfolds for this show.Personally, I feel like the show is actually a Punchline for itself, seeing as how for the first six episodes, it\'s basically all setup giving a rather...unsavory viewing experience because it raises a lot more questions that answers before everything kinda makes sense in episode 7.  The fact that you have to sit through half the show focusing on something that seems like it doesn\'t actually pertain to the show\'s premise at all is something that I feel like makes the show a lot less appealing than it actually may be.  Simply put, the first half of the show makes almost zero sense.  The second half ties everything together so that whatever we\'re watching we can understand to some degree.  As the viewer, you have to tie everything together yourself, using the information, events, and characters that you\'re presented in order to create a neat plot line that you can follow as you go on and finish the show.  In theory, this is quite ingenious, but in practice, it was shaky at best.The biggest issue I have with Punch Line was with the way it presented itself.  A lot of the points that we get don\'t actually feel like complete information, a lot of things still actually don\'t make a whole lot of sense, and the show goes into the realm of confusing so often that at times, even the show\'s characters get confused.  As a result, having to wait around for the second half might not happen with a lot of people because the show doesn\'t provide a cohesive plot line where things happen in a straight line.  (There\'s a lot of wibbly wobbly timey-wimey things in this anime.)As far as personal complaints go, I\'m not a big fan of the plot period.  There were a lot of things within the actual story that really I felt like needed more explanation, and I\'m also not a big fan of having to pay attention to every little thing that happens just in case something important shows up later on, cause that does actually happen in this show.  Overall, I didn\'t personally find the show\'s story to be all that pleasurable.  It has a nice touch of having you piece the events yourself like the show itself is a little puzzle, but because it relied so heavily on the viewer, if you didn\'t know that ahead of time, the show would make little to no sense unless the show connected the dots for you.  Plus, I felt like a few things were thrown in there just because, so that soured my experience a little.Overview:+    Decent second half+/- Interesting storytelling format  (a negative as well because the format isn\'t for everyone)-     Somewhat poor/confusing first half-     A lot of things felt very unexplained and/or just thrown in-     First half was a bit of a time waster  (sadly, it is necessary to watchCharacters (6.33/10): To be fair, while the story of Punchline can arguably be a great way of storytelling or a poor way of storytelling depending on who you\'re asking, the characters themselves really don\'t stand up all too much.First we have Yuta, our main ghostly protagonist.  Much like I have said before, the first half of the show doesn\'t really focus on our protagonist all that much, but rather the lives of the four other girls that live in their dorm house in the middle of nowhere.  This brings me to another point of confusion and why people may drop this show early.  Yuta as the main character, doesn\'t show up all that much.  In fact, he\'s for the most part an observer till later on in the series which really hampers the show a bit early on because when it comes to first impressions, Punchline doesn\'t really make any good ones.  His character does get explanation later on in the series, but the first six episodes of what is essentially exposition really doesn\'t make him shine or seem important.Then we have the girls of the dorm hourse, Korai house.  Narugino, Meika, Rabura, and Ito.  Each girl represents a different kind of anime troupe (idol, braniac, the lonely one, gamer) and each has their own functionality within our story.  (I grouped them all together to try and avoid spoilers on each one of them)  While they all do play an important part to the story later on, each one of them feels like they were thrown random character traits to make them seem a little bit more wacky/a little bit more interesting to watch early on, which admittedly, feels a bit forced.In terms of side characters, PunchLine has quite a number of them all with varying uses and importance, those uses and importances being basically, plot devices.  Pretty much every character is used to drive that plot and explain a little bit more in the world of PunchLine, and the secrets that it holds.  Overall though, I felt as if the characters really didn\'t make all that much sense.  The protagonist is essentially non-existent for the majority of the show, and all of the girls just don\'t really seem that interesting to me personally.  The side characters don\'t really have much going for them since they\'re mainly used to explain things, so their use is quite limited.Overview:-  Almost non-existent protagonist-  Female heroines felt bland-  Side characters are mostly just plot devicesArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 6.01/10): The art for Punchline was made by Mappa, a relatively new animation studio that\'s been up and coming as of late at the time of this review.  Punchline\'s animation is a style that relies mostly on a neon colored scheme, using a lot of bright colors on its palette.  Honestly, the art for the series is relatively nice looking.  It definitely has a unique feel to it.In terms of sound, there\'s really not much to say.  Aside from the OP being somehow really addicting with its repeating word ""Punchline"" at the beginning, there\'s not really much to say as all of it is pretty forgettable and not really memorable.Overview:+ Good art-  Forgettable musicPersonal Enjoyment (3.00/10): Admittedly...I don\'t really like Punchline.  While many people have seen it as a great experimentation of a new kind of story, really....I don\'t actually see it.  Instead, I see a very broken story with only being fed little bits of information that really don\'t constitute much of anything because we\'re given such minute amounts that while it does have an impact, doesn\'t really impact me as a viewer in a grave way as to how I view the story and all that.Did I enjoy this anime?Not...really.  I found it more to be confusing than anything.What didn\'t I like about this anime?The first half really felt completely pointless to me.  Until you get to the latter half, then things start to make actual sense.  But until then, confusion just took ahold of my head because I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  There was all sorts of plot convenience, pigeon heads...  To be honest, I have absolutely no idea what I watched because it didn\'t really make sense to me.Would I recommend this anime?Personally, I didn\'t like it.  But because it has such a varying opinion, I feel like it\'s worth a shot.  It\'s very similar to FLCL in the sense that both shows have that sense of randomness and they\'re both shows that can have varying opinions depending on who\'s watching them.  There\'s slight ecchi, but there\'s not a whole lot to honestly worry about.Overall Score: 6.43/10 could in a rather...peculiar situation.  For one thing, he was just in a bus crash.  For another thing, he\'s a ghost who is now away from his physical body.  And third, according to the ghost cat that he finds himself hanging around, if he sees a girl\'s underwear twice in a row, his excitement level will cause the world to end, thus creating the apocalypse.  Well, uh...that\'s...that\'s quite a predicament.On the surface, Punch Line seems to be nothing more than a slice of ecchi, as the main grab from the show is apparently this ghost guy now trying to be careful in his dorm filled with girls to not try and see their underwear twice in a row.  But when you really get into it, not everything is as it seems.  The plot for Punch Line is one that I feel is one that is one that requires a lot of attention.  You see, the show itself has very different first and second halves, basically saying that depending on which part of the show you\'re on, you\'ll be watching something that differs greatly from what you would be seeing previously.  You see, there really is no consistency in Punch Line itself on account of every episode being something different, both answering and asking new questions at the same time as the plot unfolds for this show.Personally, I feel like the show is actually a Punchline for itself, seeing as how for the first six episodes, it\'s basically all setup giving a rather...unsavory viewing experience because it raises a lot more questions that answers before everything kinda makes sense in episode 7.  The fact that you have to sit through half the show focusing on something that seems like it doesn\'t actually pertain to the show\'s premise at all is something that I feel like makes the show a lot less appealing than it actually may be.

Thank you Ushikoshi, i've never played your games so i didn't exactly know what to expect from you even with what i've heard. Punchline was waaay better than what i expected and this is pretty much the hidden gem of this season.This review is pretty much what i thought exactly after watching the ending so ... sorry if there's a weird sentence or somethign like that.I can't talk too much about the story but what i can say is this : After an incident happened in a bus, the soul of our MC Yuuta separates from his body but surprise...and now his spirit wanders around his apartment. However he has a mission : Save the Earth from an asteroid hitting the planet and destroy it. Oh, and if he gets too excited while seeing panties the earth is doomed. So yeah ... thats pretty much the only things i can say. Which is pretty much what you can read on the page of the anime. That was pointless.Anyway, the art is really good, the animation it reminds me of Kill la kill and other stuff done by Trigger and Gainax and its done very well most of time. Anyway, in my case i like that style so .. that's a plus. The action is really good too, thats something you'll really enjoy it !The soundtrack is really good and varied. The OST of Punchline is a least less forgetable than a good chunk of anime these days and goes well with what happens in the scene and can get you pumped or sad.The characters are good, but thats pretty much it. I have to say that they are pretty much are forgetable beside Meika and the cat, Chiranosuke. Still they have their moments. Again, i'm not gonna talk about it too much because ... yeah. Let's just say that they are pretty stereotypical at the beginning and after a while stuff happens.So yeah, you've read that i didn't say a lot and there's a reason. Punchline starts off with a pretty strong first episode but after that, you might get turned off by it. However, don't drop it. Ooooh don't do it because a little bit before the first half this is where the fun really start with a lot of plot-twist and a really good ending. You know like Madoka magica that starts off like a cute magica girl anime and starts being dark after a couple of episodes ? Yeah, it's pretty much the case here. It starts like an Ecchi/Comedy. It just takes more time to really start. It's totally worth it. Don't look at the rating, it's pretty low because a lot of people dropped it and gave it a bad rating before the good part.One last thing : The comedy sucked most of the time.TL;DR : The anime is really good. Some episodes in the first half are crap imo. The rest is reeaaaally good.Overall, 8/10. and now his spirit wanders around his apartment.

If you see panties, the world ends. Which is exactly what this show seems to be about. Even still, despite it seeming to be a simple ecchi comedy, slice of life series, it doesn't stop it from being hilariously fascinating but why is it fascinating? Well that stems from it's creative writing and some-what unique plot progression. I say unique simple because of the way it's presented, at times we're introduced to certain events that, at first, seems completely random or just forced but turn out to make somewhat sense...once they explain it as or after the event occurs. This may seem like it's a bad thing but on the contrary it's actually reasonable for a series such as this, one thing to note is the pacing of this show. The pacing is somewhat high, whilst this is usually a bad thing in Punchline's case it isn't. I feel like a show like Punchline can only work at high pace or else it may just not click like it originally did with me but that's a completely subjective matter.Now as for the other reason as to why it's fascinating, the writing in this show may seem dumb at times but that's just the tip of the iceberg, let me explain. At first we're led to believe (minor spoiler) that the main plot of this show is to get Yuta back into his original body but as we move along the episodes we can see that isn't the only objective, I feel like the writers are deliberately misleading us with cliches to make more of an impact in whatever's to come. Overall the story of Punchline is really fun and fascinating, hell even the fanservice seems necessary for the show to progress but unfortunately that aspect's not for everyone.The characters of this series aren't really unique, they're pretty much characters that we've seen in many other series but the characters in this series are what brings it to life. We're introduced to pretty much all the main characters in the first couple of episodes, that allowed us to establish each of the characters traits thus allowing the story to flourish properly. Pretty much all the characters have received some sort of developments whether it be a tragic past that adds depth the character or strong bonds that you didn't think could exist.As for the animation, what can I say? I think MAPPA did a great job on animating a series like this, they paid attention to small details like the facial expressions and *cough* panties *cough* along with some great action scenes which judging from there past works was to be expected. I would definitely say that this was one of the better animated shows this year and my god am I glad MAPPA got the opportunity to do something like this. As for the sound, I think the OST fits this show perfectly, for example, scenes that usually wont have much of an impact on you tend to do because of how well the OST's where used. As for the opening and ending of this show, there's not much to really say. They're average but they fit the show so there's really nothing wrong about them.Overall, I know it seems like I'm praising this show too much but that just shows how much it clicked with me. I'm fully aware that the synopsis of this show may put many people of but I highly recommend you stick with it at least until the 4th episode. once they explain it as or after the event occurs.

Boy do I regret that now! Around episode 5 things got really interesting and I was hooked on the story, characters and ambiance of the show. It's so fun but at the same time it has the right amount of comedy to action/drama ratio, and even some feels!Story - 8I found the story for Punch Line fun, but lukewarm up until about episode 5, where the real story came into its own. It's a pretty ridiculous premise...that can only be appreciated by viewing, not by having it explained to you! Despite it being so zany, the plot really doesn't FEEL ridiculous in the context of the world presented and the characters, so it's really enjoyable to watch everything unfold and be party to what is happening in each of the character's lives. It's a pretty basic saving the world type plot on the surface, but in reality every part of what you see is important to some degree and even the first few episodes, whilst not gripping, contain some important scene setting components and clues.Art - 9The art is what initially drew me to Punch Line, it has a bit of a Kill La Kill vibe, although I'd go so far as to say it's more colourful. Lines are clean and crisp, and the colours are very saturated and bright but not too bright that it would burn your eyes out. I love the character designs and each of them has their own palette which was brought out nicely, too, in their room designs, which made each of them feel unique (not just having the standard anime room with little embellishments and no personality).Sound - 8Sound is usually something I notice less in anime (with the exception of the voices, of course) but I LOVED the score used in Punch Line. The action scenes had punchy music that would get you excited for what was about to happen and the more sombre moments had fitting music too. Comedic moments and their associated sounds were timed perfectly making for some truly hilarious moments.Voice actors did a stellar job, Rie Kugimiya especially is worth mentioning for me here as often I find her voice to have a quality I don't enjoy listening to, but I found her to be more toned-down and less squeaky in this anime and I really enjoyed her performance.Character - 9The characters are what held the most charm for me in this anime (as they should in any anime, I suppose). Each character had a purpose and role to play in the grand scheme of things within the anime, there was no token character or character who made no sense. I also enjoyed the fact that they weren't really moulded to fit within tropes, as so many characters are in anime.I found Yuuta, the protagonist, clever and charismatic, unlike most male leads he had a backbone and worked out things himself instead of having deus ex machinas appear to progress the plot and conveniently show up when he is in a pinch.Chiranosuke, the cat spirit, I honestly found hilarious. Some may find him annoying but I warmed to him very early on when he goes to show Yuuta something on the computer and..let's just say he gets the wrong page. A very relate-able experience for many, I'm sure.I found all of the girls held their own ground in this anime so I felt really involved in their world, they were believable within the context, each had their quirks but each was ultimately a strong, fighting individual who knew her own mind, which is also a nice thing to see.I thoroughly enjoyed Punch Line once I picked it back up, it has more surface qualities like great art and animation, and great sound track, but when you look past face value there is loads to appreciate deeper down in the anime, such as a great story and lovable cast of characters. There are comedic moments which made me laugh, tense scenes which had me practically sitting on the edge of my seat needing to know what the outcome would be, action-filled scenes (though honestly this isn't the main draw of this anime as it's so short) which felt exciting and even a couple of tear-jerking scenes.Highly recommended for a fun afternoon watch. that can only be appreciated by viewing, not by having it explained to you!

Well not too serious I would presume, but this anime may take itself too seriously for it’s concept.Story - 3/10The story of Punch Line is kind of a complex one. It may sound simple, but not at all. Punch Line follows the story of Yuuta Iridatsu as he tries to save the world. How does he do that one may ask, well we don’t really figure that out till episode 6. But the premise of the story is that Yuuta has been transformed into...a ghost and there is a big gigantic meteor coming down to destroy the world, and the key to stopping the meteor is apparently spending time in an apartment lot and figuring out how to stop the meteor? However the world can also be destroyed if Yuuta sees panties as well, twice that is in a short amount of time. So he’s got to figure out how to save the world while keeping himself away from panties. The story is rather confusing until episode 6 when it all starts making sense. But the premise of the plot is time traveling, because Yuuta must gather as much information as he can from the present in order to travel back to the past to prevent the meteor from hitting, thus looking for a better future.The whole idea about spending time as an onlooker to figuring out how to change time is a confusing concept indeed. It is hard to understand the story, when everything just looks so normal with little plot happening in them. And the story is kind of boring pre episode 6, because you don’t know exactly what is happening and even after episode 6, it kind of repeats itself and you still don’t know the full extent on what is going on. The backstory in Punch Line is vaguely touched upon, sure we see it, but we don’t know how and why it’s happening. And the plot takes itself way too seriously, it gets very dramatic for a show that was supposed to be a comedy, and it doesn’t work well because it’s all very hard to take in. And honestly I don’t think the payoff was that worth it. Even the twist at episode 6 felt very predictable.Characters - 3/10Yuuta Iridatsu is the main protagonist, he’s goal is save the world while trying to avoid from looking up panties as well. From what we can see he’s just as confuse as we are, he doesn’t understand why he has superpowers when he looks up girls panties, he doesn’t know why he’s a ghost and he doesn’t understand what is going on. It’s like the writer did that on purpose to symbolise us in him, and I’m not sure that’s a good thing. We came for the ecchi, but we’re confused with the story. There is also rather little character development for him as we just see him having the same attitude throughout the rest of show, where he is a guy living with a bunch of girls trying to avoid them, while being nice and also trying to be the hero, with the will to save everyone as best as he can.Other characters that make up residents of the apartment lot are, Mikatan Narugino who also has superhero persona and has little development as she pretty portrays the happy girl. Ito Hikiotani, a NEET spends most of her time on the computer, however has more development over the course of the series than the other mains as she starts to get more involved with the people around her. Meika Daihatsu who is a mechanic and the landlord serves as the guardian to pretty much everyone. And lastly there is Rabura Chichibu, who despite her incompetency is shown to be a very reliable spiritual medium as the series progress.Unfortunately I don’t the main cast was all that good, as I was so caught up in trying to understand the situations to get a clearer picture of the characters. By the end of the series they felt like they were just used to show their individual talents in the last battle, because honestly their interactions with each other was kind of boring. And I would go on to the some of the other supporting characters if one of the characters didn’t really annoy the hell out of me. Seriously SCREW THE CAT.Animation and Sound - 6/10. 7/10The art style I can’t complain too much, because although it doesn’t look bad, it doesn’t look anything great as well. The shape of the characters feel a lot more rounded than other animes and the colour palette felt very simple, although some of the scenes looked very childish in a good way as it reflects on the characters rather well, and it shows the show is not a serious show to begin with. However the action scenes although that last one is completely fine, everything else before it is nothing special at all. And it does suffer have some frame rate problems, but none to breaking. As a personal opinion, I’m not a huge fan on this kind of anime art style, as it just looks very simplistic and a bit messy for me with the more rounded nature in the designs of the characters. I mean if their supposed to be adults and teenagers, how come they look like pre-teen kids.I actually kind of enjoy the soundtrack of Punch Line. Although the opening and ending songs are nothing to write home about they’re find perfectly accept. The opening theme maybe a bit catchy, in a bad way. However it’s not too annoying. The OST for the show is a mixture of J-pop and rock. Which I find quite enjoyable to listen to. I especially like it even more when they have their many variety of electro music kicking in. I like how they have almost a different OST for each situation, which gives it a huge variety and it usually does the job in fitting in with the scene. As for the voice acting, it’s fine and acceptable. But seriously SCREW THE CAT.Enjoyment - 3/10I did not enjoy watching Punch Line because I could not get my head around the story. Not only was it a hard story to follow, it was quite a boring one at the same time. The show does get a tad better after episode 6, but that felt too long before anything interesting starts happening and even then, it felt like it repeated right after. Also the fact the story takes itself way too seriously, when the concept is stupid to begin with. The comedy in the show has very little impact, as some of the jokes weren’t really all that funny and gets kind of repetive. The last fight scene wasn’t bad and the soundtrack was enjoyable, but I don’t t feel that’s enough to make it enjoyable. Especially if the characters are lacking and aren’t as interesting. And seriously SCREW THE CAT.Verdict - 4.5/10For the story I give it a 3, as the story is confusing and uninteresting to begin with. It takes way too long to go anywhere and the payoff wasn’t really worth it. Also the fact that the story takes itself way too seriously for such a stupid concept. The story sort of got better at the half way, but that was still too long.For animation and sound I give them a 6 and 7 respectively. Although the animation is good, but not great. Some of the scenes look good and some of them don’t. I’m not a huge fan of the art style, but it shouldn’t affect you all that badly. The soundtrack is actually quite enjoyable and it good to hear there is a variety of different tracks being played throughout the show, and they’re pretty good ones at that.The characters get a 3 from me. As I found little interest in them, and felt like they were just there to fill out a certain role. There is little development in them and the interactions just felt awkward between them. There are a few exceptions for some of the characters such as Ito, and other supports. The characters a bearable and not too annoying. However for the last time seriously, SCREW THE CAT.For my personal enjoyment I give it a 3. Because it was very hard following this show, plus I’m not a huge fan of the art style. It looked quite simplistic and the story didn’t feel like it fitted well with the art style. Some of the fight scenes and music are enjoyable, but that’s it, I couldn’t delve very deep into the characters as I didn’t find them all too interesting. And the jokes weren’t all that funny to begin with as well.So for the final score after rounding it all I up, I give Punch Line a 4.5/10. It feels like a below average anime was being made, which is reflected upon the art style, although it’s perfectly fine if the plot wasn’t so serious and dramatic and should’ve been more silly like the concept. If you want to watch Punch Line go ahead, but if you’re looking for the ecchi there’s not that much and if you’re looking for something weird, there are plenty of better options out there. a ghost and there is a big gigantic meteor coming down to destroy the world, and the key to stopping the meteor is apparently spending time in an apartment lot and figuring out how to stop the meteor?

Too often, an anime series that is considered ecchi would have no qualms whatsoever to deliver a decent, substantial story. However, Punch Line’s case, if the series is ever considered ecchi, is different. The series presents that substantial story we were all looking for plus many more things that we all would love in an anime series.The story is a roller coaster ride I might say, one that would keep you in grips. Between conspiracies, superheroes, strange occult stuff you never knew existed, and that seemingly inevitable asteroid, you will...never know where it will go. It amazes me how Punch Line weaves its elements together to for one intricate, exciting, and well-developed story. It reveals but not too much at one time, giving the show a generous amount of suspense and cleverness. The narrative is well pace and all too good with the plot twists and the oh-damn-I-didn’t-see-that-coming moments.Punch Line also pokes innocent fun at different anime tropes and clichés – unlikely superheroes, genius inventors, giant robots, idols singing about just anything under the sun (stacking buns higher than the Burj Khalifa), and, of course, panty shots. It is not malicious or anything.  It should be pointed out that this element was incorporated into the story smoothly.The visuals may not be unlike anything I have ever seen before, but MAPPA outdid themselves here. It is nice to watch that the studio did not spare any effort putting it all together. Just like the story, the designs are quirky, spunky, and creative and there is not a lagging moment in the animation (heck, even the panty shots are nicely drawn). It is indeed well thought of and excellently crafted.I was surprised to find out that there were going to be at least three occult-related anime series released this season. For some reason, I picked up Punch Line, maybe because it had the most ridiculous synopsis. Well, what could go wrong?Absolutely nothing. Everything about Punch Line is beyond expectation. It is not sad fan service (the type we consider detrimental to the industry). It embodies what anime studios should at least consider in creating a series – pure, innocent, and well-meaning fun. If you’re thrown by the ecchi (which is almost non-existent in the series by the way) or maybe even the synopsis, I will say about Punch Line what I have always said about Kill la Kill: Don’t drop it, give it some time, and pay attention. If you’re planning to overlook the series, then you’re going to miss out on a lot.Loaded with laughs, twists, and a whole lot of nosebleed-inducing panty shots, Punch Line shines as one of the season’s most outstanding anime series. Added to that, it is a quirky, fun-filled must-watch. I would recommend this to anyone with enough sense not to judge a book by its cover. never know where it will go.

It has a pretty decent story and pretty good characters. Yet it isn't getting as much love as it deserves. There is a reason for that. Basically, the creators of punchline basically fucked up in attracting anyone to the series. The first few episodes are pure randomness and I mean PURE RANDOMNESS. Because of that people just rated it because of their first impressions which I see to be pretty common here. Once you get past episode 6 you will start understanding the story and when...that happens there is a very high chance you will enjoy it.Thanks for reading this short review. If you want more please like. that happens there is a very high chance you will enjoy it.Thanks for reading this short review. If you want more please like."", 'The last part of a story or a joke that explains the meaning of what happened previously which intends to provoke laughter or thought.A pun on “panchira” that literally means panty shot in Japanese which the show wears on its sleeve.Or both?There are anime that follow the bait and switch formula, and this is one of them.[Story]- “That sounds like something from a video game.”With a tagline so ridiculous that says “If he sees underwear, humanity will be destroyed!?” this must be the one of those typical ecchi harems, right? There’s much more to Punchline than by solely judging it from the divisive premise....(Hint: The protagonist isn’t the cause why the world is destroyed when he sees panties, he fails to save it if he sees too much).Original story by MAGES, distilled into a 12 episode anime by Kotaro Uchikoshi (Ever17, Zero Escape). While there are many anime that model after MMORPGs, Punchline’s structure is pulled out from adventure games.We follow the odyssey of a boy named Yuta Iridatsu. On December 21st, he is taken hostage on a hijacked bus by a terrorist group. He catches a glimpse of panties which gives him a power up, and tackles the bad guy. But sees panties again, and passes out. After that, he is zapped by a yellow light in the sky. He wakes up in his apartment, confused, and finds out that he’s separated from his own body. The only help he receives is from a crazy ghost cat, named Chiranosuke, that explains his situation and abilities. Yuta uses his newfound powers to protect his house mates from danger.Unfortunately, because of Yuta’s idiosyncratic condition, he must avoid seeing panties twice, or else he loses consciousness, and as a spirit, time jumps to a point when an impending giant asteroid destroys Earth. What is going on exactly? For now, I’ll just quote the crazy talking cat, “You don’t have to over think it.”I won’t say more and make sense of what Punchline is, because it will involve spoilers. The story really is about the daily lives of the Korai House residents in a span of 10 days, and how they fight fate. It doesn’t make much sense in the convoluted first half of the series, still it bids full attention as it won’t really spoonfeed the details later. How the scattered puzzle pieces form together is a satisfying experience, the way it executes its story resembles Baccano! or Durarara!![Visuals]- “Huh? I’m in my apartment!?”MAPPA delivers in aesthetics. As an anime that is damn casual with it’s panty shots, they even have a legit good Lingerie Designer, Uemura Hiromi for that. The panties shown all over the show are pretty, and you can easily tell which girl it is based on the type they wear. Punchline can easily be mistaken as an anime from Gainax or Trigger because of the art style, it’s not surprising because the staff really are from Gainax. It’s the second time for Uemura Yutaka as a director. I like how Punchline is visually pleasing with its use of color pallete and expressive faces, but I’ll complain about the weak direction of two setup episodes because it felt like watching filler even if they weren’t. The colorful 3d CG interior of the Korai House designed by Mai Yoneyama is gorgeous, each room subtly shows a lot about the character who lives in it without outright telling us. Shota Iwasaki (Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill) is one skilled character designer. Every character is iconic and varied in appearance, no sameface, different sizes, skin types, cute outfits, and no boring school uniforms. My favorite is Yuta’s androgynous design, who knew?[Sound]- “The song earlier was a sign that there’s an emergency!”The sound effects are cool and full of impact, like the sound when a character activates Uber and the punchy sounds that give every hit in fights more intense. The OP composed by Hyadain (Nichijou, Baka to Test) is catchy, that pumps you up when the show starts, and the ED is very cute. The voice cast are all talents (except the Engrish parts, the thick Japanese accent was too obvious), every single character’s voice stands out, and sounded like they had fun with their roles with all the swapping shenanigans. Marina Inoue’s performance as Yuta is brilliant. Tetsuya Komuro did a good job with the OST, tracks I particularly like are [Strange Juice Action] when the heroine kicks ass, [Destruction] pulls my heart strings, and [Pressure] when shit starts to go down.[Character]- “I can’t believe Narugino is Strange Juice.”Punchline has an interesting cast of characters. Will only introduce the tenants here and avoid spoiler characters.Yuta, a boy that has a panty fetish. He’s one of the most unusual protagonists I ever met (you know what I mean). A big fan of Seas May. His life is turned upside-down after someone stole his body. Yuta cares deeply for people close to him, has an altruistic outlook, but tends to make rash actions. He starts of clueless, and a passive observer (he’s a spirit!) as he tries to figure out what’s happened to him. He gets more active later on when he gets used to his powers after the midpoint shift of the series, and eventually leads to form a secret organization called “Justice Punch,” that strives to save the world from destruction.The ally of justice, Mikatan. She is a country bumpkin from Tsugaru but hides it so she can be member of the idol group Seas May. Despite her a dark past, she’s the most cheerful and just wants everyone to get along, though a bit of a ditz. Mikatan may be sweet and nice, but she’s not soft. Harm the weak or her friends and you’ll get a beatdown. Mikatan is actually the famous superhero called “Strange Juice” but keeps that a secret. Has a crush on Yuta. Does not like turtles.Meika, a genius at anything mechanical, but bad at athletic things like handstands. The landlady of the Korai House, which she inherited from her grandpa. She’s protective of the apartment and doesn’t allow anyone who damages the property. Meika likes to troll the tenants for giggles. She possesses vast intelligence on certain topics. She names her fancy inventions with -maker at the end. Meika is actually Strange Juice’s assistant, called “Pumpkin Chair”.A hikkikomori and otaku, Ito. Ito is actually the legendary mech-FPS-gamer called “Torahachiro.” She’s enrolled in an elite private all-girls school but became a NEET because of a traumatic event. Ito’s dad is an education board member and disowned her once once she stopped going to school. She’s blunt, and can get aggressive. Ito prefers to spend most of her time playing online games. She loves to keep animals.Rabura, a single 29 year old woman who’s desperate to find a lover. She’s from a family of skilled exorcists and works as a spirit medium, but ironically thinks she’s no good at it, and doesn’t believe in the supernatural herself. Owns a pet turtle. She ships Mikatan and Yuta. She’s also Ito’s big cousin and is not happy of her not going to school. Rabura gets pissed whenever Meika comments about her search for men.The pet sidekick, Chiranosuke. It enjoys cracking jokes, drinking alcohol and not being helpful to Yuta. The talking cat’s origins remain a mystery.The characters are a dynamic bunch. However, 12 episodes just weren’t enough to give them equal development.[Overall]- “To a supremely happy and peaceful future.”The humor of show is more subjective than usual due to several puns that are lost in translation. Personally, the juvenile silliness leaves me a smile often. The panty nonsense doesn’t bother me because it’s presented in an exaggerated tongue-in-cheek way, like it’s not intended to titillate, and it’s mostly plot relevant too. The anime knows when it needs to be quirky and funny, it also knows when it needs to be dead serious. The show is also rewatchable, there’s a lot of detail that might not be noticed the first time, or a second or third time.If you need to avoid panties like our hero Yuta for some reason or allergic to constant mood whiplashes, then stay away at all costs. If you don’t mind a fun screwy sci-fi mystery, then this anime is surely not to miss. I recommend a marathon watch. Maybe you can figure out the punchline.

It enjoys cracking jokes, drinking alcohol and not being helpful to Yuta. The talking cat’s origins remain a mystery.The characters are a dynamic bunch. However, 12 episodes just weren’t enough to give them equal development.[Overall]- “To a supremely happy and peaceful future.”The humor of show is more subjective than usual due to several puns that are lost in translation. Personally, the juvenile silliness leaves me a smile often. The panty nonsense doesn’t bother me because it’s presented in an exaggerated tongue-in-cheek way, like it’s not intended to titillate, and it’s mostly plot relevant too. The anime knows when it needs to be quirky and funny, it also knows when it needs to be dead serious. The show is also rewatchable, there’s a lot of detail that might not be noticed the first time, or a second or third time.If you need to avoid panties like our hero Yuta for some reason or allergic to constant mood whiplashes, then stay away at all costs. If you don’t mind a fun screwy sci-fi mystery, then this anime is surely not to miss. I recommend a marathon watch. Maybe you can figure out the punchline.', ""Let me start off by saying that the only reason I started watching Punch Line in the first place is because the concept seemed ridiculous enough to provide some laughs. I mean, based on everything I had seen, it looked like any common ecchi. Like many reviewers have already stated, that's how it started out. It interested me at first and I was excited to watch it but eventually it became more like a chore as the attention grabbing features became muted and the less than subtle panty shots took over. However, by the time it got to the fifth episode (I think that's what...it was but don't hold me on it), everything changed.Story (7/10)Punch Line began without a strong story or any real sense of direction. The opening act of the show appeared to be merely a series of disconnected gags with no purpose. Even for myself, someone who finds great enjoyment in cheap comedy and slice of life, found the show to be a bore. Let me tell you though, it was so worth it to stick with the show. All the things that seemed dumb began to make sense. All the random threads were being connected. All the characters I didn't care for became important to me. The show just began to work. I don't want to spoil anything here so I won't be specific about anything so I'll just say this: the show stops being a show about panties and becomes a dynamic adventure with elements, plot threads, and emotions you'd never think could come from a show with a main character who seems to have more blood in his general nose area than a normal person has in their whole body. The only reason I gave the story a 7 is because that slow part does really put a dent in it. If they had found a way to make that more entertaining that would be a different case.Art (8/10)I don't think this section needs to be as long winded as the story section (yeah sorry about that) so I'll just get right to it. Is the art great? No, not particularly. But is it bad? Certainly not. The art style does however fit  the overall tone of the story very well. It's not too detailed and it shouldnt be. It's not generic either. It has enough imagination and individuality to make it stand out, even if just a little.Sound (7/10)I usually don't pay attention to soundtracks unless they are particularly good. Meaning if they are just average I tend not to notice them. That is Punch Line. I don't mean to say the soundtrack is bad, it's just kind of there. It normally did its job (although the score underperformed in some scenes) and generally blended in quite well. But if I can't remember a single tune after watching the show, it didn't have much of an impact. However, I did like the opening and ending themes a lot. The opening in particular was very catchy and lighthearted, much like the show itself.Character (9/10)Punch Line did an excellent job in portraying it's characters. The show made me feel a connection to the cast and not all shows can do that. Everyone is unique and has his or her own demons and/or motives. It was fun to go on the ride with them. Sure there we some cliches, but they weren't so glaringly obvious that they couldn't be looked past. Plus the protagonist, Yuta, was very likable for me and if the protagonist sucks than...oh well.Enjoyment (9/10)I freaking loved this show. Sure it had its down time, but all the rest more than made up for it. I was so surprised by this show that I expected nothing out of. Out of nowhere it became one of my favorite shows of the season, maybe even my favorite. I was just so pleasently surprised I just couldn't help but enjoy it immensely. And just in case you're worried, yes it was funny. I made it seem like it wasn't but it really was.Overall (9/10)Hats off to Punch Line here. If you are able to stick with it through the first 4 or 5 episodes I believe you will find it is worth it. Everything comes together in only the way Punch Line can do it (and the only way that makes sense). Your efforts will be rewarded and then some.This is my first review so go easy on me here. I'm not quite sure what exactly I should be saying yet.

I'm not quite sure what exactly I should be saying yet. I'll do better next time!"", 'The only thing more mystifying than the existence of Punch Line is the reception it got from the anime community upon release. Not necessarily the violent levels of hatred it got given the premise - although anyone who saw the PV should have been prepared for what was to come long ago - but for some specific bile they used to discredit it itself. FLCL without a clear direction or identity you say? First of all, if something doesn\'t have an identity, than how it can possibly be compared to something else? Second, who exactly made that shitty comparison to begin with?I\'ve compared Bruno Mattei...to a piece of cheese, and yet I don\'t see how the two anime are similar in the least. FLCL established from the start that it\'d be a story about a kid struggling with inner demons, whilst Punch Line established at its start that it\'d be about a boy being thrown into an unfamiliar situation, Silent Hill-style if Silent Hill replaced the horrifying monsters and dense fog with horrifying anime girls and dense wackiness. They couldn\'t be more different. A closer comparison would have been if you matched Punch Line up with...well, Silent Hill. The most accurate comparison would have been if you compared it to Steins;Gate or Madoka aka ""the best anime of 2011"" according to most people. In fact, I can just see those three anime being siblings with the former two having grown up to be mega-successful corporate sell-outs whilst the latter is the black sheep that nobody loves because he\'s ugly and misunderstood and the only one who\'ll so much as breathe the same air as him is Samurai Flamenco.Sorry for spoiling some important plot points to those who get the references, but considering how so many fans of them will probably never watch this show (and non-fans probably won\'t either), I don\'t think anyone\'s going to cry about it. I mean have you seen the ratings this show is getting in Japan? Even Glee at its worst is laughing at \'em. But yes, Punch Line is basically Steins;Gate\'s story combined with Madoka\'s execution, except with magical girls replaced by Flamenco-esque superheroes that fight with the finesse insanity of a character from Air Master. And the result? Not bad. Not great, but the fact that it has so much bile thrown at it compared to Steins;Gate or Madoka is very confusing to me.Punch Line is admittedly a very off-putting anime, even once you discover what it\'s really about. I mean I knew right away that it\'d be an anime about time traveling in order to stop disaster and I still had moments when I couldn\'t really dig deep into it. I\'ve made it clear that I\'m not a fan of the visual novel structure and that even the best of what comes from “visual novel writer” anime can\'t get away from having entire episodes devoted to boring setup and explanations that don’t progress things in any real way. This is particularly obnoxious in the second half when after a really hilarious reveal regarding who’s who and what’s what, the show repeats events from the first few episodes from a different perspective. It would have been fine if the reveals actually progressed things, but all they did was make me go “yeah, I kinda figured. Can we go back to playing that dramatic music again, please?”As for my opinion on the panty antics, I honestly don’t give two shits. I don’t usually like ecchi humor (actually, I’ve never liked ecchi humor), but it’s not an automatic turn-off for me...1% of the time. I was sold on following the show when I realized that despite the first episode telling you otherwise, Yuta’s nosebleeds don’t cause the destruction of the world so much as make him time travel to said destruction. That little flash-forward bit that happened right after his first eruption as a ghost wasn’t exactly subtle about it. So I figured seeing if they can follow through on this “end of the world” conspiracy and tolerated how he has to act like a pervert in order to turn into a Super Saiyan. That said, I’m not really sure why he has to do that considering everyone else seems to have no problems powering up themselves. I know he has body issues, but so do some of the other characters, and I very much doubt the author had gender differences in mind in regards to the issue apart from a cheap gag.Not to say that the comedy is good. But for what it’s worth, it’s not bad when it’s not focusing on making the main character try to relive the early to mid-00s. There are a couple of moments that made me laugh like Miyazawa Kenji before the show realized his true identity was more obvious than a 50-foot tall giant hunchback trying to blend in on the Mayflower. However, for a show called Punch Line, I’d have expected an ending that blew my expectations so much that I’d crack up harder than Ed from The Lion King after going through a large amount of coke. But no, the show plays out rather fittingly climactic before ending on another panty joke. Not a bad thing as most VN adaptations tend to chicken out with some awkwardly crowbarred-in “true ending shit” that ruin the flow when you bring it to the moving picture medium. Still, I felt it could have been stronger. Maybe I missed one of Uchikoshi’s many hidden messages. I dunno.With regards to the actual story, my issue with it is that it doesn’t really push its agenda hard enough. I know it\'s common in visual novel-type stories to mask characters\' personal turmoil by having them act like anime stereotypes, but it\'s also common in light novel adaptations to have heroines whose bust is three sizes too large break the laws of physics or for our Republicans to hate the legalization of gay marriage across the country, so I wouldn\'t go around using that as a defense if I were you. More than though, whilst the show actually tackles many of the political grudges and youth culture issues that Japan is suffering from underneath all the wackiness, it doesn’t really say much that you wouldn’t know about them other than saying we should fight ‘em with a giant robot, which isn’t applicable to the real world at all unless Japan has a secret facility they’re not telling us about. It also doesn’t say too much about superheroes either that you haven’t seen before. In fact, it’s actually kind of standard with the only thing standing out is that all the sentai members are female.But there is one standout clever moment in the end, and without getting too spoiler-y, it involves a sacrifice that whilst kinda predictable and nothing all that new in theory, is pretty f*cked up when you think about it. Could it have been a metaphor for how Japan’s youth will always suffer for its crimes? Is it a subversion of the childhood-friend trio trope? Honestly, it could be, but I don’t care enough about the show to analyze it. Maybe if said scene wasn’t succeeded by another panty gag...Punch Line isn’t leaving this review without a positive grade from me, but said grade has a bit of a noticeable minus-sign next to it if you know what I mean. Whilst a good majority of the show is solid enough, it succumbs to the same middling lows expected of VN writing and the only thing that really amazes is the visual style. And that takes a noticeable hit during the middle stretch because in order to make the finale as impressive as possible - which they succeeded at quite spectacularly mind you - compromises have to be made, and Mappa aren’t exactly KyoAni/Bones in terms of raking in the dough. Still, as a fan of animation and what can be accomplished with it, Punchline does a fine job of satisfying that itch, so if you want to see what the medium can accomplish and aren’t deathly allergic to panty/nosebleed humor and Rie Kugimiya’s nasally voice, check it out.Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to look at that other Spring 2015 “visual novel writer” anime that people seem to think is a much better series and stomp holes into its pristine soullessness with all the ferocity of a kangaroo riding a jackhammer. to a piece of cheese, and yet I don\'t see how the two anime are similar in the least.

If the premise weirds you out, don’t worry, the fan service is scarcer than you think. I had that thought when I finished the first episode, but I put my faith into the writer, and he did not disappoint.The art style, the character designs, and the characters are great. They’re wonderful, and I appreciate the friendship they have. The underwear designs were well-done and beautiful. Seriously, as a woman myself, I loved them and wanted them for myself. The fight scenes are spectacular....As for the plot, it goes the way you expect a Uchikoshi plot to go. There’s twists and turns, robots, and of course multiple timelines. It wouldn’t be a Uchikoshi game without multiple timelines. I did enjoy it, and I think everything really comes together.The music wasn’t that amazing but it was acceptable and appropriate for each scene.For his first foray into anime, Uchikoshi hit it out of the park. I’m not surprised that it’s a sleeper hit though. Maybe it’s just a curse, since all of his work is super underrated, yet it’s really good. If you’ve made it this far into the review and enjoyed my ramblings, please check out the Zero Escape series and the AI the Somnium Files series if you haven’t. Both of them are excellent and they’re written by Uchikoshi. As for the plot, it goes the way you expect a Uchikoshi plot to go. There’s twists and turns, robots, and of course multiple timelines.

Both of them are excellent and they’re written by Uchikoshi.', 'Spoiler free, most of the fun is being confused and figuring it out, only to be wrong and get slapped in the face with something strange, so I won;t get into to much detail.Punch LinePunch Line starts out as an ecchi comedy with no sense of direction. Just some lame jokes, awkward situations, and pantsu viewing with absurd consequences with no explanation behind it in an attempt to catch you off guard. But you\'ve already been introduced with good foreshadowing into what slowly becomes a convoluted and intriguing mystery, and quite possibly the wildest, ""wtf"" show I have watched (or at least sat through)....Digging deep into the ground of human scientific experiments, mecha, government cover ups, spiritual beings, genetic mutation, militant attacks, time travel, and the space time continuum, it\'s actually pretty decent to a point. Although they continue to dig deeper and deeper til they look up and say, ""oh shit, how are we gonna get out of this fucking hole?"" Well, in short, they don\'t.Story: *sigh* The show starts off a heroine chasing a hijacked bus on her motorcycle. She beats up a few then gets held at gun point. Then PLOT TWIST our MC Yuuta, sees some pantsu, goes SSJ, and tackles the dude with the gun. They fall out of the bus off a bridge into the river. Yuuta then wakes up at his apartment complex as a spirit. then PLOT TWIST. A porn loving ghost cat (don\'t ask), explains that he is experiencing an out of body phenomenon while someone else is possessing his body. He then sets out to find a strange book that the porn cat says he can use to regain his body. That\'s like the first episode, I\'m gonna get into all the insane twists and turns cause it\'s pointless unless I share every detail. But it turns into something far more grand and completely ridiculous than that. For example, when he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he sees pantsu again, PLOT TWIST! his excitement increases, thus triggering a meteor to fall from the sky and end humanity. This happens a couple times. Why? ........ in short, after a sudden PLOT TWIST he joins up with the super hero team Justice Punch who ironically lives with him to save the world from complete annihilation.Characters: Our characters get some decent back story but they\'re all spoilers. They have an mysterious past that is slowly revealed in small detail and are bond by fate/destiny/coincidence/divine intervention then PLOT TWIST!. Yuuta is our main MC and ghost, he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he cares about his friends. Mika-tan is the best character, is very positive and happy, as well as caring for her friends. However, she tends to keep her problems to herself and hide them. PLOT TWIST she\'s obvious from the start that she is the heroine from the opening scene, alter ego, Strange Juice, and a member of the idol group She\'s May. Meika is a genius inventor/hacker, a smart, intelligent and cheerful girl. She is easily upset by simple things, and has been shown to be pushy when it comes to meeting new friends.She runs Korai House, also a member of Justice Punch, known as Pumpkin Chair, she\'s also a PLOT TWIST. Ito appears to be more of a shut-in than a social butterfly. She avoids the others to play video games and surf the web, she can be a bit blunt and rude at times. Rabura is a fishy spiritual medium, everyone thinks shes a fake/con. Cause she can\'t really do shit. She\'s pretty annoying too. Our heroes.......Animation: I guess it\'s pretty decent. Although some of the action left a bit to be desired. The art was very pleasing in design and color. They especially put detail into pantsu, so if that\'s your thing. GG.Sound: I guess it did it\'s job. The OP ED are catchy, and brought good atmosphere to the serious parts, yes it gets serious here and there. Some of the insert songs like She\'s May ""I wanna see your Buns"" during the mock Doki Doki Girls Everywhere Swimsuit event were absolutely historical!!!!! That shit had me in stitches!Enjoyment: It was enjoyable for sure, it had it\'s ups and down at first, but when the back-story and bits and pieces of the mystery unraveled it really gets your attention and becomes compelling with that PLOT TWIST, then again with that PLOT TWIST. Then there\'s these random moments where you can\'t decide what you\'re laughing about. Was it actually funny? Or is it so bad and random that you can\'t help but laugh? The point it falls off unfortunately is the very last episode when PLOT TWIST. It\'s almost like, ""hmmm, I\'m not sure how we can really pull this off, so .... eh, this will work."" It was very unsatisfying to me. And they did such a good job of setting up during the last few eps with that PLOT TWIST just leave me wanting better than that. And anything involving time travel will have it\'s holes, such as the unsolvable chicken and egg paradox, but I feel like the gap they left is understandable, but also just leaves to much possibility to feel satisfied.This show wasn\'t the best by any means, but it\'s so unusual, fun, wild, and filled with PLOT TWISTS I think it\'s worth everybody checking out. Just keep in mind it\'s rather misleading for the first three eps. I was about to drop it, but something about it made me keep watching and I\'m glad I did. 6/10 Digging deep into the ground of human scientific experiments, mecha, government cover ups, spiritual beings, genetic mutation, militant attacks, time travel, and the space time continuum, it\'s actually pretty decent to a point.

A porn loving ghost cat (don\'t ask), explains that he is experiencing an out of body phenomenon while someone else is possessing his body. He then sets out to find a strange book that the porn cat says he can use to regain his body. That\'s like the first episode, I\'m gonna get into all the insane twists and turns cause it\'s pointless unless I share every detail. But it turns into something far more grand and completely ridiculous than that. For example, when he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he sees pantsu again, PLOT TWIST! his excitement increases, thus triggering a meteor to fall from the sky and end humanity. This happens a couple times. Why? ........ in short, after a sudden PLOT TWIST he joins up with the super hero team Justice Punch who ironically lives with him to save the world from complete annihilation.Characters: Our characters get some decent back story but they\'re all spoilers. They have an mysterious past that is slowly revealed in small detail and are bond by fate/destiny/coincidence/divine intervention then PLOT TWIST!. Yuuta is our main MC and ghost, he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he cares about his friends. Mika-tan is the best character, is very positive and happy, as well as caring for her friends. However, she tends to keep her problems to herself and hide them. PLOT TWIST she\'s obvious from the start that she is the heroine from the opening scene, alter ego, Strange Juice, and a member of the idol group She\'s May. Meika is a genius inventor/hacker, a smart, intelligent and cheerful girl. She is easily upset by simple things, and has been shown to be pushy when it comes to meeting new friends.She runs Korai House, also a member of Justice Punch, known as Pumpkin Chair, she\'s also a PLOT TWIST. Ito appears to be more of a shut-in than a social butterfly. She avoids the others to play video games and surf the web, she can be a bit blunt and rude at times. Rabura is a fishy spiritual medium, everyone thinks shes a fake/con. Cause she can\'t really do shit. She\'s pretty annoying too. Our heroes.......Animation: I guess it\'s pretty decent. Although some of the action left a bit to be desired. The art was very pleasing in design and color. They especially put detail into pantsu, so if that\'s your thing. GG.Sound: I guess it did it\'s job. The OP ED are catchy, and brought good atmosphere to the serious parts, yes it gets serious here and there. Some of the insert songs like She\'s May ""I wanna see your Buns"" during the mock Doki Doki Girls Everywhere Swimsuit event were absolutely historical!!!!! That shit had me in stitches!Enjoyment: It was enjoyable for sure, it had it\'s ups and down at first, but when the back-story and bits and pieces of the mystery unraveled it really gets your attention and becomes compelling with that PLOT TWIST, then again with that PLOT TWIST. Then there\'s these random moments where you can\'t decide what you\'re laughing about. Was it actually funny? Or is it so bad and random that you can\'t help but laugh? The point it falls off unfortunately is the very last episode when PLOT TWIST. It\'s almost like, ""hmmm, I\'m not sure how we can really pull this off, so .... eh, this will work."" It was very unsatisfying to me. And they did such a good job of setting up during the last few eps with that PLOT TWIST just leave me wanting better than that. And anything involving time travel will have it\'s holes, such as the unsolvable chicken and egg paradox, but I feel like the gap they left is understandable, but also just leaves to much possibility to feel satisfied.This show wasn\'t the best by any means, but it\'s so unusual, fun, wild, and filled with PLOT TWISTS I think it\'s worth everybody checking out. Just keep in mind it\'s rather misleading for the first three eps. I was about to drop it, but something about it made me keep watching and I\'m glad I did. 6/10', ""Punchline was made by the same people who made Kill la Kill so if you're into the subtle fanservice and string of jokes, Punchline could be totally what you need! I binge watched it after the first episode. And yes the description of Yuuta getting power from a girl's panties is a big keypoint of the plot.  Just believe me however at first the anime seems like any other harem/ecchi with a bunch of fanservice but if you just go through the first episode you can see how great it is with a complex plot and interesting characters. Let's get to it!!Story:8The story is...very fun to solve out with the character and can get you, the viewer, hyped.  The plot is unique but I can't really explain it without spoiling the story, but just look out for:-an evil government-betrayal (dramatic music plays)-body switching-internet gaming-a romantic subplot-ghost possession-panties sending a meteor to kill all life on earthAND MUCH MORE!!!Art:9The art style is just adorable, the lines are smooth and the animation is surprisingly fluid.  The art for the girls (which brings the harem back into play) make them all look unique and have a clear different personality, and the screens between transitions gives the viewer something to stare at.  Of course with such a perverted premise of a boy getting his power from panties, those scenes show have a large importance and the style that's drawn is clear, each panty shot looks detailed and let's the viewer appreciate animation as a whole.Sound:6The soundtrack of Punchline was nothing special, music never really influenced the anime whether it be the scenes or tone of the moment as a whole.  The opening is pretty enjoyable however, it's fun, fast paced, and showcases everything in a fast manner that makes the viewer watch it each time in an attempt to identify everything on screen.  Besides that the OST's were pretty decent, nothing to brag aboutCharacter:7Most characters got some form of closure except for one girl in the shared house, I won't say who as to avoid spoilers but she gets no backstory whatsoever.  Besides this one exception, each character has some form of a unique background that all link back to part of the main conflict and form the main story.  They're all tied by invisible bonds formed years before they knew who was who, and the character development stays consistent and lets the viewer see the character truly grow up.Enjoyment:10I cried while watching this.  Punchline is a fun anime that gets the viewer immersed in the small world it created.  It gets emotional at some points but besides that moment it has moments that could get the meanest people to crack a smile.  Even if moments seem pointless or random, they all tie together and got me thinking of my own friendships.  You can see the girls fight and argue, and it goes further from just another silly fanservice anime if you keep an open mind (panty shots were a nice add in too though).Overall:8The anime 'Punchline' is a favorite of mine, yet it does hold it's flaws.  This review held a VERY biased view over it since it was the first time i watched an entire anime in one sitting at 6 in the morning that I remember clear as day.  It can get emotional while it can also be silly and stupid, but if you give it a chance you could be surprised too.  Punchline holds a nice theme overall of how friendships have to go through hardships and fights so that the people in them can get closer and bond. If you want an anime that'll be easy to watch, or something to get immersed in, try giving Punchline a try. very fun to solve out with the character and can get you, the viewer, hyped.

I'm not that experienced on writing them.Punch Line is an interesting case. It starts out with a ridiculous premise that's enough to make you not want to bother with the show. It leads you to believe it's going to be a story about nothing more than a boy trying his best to avoid looking at panties. In expected fashion, he ends up in situation after situation where seeing panties is unavoidable. Yet out of the blue, it changes into something completely different. It all culminated in a final episode that was, admittedly, pretty well done. It was quite...the surprising bait and switch. So why the 7? Well let's get down to it.I won't spoil anything, but I will say there's a pretty interesting plot twist a few episodes in. As soon as that twist happened, the show felt like it suddenly took a bit darker and more action heavy turn. I thought that was pretty cool. However, I also think those first few episodes were overall detrimental to the entire experience.By the end of the series, I only really felt like I cared about two of the five main characters. If those first few episodes were in the tone of the rest of the series, I feel they could have been repurposed better towards making me care about the characters. Or at least towards making the story that pops up later more interesting. If anything, I just sort of disliked those three other characters and found them annoying more than I did care about them. In my eyes, it would certainly be putting the episodes to better use to repurpose them and drop the whole original premise that basically gets thrown to the side anyways.And what about all the stuff they spent the first few episodes explaining? It more or less doesn't even matter in terms of the rest of the series. The first few episodes really just feel like a pointless excuse to show panties, and some silly reasoning shoehorned in to distract you from that fact. While the series definitely picked up after the twist was revealed, I still didn't feel all that invested in what was going on until the final episode.So in short, the story felt weak, only some of the characters felt well done, and it overall really didn't make me feel overly invested in what was going on. If anything, I felt an overwhelming disappointment. The show felt like it could have been so much more than it was. I wanted it to be more. Instead we got pointless panty shots and a story with a cool premise that doesn't really shine until the very end.As for the positives, there were definitely some cool action scenes. The story was enjoyable at certain parts, though fleeting as they were. The soundtrack wasn't half bad. The art was pretty cool, though the animation certainly wasn't the best out there. Bottom line: check it out if you got nothing you're dying to watch and willing to stick it out until the end. You may enjoy yourself.

It has been a while since I have yet to see another good anime in Spring 2015, and finally I found one. I know, you might think that I hate this anime just because it is ecchi. To be honest, I actually enjoyed this anime.STORY (7):The story follows Yuta Iridatsu, a boy living in Korai House with 4 girls. Yuta was caught in an accident which turned him into a spirit, and he was guided by the cat spirit known as Chiranosuke. He has to master his spirit powers and find out how...to protect the 4 girls from terrible situations. If he sees too many panties in a row, the earth will be destroyed.I am not looking forward to seeing this anime. This is because it was titled as an ecchi. In fact, the first episode shows the wind blowing one of the girl\'s skirt, which totally enraged me because I saw this scene in Rail Wars and I am getting tired of such jokes. The synopsis also completely destroyed my enjoyment towards this show.This anime was directed by Yukata Uemura, former Ganinax member.The story is not actually about ecchi jokes. The story involves Yuta about finding out what happened to the situations he is in and how he tries to solve these mysteries. I did like the way how the story is like a mystery that keeps people thinking.The is one scene in episode 4 which is the funniest scene where Rabura is mistakenly offered the wrong items and she freaks out. I didn\'t see that one coming.However, at times the plot is very confusing and I feel that they could at least explore some details better.ART (8):The animation style looks like Gurren Laggan and Kill la Kill. The animation is fun.SOUND (8):The voice acting was good.The opening was addictive. ""Punchline""The ending was also fun to listen to. It felt like a J-rock band playing the song. Although the voice was a bit processed, the music is fun to listen to.CHARACTER (7):I have no problem with the characters. None of them stood out the most to me in my opinion. However, the problem is that characters need to have motivations and reasons as to why they have to save world.The characters at least have personality.Meika Daihatsu, the name of Mecha. Yes, she is interesting as a character who thinks quicker and implement solutions like impersonating someone.Rabura was funny when she freaked out in episode 4 and when she does the cheermancy cheer.Yuuta, I would say he did his best trying to reunite the team together. However, he was not interesting as a character.Ito Hikiotani, the name inspired by ""Ito"" & ""Hikikomori"". Just like Hachiman Hikigaya. She is also an interesting character however, she rarely participates in battles.Narugino Mikatan is cheerful and lively. I did appreciate the fact that they gave her a personality to work with. However, she didn\'t interest me that much.Chiranosuke is like a father figure to Yuta.Guriko was by far intimidating as a villain although he appeared only in the later episodes. If he was given more material on why he acted the way he did, I thought that would be more interesting. He also has a cool personality with his charm.So far, the interesting characters are Rabura, Chiranosuke, Guriko andMeika.CONCLUSION (7):I know you might be surprised that I give this anime a 7 out of 10. To be honest, I enjoyed this anime. Sometimes, life can surprise you in different ways.Even though I have few problems with this anime, I still enjoyed this anime regardless. Try not to make those ecchi jokes offend you, otherwise you will not be able to enjoy the show.I give this anime a 7 out of 10.The lesson is ""Never judge a book by its cover"". to protect the 4 girls from terrible situations.

I was finally bored enough to get trough the whole thing so now I can tell you that, it actually gets better towards the end.Don't get me wrong, this is not a great show, but it's watchable. There's some slightly amuzing moments and honestly fairly interesting plot, altough a bit convoluted.If you're gonna watch Punch Line do it when you can pay some amount of attention but don't wanna turn your brain off completely.Not recommended, but also not completely trash. "", ""This is a review from someone who's not a fan of ecchi,  but can deal with it.So straight up, if you're not a fan of ecchi, you're perfectly fine to take a pass on this anime, because while it's decent enough if you're bored, there's definitely better stuff out there to watch.The art is unique and eye catching (though the limited action sequences are awkward and clunky, epecially in the final episode), the sound is good enough (the music is zany and cutesy;  as is the rest of the show), and the characters are OK.Really, the only thing that you can...knock this show on,  is that the pacing is just a tad off. While bits of the very start and very end are interesting enough, the middle episodes suffer a noticeable lul; and that's a bit unforgivable in a series that's only 12 episodes long.The ecchi, while part of the premise, feels kind of almost like a gimmick (it's used and it's not hurt by it, but the story makes equal sense without it),  and one you can for the most part ignore. I can say though that,  if i were someone who WAS a fan of ecchi,  i could see how I could focus on the rest of the positives enough to give it a 7, maayybe an 8, because it's quite good--for an ecchi. (To give it perspective, this is a solid one, probably two notches down from another recent ecchi with an interesting premise,  No Game No Life--which, incidentally,  is a series good enough to watch as an anime, period). Being that I'm not though,  comparing it to all other anime,  ecchi and not, I give this about a 6.Not being a fan of the sub-genre,  I stuck around because the premise was bizarre, zany, and interesting enough that I decided to give it a start to finish shot, but ultimately, while nearly everything was tied up by the end, i still felt like it didn't live up 100% to the potential I saw, and the other positives weren't standout enough to make this show worth actively seeking out.Give it a shot of you're bored and have watched absolutely everything else, otherwise, pick another show. knock this show on,  is that the pacing is just a tad off.

Plot wise it is ridiculous and doesn't have much coherent consistencies. The saving grace, if you can even call it that, is the prepubescent boy's wet dream service.The show has episodic nature presented in a chronological order with a little bits of clear time rewinds. The show's presentation of time-travel and character limelights weren't bad, but weak narrative direction took a big toll on the anime as...a whole.The very gamy nature of this show definitely makes it a downside rather than up by making the viewers feel like they are watching a bad stream of some game. As you progress you slowly learn more about each characters, their goals and motives as well as learning new powers for our main ghost character.Opening song with a beautifully choreographed animations and ending song with faded picture book story telling was unskippably well done.The art direction was concise yet containing details when looked at closely, while the colour was vibrant yet conserved. Animation focused more on fight scenes but still easily managed to keep up above average on other segments.Manglobe dared to tread the experimental road with Punch Line. But it didn't pay well as the weird gimmicky game feel doubled with an uninspiring narrative focus couldn't be saved with just animation and art alone.As a disclosure I am bias as panty when it comes to superhero content.Should you recommend Punch Line?

I have literally joined myanimelist just write a review for Punch Line. This is one of the few anime\'s to conclude the story impeccably in one, singular season.With such a ridiculous premise, after watching only a few episodes its hard to see where I\'m coming from, right?

Did he even watch this?

You wont regret it...Don\'t be 28.', ""I feel like a review for this particular anime is warranted because this is probably one of the only anime I have watched that started out bad and had one of the most surprisingly good outcomes overall. It's like watching a track runner trip at the start of a race but was able to get up and recover to have a respectable finish.It is interesting to note that I had wanted to watch this anime when it was airing weekly because I loved the bright colorful art style but this was one that I ended up not starting because of bad press but come...the end of the season I had people saying that this anime was good and underrated so I had to see for myself why everyone felt the way they did.The story starts in probably one of the most turn off ways that it could possibly start, a main male character turning into a ghost and literally threatens the world by exploding whenever he sees panties or opai  from the other four female main characters he lives in the same building with. If you had decided to drop the anime after the first three or so episodes I would not have blamed you but hear me out for a second. Once I reached the half way point of the show and beyond I started getting answers to questions that I didn't even know the show had any intention of answering and revealed plot twists that I didn't even think was possible with a show about a ghost boy trying to avoid panties and blowing up the world. Also the main kicker is this anime not only does a complete 180 with its story in terms of quality but it mostly justifies the ridiculous fanservice  plot line that made people drop the anime in the first place which is something very few anime had been able to accomplish (looks in Kill la Kills general direction).The characters at first seem very one dimensional in terms of purpose but over time even the female characters that were thought to only serve as fanservise vessels begin to show their motivations and their troubles and I feel that it would be safe to say that not a single one of the characters is wasted. Even the main character who I expected to be just another generic pervert has got an incredibly unexpected amount of depth to him especially come the second half of the show.The art and animation are really good. As stated previously that was main draw to the anime in the first place before I heard people had started dropping it. I am a big fan of bright and colorful art and the characters all have their distinct style. There are even some action scenes in this show which are pulled off pretty well.The music of this show was pretty forgettable and or out there. The opening especially could have driven people away from watching the anime in the first place as the song wasn't that good and also the visuals accurately describe the major problem the show had when it first started. The only exception to this is the ending theme. The ending not only has a great song that I feel was overlooked at the time but the visuals more accurately describe the show as a whole in my opinion. The colorful cast of characters and their main characteristics as well as their fun natures show why this show is actually enjoyable.Overall this show isn't for everyone. Especially for people who can't handle fanservice at all. I feel like Kill la Kill is a perfect indicator of whether or not you will like this show in it's entirety considering it is much more well known and a more emphasized example of a show that justifies its fanservice. This anime is a short one so if you can handle the very rough start you will be rewarded with some very pleasant surprises. I am happy I gave the show a chance so give it a go and see if you feel the same way I do. the end of the season I had people saying that this anime was good and underrated so I had to see for myself why everyone felt the way they did.The story starts in probably one of the most turn off ways that it could possibly start, a main male character turning into a ghost and literally threatens the world by exploding whenever he sees panties or opai  from the other four female main characters he lives in the same building with.

When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.Punchline is...an anime that took me a little by surprise. I will say that I was expecting a typical ecchi comedy with a little bit of super power stuff, but I got quite a bit more. Though the show did surprise me, it still wasn't really anything I could lose my mind about or give too much more than the 'entertaining and interesting' stamp, landing it around a seven, even though I was tempted to give it a little higher of a score.Story(7/10)The story is what surprised me. If this anime was what I expected, this could have easily been a 5 or lower, but the story actually had some work put into it. I will do my best to give you an idea spoiler free. Th story isn't entirely linear, it deals with time manipulation, and spirits, which was actually an interesting idea. There were also a good few twists in it as well. My only complaint is that a lot of these twists are simply unimportant, or don't really make sense. However, this story is a lot more dark and developed that I think anyone was expecting.Art(7/10)This is pretty much your typical anime art, and it is of the same quality as just about everything else made recently. It does have a slightly more toony look, but I don't think it stood out all that much.Sound(6/10)his is pretty much the usual sound rating I give an anime, and this isn't much different. he sound was nice, but nothing really stood out. I ever felt lik 'wow, this soundtrack is so good.' Basically, the sound could be completely removed with little impact on the show.Character(7/10)I enjoyed the characters, for the most part. There wasn't too much development, aside from the main character, but it wasn't all that bad.  liked the backstory given to some of them, it reminded me of Zankyou No Terror quite a bit. I think there could have been more work put into each character, but twelve episodes rarely allows for that kind of development.Enjoyment(8/10)I can certainly say that Punchline is entertaining. It has some good comedy in there, an interesting plot, some fan service, and is just overall fun to watch. Though it is more serious than I expected, the show doesn't draw on you like many others do.So, Punchline is a pretty average show, that took me by surprise. t had a pretty unique concept, but I don't think it was revolutionary or anything. So I recommend this to people who like comedy, twisted plots, or ecchi. I think this show is good on those three points, and it should be worth your time. I wouldn't recommend this is you like dark shows, if you are turned away by fan service, or if you want a lot of action. This show doesn't have really any action, and never gets too dark or serious. an anime that took me a little by surprise.

First, it was announced that MAPPA was the studio handling Punch Line\'s animation. This led me to rejoice, as I had been anticipating more of their work since I had seen Shingeki no Bahamut last year; a show that greatly satisfied me (for the most part [give it a shot {go on, try it!}]). In addition, multiple notable voice actors were revealed as part of the cast, which in and of itself is reason enough for many people to \'Plan To Watch\'.However, it is...hard for me to say that I was wholeheartedly behind this show from the get-go. You see, a short PV was soon after posted online. That promo allotted a decent portion of its time to shots of panties and nosebleeds, and as a result, I became a bit more apprehensive towards the upcoming premiere of this show. Truth be told, ecchi definitely plays a part in the plot of Punch Line, but that does not necessarily hold the show back. For example, the main protagonist certainly does receive a power up when he\'s turned on, similarly to a certain future Harem King, but Punch Line wields its pervert card in a slightly different manner.The setting is a boarding house and the main character Yuuta. He\'s your typical young lad who looks out for his friends/apartment mates and can cause the end of the world if too aroused. Events in the action-packed beginning of the show lead him to become a spirit forcibly separated from his body. Go figure, right? I say ""typical"", but he really isn\'t so reminiscent of any one other character that I ever saw him as boring or annoying. Overall, Yuuta is given a fair amount of time and depth as a character.Narugino is the idol-by-day-superhero-by-day-as-well character. She is sweet, kind, shy, and kind of annoying at first. She\'s your stereotypical nice girl character, but eventually Narugino receives enough backstory and development that she actually sort of grows on you, so give her a chance. I saw her panties.The resident techie and bespectacled dorm head goes by the name of Meika. Unless you literally started watching anime yesterday, you\'ve undoubtedly heard her voice in shows such as Zero no Tsukaima and Shakugan no Shana to name just two. However, Meika\'s character is severely different from the usual tsundere archetype you\'ve seen before to the point that its a breath of fresh air to not hear squeal and yell before attacking some pitiable male teenager. She aid Narugino in her hero endeavors, and she\'s fairly cool. I saw her panties, too.Ito plays videogames and keeps a pet bear. She is a bit of a shut-in, meaning she does not possess that much self-confidence, but she still cares her friends and breaks out of her shell as the story calls for it. I also saw her panties.The last resident of the dorm is Rabura the so-called exorcist. I\'ll be honest and say that while everyone else feels equally like main characters, it was hard to see her beyond the capacity of a supporting role, not that that\'s a bad thing. I suppose she is still fairly likeable, albeit more plot device than protagonist. She\'s your mature older woman who cannot get a boyfriend and helps her friends in a pinch. You will see her panties.Chiranosuke, the flying spiritual cat who loves porn and guides Yuuta gets a special mention as he was one of my favorite parts of the show. Alas, he does not wear panties. Not even spirit panties.If the multiple paragraphs devoted to character descriptions wasn\'t enough of a hint, Punch Line begins as a show mostly depicting the interactions of the boarding house residents, despite the overarching story premise set forth in the first episode. As a result, one believes this anime will be focused on moving forward the grand, mysterious plot from the start. However, the pace feels pretty slow until mid-way through, as it transitions back from character-oriented to a progressing plot.Even still, this unsettling change-of-pace left me interested in the show and I looked forward to seeing where Punch Line would take me. It displayed above-average animation and solid voice acting. The plot kept me invested. In fact, I would not have been surprised had it been a two-cour show. Therein was the problem that arose. Namely, the ending did not quite live up to expectations. It fit, and I suppose it was not entirely a bad ending, but I was hoping for more. To use an analogy, it was like building up a thirst and being handed a cold can of soda. You\'re feeling great as you anticipate that carbonated, unhealthy, cold, sugary drink. But upon that first gulp, you realize it\'s slightly flat and not all that cold. It has by no means lost its carbonation and bubbliness, nor is it warm, but it simply did not live up to the hype you forced onto it.Though I say this, don\'t misunderstand. I enjoyed watching Punch Line and I believe it to be pretty decent show. It was a fun watch with a varied ensemble of characters with good chemistry. Ecchi didn\'t ruin or hinder the quality and was sparsely used for the most part. My advice is to not walk into the world of Punch Line with high expectations and you, too, can have a good time.

My other advice is to (re)watch Shingeki no Bahamut.', ""Note- This is my first review ever because I felt that the anime is ranked a lot worse then what it actually deserves.Story- The plot of the story was a solid 10. Although the viewer is left with a inkling of a doubt as to whether it is a forgery of Steins Gate or Madoka Magica, the anime makes up for it with the way the story plays out and wraps up beautifully in a meager 12 episodes. Although some of the ecchi was unnecessary / not funny, I believe it can be overlooked when it comes to a broader perspective.Art- Not much to be...discussed but I feel like the studios choice of art design fit well with the supernatural aspect of the show. Panties weren't unique.Sound- 7, great choice of voice actors, kept getting nostalgic over the Familiar of Zero voice but the obnoxious screaming of the MC at times was off-putting.Character- 8, I thought that it was a nice mix of unique characters and although a lot of people believe that there was absolutely no character development in this anime, I truly believe that adding any more unnecessary twists and features to the plot would confuse the viewers into oblivion.Enjoyment- 3, Ending left a very sour taste in my mouth, it didn't make much sense on behalf of any standard human morals. Definitely a memorable anime so much so because of the way i was unsatisfied with the ending. discussed but I feel like the studios choice of art design fit well with the supernatural aspect of the show.

Besides that it did a fair job at the story and was actually fairly clever at points. This is an example of a good story with decent characters and humor being ruined by the need to add unnecessary echhi humor.Story: It's decent, not necessarily new but it does it well even if it's rather slow around the first half. Has some very nice twists that it hints at during the show. The story would've been much better if they hadn't relied on the crappy nose-bleed echhi factor as it quickly became tired...and irritating, at least for me.Art: I have nothing to complain about here but then again there's nothing that stood out to me as well. Definitely liked that there was a lack of obvious CGI animation as that's my pet peeve with some recent anime.Sound: Same with art, nothing to complain about, seemed well done.Character: The characters were decently fleshed out, though Rabura was a bit bland (just my opinion though). By this point you may have noticed that I'm not particularly concerned about extensive reviews of a show as I usually get that out of the way while I'm watching it.Enjoyment: I finished it in a single day so, yeah, it was enjoyable but I did find myself skipping five-second intervals every once in a while, so not a good sign. Would've enjoyed it more if it had taken itself more seriously.*Spoilers and ranting ahead*Just want to throw it out there, the ending is so good until after the death scene. They ruin the lasting feeling of sacrifice by making it seem almost arbitrary and just that it happened so whatever. If it had ended with just his sacrifice it wouldn't have been a perfect ending but it sure as hell would've been better and my ranking of the show would've been an 8 instead of a 9. Besides that they had good humor, I personally liked the cat porn joke. I did like the fact that they kind of led to Ito using the mecha by having her be really good at a game that the mecha's controls were pulled from. I hate the fact that they didn't take the story seriously. When a character dies you don't offer panties, that is in every aspect offensive, maybe not necessarily to the character but to me the viewer who is trying to take the damn ending seriously. That shit ruined the tempo of the ending and combined with all the other crappy choices made me dislike this anime.

While the animations are good and it’s overall pleasing to look at, I found myself easily drawn away or distracted by other things. The main thing I did appreciate was the amount of detail that went in to some things, for example after Mikatan has been crying for what we would assume has been a long time, she actually has redness surrounding her eyes, and it stays like that for quite a while. It’s those little things that really no one would really care...about if it wasn’t there, but because it is there, it shows the amount of detail that went into making it. One of the main things that drives this show is Fan-Service. There is no way to hide that fact as one of the main plot points is that the main character, Yuta, goes berserk whenever he sees panties or anything suggestive, and in a house full of girls, it happens often. Whenever this happens early on in the show his nose will gush with blood, ill talk about this later, but this is a type of thing that I find just over-the-top and sometimes a bit annoying.Music: So the songs in both the opening and closings are catchy, but I’ll be honest, I did not feel any regrets just skipping past them, but from the opening animation, one could really get the gist of the entire show: kid sees panties and goes crazy while his nose gushes blood. This being said the music used in the show, while usually under the voices or the action is pretty solid and worth a listen because it really adds to the shows experience. While there was no real extra sound like I’ve heard before, other than the occasional crash, that is something that I feel like if it was included the show would be quite a bit better.Story: In a word - Confusing. I had a hard time following this show and while everything seemed to pan out as time went on, after the first few episodes I was confused. Then, after episode 6, the plot made those first six episodes close to meaningless outside of episodes 7 and 8. The over usage of the bloody nose is something that I get is a cliche but when it is so exaggerated it makes the show feel like it’s trying really hard to be funny when it really doesn’t need to be. Yuta ends up being a disembodied spirit in the very first episode and as the show progresses he learns how to use this form better and better. He realizes that there is a terror group, the Qmay group, that is trying to use an asteroid to destroy humanity and breed a perfect world, So the show mostly consists of Yuta teaming us with the other people in his friend group that can go berserk like he can to stop this group from succeeding. At its core this show really is about ‘superheros’ working together to save the world.Personal Reflection: So I want to point out that I am not really a fan of superhero things. Be it movies, TV shows, comics, whatever, I just don’t really care for them. And while this stigma against these types of things may have factored into how I felt about this show, it doesn’t change that I had to try and convince myself to come back to the show over doing other things. The overuse of fan-service is something that I thought was a little much, and I don’t mind it at all, but because it was such a large part of the story, I found myself wondering “why?” I felt like there was a lot that could have been done well here and it just wasn’t. And while near the end of the show I began to care more and more about this cast, by the time this happened the show was over. It was not a bad show by any means, but it isn’t one that I plan on watching again anytime soon. What I really want to say with this is; watch out for fan-service in this zany superhero comedy/drama.Overall Rating: 7/10 about if it wasn’t there, but because it is there, it shows the amount of detail that went into making it.

At its core this show really is about ‘superheros’ working together to save the world.Personal Reflection: So I want to point out that I am not really a fan of superhero things. Be it movies, TV shows, comics, whatever, I just don’t really care for them. And while this stigma against these types of things may have factored into how I felt about this show, it doesn’t change that I had to try and convince myself to come back to the show over doing other things. The overuse of fan-service is something that I thought was a little much, and I don’t mind it at all, but because it was such a large part of the story, I found myself wondering “why?” I felt like there was a lot that could have been done well here and it just wasn’t. And while near the end of the show I began to care more and more about this cast, by the time this happened the show was over. It was not a bad show by any means, but it isn’t one that I plan on watching again anytime soon. What I really want to say with this is; watch out for fan-service in this zany superhero comedy/drama.Overall Rating: 7/10', 'Punch Line opens with a dubstep track so horrendous it sounds like an HD rendition of the title theme from Crazy Bus, and some superheroine who has the strength to jump through the windshield of a bus, and punch someone out the other end, but, somehow, once someone gets the jump on her, she can’t get him off, so does she have superhuman strength or not? Rather inconsistent, let this be a taste of things to come, and that encounter itself doesn’t matter, because as it turns out, our main character ends up seeing panties two times in a row, which causes the planet to...explode, somehow, but luckily for him, he has a magical talking cat to go back in time and stop it from happening. Now, here’s a question, if you can go back in time and stop anything bad from happening, including the one event that the whole story is centred around trying to avoid, wouldn’t this complete negate any tension the story would attempt to create? It would seem like it to me, but they never address it, not even in the later episodes wherein he goes back in time.But, the story, let’s talk about that, after the world exploded, the main character’s soul got separated from his body, and someone is possessing his body, and so now his soul is a level 1 ghost in an MMORPG with a really bad tutorial, and he needs to find some bootleg necronomicon so that he can get his soul back into his body, come to think of it, this whole thing is just like a contemporary Army of Darkness, but without any of the humour, memorable dialogue, or anything else that made Army of Darkness good. The talking cat loves his info dumps, in fact, that’s his only purpose as a character, to give long, tiring, boring info dumps out the arse about how being a ghost works, perhaps if it was one instance, I would be able to overlook it, since they need to establish the rules of being a ghost somehow, but that’s not how it happens, almost every episode he comes in and you just know as soon as his mug appears that the next five minutes are going to be a drag, and to make matters worse, despite this fact the rules of this universe seem to have absolutely no consistency, it is very apparent they were just making up the rules as they went along.Not only did the rules of the universe seem to have no prior thought put into them, neither did the tone of the story, which is incapable of accomplishing anything. It begins as a superhero anime, and then that’s more or less entirely forgotten. According to Wikipedia, it is a comedy, but I’d consider that a stretch, considering the only humour came in the form of two running gags – the cat watches porn, and the main character explodes if he sees panties, neither of which I ever found funny, that’s all there is that I would say constitutes actual humour, everyone does that Marvel/Disney Star Wars thing where they’ll say things that aren’t funny at all but enunciate themselves as though they’re jokes, but, as I said, I do not consider that to be actual humour. Sometimes it tries to be a drama, the main storyline, apart from trying to get the main character not to look at panties, is that some apocalypse cult put a video onto Nicovideo which they titled Harakiri Harassment which contained a “list of victims”, which just so happened to include all our main characters, and as it turns out, they’re trying to kill all of them, for some reason, also harakiri is seppuku, and spoiler alert, when they kill Ito in episode 5 (but it’s okay because they can just go back in time and fix everything) it doesn’t even look like an attempt at seppuku so good fucking job on that one.Speaking of the characters, let’s go over the backstories of everyone, there is the landlord, who is a robot and 1337 hacker, because so random lol, there is a hikikomori who dropped out of school because she was bullied (how sad, maybe I’d give a shit if they either didn’t portray it in the most cliché way or they had a fucking backbone and were willing to commit to anything, because every time they try and have a serious moment they forget about it two minutes later), some necromancer who dates someone but gets pissed when he reveals after five minutes of knowing her that he’s in the NSA and reveals a top secret mission and that he only wanted to talk to her because he wanted to get close to the robot, and she gets pissed and starts shouting and crying (‘drama’) because she was interested in him, I’d personally be a bit pissed myself that the NSA’s not learned better techniques of locating people. And that’s it, I didn’t come in expecting anything very good in the way of character, but even among ecchi comedy this is a considerable step backwards, there is nothing of value here.So, let’s conclude things, the first episode has a soundtrack that is positively loathsome, and it gets better after that, since after that point it’s only the height of mediocrity, and also strangely absent. The talking cat is there to make the story far more boring than it already was, with so many info dumps that go on far too long, and almost all the content in them doesn’t fucking matter, and none of the other characters are of interest at all, they have almost no chemistry at all, and as bland as they come. The tone is all over the place, because the writers are too afraid to commit to anything, but also too incompetent to really be capable of even a light-hearted tone, and for a series titled Punchline there is a profound lack of any actual humour.

The premise alone is horrible and unappealing.And yet it's pretty good somehow.I would compare this type of absolute trash entertainment to the movie Venom. It's pretty objectively a poor work, but you're having so much ridiculous fun that you can ignore that and just go along for the ride.So yeah, this is an anime about ghosts and time loops and asteroids and robot scientists and superheroes and gene editing and gender identity and government coverups and school bullying and cat...gods and romance and friendship and panties and panties and panties. It covers the whole damn spectrum of Weird Anime Stuff, gives absolutely no thought into actually making a coherent piece out of it all, and just blows into the story.Part of the reason Punch Line probably wasn't as successful as it could have been is because of just how brazen it is about refusing to dumb itself down (or in this case, smarten itself up) for audience expectations. It knows exactly what kind of show it is, so instead of trying to hunker down and deliver an appealing fanservice show or a compelling character drama, it just dicks around however it wants and throws every possible element against the wall seemingly at random. The show starts off as some bombastic action show, before suddenly and violently veering into a supernatural apartment roommate comedy, one that of course quickly reveals itself to be a sci-fi/fantasy hodgepodge that never quite explains its own existence. The same episode that introduces ghostly possession also introduces the NSA. Yeah, it's that kind of show.The cast is good, the four main girls all being pretty solid archetypes you've seen before but in an interesting dynamic because each character gets just a little bit of extra development to make them really apt to clash with each other. Add in the main hero and his psuedo-shounen hero self, and you actually have a pretty eclectic mix. A couple of of them have some legitimately well-done dramatic moments as well, rare for any action or comedy series.The main hero, Yuuta, is one of the biggest standouts of the series, in that his role as a generic male protagonist is a sleight-of-hand by the show itself. I can't divulge too much here, but let's just say that the story is in medias res for a reason.And... that's really the biggest hook here for Punch Line. It is constantly trying to fool its audience, throwing in crazy plot twists and unbelievably dumb backstories, slowly unfolding the entire story in all its convolution. LARGELY the story is predictable and if you're paying attention you can pretty much figure out where it's going by the end of episode 2 or 3, but there will be a few shockers to throw you off balance even then. It's really stupid but I very much enjoyed every stupid plot development.The writers were clearly having a ton of fun making this story, and their excitement really translates into a fun end product. You see lots of shows where it seems like they were just making it out of obligation, or maybe the passion left before production actually begun, or something else that is reflected in the paint-by-numbers elements of the end product. Punch Line is the opposite of this and you can pinpoint each moment where the writers definitely thought they were being super clever. It's good to be in love with your own story!Sadly, the show is a bit too scatterbrained for its own good, and the finale isn't particularly strong. It actually feels like they were too rushed, and that the series needed another three or six episodes to truly tell the story they wanted to tell. But thanks to the anime industry's pointless and strict season requirements, we only got twelve episodes out of it. Honestly, if it had gone a full 24 episodes, I think it might have actually been able to ascend past being stupid fun and become something truly good. As it was, there wasn't quite enough time available, though the fast pace is definitely welcome.Unless you're a moron who takes everything too seriously, Punch Line is probably for you. It sucks and is great simultaneously, and it's rare to see that kind of thing. Despite my 6/10 rating, I actually recommend this quite a bit!

After that, the 'real' greatly enjoyable anime starts. the first...six episodes are kind of like long-ish, fairly important however suprisingly amusing build-up story.so, that's it, i hope i didn't violate some spoiler laws or anything, saying just what kind of impressions you could get from watching this. And by all means, enjoy this anime, unlike many others this one actually gets better with the episode count. six episodes are kind of like long-ish, fairly important however suprisingly amusing build-up story.so, that's it, i hope i didn't violate some spoiler laws or anything, saying just what kind of impressions you could get from watching this.

I urge anyone to finish this series to the end because its worth investing time on it. The author really blended the characters and plot. I should state that it first several episodes wouldn't stick you on your seat, but further into it you wouldn't mind the premise that has been set up at the start. I think the Author had the idea of catering the story to every kind of viewer which is saying combat, art, story, music and ecchi enthusiasts would love to watch, there isn't anything lacking in relevance to...how the story is plotted. how the story is plotted."", ""This show caught me off guard. When I first the premise I thought it would be another stupid ecchi, but I watched it anyway. I am happy I was wrong.Story:10/10Punchline starts with our protagonist Yuuta Iridatsu on a bus. This bus is hijacked by a terrorists, but is saved by a magical girl esque hero as well as some other passengers on the bus including Yuuta. From this description it does  not seem like much, which is what I thought as well.  But from here the crazy plot of Punchline unfolds. Almost anything else I say will delve in to spoiler, except one...detail, whenever Yuuta gets a nose bleed a comet hits earth.Art:7/10Punchline has a very interesting style. It's very organic and rounded, but besides that it's nothing special. The characters are not particularly detailed besides their hair.  The small amount of action is also quite good, but is still nothing special.Sound:9/10As I said in my Kekkai Sensen review, sound is my hardest part to review. Despite this I liked all of the music and VA's in Punchline. The opening is strange but very catchy. The VA's were all very enjoyable, especially Yuri Yoshida as Chiranouske and Haruka  Tomatsu as  Rabura.Character:9/10All of the 5 main characters, Yuuta, Meika, Ito, Mikatan, and Rabura were all great in their own way. Yuuta was a very funny character who proved he was more than  just a perv. Meika was a great leader/mother figure and helped everyone else. Ito(who is my new waifu) is a neet who opens up over  the show.  Mikatan proved to be more than just an idol. Rabura brought a lot to the single older woman trope. All of the main characters brought something to the trope they fit in to.Enjoyment:10/10I am not the biggest fan of Ecchi, in many respects I do not like it. Shows like Shimoneta and  Prison School are better than most Ecchi because they add something to it. Punchline does the same. It takes a pretty stupid concept,  and turned it into a truly great and heartwarming show. It also helps that there are 2 meganekkos.Overall:9/10I would give this show a 10/10, but there is one major problem. The story is not finished. We did get a very nice conclusion, but there is still a lot to learn. This does seem a very trivial thing to lessen the score fun, but feeling unsatisfied with an ending is a really big problem.

In short, I\'m writing this for those considering to watch it but aren\'t sure if they want to start it.*Let\'s start. This anime i would best describe using the word \'Wacky\' but that would be expected from an anime where the plot says that ""humanity will be destroyed if he sees underwear"" or more accurately if he sees a girls underwear, he becomes so excited he becomes superhuman but if he see the underwear again in...his excited state.....Join Yuta who lives at Korai House conveniently with 4 other hot girls(I knew that Ecchi tag wasn\'t just for show) but is now a spirit and he has to figure out how to save the world and get his body back all while being guided by our resident Yoda, who is a pervy ghost cat.The anime, though it starts of as your typical ecchi harem, after about 5 episodes you\'ll realize this anime is more than meets the eye. All the weird and crazy occurrences all start to piece together towards the end. I feel sad for those who thought this is a cliche harem and called quits early on. You can expect the humor to be over-the-top sorta like kill la kill or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.If you feel like watching something funny that is weird and wacky but at the same time not cliche like other ecchi harems and still has a complex storyline, this is a great pick.*This is obviously my opinion, if our opinions match...Great, I look forward to hearing your opinions as well as giving you more of mine, Otherwise we\'re obviously very different people*This also happens to be my first review, Woohoo!

I finally wrote one', 'Punch LineI started watching this as a guilty pleasure. A guy who’s sexual arousal destroys the world was a hilarious premise. And I enjoyed the show, really. It’s pervy fanservice, without the need of inexplicable beams of light and oh so convenient steam clouds. So why didn’t I enjoy it more? Two things: one is the fact that the comedy has to take a back seat in the final third of the series in order for the story to play out. I really hate that when that happens. The premise is ludicrous and silly, but the series takes a serious turn, because of the serious...story they present. Like halfway through the original writer hit a wall and had to hire someone else to finish the story. But writer two didn’t know it was a comedy.Second is more of a personal thing. It comes from being a fan of science and science fiction and is in two parts. First is the time travel paradox. I won’t spoil anything here but let’s just say either time IS absolute therefore no action one takes can affect the outcome; or time ISN’T absolute therefore there cannot be dire consequences for effecting history.and Punch Line tries to have it both ways.

Typically, whether I love, like, dislike, or hate an anime, I just rate it and keep it in mind for future use, (as recommendations or warnings). This anime is so bad that I COULDN'T ignore this when I saw the high rating this bucket of fish scraps proposing to be a work of art has.So, good things first. The art is pretty good, and the designs of characters is pretty decent. These elements aren't the absolute best I've ever seen, but they're nowhere near the worst. I never noticed...any issues with the sound design and choices within, but that's possibly due to the fact that those elements are the least of my worries.Now, onto the real purpose for this review...Oh. My. Goodness. How can you even screw up a story so hard? How can you simultaneously be so incredibly boring and yet make absolutely no sense whatsoever? How can a piece of art feel like nothing more than a dead fish trapped in the body of a super model? How can you possibly inspire frustration when almost every single element dulls one's experience so far that staring at twenty minutes of a featureless gray circle for twelve episodes would somehow be more enjoyable?Another review I happened to notice compared this piece to the standard modern art piece. Sure, there's pretty colors. Yes, it's compared to masterpieces by certain people. There's definitely many people that consider it to be refreshing, powerful, and expressive.In reality, it's a canvas that's been covered in twenty flavors of gray paint the artist bought at discount price when he tripped and spilled his watercolors. You can talk about the deep meanings and bold choices all you want, but haphazardly throwing random things of the same low quality without any true thought will never be worth the elements individually. That's what this anime is. It an astonishingly thoughtless waste of potential.Art's nice, though. Would recommend if you're deaf, can't read subtitles, and aren't intuitive enough piece more than a single bit of the story together. Trust me, those two pieces will not fit together, so it's better to not have more than one. I just hope it's one of the decent ones. any issues with the sound design and choices within, but that's possibly due to the fact that those elements are the least of my worries.Now, onto the real purpose for this review...Oh.

Would recommend if you're deaf, can't read subtitles, and aren't intuitive enough piece more than a single bit of the story together. Trust me, those two pieces will not fit together, so it's better to not have more than one. I just hope it's one of the decent ones."", ""Punchline really surprised me, it started out with the empression that it was going to be a silly natured anime full of fan service. As the season progresses, so does the seriousness of the plot, and the situation that the MC is in.Story - So we have our MC Yuta, he finds himself in the middle of a bus hijacking where a pink haired girl named Strange Juice is able to subdue all, but one of the assailants. The leader, an unnamed white haired guy, of the group who attacked the bus, prepares to shoot Strange Juice. He is stopped by Yuta, who had...somehow powered up after seeing his neighbours Rabura's panties. Yuta tackles him out of the bus and into the sea below the highway, while falling the white haired guy happily says something to yuta which is quieted out. He wakes up on the shore with Strange Juice, but ends up unconscious again after seeing her panties, suddenly a beam of light comes from the sky and hits Yuta and he is thrown out of his body. Yuta wakes up in his dormitory and finds that he has become a spirit with only a talking cat, Chiranosuke, to guide and help him.Throughout the season, Yuta learns that an impending disater is going to hit Earth in the future, and the only way he can change that future is by trying to affect current events to ensure that devastating future doesn't happen. He also remembers the events surrounding his childhood, and his two friends at the time Chiyoko and Guriko.Art & Sound - Overall art is fine, no complaints or anything worth mentioning. The OP is catchy, and ED is decent, and the insert song in EP 12 fits the moment perfectly.Character - I enjoyed Yuta as a MC, I felt the anime allows the viewer to follow him along with the events as well as learn of his past, and how he has ended up where he is. Yuta has the power to uber-fy, which allows him to push his body further giving him extra strength and speed.We also have Mikatan, Ito, Meika, and Rabura, these are the 4 neighbours of Yuta.Mikatan - She is the hero Strange Juice who stopped the gang involved in the bus hijacking, she is a good natured girl and loves to playing with her friends. She has links to Yuta's childhood and just like Yuta has the ability to uber-fy, although her body suffers as a result of using it, this means she has to take medication.Ito - She is a NEET and prefers to stay in her room playing video games (don't we all?) she has a pet bear name Muhi who seems to be the target of an evil group called the Q-may group who are intent on allowing the disater, that is going to strike earth in the future, to happen.Meika - She is a robot who is the landlay of the dormitory, she is brilliant at hacking which plays a part latter in the season. She also helps Mikatan with her Strange Juice persona.Rabura - She is an exorcist although she doesn't believe in spirits. She can be temporarily possessed by Yuta's spirit when there is cinnamon ( Cinnamons hightens spiritual powers) in the area.Enjoyment - I enjoyed Punchline while it starts out as ok, it does gets better as the season goes on, what really made this good in my opinion, is how light-hearted everything is from the fan service, to the fights, and even the ending was very light given the circumstance. The anime also does well to not go with the most obvious ending. somehow powered up after seeing his neighbours Rabura's panties.

It's an absurd ecchi parody with plenty of funny moments and not a ton of depth, but Punch Line has a passable plot sprinkled with just enough mystery to keep it from feeling like disconnected nonsense.Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy for Punch Line to have more depth, but it isn't exactly promising much in that department. It's an anime with a strong male gaze that revolves around a character both accidentally and intentionally catching glimpses of women's underwear. It's 12 episodes with a good fast pace, it's animated really well...with some great character designs reminiscent of Studio Trigger, and the OP is a bop minus like 10 dead seconds in the middle.

The story is all over the place, and can't decide what it wants to be. We start off with what looks like a Shounen action anime, but then in the next few episodes becomes a slice of life comedy. Don't get me wrong, I think those two can work well together if done right; however, this anime does it anything but right.Not to mention that in only the first few episodes we are introduced to many plotholes and random plot conveniences. For...example: why does cinnamon increase spiritual power? Who knows. How could the MC turn back time the first time if he didn't have enough spiritual power? Who knows. Those are just a few of many.Episode 6 is when I finally decided that this show was just dreadful to watch, and a complete waste of my time. In episode 6, there is no explanation of why or how, but the meteor changes course and comes towards Earth. We also learn of probably the most obvious plot twist of all time, the dude in the superhero outfit is actually our MC's real body. We also learn that the MC is a girl, which I thought was pretty strange and was just pulled out of their asses to cater to the LGBT community. This also goes directly against one of the main plot points, because why would a biological girl get so flustered seeing panties, even if they identify as a male.After episode 6 I skipped to episode 12, just to see what happens, and I couldn't even finish the episode before becoming bored. I don't understand how in the 6 episodes I skipped they managed to attract the attention of a small army, all able to use the same power they could. It also made no sense how they still managed to defeat said army, despite being outnumbered like 100-1.In the end, I would not wish the pain of watching through the entirety of this anime on my worst enemy. I felt so disappointed and upset that I wasted 2 hours of my day watching this pile of shit. example: why does cinnamon increase spiritual power? Who knows.

You would understand they put a lot of efforts into this anime.Sound-9The best thing about this anime is the music in it, the opening sequence was a really well made music that is so relaxing, it could be used as a background music for studying. The ending is also great, but i prefer the opening more, the voice acting put in this anime is ok, it just gives a different feel than normal anime. As someone who is used to hearing japanese in anime, chinese aren't that bad too.Character-8Really well developed characters, the design is good and it shows a different and more chinese hairstyle. it has a lot of traditional uniform and accessories, there's a lot of character in this anime but it really focuses to the princess and the prince.

It was my first Chinese animation show, and I am shocked more people don't talk about it??? It was STUNNING: visually, emotionally, and plot-wise. The characters were all beautiful, the dialogue was hilarious and gripping, the plot was emotional and captivating, the music was gorgeous, and the entertainment value was 100%. I was completely obsessed with this show and could not stop watching. I had to literally pull myself away to get to my real life.The romance was seriously so fun to watch and the development is realistic and raw. The characters make realistic decisions, have genuinely...realistic emotional responses, and say relatable things. I am so so impressed with this show.I really encourage you to give this show a chance. You'll be into it within the first few minutes. The Chinese language takes a few minutes to get used to it and you stop noticing after a while. I could not get enough of this show and I will be so sad when season 2 ends! As I write this, I am already halfway through the second season.Some people complain that the show is quick and not many minutes, but I really love that I could binge this within three hours. realistic emotional responses, and say relatable things.

The story was fairly interesting, although quite political, but it doesn\'t have a proper ending. It just suddenly stops at a random, somewhat downbeat point, so episode 12 doesn\'t seem like the final episode at all. It\'s kind of a mix of action, slice of life, and romance, although the romance is almost non-existent (male lead is very cold). Each episode is very short; just over 10 minutes\' content between the opening and ending, so it does not take long to get through.

Shaman King (2021),https://myanimelist.net/anime/42205/Shaman_King_2021,"['!! This review contains out of context spoilers. !!I remember the first time when the reboot was announced: I was so excited to start it, and because I rarely get hyped over new anime, it is pretty clear that I had some high enough expectations at that time. It may or it may not be clear by now, but I grew up watching the old adaptation, and I will try to not bring it up that much in this review.I became more and more disappointed the more episodes I\'ve consumed. The first episode made me meh enough, there was no wow factor to get me...entertained, but I was hoping that in time it\'ll get better, right? Right??Sadly, there is no hope for this series.I\'ll quickly resume what is going on animation wise. It looks bad, it looks cheap, it looks boring, weak, uninteresting, there is no compelling thing visually. There are at times some more detailed close ups, but they do not bring anything to the table. The action scenes are just boring, nothing entertaining is going on. The far away shots look strange, the animation is cutted out, it is weird and clunky looking and the frames look junky. Boring color choices. There are times when characters don\'t fit with the background at all. There is nothing much to explain, it\'s exactly like this.It is a brand new adaptation of a 20+ year old battle shonen series, for a 2021-2022 anime it is obviously filled with some outdated and old clichees that everybody had enough of. From the start it can have some lows in its storytelling, but at least is it competent enough to pass? No, I don\'t think it\'s enough, worse, it gets worse, and worse in time, and the last third of the story gets so bad you can\'t even process what is going on in front of your eyes. From a basic battle shounen with some tournament elements in it, this anime becomes an incoherent mess, so bad in fact I can even compare with the Wonder Egg Priority special: in the end it became a ""random stuff go"", ""let\'s just put something just to fill in"" type of story, and not as so bad it is funny as the early mentioned WEP, but it actually gets frustrating to follow up the events.I wrote so much about how the story gets baaad, but I haven\'t wrote what\'s going on. Out of context spoiler warning, after Yoh and Anna\'s backstory, the story gets confusing, non sensical, random, things just start happening with no coherence or proper explication. Mechas? Aliens?? Random fleet raids that don\'t have any purpose in the story?? TRAINS!! You\'ll start questioning yourself what are you watching, you came for some Jojo style shamanic fights, you ended up in a state of constant confusion and fatigue. Everything is so rushed and random, it is a complete mess.I don\'t even like the characters in this reboot. In the first episodes the main cast was more open to each other, I think that they behaved pretty normally in the beggining, but after the tournament started it became irritating to see them interact. Everybody is so apathetic towards one another, everybody feels like they want to do their work individually and they\'re forced to be together. Horohoro is the best example in this situation, I may be too used to the old version of his (and I assume that) which is more comedic and fun, but here he became more and more irritated, more and more serious Bakugo-like character, he became even edgier than Tao Ren. I also dislike how Hao is portrayed in this series, he\'s more comedic and has so much more interaction with the main cast, it kinda ruins that mysterious vibe I\'m used to (again, I assume that). Also one last thing is that I absolutely despise that Tanuki-Fox duo, they were so gross and unfunny I hate, hate, hate them. STOP SHOVING YOUR BALLS ON MY SCREEN!!It\'s not a review that I\'ve put a lot of work into, but there is nothing much to say about the newest Shaman King anime. With or without the bias of growing up with the old series, the 2021 reboot is just not good. There is absolutely nothing decent or worth mentioning in this anime. It is one of the worst series I\'ve ever forced myself to fully finish just because of my own nostalgic feelings.Were you a Shaman King kid who hasn\'t touched the reboot? I don\'t recommend to start it like me, it\'s a complete waste of time. You\'ve never seen SK in any shape of form? Still don\'t recommend watching it. entertained, but I was hoping that in time it\'ll get better, right?

Still don\'t recommend watching it.', ""Here's my thought and review SO far, but before here's some info i want people to know. To begin with general info the manga as 300 chapters and it will be adapted in 52 episode confirmed so it's a lot to cover for the manga. Studio (we can see in MAL but still) is Bridge which isn't super renown already, so those are few important info it will come back later on. I watched old anime then got into the manga and became my fav manga of all time.Now for old anime, it had 64 episodes and the story started to diverge from manga in...the US arc(trying to not spoil or less possible for new fans). The old anime added a lot even in what the manga cannon stuff was (some good and bad not not really to go much more in depth regarding the add-up) and the latest part was just anime original.Now back on the new adaptation haha (sorry this is a roller coaster) is more manga accurate on how stuff happen. Now, sure some stuff were cut still but really minor stuff. The new anime seems to be more and adaptation on what the old anime never had a chance to do.Now, i think people are overpraising the old anime it wasn't bad but not amazing either... i feel people have a lot of nostalgia towards it. So i understand why people can complain to it. I re watched recently and yeah i mean early is more developed but im so use to manga that it doesn't bother me too much character development are made later in the books. To me it misses on how the character were develop in the manga in the og adaptation they lost their core i find. In the manga we see great things that happens (i know old anime couldn't put it coz catching up manga etc... just trying to say how it is) we have Horohoro backstory, Joco/Chocolove arc and important fights, Jeanne secret, how Anna and Yoh met AND the real ending was great but the epilogue MADE it great for real.Now the anime so far is really mid-tier sadly the animation is often stiff so it makes weird and because its so condensed it does feel rushed by moments. Now i wanna say since episode 8 and onward the pacing is WAAAYYYYY better. Still could maybe be slightly better but its getting on a real decent normal anime pacing. Some part are getting a bit more well animated but its not MAPPA or UFOTABLE for sure so sadly we cant really expect the best animation of the year but we can hope for an improvement.It is one of the first paranormal shonen so people can easily make some parallels with newer one. Although if you expect something darker like Jujutsu this really isn't dark its very light but gets a bit more philosophical later on.Finally overall, i recommend it even if early it makes it feel a bit too shonen cliché sometimes (it's a bit like that early in the manga but  with the extra panels and everything it does change the perception of it and makes a bit better) overall if you are new and want to get into the story it works. If you are an old anime fan only dont get surprised early you gonna feel like they just cut everything but remember old anime added a lot of original. Once again when we get to the US arc you should be able to see new things and enjoy. After all tough, in all fairness it is way better to read it none of the anime adaptation gets Takei spirit and ambiance that well and i think its hard to do. If you cant get into the new anime try to read maybe you'll be able to like the story. It just  keeps on getting better, but i understand its not for everyone. I want to point that like any other review this is an opinion and you should really watch for yourself and judge most of the time. There's so much more i wanna tell but that's it for now. I hope it was helpful to give you a good idea. I'm a simple man and im  just happy we getting a new anime and merch haha. Take care the US arc(trying to not spoil or less possible for new fans).

I had a blast watching it every week and was always excited for each new episode. Of course, it\'s not perfect, it does have some flaws which, depending on your preferences, may affect your opinion really negatively, but I personally had an overwhelmingly positive experience!I loved the story, though that\'s kind of a given, since I\'m a fan of the manga in the first place. Nevertheless, it\'s worth mentioning that this anime does a great job adapting the whole story of the manga and very faithfully at that. There are very few things that have been changed or cut, but...they\'re really inconsequential. I absolutely adored the ""Osorezan revoir"" arc in particular (which shows Yoh and Anna\'s backstory), easily the best part of the anime for me and one I\'ve wanted to see animated for years! And it did deliver beautifully, it actually made me cry. Another thing I adore is the ending - not gonna spoil anything, but I love how the main conflict gets resolved and how different of an approach it takes compared to other shounen that people are used to. The story has some very interesting themes and lessons that it wants to showcase and Yoh\'s catchphrase ""Everything will work out"" is really soothing and definitely something I needed to be reminded of.The pacing was a bit of a problem at times, it was rushed during the first 12 episodes (because they were adapting things which were already done in the first anime adaptation) but after that I had no issues with it, except for some of the episodes closer to the end. It does have a faster pace than usual, but it genuinely didn\'t bother me - I prefer a faster pace to having to slog through filler episodes.Something I definitely need to mention is the soundtrack - the music of the show is absolutely phenomenal! Yuki Hayashi did an amazing job with this, the music is original and very memorable, I listen to it all the time and it\'s quickly become one of my favourite soundtracks ever! I literally can\'t praise it enough, the show would not be what it is without it!Speaking of sound, let\'s also mention the VAs - they were all amazing, they really fleshed out the characters and conveyed their emotions beautifully. The show even managed to bring back some of the VAs from the first anime, which was great and really took advantage of the nostalgia aspect. Overall great performances! The characters themself have always been my favourite part of the story - each of them having a distinct personality and motivation, and each of them being given their time to shine. Unlike some other shows, this one does not focus solely on the main character while sidelining everyone else, it gives opportunity for each character to have their own moments. I also love the relationships between all of them.I really liked the art and the colour scheme they used. The animation, though, is admittedly a bit of a problem. It\'s nowhere near as good as one would expect from an anime from recent years and the fights don\'t look as good as they should. This and the pacing are, in my opinion, this anime\'s biggest issues. Other than that, though, I think the adaptation did a great job!It\'s inevitable that a lot of people will try to compare this to the original anime from 2001 and, while I\'m sure that nostalgia is a factor and a lot of people will prefer the old one based solely on that, I can say that I definitely think this one is better. It tells the story the way it was intended to be, unlike the old one which had a good beginning while following the manga and later got bogged down with fillers and ended in the most typical shounen fashion.Overall, I had a great time watching this, it reminded me how much I love this story and these characters and I\'m really happy it exists in the first place. I may be really biased but it is what it is - this anime brought me immense joy, flaws and all, and I\'m really going to miss it! Thank God they\'ve already announced a sequel! they\'re really inconsequential.

It. Is. Amazing.Shaman King is a masterpiece with loveable characters and new takes on classic tropes. Every character (with a few exceptions) has their own fleshed out goals and motives, making you get invested in each and every one. When someone has a tragic backstory, it\'s not just tacked on for extra drama, it adds nuance to their actions and helps define their ambition. This series also starts off light-hearted but gradually gets darker, kinda like Hunter x Hunter.The power system, summoning ghosts and channeling their power into things with one\'s own...spiritual energy, is very unique (ik a lot of people have been comparing them to JoJo stands, but more on that later) and makes the fight scenes and superpowers interesting. However, due to the series\' focus on stuff like characters\' philosophies and the true nature of goals, there\'s a lot of talking during the fights, so if you\'re looking for a series with high-action non-stop fights this one might not be for you.As for the soundtrack and voice acting, both of them are just... BEAUTIFUL! They managed to bring back a lot of the 2001 adaptation\'s legendary voice cast and songs, and added some new equally boppin ones as well.The animation/art style, while nowhere near the level of *insert whatever shonen is popular nowadays*, is very smooth imo. They managed to get a perfect bridge (ba dum tss) between the style of 2001 and fairly modern production values. Call me a boomer, but I\'m a sucker for retro animation, so this was a very nice surprise for me.While I personally don\'t have any problems with this show, I\'ll address the pacing because i know this puts a lot of people off it. Some episodes go through a LOT of manga chapters, so some stuff might not hit as hard as it should, but bear in mind this is a remake. Both Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and  Hunter x Hunter did the same, but slowed down when they reached the part of the manga which their predecessors didn\'t adapt. And the recent episodes of Shaman King 2021 have been getting a less choppy pace, so it\'s clear they\'re going for the same thing here.Overall, Shaman King 2021 is a gift from the Great Spirit. Pompadours off to Hiroyuki Takei and Studio Bridge!TLDR: If you want high budget action, skip this. If you can\'t be bothered to wait for a series to get better as it builds up, also skip this. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and check it out!Also to anyone calling it ""JoJo for kids"" because of the power system, you\'re laughably wrong (this is coming from a guy who\'s #1 anime is JoJo and #2 is Shaman King). Ghosts are their own separate characters rather than just a projection of the user\'s spirit, and they\'re used in a completely different way in fights. It\'s like calling Hunter x Hunter ""Naruto for kids"" because their characters both fight with innate energy, or Spider-Man ""Batman for kids"" because they both hide their identity with a mask. spiritual energy, is very unique (ik a lot of people have been comparing them to JoJo stands, but more on that later) and makes the fight scenes and superpowers interesting. However, due to the series\' focus on stuff like characters\' philosophies and the true nature of goals, there\'s a lot of talking during the fights, so if you\'re looking for a series with high-action non-stop fights this one might not be for you.As for the soundtrack and voice acting, both of them are just... BEAUTIFUL! They managed to bring back a lot of the 2001 adaptation\'s legendary voice cast and songs, and added some new equally boppin ones as well.The animation/art style, while nowhere near the level of *insert whatever shonen is popular nowadays*, is very smooth imo. They managed to get a perfect bridge (ba dum tss) between the style of 2001 and fairly modern production values. Call me a boomer, but I\'m a sucker for retro animation, so this was a very nice surprise for me.While I personally don\'t have any problems with this show, I\'ll address the pacing because i know this puts a lot of people off it.

I used to watch it in primary school with my classmates. I re watched it a few months before the 2021 version aired so I think I can make a fair comparison. I will not give any spoilers in this review.I actually like this version a lot. It has a faster pacing, but in a good way. It has a more modern, fresh shonen vibe to it. The characters also have stronger personalities and their reasons to fight are highlighted more than in the...original.So the story up until now was within the expectations. I look forward to see how they will adapt some arcs later in the story. Fingers crossedThe art is very good. It kept the important aspects of the old shaman king, while giving it a contemporary and fresh vibe. The animation is very good, however I can still spot some scenes where the animators were a bit lazy. That said, it doesn't ruin the mood though.The sound is ok. I am not a huge fan of the anime themes (with some exceptions like Mirai nikki, golden wind and bleach), but the opening song is pretty niceThe characters are a forte. They were done very well in this version. Their reasons and backstories seem more clear and they have more potential for development, if you look past the superficial tsundere personality of half of the characters (which I think it's a nice touch)I genuinely enjoy this show and I always look forward to the next episode. The fights are well done, and usually there's at least one per episode.Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 8Characters: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8 original.So the story up until now was within the expectations.

Having fights, going on about friendship that wasn't really developed, rushing to a tournament.It's rushed but at the same time some fights have long boring dialogue with characters that don't matter, so it's not exactly fast paced either.

The art's fine and the voices aren't annoying. I don't know what the point of rushing through it is.

And the final stretch of it being just so much cut content, averaging at around 6-7 chapter per episode.One thing you can't complaint about is the...Theme Songs, especially the 4 Ending Themes, each better than the previous. And there was no doubt the soundtrack is gonna be epic when you have Hayashi Yuuki on board.All in all this was far from a perfect adaptation, but it did introduce me to this story about Shamans, of which I definitely am gonna read the manga, cause the Manga is just great from what I heard.And do hope that somewhere in the future we still get another proper remake, atleast 75+ episodes, cause the story, atleast for me personally is something that can work even in the future Theme Songs, especially the 4 Ending Themes, each better than the previous.

To some people that\'s not a bad thing at all, but in 2021, it doesn\'t really do much for me. Its not bad, its just not great thus far. It definitely doesn\'t reinvent the wheel.And I understand that this is probably something that had a hand in inventing the wheel in the first place, I just don\'t...think it holds up to modern era shounen battle anime standards.As far as the technical side of things goes, also pretty average. There hasn\'t been any crazy high quality animation, though the art is solid enough, and the soundtrack and voice acting haven\'t particularly caught my attention besides the ending song which is pretty good.Overall I think probably skip this one if you don\'t hold any sentiment towards the original anime or manga, and even if you do, don\'t expect this to blow your mind. Maybe worth a watch if you enjoyed shows like Fairy Tail. I can\'t exactly put my finger on it but it gives me a similar feeling to that.5/10 very mid so far, way better stuff out there to spend time watching, but also half decent if you want to turn your brain off think it holds up to modern era shounen battle anime standards.As far as the technical side of things goes, also pretty average.

I am an actual Shaman.2. I have never seen the original Shaman king.With that in mind, this review may be biased.I loved this anime. Absolutely loved it. I\'ve never even seen an anime about Shamans before. I\'ve seen anime about Onmyoji, which are Japanese mystics, but I\'ve never seen an anime that covered the entire global Shaman diaspora before. I loved how they really did a great job going all over the world and giving representation to everything from the Druids of Europe to the Shamans of North America.  Granted, it\'s not like it\'s a compendium of knowledge for true...Shamanism, but it\'s nice to see that whoever made this film really has a knowledge of various Shamanic cultures, histories and ideologies. They also have an even greater depth of knowledge about New Thought. (The Afterlife concepts found in the Great Spirit portions of the anime.). I wouldn\'t be surprised if the creators of this anime were practitioners of New Thought.I, personally, loved the characters as well. In seeing other reviews, it would appear that the character personalities are different from how they were in the original. Because I never saw it, I\'m not jaded by the nostalgia of how they used to be. I only appreciated who they were.  I loved Yoh\'s relaxed attitude mixed with a little cockiness, he might be a favorite MC for me. I also really loved Anna, who was my favorite character. Either her or Hao were my favorites.  And yes, Hao, is the villain, but his completely untouchable attitude and demeanor, I really liked it. It was different. (MILD SPOILER): I\'ve never seen an Antagonist so confident that he\'ll jump into the bath with his enemies buck naked, knowing no one is nuts enough to attack him. And then go to sleep in their home, while unwelcomed. That was a flex so strong it could pop a vein.But, with all that being said, as much as I loved this anime for how its resonated with me, it has a LOT of flaws. If I was not biased as a practitioner of Shamanism myself, I would probably have scored this much lower because of the many, MANY mistakes they make in this anime. (SPOILERS AHEAD!)The biggest mistake BY FAR is their penchant for spoiling their own show with the OP and mid-show credits. I know OPs can be spoilerish, but their openers were INSANELY filled with spoilers. They showed all of the first season\'s enemies hanging out with Yoh episode 1. Why would you do that? Showing Ryu, Ren, Faust and Lyserg standing shoulder to shoulder fighting Hao in episode 1 totally destroys any suspense when they show up as enemies in the anime. You automatically know that they\'re going to lose, and end up turning good, so nothing they do as a villain really matters. (Still, what Faust did to Manta when they met was pretty shocking. I didn\'t see that coming.) In addition to that, they would have the commercial break slides spoiling evolved forms before they actually ever used the forms in the show, thus spoiling the forms. But, as bad as that was, nothing was worse than the second opener.  They literally showed Hao with the Great Spirit, and the Five Warriors with the Elemental Spirits. I mean...what the hell? You basically gave away that Hao becomes Shaman King 20 episodes before it happens. And then it sucks out the suspense at the end when Hao does the (admittedly awesome) awakening. As much as I liked that, do you know how much more I would\'ve loved it, if I didn\'t see it coming? I would\'ve really thought, especially being at the end of the anime, that it was one of those ultimate swerves where the heroes actually lose. Just horrible spoilage.Beyond that, there were tons of mistakes in the story itself. Such as Yoh expressing zero knowledge of Furyoku to Silva when they meet, and then later providing the Matamune flashback showing that the Spirit taught him how to Spirit Integrate and attack to defeat an opponent in the exact same way he passed Silva\'s test.  So, he should already know all about Furyoku. How could he even grow up as an Asakara and NOT know about Furyoku? He was trained by his grandad, and his wife was Anna the Itako, how would they not tell him once? How could he not even see Anna\'s Furyoku when everyone else was seeing it and freaked out about it?  The show was filled with little holes like this.Another critique of the show is the pacing. Man, the pacing was atrocious. It\'s like they spent so much time on fights that didn\'t even matter, that they ran out of time and had to rush through the ones that did. I was so disappointed when the final fight of the first round that pit Yoh, Ryu and Faust against Ren, Horohoro and Chocolove, was rushed and done in like 2 minutes without even a conclusion. And then it was just Ren vs. Yoh pt. 3, in those 2 minutes.  But, the pacing issues became really bad when it was time to go through the 10 chambers to try and reach Hao before he awoke. His guardians were the strongest fighters in the anime. So strong they were dropping the heroes like flies through the first three chambers.  But, then it was like: ""Oh no, we\'ve only got the budget for 4 more episodes, we better hurry up and finish."" And so the later more important fights were done in a couple of moves. Silva vs. Yoh should\'ve gone MUCH longer. And it would\'ve been nice to see them fight Goldva.My final critique is against the logic of the show at times.  The characters just fail to use logic. A great example of this, is that they know that they only have 15 hours to reach Hao. And then they actually decide to go to stop at one of the levels to replenish their mana. I get it, you\'re low. But, you stop and eat, hang out and talk, go to sleep ALL NIGHT, get up and have breakfast, when you have 15 hours to save the world...What an absolute shocker that you ran out of time and Hao had to come find you. Which is fine, I guess, since Hao coming to them was one of my favorite parts.But the logic was all over the place. You\'re fighting for the fate of every life on Earth. There\'s 9 of you, and you\'re entering rooms where only one guy is there to defend. So...let\'s hang back and let one or two guys fight, instead of jumping every single one of these dudes 9 on 1 from the start. They should\'ve jumped Luchist and then did the same to the Patch.Man, the more I write about this anime, the lower the score in my head is going... I\'m going to stop, because I really, really enjoyed this anime a lot. It\'s just got a lot of holes that makes it clear why its score is a high 6 instead of an 8.  I would definitely recommend this anime. But, not to people who have seen the original Shaman King. From what I can see, you\'re probably going to hate it a lot. Again, this review is biased, because this is more than likely an anime that deserves the score it has, but it resonated with me personally, so my score is reflecting that.

The really unfortunate part is the pacing. They give no time to build any rapport with the characters, there is no understanding of struggles or time to let their pasts or stories sink in. The participants keep getting stronger and their is no effort shown whatsoever so one does not understand what is going on with them. It is terribly told, and I can't tell if the original story was this bad or it's just the adaptation. The only redeeming quality is that you can understand the tournament a bit and some of the characters...are at times cool.

Had high expectations coming in but was left with great disappointment at the end of the season.I'm glad this reboot is staying faithful to the manga, but there's definitely something about the execution that made me wanting more.

"", 'Shaman King is a bad anime series. So where did it all go wrong?A brief background to make my review more understandable. I watched the original Shaman King when I was a child. Then when I entered high school and was on my way to being addicted to anime, I watched it again, with a broader mind. Then I read the manga and even the sequel, Shaman King Flowers.When the remake was announced, my childhood friends were making a big fuss of it, on how it was a great story and how it was a lit show. I already knew that the show was...going to be bad. The answer to the question of where did it go wrong is simple; the moment an anime adaptation was going to be produced.People, especially from the place where I’m from tend to view anime from 1990s and 2000s as if they were all good. Maybe because they have a certain bias for nostalgia, or maybe they were just kids who have a very narrow or straightforward view on beauty, or maybe because they have not watched enough anime to have a certain standard. Shaman King perfectly takes advantage of this. It has a weak story telling yet people seem to place it on a pedestal. But in reality, it doesn’t really compare to the other “great” shounen anime that people place in a pedestal from its time like Hunter X Hunter, Slam Dunk, and Yu Yu Hakusho.Shaman King has shitty dialogues and I don’t know if its intentional, but sometimes it feels like they are trying to shove some certain philosophy to be accepted by its audience which is very irritating. It’s like a pastor is saying some story to try to convince you to be Christian or something. I mean it’s ok to try to influence the audience since it is the purpose of art, but forcing the audience to open their mouths to shove food down their throats isn’t really a great way of doing it and more so if the food tastes like shit.Then the oversouls, man… It’s like a 6-year old thought, “what would be a great power?” Some oversouls were fine but some were just….There were certain scenes which I don’t know if the author did really try to make us laugh or was just so bad at writing it made me laugh. A no spoiler example: a certain person sacrificed his life and there was supposed to be some sad scene, but the scene turned out as if it was insulting the dead character. My God, I felt really bad for the character who sacrificed his life.For the fight scenes… If there are any… 99% of the attacks showed the preparation for the attack and then it skips the part on how it will reach the target and then it will show that the target was hit or the target dodged the attack. A sword is going to be swung, there is no swinging, but then it hits the target. That’s the “fight” scene. The choreography or the of the fight scenes were also very bad. Though to be fair, it only adapted what the choreography in the manga was, so it didn’t really have a good start to begin with. But the anime could’ve at least changed a few fighting sequences which other anime adaptations do and more importantly, they could’ve added motion to the fight. It was like I was reading an audio-visual manga…For the art, I actually liked the art of the original anime better. I think that the colours of the remake were too bright and I preferred the old one.Though, the anime did have its moments, but they were very few for a 52-episode anime. It would even be few for a 12-episode anime.Overall, it was going to be a shitty show because the source material was bad in the first place, and then the animation was very bad.Overall 1/10Enjoyment 2/10 (I rate based on enjoyment) going to be bad.

It's made me love the characters more than I already do. It covers a lot of the manga the original did not. To me, it feels perfect to the manga and did it justice. It get right into the depths of the characters. The new animation is so crisp and clear. The only issue I have is the animators got lazy on the head portions, making them too big. But each episode just leave you wanting more! It may come off dull and rushed at first, but as it progresses it get intense and...has a steady pace. has a steady pace."", 'I\'ve been watching this because I liked the old anime when I was a kid and I had always heard that the manga story was markedly more cohesive. If this is representative of that, I can\'t say that I agree. ""Shamon King"" is a series of moralistic vignettes starring characters that you\'re supposed to admire, and... it\'s morals are shit and its characters are shit. So, more than usual, the show feels like a waste of time.This really sunk into me during one of the later mini-arcs where the kids were meting out revenge against the character who murdered their father. The moral of the...story was that the motto ""they hurt me, so it\'s OK for me to hurt them"" is universally wrong and creates cycles of misery. And it\'s like, yeah, sure, OK. In a STORY. Where characters run around with murder powers and nothing better to do. I don\'t label things ""childish"" because I believe that children are people, but this pablum is absolutely something that society force-feeds children because of our stupid collective fantasy that childhood should be some state of innocence where kids are regularly lied to. In real life, people take revenge all the time. In real life, people set up structures in order to separate themselves from responsibility for their revenge, and then leave those structures in place for their descendants to suffer under without understanding why they were created in the first place. (see, loosely, the police.)In real life, at least a good chunk of the time, the revenge is motherfucking justified. Kill your rapists. Kill your racists. The reason we often don\'t seek out that revenge is that the individual actions of those people who hurt us are part of larger systems that dominate us. In those examples, of course, patriarchy and white supremacy. Any and all actions taken to advance those causes are justified because they are extensions of those systems. Therefore, anything and Everything we can do to demolish them is justified. ""Shaman King"" would have us spend 1000 years waiting for the bad shit to happen and then work through it with a smile. Fuck off. This is real life.In real life, murderers don\'t get to come back to life and say ""I chose to come back blind because I wanted to understand what it was like to experience the world without any light, like the person I hurt."" Now, of course, alluding to that particular character invites the question ""what about reformed people?"" And my response to that, of course, is ""What ABOUT reformed people?"" The solution to crimes like murder is to treat them like the expressions of a system that they are, and eliminate as much as possible the systemic motivations that cause it. If the motive was money, provide people with sufficient money. If the motive was family-related, change the social contract of the family (and, no, what a ""family"" means is not a monolithic concept). Further, if you truly believe that there are just people out there who exist just to kill people for no reason, then the logical conclusion of that belief is to staunchly oppose any sort of behavioral regulatory agency; after all, what if the bad people who want to murder people take control of it? See, very pointedly, the police.But, no, the solution posed by ""Shaman King"" is not concerned with these things. It\'s concerned with shouting surface-level morals while a loose tournament-style shounen manga story plays out in the background. And, while I was fine with a lot of that, the show just pushed my buttons when it tried to be anything more.In conclusion: Except Anna. Anna is perfect.

I\'ve been on forums and comment sections often and I can\'t seem to find why people hate it so much. Every week I see the average score here on MAL drop (6.66 by the time of this review).The story is alright, nothing more nothing less. There are some memorable characters like Ryu of the wooden sword and Ren. The action is good although it would be nice if the animation was better. The soundtrack is also pretty good and I...find myself listening to it sometimes.I think that Shaman king 2021 is a perfect example of people hating on something just because it is a remake of an original. I think people should view remakes in a more positive light and be more considerate and lucky that a franchise they love is being brought back after many years. Look at the cowboy bebop live action on Netflix for example. I\'ve watched the original anime and it\'s also in my top 10 all time and I have no idea why people hate the live action so much. its really well made and I think they do a good job of re creating the different aspects of the show. Same thing with the demon slayer movie recap. A lot of people will give it a lower rating because they say it ""wasn\'t necessary"" or something and I just don\'t agree. But that\'s also not to say that they\'re some bad remakes out there but I\'m sure you get my point.I just think that we should all be thankful for remakes and appreciate that the thing we love are getting second chances. find myself listening to it sometimes.I think that Shaman king 2021 is a perfect example of people hating on something just because it is a remake of an original.

It is definately one of those shows I used to love as a kid.To give some backstory first I first watched the old adaptation of this anime back as a kid and went on to read the Manga a bit later. I never finished the story though ... but I knew it differs a lot from the old Anime's ending.So when the new adaptation was announced I was glad to have the chance to get back into the series to experience the 'correct' adaptation of the Manga's story.Was it good though...?  Well....The first episodes were actually really promising. I was...glad to recognize a lot of scenes from the Manga and it was great to see these characters again after so many years. It was actually pretty enjoyable until the part of Anna's backstory ended... After that everything went downhill sadly.The Shaman tournament lost all importance and it kind of just faded away? While the old adaptation really focused on this part it was weird just not seeing much of it at all. When you did, it wasn't really fun anyway though... the fighting scenes were just overall really boring and not animated in an exciting way. Most things just got explained instead of seeing some actual action...I hoped a new anime would do this differently but I guess not.The characters definately didn't have enough time to interact with each other ... I am actually kind of annoyed that Chocolove got so much attention throughout the story... I just hate this character a lot. His weird humour doesn't work and is so unnessecary. Instead I would have loved to see more of HoroHoro or Ren or even Yoh... because honestly for a main character he sure didn't do that much... especially in the final episodes.The story just went all over the place... characters constantly got revived like it's nothing special at all. The progress the characters made just felt forced and rushed and everything kind of became 'too big'. I can't really say anything positive about the second half of this show... and it pains me to ay that really.I guess the original story wasn't that good after all and the old adaptation definately made a good choice of rewriting it...At least my respect towards the old Anime only grew now and I would recommend it over the new one. Especially since the new one didn't get rid of anything 'outdated' like character clichés, bad humour or too much shouting or Ryu being creepy af anyway.Unfortunately This anime turned out to be really mediocre, maybe without the nostalgia bonus it would be even worse. glad to recognize a lot of scenes from the Manga and it was great to see these characters again after so many years.

The story pretty much the same, but with an updated looks of the characters. I was excited when I first heard that there is going to be a remake of one of my childhood animes, and when I saw the traier, I was excited... New character designs, plus Anna look so beautiful.The first 3 episodes are interesting, but despite having updated character designs, the remake did not deliver well when it comes to story telling and not having any jaw dropping action sequence or any visuals for that matter.The story telling is...so rushed, and everything just happens so fast, or the action sequence are just cutted (at least I feel like it is...), it feels as though it is a downgrade from the originall, 2001 release. For example, everyone said that Yoh will be in the cave for at least 1 week, but when they arrived in front of the cave, Yoh came out from the darkness like He came in yesterday, it just happens so fast.Part of the reason why I enjoyed watching Fate/ Stay Night: Ultimate Blade Works, and Fruits Basket (2019-2021) is that they have similar or almost exactly the same storyline as the original release, but adding something almost completely different; Shaman King does not have that, It feels as though a copy and paste from the original release, and only updated the character designs, and... cutting some important parts.Being released in 2021, I was expecting an amazing, jaw breaking actions, but I did not see that. Compared to the new releases in this year (2021), or last year (2020), this is bad. Blood-C may  not be a good show (according to the people who have watched it), it left something momerable among anime fans, and they delivered it nicely. Shaman King (2021) is just not as good as I was hoping for.I might still watch this in the future, waiting for something that will blow this anime in to the online world, but for now, I will cancel watching this show. so rushed, and everything just happens so fast, or the action sequence are just cutted (at least I feel like it is...), it feels as though it is a downgrade from the originall, 2001 release.

Everyone who was born in Russia in 90s know about it and me is not an exception. The first thing I did after school lessons was turn on the TV to watch Shaman King and plunge into this beautiful world. Should I say how I was excited when I heard about the new adaptation? Then after watching first episode of new Shaman King (2021), disappointment overtook me.Story [2/10]A lot of people hated first adaptation, because plot was changed around the middle of the anime due to the manga being in...ongoing state. I can agree that second half has obvious cliches and common tropes, but it\'s still was better than what we have now.The original manga story, which is adapted in Shaman King (2021) is full of mess. Golem, Aliens and Princess Hao? Yeah... Sure, that what we needed so much! Super powerful god antagonist with the Great Spirit under control, can\'t erase ordinary shamans? Of course! Main characters dying several times to get resurrected and gain more furyoku? Sure, why not? It\'s so exciting to see that heroes are safe, cause they will be resurrected anyway, right? Maybe it has interesting dialogues? No, miss again, it\'s just a philosophical nonsense.Character [5/10]The cast is pretty same as in first adaptation, with addition of some characters from manga. But we have two problems here. First is that Matamune is the only new interesting character with unique traits. Second is that 1400 years old Hao became an insecure boy, whose principles and opinions can be changed at the click of a finger. The positive side is that Anna\'s backstory is now adapted.Art [2/10]Wow, that is just a disaster, I mean it could be worse only, if they added cheap CGI. You can see the problems from the first episodes, characters body proportions and the perspective of some scenes are terrible. For example, Mosuke has a small head which he can cover with his large hand and it looks hilarious. I will stop you before you say that it\'s author style, no that\'s not the case. Just open manga now and compare dialogue scene between Amidamaru and Mosuke, if you don\'t believe me.   Yoh head also changes in size and sometimes is bigger than his body.You think animation of action is better? No, fights are so STATIC, that it felt like watching presentation in Microsoft power point. Best fight scene that adaptation have is the battle of Yoh and Ren, but even there old adaptation feels better. You can compare it by yourself (ep. 19 of SK 2001 / ep. 9 of SK 2021), twenty years have passed and there are no improvements. I don\'t even want to talk about other fights, especially in second half, they are awful.Sound [4/10]In first ten episodes we have some wonderful and atmoshperic OSTs like main ""Shaman King"" theme, which is combination of shaman singing plus electronic music. The ""Vorpal Dance"" has traditional chinese music vibes, it sounds awesome and seems like a perfect theme for Ren. Also they decided to bring OST from old opening ""Over Soul"" back in one episode, probably to evoke nostalgic feelings. But then after these cool tracks music starts to deteriorate, I can\'t remember anything good after listed themes.Enjoyment and Overall [2/10]I felt like screaming with frustration, had high hopes for true source adaptation. I was dreaming about second season (""Flowers"" adaptation) since a kid, now that it\'s been announced, I am in despair. My recommendation for everyone is to watch Xebec adaptation from 2001 instead of this one. ongoing state.

Yoh however doesn\'t want to be shaman king so he just lazes around listening to music. Then one day the tourney starts and now he has to enter it along with his friends. There\'s also the main antagonist who is Yoh\'s twin brother who is a reincarnate of some super overpowered man 100 years ago. Yoh makes friends on the way to becoming shaman king to help him.Review:Ok first...of all the voices of Yoh and Tao have voices that sound a bit wrong, and because of the audio Yoh\'s voice kinda pisses me off. I\'ve never watched or read shaman king but the opening spoils the fact that 5 of the people he is supposed to be enemies with becomes friends with him so it has no actual suspense when I know that he\'s not gonna try to kill or try to not get killed by those guys.Besides that, shaman king has so much originality to its power system and rankings. And the characters are pretty diverse and unique. I like how they made the main antagonist Yoh\'s brother who is just a reincarnated guy from a thousand years ago. Based on these reviews I think that maybe if I watched the original anime I might have more thoughts on this, but I\'m not gonna watch the same story with different quality animation.Recommendation:I would recommend this as an original story and world is always an anime I\'d recommend. I can\'t claim or compare this with the other anime but I prefer you watch the more recent shaman king than the old one. of all the voices of Yoh and Tao have voices that sound a bit wrong, and because of the audio Yoh\'s voice kinda pisses me off.

It's because people think about it just as I thought at the beginning - oh my lord what does it look like, the nostalgia tells me that this looks bad omg and it's just a reboot. But then I've read that it wasn't just a visual reboot, it was the actual anime adaptation and not only some childlish cartoon about 'friendship is magic'. It's great, it's actually awesome. Yeah sure the art is pretty mediocre and for 2021 anime it SHOULD be better but you can get used to it. Great story....It's awesome that it's gonna get a second season. Can't wait to see it!

I remember binge reading the entire manga and watching all of the anime I was capable of getting my hands on. It was up there with Rurouni Kenshin for my personal favorites as a youngin. Unlike Kenshin though, I regret to state that with this new series, my tastes in anime have sadly left this series behind to only be reminisced of fondly as a sweet memory of my youth.I tried to give it a chance, but to avail. Shaman King\'s pacing is at a whiplash pace compared to other Shonen of the same time period....It\'s overreliance on having spectators explain every little detail of a fight, as well as the consistent attempts to hide as much actual combat and damage dealt to the characters is enough to take you out of the story that is being told. I do understand this series at it\'s core is for kids and the older series had similar variations of this problem that I did not care for when I was younger.Indeed, this is simply an example of ""old man yells at cloud,"" but I am not here to state that the older series is better and this new series is terrible. Instead I am pointing out that this series is one that may suffer from individuals such as me who have aged out of the appeal. If you remember Shaman King as a kid then by all means give it a go, but do not be surprised if these series does not hit that same level of wonder and fun that you had when you traversed through the series all those years ago.

Thus far, I find it amazingly put together where every piece of it is well-thought-out and considered to bits: from all the characters and their roles in a manga to the storyline and how it unfolds. It is surely a must to watch it and will be worth your time - you will enjoy it! Hope for the next season!!Getting into more details, I can say that I liked that every character has its own personality and played some sort of role...in developing the story. Each of them had something to come up with as far as the message and their story go. For example, Yoh was always the kind of person who was able to settle things down and approach them in a way that helped everyone to succeed eventually and take away a lesson off of it. In the event of battling the opponent, he was always trying to carry a message of finding the solution in a positive way so no one has to struggle or suffer out of a certain situation. Overall, the messages and principles every character lived by and displayed through the story spoke to me on how we, as humans, can resolve and work out a way out of any life problem that will be morally and righteously grounded.Additionally, what also stuck out to me was the simplicity of the story and how all the characters are naturally mingled and interact with each other - there were no superfluously added details to the story. It was simple and easy to follow as long as one follows the storyline. Much as the pacing of some episodes were rushed on and off, the story was unique and compelling for me, especially when it comes to their fights and what other ideas and messages the characters can bring along with them when facing the challenges along the way. in developing the story.

I was so hyped for it, but this anime does not do the story any service.There is a lack of tension and pacing throughout this anime. I was giving the beginning the benefit-of-the-doubt, thinking that they were attempting more of a recap so that they could get to the later parts of the story and flex their skills in adapting the story, but no.This is just Shaman King with bad pacing, no anticipation & slideshow animation.The only compliment I have for this anime is that the quality of the colors are so...good! Is that what most of the budget went to because it definitely was NOT the animation.If anything, I would want a better animation studio to re-remake this series with better quality and add SAKUGA animation! This series really deserved it...To compare it to the early 2000's series, I rewatched it and have to say even within the first few episodes the storytelling, action and comedy was much better. The only thing it suffers from is some drawn out pacing like in the Faust vs. Yoh fight, but that rarely occurs.The old anime also has an alternate ending to the manga due to it not being finished at the time of it's making.I highly doubt it will happen, but I hope this series gains traction to be remade again in a much better way. good!

The only thing it suffers from is some drawn out pacing like in the Faust vs. Yoh fight, but that rarely occurs.The old anime also has an alternate ending to the manga due to it not being finished at the time of it's making.I highly doubt it will happen, but I hope this series gains traction to be remade again in a much better way."", 'As a big fan of the original anime series of Shaman King, I was pretty concerned about this reboot, since most of the time I tend to be a little disappointed when an old anime gets one (Sailor Moon or Hunter x Hunter, the only exception maybe is Fruits Basket), starting to watch this anime out of curiosity but always with the idea that ""next episode it\'ll get this bad that I\'ll just hate it.""From my rate, you can deduce this didn\'t happen. In fact, I actually enjoyed this anime really much. It felt really nostalgic, as you can perfectly see that it\'s not a...recent anime, since it has all the vibes and tropes of a typical 2000\'s shonen. Even the format of 52 episodes is something that makes me think of an old anime, nowadays it\'s really rare to have an anime of that lenght. Since it\'s a 2000\'s shonen, the tropes are the basic: power of friendship, many level up without a real sense to the plot, every enemy is a friend, etc... If you find these things annoying, then you wouldn\'t like it, but luckily I love these tropes so it\'s okay. I love when there is a battle tournament, so I couldn\'t not love Shaman King since it\'s literally the major plot point. And the message that ""death is something that happens and you shouldn\'t be scared of it, since it stops your life but also it\'s the start of something new"" is poetic.The characters are as memorable as in the first season, really charismatic and lovable. I love the idea of so many culture both in the characterizations, the spirits and the morals, since it\'s based on the shamanic world and all the type of culture based on the spirits, it was very interesting to see the different way to approach the topics. Yoh is both very typical and unusual as a MC, but that\'s what makes him very interesting. And I love the team of main characters, though I would\'ve liked to see more about some other characters that unfortunately have poor screen time.The opening were both really beautiful, since I wasn\'t even skipping them most of the time, and it\'s really strange for me. About the ending- well, I watched it on Netflix, it just goes to the next episode without letting me listen to it, so I\'ll fly over this part.And then, the real Achille\'s heel of the serie in my opinion, the character design. I honestly don\'t know why when they make a remake of an old serie, they just decide to have the worst chara design possible. It happened already some times and I really don\'t understand this, it feels like something cheap and plastic, also because those ""neon colors"" don\'t always go well with the vibes and the tone of a scene, seeming too bright for a maybe dark moment in the story. It doesn\'t completely ruins the experience, but they could\'ve made something way bettere instead of this.In general, for those who loved the first season, and even for those who never watched it or read the manga, if you like 2000\'s shonen, this is pretty much a must to watch.

So many things were done well while others felt severely underwhelming.To start, the plot and overall story is very run-of-the-mill. The first half has a clear and solid goal, but it\'s just so boring! Things are uneventful for the most part and there\'s only a few moments that are memorable. It almost seemed like there wasn\'t anything going on in the first place. As the series goes on, the plot takes a complete 180 and it does end up getting more interesting with more action, but the ""end-goal"" completely falls apart. The story just gets more and more...convoluted and random as time goes on, but at least there\'s actually stuff happening that can capture attention. If you piece together your own interpretation, it\'s honestly not that bad.It\'s extremely worth mentioning that the one thing that kept me coming back and not dropping this series as a whole were the characters! They were all so investing, and easily the best aspect of the anime. Each of the main characters feels fleshed out and developed well enough to really get to know them. Watching their development is great, especially seeing how their morality changes. Additionally, the dynamics and interactions between different characters are extremely entertaining, most notably Ren and Horohoro. The dynamic between the Asakura brothers was very unique, too. At the end of the day, if it weren\'t for these characters, I most likely wouldn\'t have finished this show.As for the other elements of Shaman King, they do well for themselves. Simple, watchable art and animation, good soundtrack, and an understandable combat system. Overall, if you\'re looking for something new to watch, Shaman King is worth considering, but not completely worth prioritizing if you have a pre-existing watch list. convoluted and random as time goes on, but at least there\'s actually stuff happening that can capture attention.

I won't argue here,...but the series deserves a higher place but the series deserves a higher place"", ""Shaman King 2021 is the second anime adaptation of the Shaman King manga, this time promising to adapt the events of the manga all the way to the end. It is in some ways worse than 2001's adaptation, and in some ways better. In my opinion, a person's enjoyment of the show will largely depend on whether he/she has watched the 2001 series, and on how much he/she wants to see the manga's version of events.To explain some basic situations around the production of this anime: this show, likely due to budget reasons, has been decided to span a total of 52 episodes. The complete...edition of the manga, which this show adapts from, has a total of 300 chapters. This means the pacing is quite rushed and content has to be cut. Now that is out of the way, let's go over the pros and cons of the show:pros:- clean art and colours. The art is consistent with the author's updated art style- the music is decent. While it lacks some iconic themes that 2001 has, Yuki Hayashi does a good job of composing fitting music for the various scenes and characters.- it follows the manga, so character backstories and plot points not shown in the 2001 show is shown for the first time in anime form.cons:- rushed pacing. As explained above, the show only has 52 episodes, so some less important story points or scenes has to be cut. The pacing can be really bad in some episodes, and it does ruin the atmosphere sometimes, especially for people who liked some of the running gags and jokes used in the 2001 adaptation as well as the manga.- lazy animations. A majority of the fight scenes are lazily animated with use of still frames or moving still images, which can take away from the enjoyment. Perhaps as a consequence of the rushed pacing, the animators animate just the content in the manga, thus not taking advantage of animation as a medium by fleshing out fights with extra animated scenes.That's pretty much it. My biggest gripe as a manga reader of this show (I've read up to chapter 246) is that the pacing is rushed and that the animation isn't better. I'm not asking for Demon Slayer level of animation, just some more effort put into animating.However I do still enjoy this adaptation. The art, voice acting, and soundtrack is done well, and Takei's story still has its charms. At its core Shaman King has some positive messages that I think both young and older demographic can appreciate. edition of the manga, which this show adapts from, has a total of 300 chapters.

The story itself is great but a new person will be very confused what this was even about due to how squished and cropped the story got. This anime needs at least 150-200 episodes to tell the story at least in a way to clearly...understand whats going on without leaving out major plot points. To summarise this: a great story, great characters, sound and  art are great but they didnt do this anime justice by giving it only 52 episodes. This anime would be a true masterpiece if it got the amount of episodes this anime needs to cover just the BASIC major plot points. This anime is too shorthanded on the amount of episodes. understand whats going on without leaving out major plot points.

Españoles reuniosHoy justo acabo de terminar esta serie.  Al principio de está serie estaba emocionado porque iban a hacer un reboot de una serie que vi en mi infancia y me gustó mucho pero.  Que coño es esto.   La serie está bsntante bien en los arcos primeros del torneo en la calle, una vez que van a los de los patch y se empieza a formar el torneo de verdad esto cada capitulo empieza a ser un desmadre total. Yo...creo que ya el punto algido y donde se terminaria la serie para mi es el capítulo 38. Cuando Hao que se supone es el malo malisimo va se toma un cafe , se baña duermen con él.  No entiendo.   Luego los power ups que se sacan de la pinga de que si ahora te vas un momentillo al infierno me derrotas dos demonios y me saco un power up de la pinga.  Luego los guines salidos de la combinacion entre un niño de 5 años y un diplomático. Lo mismo esta todo super serio e interesante que lo mismo se mueren cantando una canción EJ:faust se muere cantando una canción . Y no te llegas a tomar en serio esta serie porque no te llegan los personajes igual. A partir del que digo del 38 todo se convierte en una especie de zelda en el que hay que encontrar a los 5 espiritus (que luego salen 3 minutos) y matar a los patch de 2 en dos por capitulos contandote las historias muy rápido y sin pilalrle cariño. Ni hasta la batlla con silva que me molaba es una basura con patatas.Luego hao que se supone que es el villano malo que quiere destruir a la humanidad. Le dan dos puñetazos le tira 3 ataques de mierda que paran con el culo y se presentan todos en tren  le dicen 4 mierdas del poder de la amistad el poder del amor y la alegria y ya se le van todas las ideas que tuvo durante 1000 años. Luego su madre le mete un bofetón y ya perdona a la humanidad .QUE ES ESTO DE VERDAD. Porque de una serie que recuerdo mejor que esto acaba muy ñiñiñi y ya todo se arregla por dios .  Luego seré yo que estoy loco y me he visto 500 series y me espero todos los giros y las tramas . Pero vamos menudo porro de serie chavaleSi quieren ver power ups estupidos y peleas con guiones sin sentido y historias sacadas de la manga esta es vuestra serie chavales yo me volví selectivo creo que ya el punto algido y donde se terminaria la serie para mi es el capítulo 38.

Lots of the story beats at the start are the same but it diverges quickly because the whole tournament finals end up with a different outcome.The story pacing is weird, and the cause of that is that the series has 52 episodes. exactly 52. The ending of the series seems like a clay statue being droppped on a floor. one side is intact, then the middle warped and the end side is just a flattened mess.The end conflict, the great thing the rest of the series was building up to. the great battle between...good and evil, essentially didn\'t happen. The conflict ends with the heroes being too late cause they were battling the villain\'s luitenants and just going ""i guess we lost. okay."" the series seems to allude that the villain simply went zen and changed his mind instead of recreating the world in his desire, and had no budget or time left to do anything except a slideshow with some text saying ""this is what we did after that i guess"".looking back, while writing this i lowered my rating and recommendation and just have to say my time was wasted at the end. good and evil, essentially didn\'t happen.

TL;DR at the bottom.I\'ve been a fan of Shaman King since the FoxBox days (almost twenty years now), and I\'ve read the manga twice (three times if you want to count the original run of Shonen Jump volumes that stopped at 32--just before the final confrontation), so I\'d say I\'m a huge fan. Going by that, you think I would be critical of the remake, right? Well, after wishing for years to get a remake that followed the whole...story, we finally did, and people immediately picked it apart. ""The pacing is bad,"" ""it\'s a slideshow,"" ""what is this art style,"" ""why are the pieces of music not the same..."" You know, the usual when it comes to a remake. However, I can assure you it isn\'t as bad as people make it out to be.---THE ART/ANIMATION---The art is absolutely gorgeous, and tries to emulate Takei\'s art style for the manga. It does pretty well, though it did suffer at some moments. The colors they used and the faint glow given to the spirits isn\'t too overwhelming, and does the style justice. However, I do wish the comedic facial expressions weren\'t cut at some points, as they were amazing. As for the animation, it could\'ve been done better, but I\'m glad we didn\'t get Fairy Tail (2009) levels of slideshow (nothing against FT, as I really like it. However, you have to admit the first series was terrible when it came to animation). We actually had movement during the fights.---THE OST---While I definitely prefer the OG\'s OST better than the remake, it isn\'t terrible by any means. The openings, for instance. I always find myself going back to ""Over Soul (which does make an appearance in the first Yoh VS Silva fight)"" and ""Northern Lights"" more than the remake\'s openings, but I\'ll listen to them when the episode starts without a second thought. Even the ending themes managed to get me this time around. And don\'t get me started on ""Osorezan Revoir"" that was present during Yoh and Anna\'s backstory. I absolutely loved it, and it even managed to bring a tear to my eye.---THE PACING---Okay, this is where my complaints lie. While it did rush through the beginning segments of the story to get to the SF, it wasn\'t as horrible as people claimed. It was mostly comprehensive, even if you didn\'t know anything about the series beforehand. My friend that watched the remake but had no prior knowledge on the series was able to follow along no problem. Everything went well until we got to the Mu Continent towards the end, where it felt more like they were speed-running a video game than anything else. Officiants were taken down in only a few scenes, they would kill two/three officiants per episode, stuff like that. And I know it didn\'t last too long in the manga, but this was the chance to build up the battles to something even greater, especially Yoh VS Silva (final). All-in-all, though, I still enjoyed seeing these scenes animated after so long, but there\'s no denying they could\'ve done better during this segment.---TL;DR---SHAMAN KING (2021) is a great series with great messages, and I\'d recommend it to anyone. The art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is great, though I still prefer the 2001 series\' openings. Finally getting to see the ending animated was absolutely amazing, though the pacing suffered quite a bit in the last three/four episodes, feeling more like a video game speedrun then an anime.Now, if Netflix could just get their greed claws out of it so we could get a proper home release or TV premiere, I\'d be happy.

Ta Bu Dang Nuzhu Hen Duo Nian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54881/Ta_Bu_Dang_Nuzhu_Hen_Duo_Nian,"[""This is easily the most indecisive I've been on a series quite honestly. Warning, this review is utterly dependent on the quality/resolutions delivered within the 2nd season as this is not a complete story as of writing. After so many anime/donghua, I've noticed the more you binge the more you cannot help but develop a slightly obnoxious mindset of thinking you know everything going on in the 1st ¼ of the show, off of troupes/ events you have seen play out before time & again. I went in to this on the first episode expecting a virtually historic animated account of some part of Chinese...history I have never heard of prior to viewing. Quite gladly (now anyway), I was completely ignorant to any details, really, as the synopsis even does extremely little to give you an actual full scope of the plot. Trust me, that actually may be a good thing. I find it quite apt that the small amount of information you can find about it including the little MAL briefing are questions themselves rather than definitive information, because the first half of the story had much that vibe itself if that makes any sense whatsoever. I don't know quite how to describe it actually. Is it a time travel thing? An isekai? Am I complete and utter tripper? How in the actual flying **** do they have Da Vinci wingsuits & a wholeass gatt in what I was assuming is ancient China? Etc... For the first time in a long time I really enjoyed not knowing where the hell this story was going however, in a good way. As consumers it is my belief that we are generally lazy and expect everything to be spoon-fed to us instantly, whereas this show does a unprecedentedly amazing job of feeding you small pieces as the story unravels. Don't get me wrong, I found it quite jarring myself at first and immediately attempted searching for information via google, but I am glad there's literally nothing about the show online in one selfish aspect, because the mystery ensconcing the narrative was as result sublime. I will say however it does almost every genre pretty excellently: comedy, action; you name it. If you fancy yourself a show with some absolutely hectic war/fight scenes with some majestic sound effects I implore you to come peep this beautifully animated ahh masterpiece. \U0001fae1In my region the program is available on Rakuten Viki (not sure about elsewhere) history I have never heard of prior to viewing.

Shinkon Gattai Godannar!! 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1104/Shinkon_Gattai_Godannar_2nd_Season,"['Even though this is the second half of the series, I will be talking about both part one and part two of the Godannar anime. Since both of them are the same whole overall storyline. If you have read my first review you\'ll notice that its about 90% the same as the first. This was unavoidable because both season one and two are both equal parts of the same pie. And really only differ with the actual music.Story: 7/10Well this version picks up after the cliffhanger of the first season, its much better since the story is more fleshed out this time, and it starts...to concentrate more on the story. Basically the whole series revolved around these creatures called ""Mimesis"" that seem to be attacking earth for some unknown reason, and its up to a select group of mecha style fighters (most of which contain exaggerated busty women) to save the earth from this threat. Though even in the end we never really know why earth was being attacked. Instead its nothing more than mech on mech action (which isn’t too shabby actually) and up close shots of the female’s body. The character development is pretty low as well, with the exception of Anna, Goa and Mira.....we never really get much story from the other characters. At least not something that will actually make you want to care about them like you normal would, not to mention everything in this series feels very generic. To its credit though the action scenes are pretty descent, and the mecha designs I actually found kind of neat. No real story here, but the fighting parts and fan service might keep some into it. Oh and this series actually does have a descent ending.Artwork: 8/10Same as the first, but easily the best part, all the character and mech designs are all very well done here. They both boast colorful and detailed body suits and armor, and you can tell that each one went through some thought on how to give it flare and appeal. The backgrounds are also nice, you get some pretty lush environments, from the deep jungle scenes, to the large city scape ones. Very nice to look at, though some may be turned off by the extremely robust bouncy women, as all are very exaggerated in this respects.Soundtrack: 6/10There has been a tweaked version of the first seasons tracks, decent enough, even though you really only get one catchy background track (which is a non-vocal version of the opening), but other than that however, there really isn’t much to say about it. The opening theme was pretty darn awesome though, you get this raspy male pop singer that has a pretty distinct voice to him, though I doubt it will appeal to a major part of the audience, it still is and interesting tune. Ending theme was okay, and played as a somewhat low key melody, but nothing really distinct about it.Characters: 7/10Well all the characters are likable, and there are literally tons of them in this anime, and I can promise you that you will not even get to know half of them, as they tend to only pop in when needed, and never any other time. Now you do get some actual back story and character development with about three or four of them, and even that is pretty shallow. Though I did kind of like watching Ana and Goa interact with each other. Its one of the few series that has both leads already married, and a big part of the show is all about them trying to keep things together. Nothing too special, but it will probably catch your eye.Bottom Line: 7/10Well if you already started the first half, the second one is a little better story wise. While there are a good portion of things that just didn’t work out to distinct this title from other generas like it, it isn’t really a bad series either. And this second season does improve on thing quite a bit. Watching Goa and Anna interact is pretty fun to watch as always, plus there is actually an ending to this that ties up all loose ends. A much needed improvement. to concentrate more on the story. Basically the whole series revolved around these creatures called ""Mimesis"" that seem to be attacking earth for some unknown reason, and its up to a select group of mecha style fighters (most of which contain exaggerated busty women) to save the earth from this threat. Though even in the end we never really know why earth was being attacked. Instead its nothing more than mech on mech action (which isn’t too shabby actually) and up close shots of the female’s body. The character development is pretty low as well, with the exception of Anna, Goa and Mira.....we never really get much story from the other characters. At least not something that will actually make you want to care about them like you normal would, not to mention everything in this series feels very generic.

Brett Weaver's (Voice of Nabeshin from Excel Saga) voice was perfect for Goh. He truly excels at being over the top. I was also nice to hear hilary haag ( Voice of Rosette Christopher from Chrono Crusade) as Anna, she along with everyone else did an amazing job.I really liked how the music felt so nostalgic, I thought it was good overall.CHARACTERS:I enjoyed how every character got at least one moment in the spotlight. All the characters were likable and fun to watch.ENJOYMENT:I liked the over the top moments, they reminded me of G-gundam and Gurren Lagann.

They g into more details of the story, but there are a lot of things left unsaid. The characters are better explained than in the prequel. Some of the characters still get to your nerves though (in reference to my review on the prequel). The robots have nice designs and new attacks are introduced to the different mechas.It is better than the first season, although it's totally dependent to it. It seems to be more worked and better developed, with good art and good animation.

Don\'t get me wrong, the anime still doesn\'t excel in any area but improved somewhat.The only cool thing about the anime that liked is the ""Blade Gainer"". The Blade Gainer is a cool mech which was given more screen time in the second season just to be brief and...give no spoilers. A side story or maybe a couple ovas revolving around the coolest mech of the series would have been a very nice complement.Focusing on the series as a whole, now that I watched it all, I can say that its not a completely terrible anime but its also not great. There was some improvement as the anime developed into later episodes but, its not anime I would wanna watch again. There are way better titles for its genres. give no spoilers.
