Each episode is really short, so it's easy to watch the series even when busy.So, the story is pretty non-existent. But it's understandable because it's supposed to be just the daily lives of the characters. The characters are however all very hilarious and likeable in this one. In fact, I like Toshiki Kai in this particular series more than the original (you get to see Kai sneeze in this one).You need to be able to have at least...seen the first season before watching this in order to get some of the jokes. If you watched the first season and like it, give this one a go! :D seen the first season before watching this in order to get some of the jokes. If you watched the first season and like it, give this one a go! :D""]"
Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37487/Muhyo_to_Rouji_no_Mahouritsu_Soudan_Jimusho,"['10 Years ago, I discovered what the Shounen Jump was and how many of my then-favorites originated from that magazine, and naturally, the next step was checking out as many other series as I could. Muhyo and Rouji was one of them that immediately struck a chord with me due to subject matter, character designs and a general inexperience with Manga.So even as a seasoned, somewhat jaded viewer 500 Anime later, I got a little excited when this anime adaptation was announced, even though the red flags were apparent right from the start. 12 Episodes was just way too optimistic of a runtime to...comfortably fit in 150 manga chapters and Studio DEEN is known for being a mixed bag with more bad results than good. But my nostalgia and not having done anything with the Manga in years made me want to check it out regardless.Sadly though, the Anime turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Shounen-Manga adaptation with poor choices in Sound effects and animation. The Moving-Manga-aesthetic drags the pacing down immsensely and every time I hear that ""whoosh""-sound effect of Muhyo\'s book, I keep waiting for the Log Horizon OP to start playing. There are very apparent cut corners that become glaring distractions once you notice them and there was very little care that went into thinking about how to adapt this Manga into a moving medium.But isn\'t it worth watching out of care for the source material reardless, like with that poor excuse for an Ace Attorney Anime adaptation?In this case... no.Turns out the source material wasn\'t nearly as good as I remembered to begin with.Starting with what was good, I enjoyed Muhyo as a characer still, and I was very happy to hear which voice actor they picked for him. He\'s harsh and antisocial at times, but also very sharp and you get the feeling there\'s a reason behind it. The aesthetic that drew me in back in 2008 also translated very nicely into a medium with color.That\'s... about it.Rouji, his sidekick/comedic relief, is a butt monkey who was already dated by the time this Manga came out. The jokes surrounding him as well as their relationship get really old really fast, and Muhyo doesn\'t even seem to need his contribution all that much - outside of the paperwork Rouji probably does - and doesn\'t seem to generally care that much for him, except maybe when Roouji\'s actual life is on the line.You have to wonder why Rouji puts up with all this abuse and why Muhyo treats him like this.Of course there is a bit of a backstory to them, but to a newcomer especially it\'s kinda off-putting.The little episodic stories each episode focusses on really aren\'t that interesting or original, the one-off characters don\'t contribute anything of value.I was willing to try and get enjoyment out of this show for the sake of nostalgia, despite it\'s aforementioned flaws, but once that ran out, there was really nothing left.It\'s a mediocre adaptation of an unoriginal, painfully average Shounen Manga - there really is nothing to see here. There are a ton of better Shounen, better episodic (Ghost) stories and certainly more better animated shows out there. comfortably fit in 150 manga chapters and Studio DEEN is known for being a mixed bag with more bad results than good.

Random people come to this duo because there is something clearly possessing them, followed by our dudes trolling these clients with all sort of magic tricks and whatnot. Typical episode centers around our client getting close to nervous breakdown in public forum because these spirits are also further trolling them. Not sure what these characters did to deserve this, but they are really hopeless and...scared so that's kinda cool to watch.The single best part about this show is the 1st main character dude who is a midget and fat also. Whenever someone is about to lose their shit over ghosts or whatever, this dude is smirking and enjoying every second of it. People embarrassing themselves and acting hopeless in front of him seems to be his fetish -- if not the sole reason that makes his life worth of living. Sick bastard, truly.Appreciating this anime may not be the easiest as it does not value characters all that much. Rather offers some quite miserable tales that focus on despair, death of a loved one, bullying, and in generally relies on some edge and dark feeling stuff. The actual drama writing can also be quite uninteresting, the episodic nature makes the pacing awkward and overall, this anime doesn't really have much to offer. Basically no one will even remember it exists week after it ends.Production wise this thing airs on a day time and is considered a shonen anime, so some censorship exists in the broadcasted version at least. For example, many of the death scenes are not even animated, only shown in black'n white still pictures. As a conclusions: watch the first episode, drop or continue. Whatever you do, this thing is not what the cover picture of premise promises. scared so that's kinda cool to watch.The single best part about this show is the 1st main character dude who is a midget and fat also.

Summer was actually pretty dull honestly, there weren\'t many anime that looked good and it felt boring at first, luckily there were some anime that turned to be pretty good and there\'s Muhyo to Rouji, an overlooked anime that caught my interest when it first aired. It started really good, however, it weakened episode by episode.So what\'s Muhyo to Rouji about? Muhyo to Rouji settles on the real world featuring the everyday life of Muhyo, an executor...of the magic law, and his assistant Rouji, who ""helps"" him exorcising evil spirits around the town. The first episode of the series already settles a dark atmosphere when it comes to these evil spirits and how Muhyo sentences them to an execution that comes from hell itself with the help of the magic law and their articles. The magic law is actually a double edged sword for many reasons, if the executor gives the wrong accusation, whatever he called from his book will turn against him and will left the evil spirit unaffected. The magic law also allows to makes a contract with hell for an exchange of ""Ren"" in order to summon hell executioners, which is also the energy that\'s used to make magic spells. If you run low of Ren your body will weaken and will need rest in order to restore the Ren used, or, in extreme cases, you\'ll need help to restore Ren from others.At first, the series seems to go on an episodic nature, but later on, the plot moves further into Muhyo\'s past introducing us into the ""magical world"", and thus the evil entities that betrayed the magic law will cause chaos around the magical world in order to dispose of Muhyo.The animation looked cool at first, until you realize that Studio Deen is recycling scenes from previous episodes (Like the magic law summon) which will make it feel repetitive to a certain extent. Other than that, I think the animation is okay for the most part. There are some hell summons that looked really nice, ""The train to hell"" was one of them, there are other interesting summons that got summoned (no shit) later on the series. The sound department was okay for the most part, the voice acting was decent and the OP and ED were good, they sound kinda classic (well Muhyo to Rouji\'s manga is kinda old, so its to be expected I guess)Then there comes the weakest part of this series, their characters. Most of them are your typical generic bunch of tropes. We have Rouji who is a wimp who cries for everything and its pretty much useless but somehow gets acknowledged by his superior, We have a Female that serves no purpose but to be Fanservice  (I forgot her name lol), we have the common pervert guy that gropes the breast of said fanservice girl (at least he has some relevance in the later episodes) and we have Muhyo, who is the hero of the show. The rest of the cast is forgettable including the main villain of the show, who has something against Muhyo\'s extremely good traits with magic and wants to bring him down no matter the cost. The show tries to ""develop"" Rouji as Muhyo\'s apprentice but most of the times he ends up being useless.Enjoyment 7/10: Despite the dull characters and the dull storyline, I managed to enjoy this series. The magical world, the hell summons and the spells were really nice, there were some evil spirits that were deadly and some of them were a bunch of really weird creatures that seemed interesting. I really wished the show could have focused more on world building around legends and poltergeist rather than going to the magical world and confronting Enchu\'s lackeys, but well, that\'s it.Overall 6/10 of the magic law, and his assistant Rouji, who ""helps"" him exorcising evil spirits around the town.

And it's not just magic, here we also have lots of action, comedy and even a hint of terror.The anime begins by portraying its protagonists as spiritual detectives who are solving random cases with their magic rights. One as the boss and another as the helper. Do not go weighing that the anime is only in this as soon as new characters are introduced and a much heavier storyline is appearing behind. The characters in the great majority are well worked with their motivations developed and are quite charismatic.The anime also has a good plot twist,...not something extraordinary but it sure will surprise you. The only problem was its end ... it was not bad but I expected more, at least it left a good gap for a 2nd season. not something extraordinary but it sure will surprise you.

A while ago, I was browsing through the library when I stumbled upon the first volume for a manga called Muhyo and Roji\'s Bureau of Supernatural Investigation (Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho) and honestly, I didn\'t give it a chance. Then I decided I would probably regret not trying it out. Best. Decision. Ever. I was instantly hooked and I wanted more and more of it. I loved the ever improving art, I loved the characters, I loved the story, and trust me, before then I despised manga and anime. When I finished, in March, Crunchy roll released a trailer for Muhyo...to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho, and I practically jumped out of the car. I waited for the first episode, and it was so incredible! At first glance, it looked like just some cheap kid\'s anime, but give it a chance! It is most definitely not a kid\'s show....Of course it needs a few improvements here and there, but overall its amazing and great! My dear fellow reviewers and watchers, please do not judge any book by the cover! Give it a chance before you brush it off as ""Ugh, another cheap manga adaption"". Come on! You\'re better than that :3So! Overall I\'d say it\'s pretty good watch! to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho, and I practically jumped out of the car.

If you are going to watch it anyway, you might want to skip this review._________________________________________________For the first time in a while, I saw something seemed interesting go through it and actually decided to drop it.Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho actually had my hope up with the first 2 episodes going quite well, introducing what goes on and even gave a clue on what the boss would be. It seemed great, but then, it starts going down the drain with how the rule introduced in first episode was broken...almost instantly, by the mediocre cases that happened in episode 2 and 3 and character shift in episode 3 and 4.At first episode, there was 1 rule given: ""No contact to client after the case"". Yes, it was kept in the episode, they refused to meet the first client. But then, in next one, where a kid just went and harassed them, they helped him then he came back on his own, saying it\'s not breaking the rule. Following him, a girl haunted by her father came, got her case done and again, come back again frequently. Ok, 1 or 2 times won\'t be much a deal, but then she went through a portal to a place seemed like normal people shouldn\'t be at. What? You mean it opens for all people near it? Ok, I guess. That can happen. It\'s to further a plot point.But what\'s the plot so far up to episode 4?- A girl whose friend died in an accident tried to take her away for their so called ""friendship"" then they decided to sacrifice themselves for their friends?- A kid undoing a seal, gets an evil spirit out, is about to be killed then saved by main characters.- A school girl got herself possessed but turns out, it was her own father and everything was rather cliche how they got into that situation and make up with each other.- Talented people gets hate. Then as incoherent as it is, used their talent to fight back that hate on them. Plus a hint on main character.- Sidekick tries to become more useful, fails but then was given a push to the back and saved. Plus a little scolding later and a ticket to do what they wanted to do, which took an entire day to happen.- An incident at the place which is headquarter for the organization main character belongs to. Everyone fails at their work but main character. Last boss shows himself for the n time.Looking at it, all of them are cliched development of plot, with uneven assignment of time slot. First one took an entire episode being all cliched. 3rd one took half an episode being all cliched. 4th and 5th, 6th? Really now? What\'s more cliched then an useless sidekick who tries to be all better and fails just to get himself some hope by main character, then stuff goes wrong again so they starts blaming themselves?Yeah, it\'s that kind of character shift. While it makes some sense, it shows some expectation of development, it still get too repetitive. I get it, the sidekick is not that experienced so it\'s expected. But to just off undoing whatever advice they was given moments ago without even a try to resist? Come on! Not to mention the shift in pretty much all earlier characters in earlier cases. They keep turn from here and there over the period of their appearances that it was hard to watch.To top that switch off, main character tries too hard to be edgy. At first, they try to punish every spirit in the crime they made equally, but still make efforts to get any spirit whose story was touching a lightened sentence. Then they went off and showed himself as the envied talented young prodigy who is definitely getting ""revenge"" from one of those people envying them. They shows themselves to be more capable than all other people and off to do all the work themselves and fails at it for a little but still get the work done. Real edgy there. I can actually start a bet on how hard they gets beaten at the end to be saved by their sidekick growth in the last episode.That\'s problems with plot line and character building. Art and sound doesn\'t help at all, and I think you would notice so I won\'t complain about it.Having heard this title from Animax, thought it looked like some Manga series I was interested in in the past, I gave it a try, and to my surprise, I decided to drop it pretty fast. I at least tried for half of the other series I dropped so far, but this one didn\'t even deserve that. I actually feel sorry for anyone who had to made it and anyone who had to translate it because it\'s their jobs. Then the fansubs, I respect them for going through all 12 episode of this poorly made series. almost instantly, by the mediocre cases that happened in episode 2 and 3 and character shift in episode 3 and 4.At first episode, there was 1 rule given: ""No contact to client after the case"".

Compared to the other episodes, this felt very lackluster and poorly paced. I don't dislike it because it's an idol story though, that could really well done - this just felt a little contrived, even compared to the rest of the show. What I do like is that it showed just a teensy bit of how things are with the cast after the end of the...last episode: getting to see Asuta and Renge working together in their battle outfits, and a certain couple returning from a honeymoon made it worth the time, and that's about it. last episode: getting to see Asuta and Renge working together in their battle outfits, and a certain couple returning from a honeymoon made it worth the time, and that's about it.""]"
Shichinin no Nana,https://myanimelist.net/anime/623/Shichinin_no_Nana,"[""Nana Seven of Seven is an adventure/comedy title produced by Studio A.C.G.T in 2002 that tells the story of a girl named Nana, who is split into seven different versions of herself by a light prism in her grandfather's cellar. The whole plot line follows her newfound predicament and her aim to confess love to a boy she likes. That's pretty much it.I initially latched onto the series with it's gig on splitting the protagonist into her seven constituent personalities and wasn't completely clear on the idea of the split until I got a few episodes in. For the most part the series is quite...enjoyable as the original Nana tries to deal wth the craziness of having her copies thrash around her house and drive her crazy... it uses the situation she's gotten into as well to personify the internal battles she has with her own feelings over friends, family, school, and her love life as well.It should be noted also that each of the prisms that form when she gets split give the seven Nana's super powers which occasionally enter the fray as part of the plot progression... particularly as they play out the Nana Rangers (which comes across as one of the weirder aspects of the series in my opinion). The nana ranger get up plays into helping Nana keep the secret about her being split into seven people and also has a hand in the events later in the series as the climax draws near.Overall the series, while it can be pretty odd at time, does a good job at fleshing out the protagonist and it's engaging enough to not only keep you watching, but also to make you feel for at least her, as it develops her relationship with the boy she likes.If anything drives me the least bit crazy it's that the seven personalities being split off don't seem to have any effect on the original Nana beyond the fact that her other emotions are personified. Not to mention what happens at the end which I'll avoid spoiling for those who haven't seen the series.All in all it's certainly not the best series on the block it was just good enough to keep me entertained. I tend to be a sucker for the split personality/ body swap materials so I enjoyed it and would recommend at least trying it out enjoyable as the original Nana tries to deal wth the craziness of having her copies thrash around her house and drive her crazy... it uses the situation she's gotten into as well to personify the internal battles she has with her own feelings over friends, family, school, and her love life as well.It should be noted also that each of the prisms that form when she gets split give the seven Nana's super powers which occasionally enter the fray as part of the plot progression... particularly as they play out the Nana Rangers (which comes across as one of the weirder aspects of the series in my opinion).

I am just going to write about some things that were in my head while watching this anime. Also, this anime actually has an ending! The dub is 10/10. I usually watch sub, but I am glad I gave it a chance.This anime really starts pick up after episode 16. Before epside 16 it seems like your typical anime that drags on with no progression, but after looking back it is actually fleshing out the characters and your building investment in them. This...is something that a lot of animes skip, which causes you to not care about the plot or the characters. Having 25 episodes definitely  helps.Sidenote: This is pretty random, but there is a scene that revolves around a plane, and the accuracy of the information in the anime about planes is really surprsing.

To be honest I only got it because I thought it would be bad 2000's stuff I could laugh at but actually became quite invested by the end. First off I would say watch the dub. I don't even know if the show has a sub but the dub is very solid and made the experience for me. As for the show itself, it starts off as a regular slice of life show (minus the seven nanas part) for a good while building characters and such. Toward the second...half of the series, it picks up and becomes more serious and has some genuine emotional moments that make the viewer feel for the main character Nana, which is where the show really shines. Overall I think Seven of Seven is a show worth your time, especially if you like comfy 2000's anime dubs or if your worried about school like Nana is, as can be very cathartic and relatable. half of the series, it picks up and becomes more serious and has some genuine emotional moments that make the viewer feel for the main character Nana, which is where the show really shines.

Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara: Christmas?

Just a fun Christmas with the cast we all grew to love during the main series. Art was pretty much the same as the main show, so no complaints there. Comedy was a huge factor in this OVA and they pulled it of pretty well and with the little bit of fan service they offered the 24 minutes went by pretty quick.This OVA is perfect for the current season, winter, it's just a fun little Christmas Present. "", 'Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara, or If her Flag breaks, was a show that really pushed itself beyond what it tried to be.  Being a show that got mixed reviews and a rather poor assessment from me, well, I had to see the OVA to be completely honest here.  So...what little secrets lie within the quest dormitory this time?Story (6.78/10): Well, to answer that question, not really much.  To be blunt, this is a christmas special, with pretty much the entire cast of the show celebrating christmas.  There\'s not really much to say beyond that.  The characters essentially have a...party complete with the King game, food, and overall wackiness that this show attempts to deliver, in addition to Kanojo ga Flag\'s signature style of character interactions, overly reserved catfights.  This brings me to my next point.The majority of this OVA, and even the original show itself, utilizes the idea of ""overly reserved catfights"", which basically entails our main harem protagonist Souta, being surrounded by about eleven or so girls, most of whom fight against in each for his affection in a way that each of them both don\'t want to lose to anyone else, but also want to be fair and share Souta within them in a very, very passive way.  (Yeah, confusing, I know.)  More or less, this is what the entire OVA is filled with, and really...not much else.Overall, the story of the OVA was decent for what it came from.  I personally didn\'t expect very much from this OVA, so I wasn\'t really thinking much of it.  To put it simply, it was an extra episode that did continue on for what the show was known for without really any major changes to what people who have already seen this show already know.Overview:+/- Overused story idea+/- Kept true to the ""way of storytelling""  (This is a plus and a minus on account of how repetitive and sometimes idiotic the passive catfights are presented.)Characters (5.99/10): The characters in Kanojo ga flag return really without much change.  Although it is standard for an OVA to do this, as the audience is reviewing characters and personalities that they have witnessed before, and may require a refresher, the characters on their lonesome here really aren\'t all that spectacular.We have our main protagonist Hatate Souta, our somewhat emo downer that has a little horde of girls of varying ages trying for his attention.  Throughout this OVA, Souta really just falls into a passive role more than anything else.  While the entire 22 minute runtime is essentially the girls devoting all of their time and effort for Souta\'s sake, Souta...really doesn\'t do anything.  More or less, he just sits there and lets whatever happen, happen.  He didn\'t really take much of a commanding role in the original run of the show either, but here, he just feels a lot more submissive and passive than I had seen before.And then we have the girls of the series.  Nanami, Akane, Kikuno, Mugumu (Yes, I convinced this one is a girl, no matter what anyone else thinks.), Rin, Ruri, Mimori, Obaba, Mei, Kurumiko, Hakua, the teacher and Serika.  This OVA, as I have stated before, is for the most part, all but three of the females listed passively fight over Souta with varying views of love, including but not limited to, little sister, older sister, childhood friend, man friend, etc.  The show really doesn\'t even attempt to go beyond what it already has stated for each of these girls.  Everyone but Nanami is a single trait character, with one trait detailing their entire personality, as such making them perfect for the roles as harem girls.  While this does make understand what is going on a little simpler since characters are easily recognized by their personalities, it really is all just average at best.  Plus, there are just too many of them.  I don\'t remember this show being To-Love-Ru with the sheer amount of girls here.  Hell, they even made a proper dogpile of them in the last few minutes.Overview:+/-  Harem troupes (good for harem, not good for anime)-   Overly passive main character, who is also quite dense at times (like always.)Art and Sound (7.00/10): Both aspects of music and visuals stay relatively the same as before with the actual series.  They reuse the same OP and ED tracks for this OVA, and the art itself doesn\'t really stray from the overly colorful and moe artstyle that this show went for.  The aesthetics for the show are decently well done, and I\'m glad that the style stayed on the same good quality throughout.Overview:+ Consistent qualityPersonal Enjoyment (6.99/10): Kanojo ga flag was in my eyes, an anime that failed on account on trying to accomplish too much in WAY too little time, aka, something I like to call Angel Beats Syndrome.  This OVA however, really didn\'t add too much to the series or redeem it in any way aside from being an extra episode where we get to see the wacky antics of the Quest Dormitory.  I mean, when you have something that\'s a christmas special, what else can you expect?Did I like this OVA?To say it wasn\'t enjoyable is being harsh.  The OVA was really more of a entertainment thing more than anything else.  Particularly because of how it was structured just to be focused around it ""passive catfights"" more than anything else.  What I did like in this however, was how Nanami stayed in her role.  As the character that I consider to be the best out of the entire cast, I was quite happy to see that she didn\'t deviate from her role too much and stayed as a character who was both close to the main protagonist, but wasn\'t made in a way that made her an obvious member of the harem.What didn\'t I like about this OVA?Most likely, the overly reserved catfights.  While they are a part of the show and are essential to how the show was structured, it got tired and old really fast.  I have stated previously that these catfights made up the show and made it infamous for that reason alone.  But when you have an entire episode just straight up about that, yeah, you\'re going to bore your viewers cause there\'s nothing really entertaining about that.Would I recommend this OVA?If you liked Kanojo ga Flag, then go ahead.  If you haven\'t heard of the series or don\'t like it, I would suggest no.  Because of its position as an OVA, this episode I feel would only really appeal to fans of the show on account of its position as an extra episode.Overall Score: 6.47/10 party complete with the King game, food, and overall wackiness that this show attempts to deliver, in addition to Kanojo ga Flag\'s signature style of character interactions, overly reserved catfights.

One thing you can say good about it is that it has alright art and sound for when it made and it does follow a progression. Also, that it's consistent in it's plot and themes and quality, and it does do a good job of bringing the manga to screen.However it does happen to be hard to get all the episodes and to figure out what order they were in, however I do not hold that against it. It's a lower popularity anime from the 80's,...so many things can be forgiven.However this anime has aged like milk in comparison to even some other shows of it's time, especially in the art and sound, and story-wise too. I would love this to be a great underappreciated anime, and it is a little, but it's not good in really any way except the fact it might have inspired a lot of the Lion King, although perhaps only on a subconscious level, because they didn't realize it until it was already almost complete. Nice of the maker of this not to sue.Watch to see an example of a somewhat child anime from the 80's that was mostly average, perhaps even back then, who knows? so many things can be forgiven.However this anime has aged like milk in comparison to even some other shows of it's time, especially in the art and sound, and story-wise too.

Kidou Senshi Gundam MS IGLOO: Mokushiroku 0079,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1916/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_MS_IGLOO__Mokushiroku_0079,"[""Story and CharactersThis awesome sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam MS IGLOO: The Hidden One Year War picks up where the prequel left off, with Lieutenant Oliver May and the 603 Technical Division Unit aboard the Jotunheim continuing testing and evaluating experimental weapons to aid the Zeon war effort against the Federation Forces. A war effort that is not going to well for the Zeon.These 3 OVAs tell stories of another different weapons and their technical champions. The first is about a deep see diving mobile suit piloted by a seaman, who is lovingly and very realistically rendered. He had the best backstory, which is amazing...because like all real sea-men, he doesn't talk very much.The second features small sub-mobile suit units and stars Erwin Cadillac, the unpopular Captain Cadillac's younger brother. Erwin is much more likeable than his sister, winning over basically ... everyone including the viewer. Finally there is the mobile armor who ends up being test piloted by Lieutenant Oliver May himself, yes, things are going THAT desperately in the war. When he came racing to battle in his mobile armor ... for a moment I felt like a proud mother!If I had to rate the OVAs separately, I would have to say the first episode as a standalone would deserve a 10, with the other two being between 8 and 9. Be aware that by this sequel series, you're already fully invested emotionally in the characters so if you're the emotional type (like me) keep the tissues close by.Art/AnimationCGI type similar to Final Fantasy Spirits Within/Advent Children. Some details are unbelievable (can see individual eyelashes and strands of hair) while others look very obviously CGI'd (repetitive explosions) which seem chunky and blocky. Overall, this was well done compared to most of the older gundam series which has dated animation. The animation is more of a personal preference as to whether you like the CGI or cell drawings.SoundSound was the weakest part of this anime. Voice acting was good but music was so so. Except every time they play that sad violin music the viewer gets so well trained that they inevitably expect someone else to die ...EnjoymentVery satisfying conclusion to the 1 year war from all standpoints. Was a toss up between giving this a 8 or 9 rating but overall the first ova was a lot better paced story wise. because like all real sea-men, he doesn't talk very much.The second features small sub-mobile suit units and stars Erwin Cadillac, the unpopular Captain Cadillac's younger brother.

The sequel follows the same formula with a new weapon being introduced in each episode and a pilot to fly it. The final two episodes are strung one after another and don't have the time gap that is evident in the other episodes. The final two episodes are very action oriented and, in my opinion, don't do as a good a job in respects to storytelling.The animation is the same CG as the first OVA,...but it seems a little better. This is probably due to the explosions -- they look extremely realistic. The characters and ships see no improvement, but the animation is still very good overall. Not spectacular, but still very good.The sound is fairly well done. The opening song is nice, and does a good job of setting the mood for the rest of the show. The voice acting is still very good and emotions are very accurately displayed by the actors. The background music is nice and often creates an ominous setting while adding scale to the enormous space battles. Sound is nothing particularly special, but there isn't anything bad about it either.The characters are mostly the same as in the first OVA, but the newly introduced characters, especially the Seaman, add great depth to the story and are very enjoyable. All of the voice actors from the original returned and did an excellent job again.In my opinion, I found this OVA to be better that the previous one, and this is mostly due to the added battle scenes, and the main characters getting a piece of the action. With this the emotions are also a lot higher and since we've become accustomed to watching these characters over six episodes now there is a certain emotional attachment to each one. The ending is very nice as well. Being the only Gundam series without any actual &quot;Gundam Units&quot; this series does a fantastic job of giving the story from the prospective of Zeon. but it seems a little better.

A ""Weird OYW"" show about failed Zeon weapons? It sounded amazing. I still have to admit some of the ideas are rather cool - the giant laser platform for starters.However, why does it get an overall 5 then? Because it\'s distinctly lacking in a lot of ways. The CGI is good when the MS and vehicles are on screen, but the characters cycle through absurd facial expressions. I don\'t know if this poor quality is a limitation of CGI or an intentional homage to the wacky perspective and animation errors of Mobile Suit...Gundam, but either way I greatly prefer the cel-animated look of even shows like Victory Gundam, which itself is on the lower end of animation quality at times.Similarly, some of the weapon ideas are fundamentally stupid, even for the franchise that brought you the Zakrello. The Z\'Gok Diver looks uninteresting, and while it\'s great fun in Giren\'s Ambition V, its episode is quite weak. The plot is predictable in its attempts at eliciting an emotional response, and by the end you have no attachment to the characters because they are so neatly fitting into archetypes. In addition, the ending episodes make prominent the Nazi influence on Zeon to an almost uncomfortable extent - the generic space villains with capes and silly hats of the original series are replaced by trenchcoats, jackboots and other paraphernalia.What the show does do right, most of the time, is action. There are several fights I\'d consider very good (the Hildolfir fighting the Zakus, Char at the Battle of Loum, and the bits of the fall of Zeon you see) but the hamfisted attempts at tragedy make Victory Gundam look like a serious and tragic war story, and it need not be said barely compare to shows like War in the Pocket or Area 88 in their attempts at showing the human cost.Watch MS IGLOO if you\'re a diehard UC fan, or you think Zeon were robbed of victory. Otherwise, it\'s quite possibly the weakest entry in the Universal Century.

Sadly this only happens in the last couple of minutes of every episode. In a brighter side, it's only 3 episodes long, so it won't be too insuferable like the 47 episodes from ZZ.I Zeon's eyes I thought we would get to know the principalty and it's people better. Nah.

In my opinion that her sister is regulating everything, it makes no sense to have that extra episode.Some futures stories are boring as hell and others hopefully lasted 20 seconds, nothing regulated, Definitely not the end I expectedit won't let me do a long review, soI leave you a recipe...for Chilean EmpanadasHow to make Chilean Beef Empanada:1To prepare the dough for the Chilean empanada, start by mixing the flour with the salt and the baking powder on a surface to knead.twoMake a circle with the flour and put the warm butter previously melted in a pan in the center; then add the egg and milk slowly to begin to mix gently with your hands until you achieve a more homogeneous dough.3Let the dough rest for a few minutes and continue kneading.If the consistency is too dry, it continues to be softened with milk, and if we have added too much milk, we can add more flour.Chilean Beef Empanada Recipe - Step 3 Image: Google Images4After kneading, we take out pieces of dough and make spheres to knead again and make dough discs (up to 25 cm in diameter).5Next we will prepare the filling for our Chilean pine or meat empanadas.

I was pleasantly surprised. It works a hell of a lot better than the main anime. If you can put the rest of the series out of your head, it's very watchable. Nothing great just light fluff, about a little sister vetting her big brothers girlfriends in a very bratty kind of way but fun.The story makes much more sense than the mainl.  The characters are there and mostly stand on their own except for the cross dressing ninja from the main series. You got the feeling she was put in there...as filler because they needed an extra couple of minutes of story line. Art and sound aren't bad nor particularly good. The character designs are a bit above average.If you have time to kill and like bratty little sister you could easily do worse. as filler because they needed an extra couple of minutes of story line.

A lot of them, unfortunately.StoryThe story is quite interesting, and fairly original. The quality of its presentation varies throughout the series, however - foreshadowing, for example, is plentiful and very well intertwined into the story, so that little details that you might notice but not think much of turn out to be intricate plot points later on.  On the other hand, there're the cheesy &quot;OMG! The sky is falling!&quot; bits usually associated with fantasy series surfacing all around the second half of the series which definitely...hurts the suspense of disbelief. Another flaw is the climax being stretched into the last 3 episodes which could've easily fit in a single one.ArtNot bad, but nothing to write home about. It's detailed and fairly pretty, but the sudden switches from ultra-contrasting (butterfly clouds, Hikari's hair and dreams) to ultra-pale colours (most secondary characters, slice of life sections) that happen every few minutes are annoying. The deformed butterfly logo is a definite plus though - very memorable.SoundThe opening/ending songs are quite generic, but the last episode's ED is nice if only for the fact that it's meaningful in the context, which is a rare occurrence in anime. Background audio is hardly noticeable, but it completes the atmosphere well enough so that's good.CharactersI'm a bit torn on this point. On one hand, the four main characters are very likeable and by the end I definitely cared about their fate. On the other, however, apart from Akari, all of the characters bring on a sense of deja vu; a reckless protagonist with a funky hairstyle, a troubled past and superpowers - check; a jealous childhood friend - check; a calm and popular big brother - check; a busty foreign drunkard who is actually wise and &quot;cool&quot; - check as well, and those 4 is just the icing.Enjoyment / OverallI've enjoyed the series, personally, but it felt like I had to go through all the silly action segments, plain stupid fan service, boring showcases of jealousy and unfunny jokes to get to the few excellent romantic scenes here and there. On the whole it was worth it, but it could've been much better if they didn't try to put in a little of every genre and concentrated on getting just one or two right. hurts the suspense of disbelief.

Then it sprinkled some ""sad, but true"" stories of the past.Let\'s start off with the good. The art is fairly decent. For the most part, colors are nice, and natural features such as the trees and character outlines are quite nice. Hikari\'s outfit in particular is great. Sound isn\'t really...noticeable for me until near the climax, in most cases it was absent at all, which sometimes is a nice change of things.

It&rsquo;s such a shame, because this series is a little jewel. There is something in this anime for everyone.Story:The only reason the story gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because this anime was so short. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy short animes. However, the basic concept had so much depth this series could've easily had 120 episodes instead of 12 without repeating itself at all.One thing this series can be described as is dynamic: shojo, shonen, slice of life and certain elements of the...supernatural are seamlessly interwoven from episode to episode. This change of pace helps keep things fresh.Art:Probably my favourite aspect of the art is Hikari and Akari&rsquo;s designs. It&rsquo;s hard to find cuter girls anywhere. It doesn&rsquo;t stop there, however. If you are able to peel your eyes away from the pretty, pretty characters, you&rsquo;ll see that the scenery is also rich and detailed, and the brief, but very epic action scenes will knock your breath out. The opening is really nice and the animation is smooth.Sound:What is guaranteed to capture everyone&rsquo;s attention from the start is the opening theme, Metamorphose. It&rsquo;s sung by Yoko Takahashi, the same singer who did Cruel Angel&rsquo;s Thesis in NGE, and is probably the best opening music I have ever heard. With that said, it overshadows the ending theme a little bit, but both are really nice.Granted, the English dub could&rsquo;ve been a lot better. Takeru and Ryon especially don&rsquo;t always sound natural, but it&rsquo;s not bad.Character:I dare you not to fall in love with Hikari or Akari. I DARE you.

The story itself has a somewhat predictable ending, in my opinion, but it finishes quite well.Art-wise, I think presently...that most of the prolific stuff is coming out of Kyoto and Artland, with Melancholy/Luck Star and Mushishi, respectively. While it didn't blow me away it didn't take away from the series itself, which is the main reason I gave it the score I did.Music: Personally I think it has one of the best opening songs in quite a while, with the simple music carrying the words rather nicely. The insert music has a habit of blending in with the dialog, which is a plus in my book.At the end of the series I really cared about the characters - a lot. On top of that there was a lot more main characters involved, unlike NGE, but it did not get bogged down.Obviously I found it entertaining, but if I would really have to classify it it would be Evangelion's drama mixed with Furi Kuri's humor, then some relationships development tossed in for good measure. All the same it was balanced rather well.In general I would recommend this anime to pretty much anyone, especially someone just interested in the genre but not really well versed in it. Admittedly I was quite surprised to see that there were so few people that had actually listed it under their anime list, especially given that it is a GAINAX, and I think it is being overlooked by too many viewers. that most of the prolific stuff is coming out of Kyoto and Artland, with Melancholy/Luck Star and Mushishi, respectively.

Basically this anime has been around the block a few times. It's always with some new twist, but still the same generic, true to its roots as fanboy/girl anime. Am I being too harsh? No.When you set out to make an anime, any anime, you need to have some sort of idea of how the characters act in the anime. If, as so many times before, the characters feel as unreal and sort of pasted in as they did in this anime then the anime probably isn't going to turn out...to be very entertaining, or whatever they wanted this anime to make its viewers feel/think.

Put on your Indiana Jones outfits, because we are going deep into the obscure for this bit of anime archaeology. ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" which I will hereafter refer to as ""TUYBW"" is a series that came out in 2004, but was completely forgotten shortly after despite a decent budget and being produced by freaking GAINAX themselves! How could a Gainax anime become so quickly forgotten despite the legions of fanboys that will swallow anything Gainax shits out? The answer is timing and overshadowing. If another...series has a VERY similar plot and premise, but becomes much more famous and came out at the exact same time, it is possible for the twin series to be completely buried. An example of this would be Independence Day vs. Mars Attacks, which came out the same year. Tim Burton is usually much better liked than Emmerich, but Mars Attacks was completely forgotten and overlooked because of the hype surrounding Independence Day. I will explain in the next paragraph.TUYBW is about a bland male protagonist who finds a naked girl in the middle of the woods. This naked chick suffers from amnesia, but rather than take her to the hospital or police station, he decides to take her home. Unfortunately, this chick has multiple personalities and one of them is an evil killing machine! This was the year 2004. At the same time TUYBW was airing, another anime called Elfen Lied came out with the same plot and quickly gained fame online for being ""over the top madness"" and one of the goriest anime people had seen in years, because no one cared about the utter bullshit that is Gantz. Elfen Lied spread through word of mouth, AMVs, and youtube clips like wild fire, whereas TUYBW was simply overlooked in favor of its bolder cousin.The interesting thing is that TUYBW came out BEFORE the Elfen Lied anime, but after the Elfen Lied manga. So is one a ripoff of the other? Not really. The plot of a clueless male finding a beautiful, injured chick that claims to have amnesia, but is really a psycho killer and bringing her home despite ALL logic was actually started way back in 1952 in the novel East of Eden by John Steinbeck. That\'s right kids! If you need to blame someone for that ridiculous sub-plot, blame Steinbeck, because it is entirely his fault!So what exactly made Elfen Lied take off in fame and TUYBW languish in obscurity? The most obvious answer would be ""shock and awe"". TUYBW was aired on regular Japanese cable and couldn\'t afford to push the envelope with gore, nudity, and controversial topics such as child abuse, animal abuse, and graphic human experimentation. This was one factor that made Elfen Lied catch people\'s eyes much more effectively than TUYBW. However, the real answer is one word: ""ambition"". TUYBW never tried to take itself that seriously, remotely challenge the viewer\'s worldview, or really try very hard in any category. The reality is that TUYBW is completely average to mediocre across the board from characters to soundtrack, to animation. Elfen Lied is a highly divisive series that is either considered complete garbage or a freaking masterpiece of anime. The reason is that Elfen Lied no matter how much some people hate it actually DID try. EL had a unique opening for its time that referenced classical art while playing a rather haunting, yet serene Gregorian hymn. TUYBW just has a VERY generic opening. Elfen Lied tried to use CG mixed with traditional animation, whereas TUYBW is one time Gainax did NOT go all out in the art department. It is simply par for the course animation. Elfen Lied offered rather memorable (even if completely insane) characters and tried hard enough in its plot that you WILL remember it whether you love it or hate it. TUYBW is the type of anime that is so generic that you watch it and forget the next week that you ever watched it.Overall: 5/10Am I saying that TUYBW is a buried gem that was unjustly overshadowed? No! I just wanted to shed some light on an obscure series and try analyze why some series get famous and others are forgotten. To be honest, TUYBW is a very average and cookie cutter series that no one should really have a reason to watch. It isn\'t good, but it isn\'t memorably bad either. It is forgettable vanilla, which in my opinion is the type of anime that is least worth watching! series has a VERY similar plot and premise, but becomes much more famous and came out at the exact same time, it is possible for the twin series to be completely buried. An example of this would be Independence Day vs. Mars Attacks, which came out the same year. Tim Burton is usually much better liked than Emmerich, but Mars Attacks was completely forgotten and overlooked because of the hype surrounding Independence Day. I will explain in the next paragraph.TUYBW is about a bland male protagonist who finds a naked girl in the middle of the woods. This naked chick suffers from amnesia, but rather than take her to the hospital or police station, he decides to take her home. Unfortunately, this chick has multiple personalities and one of them is an evil killing machine! This was the year 2004. At the same time TUYBW was airing, another anime called Elfen Lied came out with the same plot and quickly gained fame online for being ""over the top madness"" and one of the goriest anime people had seen in years, because no one cared about the utter bullshit that is Gantz. Elfen Lied spread through word of mouth, AMVs, and youtube clips like wild fire, whereas TUYBW was simply overlooked in favor of its bolder cousin.The interesting thing is that TUYBW came out BEFORE the Elfen Lied anime, but after the Elfen Lied manga. So is one a ripoff of the other? Not really. The plot of a clueless male finding a beautiful, injured chick that claims to have amnesia, but is really a psycho killer and bringing her home despite ALL logic was actually started way back in 1952 in the novel East of Eden by John Steinbeck. That\'s right kids! If you need to blame someone for that ridiculous sub-plot, blame Steinbeck, because it is entirely his fault!So what exactly made Elfen Lied take off in fame and TUYBW languish in obscurity? The most obvious answer would be ""shock and awe"". TUYBW was aired on regular Japanese cable and couldn\'t afford to push the envelope with gore, nudity, and controversial topics such as child abuse, animal abuse, and graphic human experimentation. This was one factor that made Elfen Lied catch people\'s eyes much more effectively than TUYBW. However, the real answer is one word: ""ambition"". TUYBW never tried to take itself that seriously, remotely challenge the viewer\'s worldview, or really try very hard in any category. The reality is that TUYBW is completely average to mediocre across the board from characters to soundtrack, to animation. Elfen Lied is a highly divisive series that is either considered complete garbage or a freaking masterpiece of anime. The reason is that Elfen Lied no matter how much some people hate it actually DID try. EL had a unique opening for its time that referenced classical art while playing a rather haunting, yet serene Gregorian hymn. TUYBW just has a VERY generic opening. Elfen Lied tried to use CG mixed with traditional animation, whereas TUYBW is one time Gainax did NOT go all out in the art department. It is simply par for the course animation. Elfen Lied offered rather memorable (even if completely insane) characters and tried hard enough in its plot that you WILL remember it whether you love it or hate it.

This one has both, but the romance is passing odd. The kids in the story are all in high school, but when romance time arrives the boys regress to approximately age 11. They agonize endless (usually through several tiresome episodes) before they kiss the girl, no matter how clear she makes it that they're welcome to do so. In general, these late-teen anime boys twitch and draw back like...maidens on their wedding night whenever a girl gets close to them physically or emotionally.

"", ""Note:  This is the review I wrote for Netflix.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone...or something like that :)SPOILER ALERT!I have read several reviews saying people did not like this anime. I'm sorry to hear that. One reason people were unhappy with it is the amount of nudity. Yes, I agree, it was a bit excessive at times. However, the two characters who were usually naked were Hikari and Akari, and since they had no physical form before coming to Earth, it makes sense that they would not conform to boundaries that other humans abide by (i.e. wearing clothing at...all times). There were also a couple shower/tub scenes with naked girls, but in Japan, it is not uncommon for family members or close girl friends to bathe together. I mean, heck, they have public bath houses in Japan, after all. Viewers simply find it shocking because it is nowhere near common in America. In conclusion, perhaps the rating should be more like 16+, as this amount of nudity is not appropriate for a 14-year-old in the States to be seeing.Moving on, another common complaint I saw was about the ending. No, so it didn't have a happy ending. Not everything in life is flowers in sunshine. But you know what it did have? A believable ending. I'm really not sure how it could have ended any other way. It's how it HAD to end. And it was moving. I teared up at the end when Hikari and Takeru had to be separated, especially the ending scene she saw at Takeru's house for the last time when she saw all she could have had as a human; everything she had to give up by doing what was necessary in order to save the planet she'd come to love.Overall, it was sometimes funny, sometimes sad, always beautiful anime with likeable, believable characters who capture the viewers' attention and hearts.

It's time for This Ugly Yet Beautiful world, so here we go!In the long history of the Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions, each one wiping millions of life forms out of existence.  Because of this, over ninety nine percent of all life forms that have ever existed on earth are now gone forever.  But what caused these mass extinctions, what was their true purpose, and...  When will it happen again?Following this admittedly intriguing monologue, we...cut to our main character, Takeru Takemoto, delivering a monologue of his own.  He talks about war, famine, disease, and all that fun stuff as an excuse to get out of helping his classmates clean the pool.  Yes, this is our main character.  He then lies around, wondering what he should do while doing absolutely nothing.  And in the same episode, he remarks that his uncle, who owns his own delivery service AND dormitories, where Takeru is living for free, isn’t ambitious enough.This is a person that I wouldn’t want to be friends with under any circumstances, and yet he actually has a healthy little collection of five friends that spend way too much time at his dorm and obsess way too hard over his love life.  But I digress.He and his best friend Ryou are out making a delivery when they witness a bright comet shooting down from the sky.  It doesn’t move like an inanimate object, though...  It moves like it has a destination in mind, and after following this light, Takeru discovers a beautiful naked girl with orange hair...  Who he names Hikari.  Japanese for light, of course.  Because Chi.  She forms an instant attachment to him...  Like a newborn animal would...  and their whirlwind romance thus begins.Much like Mahoromatic, this series was a joint effort between Studio Gainax and Studio Shaft.  While neither studio is perfect, and they’ve both released some poor looking shows in the past, the animation in This Ugly is embarrassing by either studio’s standards.  The budget was clearly bare bones, and even the high points of the story are marred by obvious tricks like sudden technique changes, bounce-walking, and speed lines.  The artwork is equally bad, with flat coloring, boring backgrounds, and enough jagged outlines to make FMA Brotherhood look lovingly rendered.As far as the character designs, they’re nothing special...  Derivative and forgettable are the words of the day, at least for the most part.  The only thing really noteworthy is the insert from the first volume DVD, in which the Character Designer and Chief Animation Director himself chronicles his reasons behind each design.  Without any exaggeration, his explanations range from such deep, complex specifications as “I thought this would be cute” to “I wanted him to look cool” to “I like large breasts.”Although one of Takeru’s buddies was apparently based on a famous Japanese motorcycle who died shortly before production began.  Do with that tidbit as you will.As for the music?  I didn’t like it.  The tunes were repeated over and over again, which sucks, because I find about half of them distracting and inappropriate to the series.  The opening, however, is a thing of beauty, possibly one of the top ten of 2004.In any case, for the sake of Studio Gainax’s twentieth anniversary production, we’ll suspend disbelief and pretend that science doesn’t exist.  We’ll pretend that each mass extinction was caused by a supernatural being that periodically comes to earth on a comet, takes the form of whatever the most intelligent creature in existence is at that time, and evaluates the world to see if it needs to be demolished.  We won’t ask where they came from, or how this system came to be, or how the Earth knows to send battle monsters to stop these entities, because we don’t want to go to bed feeling as though we’ve wasted precious energy that we can’t get back.The entity splits into two, and this time around, those two take the form of hyper-sexualized teenaged moe girls who are given the names of Hikari and Akari.  Yes, that’s a spoiler, but trust me, knowing that in advance won’t hurt anything.  Hikari winds up with lazy boy Takeru, and we’ll call that Story A.  Akari winds up in the home of the space cadet Ryou, and we’ll call that Story B.  Story A, as I mentioned in my plot summary, is a romance tale.  And I’m going to say this up front, it is a very weak romance tale.  Both of our main characters are completely milquetoast, with the only really interesting thing about either one being their tragic backstories.  They flounder in their efforts to form a relationship,  and while there is a pretty good reason, the awkwardness between them can sometimes be flat-out painful.  I mean, I have Asperger’s syndrome, and even *I* wouldn’t strike out in some of the situations that Takeru finds himself in.On the other side of the coin, we have the B side of the story, which in my opinion should have been the true A side, as it’s a lot stronger.  Ryou is a pretty damn likeable character, despite all his bishie-ness.  While laid back and easy-going, he’s a very paternal figure to his precocious little sister, whom he allows to think that she’s the one in charge.  They pick up Akari, and while I’d be hard-pressed to say she has any important role in the story, she’s still given much more personality and development than her ‘sister’ is.  I may be alone in this, but I found myself enjoying the show a lot more when the three of them were on screen.  They even get some pretty good blink-and-you’ll-miss-it sight gags, if you’re looking hard enough.  Like Ryou being the only person on a test of courage to be dressed as a western monster.  or Akari catching a giant fish with a nude bear-hug, only to be seen subtly gnawing on it’s severed head at lunch a few scenes later.As for the supporting cast, there’s little to no support to be found.  Takeru has two male friends, who obsess over the fact that he’s living with a hot girl, and two female friends, who call those two stupid.  Oh, they also coordinate activities and make clothes for the aliens.  Overall, characters that need not exist, as there’s nothing they contribute to the plot that other characters couldn’t offer.  I found myself wondering why they all invested so much of their time in such a boring character’s life.He Also has a cousin named Mari who’s madly in love with him, but didn’t know it until he was taken...  I guess I should be disgusted by that, but this is Japan, and that DOES sound like typical teenage logic.  Besides, I can’t hate a Luci Christian character.  What I can hate, however, is the American scientist that lives in their dorm, and embodies every single stereotype that the Japanese may have against American women.  She’s loose, she’s an alcoholic, she’s immodest, she’s always making passes at her teenage co-stars, she looks like Ritsuko Akagi...  She’s investigating the mass extinction, and she just happens to move into the exact right dorm house.  Hikari introduces herself as an alien, so of course, Jennifer Portman’s first instinct is to shower with her.They also have two alien sidekicks named Ku-on and Ionios, and I actually found them to be quite funny.Now, I can’t talk about the English dub without addressing a very interesting little fact.  For whatever reason, the majority of the actors used really ridiculous false names.  Was the show so bad that they didn’t want their names attached to it, or was this just a joke?  I can’t find any explanation, but if I meet one of them at a con, that’ll be my first question.Cynthia Martinez...  AKA Goldie Fawn...  Has been a favorite of mine in some shows, and I never really minded her gravely voice up until now.  Her line deliveries are spot on, but the tone and pitch of Hikari’s voice makes HER voice sound like a dying cat.  Shelley Calleen Black does a great job relaying all of Ms. Portman’s eccentricities, as much as I may hate the character, and Hilary Haag...  AKA Alexis Bestman... is adorable in the role of Kimi.  Quentin Haag, presumably related to her, has only had seven acting roles to date, but he does a pretty decent job in the role of Ryou.Braden Hunt doesn’t fair nearly as well in the role of Takeru, giving a performance that’s charmless and wooden throughout.  Taylor Hannah, Chris Patton and Monica rial are wasted in low profile roles, when they could have easily taken on the starring roles by themselves.  Patton and Rial as Takeru and Hikari?  Yes, please!But the star of the dub is Jessica Boone... Or Circe Nightshade of SNL fame... playing the role of Akari.  She’s playing a sweet, wide-eyed innocent who’s trying to enjoy life to the fullest as she secretly evaluates it, waiting patiently for a tragedy that she knows will eventually occur...  It’s a subtle performance, and she plays with this nuance beautifully.  Hell, she’s so good that other actors sound better just by interacting with her.Fun fact:  About half of the affore-mentioned characters will, at some point, make a pretentious speech.  Okay, so that’s not a very fun fact, but it’s also a fact that can’t be avoided.  Gainax has always been known to indulge in pretense, but this particular project takes that predilection to a whole new level.  This anime is very pretentious, and it LOVES to hear itself talk.  The characters are blabbing with more ideas than the series is willing to commit to, ruminating on the nature of life, and spewing philosophical metaphors that barely make sense and never really get explored.  This is where the collaboration of Gainax and Shaft comes to blows, as it seems like the former is trying it’s damnedest to bring depth to the material, which the latter is trying to jam with as much gratuitous nudity as possible.The basic plot could be an interesting one, scientific heresy be damned, but the writing that should be supporting it is awful, and I’m not just talking about the awkward translations.  There’s barely any development, way too many characters, character descriptions that are told to us rather than shown to us, constant otaku pandering, and aimless philosophizing that serves no purpose other than to jam the characters heads up their shiny asses.  The humor occasionally works, and when it does, the comic timing is spot-on.  But this show isn’t focused on being funny.  It tries to be serious and tell it’s story, while dishing out wacky hijinks and harem cliches, despite not really being a harem show.  The filler material makes up half of the story, and it can range from tolerable at best to painful at worst, with the obligatory beach episode being a particularly low note.And yet, even when it is focused entirely on it’s plot, it’s still barely watchable, as that plot relies too much on it’s milquetoast leads.  I won’t reveal how the multi-episode climax plays out, but it is both catalyzed and carried through by some of the most melodramatic high school bullshit ever animated.In short, I rarely ever see a story or plot that are executed this terribly.However, despite my complaints, I like this show.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s bad, there’s no arguing that.  It might be the worst Gainax show that I’ve ever seen, and it rips off former Gainax properties without mercy or restraint.  But it’s a pleasant kind of bad...  The kind you pop into your DVD player when you’re feeling bored and forgiving.  It’s lighthearted, and if you’re not overthinking it, it isn’t too insulting or offensive either.  And I genuinely do like the side B story, at least for what it offers.  It’s an ugly show, without a doubt, but there’s still some beauty to it, which is why I’m going to be generous and give it a 4/10.  You can shave off two full points if underaged nudity gives you the creeps, and I’ll understand completely. cut to our main character, Takeru Takemoto, delivering a monologue of his own.

Like Ryou being the only person on a test of courage to be dressed as a western monster.  or Akari catching a giant fish with a nude bear-hug, only to be seen subtly gnawing on it’s severed head at lunch a few scenes later.As for the supporting cast, there’s little to no support to be found.  Takeru has two male friends, who obsess over the fact that he’s living with a hot girl, and two female friends, who call those two stupid.  Oh, they also coordinate activities and make clothes for the aliens.  Overall, characters that need not exist, as there’s nothing they contribute to the plot that other characters couldn’t offer.  I found myself wondering why they all invested so much of their time in such a boring character’s life.He Also has a cousin named Mari who’s madly in love with him, but didn’t know it until he was taken...  I guess I should be disgusted by that, but this is Japan, and that DOES sound like typical teenage logic.  Besides, I can’t hate a Luci Christian character.  What I can hate, however, is the American scientist that lives in their dorm, and embodies every single stereotype that the Japanese may have against American women.  She’s loose, she’s an alcoholic, she’s immodest, she’s always making passes at her teenage co-stars, she looks like Ritsuko Akagi...  She’s investigating the mass extinction, and she just happens to move into the exact right dorm house.  Hikari introduces herself as an alien, so of course, Jennifer Portman’s first instinct is to shower with her.They also have two alien sidekicks named Ku-on and Ionios, and I actually found them to be quite funny.Now, I can’t talk about the English dub without addressing a very interesting little fact.  For whatever reason, the majority of the actors used really ridiculous false names.  Was the show so bad that they didn’t want their names attached to it, or was this just a joke?  I can’t find any explanation, but if I meet one of them at a con, that’ll be my first question.Cynthia Martinez...  AKA Goldie Fawn...  Has been a favorite of mine in some shows, and I never really minded her gravely voice up until now.  Her line deliveries are spot on, but the tone and pitch of Hikari’s voice makes HER voice sound like a dying cat.  Shelley Calleen Black does a great job relaying all of Ms. Portman’s eccentricities, as much as I may hate the character, and Hilary Haag...  AKA Alexis Bestman... is adorable in the role of Kimi.  Quentin Haag, presumably related to her, has only had seven acting roles to date, but he does a pretty decent job in the role of Ryou.Braden Hunt doesn’t fair nearly as well in the role of Takeru, giving a performance that’s charmless and wooden throughout.  Taylor Hannah, Chris Patton and Monica rial are wasted in low profile roles, when they could have easily taken on the starring roles by themselves.  Patton and Rial as Takeru and Hikari?  Yes, please!But the star of the dub is Jessica Boone... Or Circe Nightshade of SNL fame... playing the role of Akari.  She’s playing a sweet, wide-eyed innocent who’s trying to enjoy life to the fullest as she secretly evaluates it, waiting patiently for a tragedy that she knows will eventually occur...  It’s a subtle performance, and she plays with this nuance beautifully.  Hell, she’s so good that other actors sound better just by interacting with her.Fun fact:  About half of the affore-mentioned characters will, at some point, make a pretentious speech.  Okay, so that’s not a very fun fact, but it’s also a fact that can’t be avoided.  Gainax has always been known to indulge in pretense, but this particular project takes that predilection to a whole new level.  This anime is very pretentious, and it LOVES to hear itself talk.  The characters are blabbing with more ideas than the series is willing to commit to, ruminating on the nature of life, and spewing philosophical metaphors that barely make sense and never really get explored.  This is where the collaboration of Gainax and Shaft comes to blows, as it seems like the former is trying it’s damnedest to bring depth to the material, which the latter is trying to jam with as much gratuitous nudity as possible.The basic plot could be an interesting one, scientific heresy be damned, but the writing that should be supporting it is awful, and I’m not just talking about the awkward translations.  There’s barely any development, way too many characters, character descriptions that are told to us rather than shown to us, constant otaku pandering, and aimless philosophizing that serves no purpose other than to jam the characters heads up their shiny asses.  The humor occasionally works, and when it does, the comic timing is spot-on.  But this show isn’t focused on being funny.  It tries to be serious and tell it’s story, while dishing out wacky hijinks and harem cliches, despite not really being a harem show.  The filler material makes up half of the story, and it can range from tolerable at best to painful at worst, with the obligatory beach episode being a particularly low note.And yet, even when it is focused entirely on it’s plot, it’s still barely watchable, as that plot relies too much on it’s milquetoast leads.  I won’t reveal how the multi-episode climax plays out, but it is both catalyzed and carried through by some of the most melodramatic high school bullshit ever animated.In short, I rarely ever see a story or plot that are executed this terribly.However, despite my complaints, I like this show.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s bad, there’s no arguing that.  It might be the worst Gainax show that I’ve ever seen, and it rips off former Gainax properties without mercy or restraint.  But it’s a pleasant kind of bad...  The kind you pop into your DVD player when you’re feeling bored and forgiving.  It’s lighthearted, and if you’re not overthinking it, it isn’t too insulting or offensive either.  And I genuinely do like the side B story, at least for what it offers.  It’s an ugly show, without a doubt, but there’s still some beauty to it, which is why I’m going to be generous and give it a 4/10.  You can shave off two full points if underaged nudity gives you the creeps, and I’ll understand completely."", ""In my honest opinion, this anime was an average to me. It had a good story line and was funny at points, but it took everything I had just to watch it. I also didn't like the fact that the ending was so.......bad. Sorry to anyone who thought this anime was great, but I'm just voicing my opinion on the matter. If they want to make it better, the people who made this could add a second season to further explain the series. So that's my opinion on TUYBW.

In the latter half  , it does  pick  up  a bit, which redeems the  series.The characters seem  a bit generic at  times, yet at  other times  they really shine and  come into their own.So   as i mentioned  above , its worth  a look, just don\'t expect brilliance   because its not  , but its a good  solid performance  for all that i would have given up.

This Ugly Yet Beautiful world started out strong. The first episode was really good. But then everything just went down hill from there. The concept was good, the storyline was good, there was just some rough areas of this anime.I'm gonna start this review with the pros of this anime. The storyline, I thought, was very interesting. The concept of two girls coming from space and taking human form is what made me want to watch this. The characters are okay. Some of the characters are just unneeded and unwanted in my opinion. I...thought that ending was good though.Okay, now the cons. The anime started out strong like I already said. The problem with starting off strong is you have to stay strong. This anime, unfortunately, didn't. Episodes 2-8 honestly, I don't even want to call them filler episodes because some of the episodes didn't even tell you anything. Some of the episodes were just really unneeded. I watched the dubbed version. If you watch, be prepared for Hakari's voice because her voice made me want to just watch the subbed version. I found that this anime turned more into a romantic drama because of all the love triangles that happen. There's a love triangle between Takeru, Hakari, and Mari even though Takeru and Mari are cousins. There's also a (family) love triangle between Ryou, Kimi, and Akari. I feel like you could've probably watched the first episode and then the last 3 episodes and you would've understood what happened. If this anime was over 12 episodes, I probably wouldn't have finished it. There's also a lot of unnecessary nudity.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this anime to someone. Even if I did recommend this to someone, I would say to just watch the first episode and then the last 3 because those are really the only episodes you need to watch. thought that ending was good though.Okay, now the cons.

For this, I would say that the title is creative and appropriate because it introduces this concept of two perceptions or sides. The heaviest emphasis on duality comes mostly from the characters, but also the underlying message (that can be derived from the title). It makes the viewer think and notice how the story has depth to it. I praise this and welcome it, and would say that, beyond anything else, it is the duality that makes this anime...worth the watch. worth the watch.', 'takeru takemono and his friend ryou nishino are out on his motobike one night. one there way back to his house they see a light that flys though the sky and lands in a tree. the boys run over to find a strange girl floating in the tree. she is named hikari. takeru gets hikari down from the tree and decides that they should take her home with them. before they leave the three of them are attcked by a monster that seems to be drawn to hikari. takeru proteat hikari with an stange power that he suddenly got. they defeat the monster and take...hikari back with them. a few days later another girl is found, by ryou. the two girls are brought together and class each other as sisters. it is later discovered that hikari and akari are aleins from a distant demension, unknown by any of them, that the hikari and akari were actually sent to earth to destroy it. later in the anime hikari discovers her dark and evil side that wishes to get rid of her friends and destroy the planet. find out if takeru can stop her, watch to find out hikari back with them. a few days later another girl is found, by ryou. the two girls are brought together and class each other as sisters. it is later discovered that hikari and akari are aleins from a distant demension, unknown by any of them, that the hikari and akari were actually sent to earth to destroy it. later in the anime hikari discovers her dark and evil side that wishes to get rid of her friends and destroy the planet. find out if takeru can stop her, watch to find out', 'I liked this one it is sweet and cute and this is from someone who like films such as Elfen Lied, well it is a nice story, hard to explain but it is the type of film that gives you a warm feeling afterwards.Plot line is the normal boy meets girl, it possibly helps that she is naked and has no memory where her clothes are let alone who she is, anyway forget about the plot it is a nice film with some good funny bits, so what are you waiting for go watch it, you will not be disappointed. ', 'I heard some things about this anime so I decided to give it a shot. Here\'s my review:Story/CharactersBasically it\'s a boy meets girl love story of sorts mixed in with some sci-fi drama and comedy. There\'s really nothing wrong with that format, but it gets overused and many of times, it\'s always the same. In this anime it\'s no exception. The love story part would have been nice if they actually made better characters, but the characters just plain suck. Hikari is your prototypical goodie two shoes with a ""dark"" side (yeah didn\'t see that one coming..rolls eyes) and Takaru the male lead is just...a moron who just does whatever he feels. I mean this girl literally falls out of the sky and a freaking monster attackers her and they Takaru and his friends don\'t even seem the slightest bit scared or consider this to be a strange situation? I mean seriously? It\'s just hard to believe that the characters just go along with everything; makes me feel like I\'m getting trolled. Anyways, just a bad story and bad characters overall 3/10. BTW did I mention it goes by really fast. I mean the girl is literally in his house the next day like nothing ever happened. Yeah right.ArtworkNot particularly great. It\'s very simplistic, no high details any where, it\'s just mediocre to be honest.SoundEhh I watched the English version and it was just plain bad. I mean freaking terrible. Half the time I couldn\'t understand jack squat they said. Maybe I\'ll watch the Japanese version, but..it\'s a pretty below average anime so I think I won\'t waste my time on it. The music at times was very please. For example when they contemplate things it gives you this very good piano or strings music that fits the mood just right. Can\'t really say the music was bad, it was pretty decent.OverallOverall I was like ""ehh"" watching this show. I never really laughed, never felt anything for the characters, it was just ehh..By the end I was like wow that\'s it?..terrible. I pretty below average anime and that\'s not good. Ugly definitely, beautiful...hell no! a moron who just does whatever he feels.

Now I’ve already ventured through Mahoromatic before and I know what content to expect from these two studios.Takeru and Ryou are high school students who work doing deliveries for the former\'s uncle. One night, the two go to investigate a mysterious light in the woods only to find a young girl. Takeru and Ryou are attacked by an alien, which is defeated when Takeru transforms into a powerful and strange looking beast...himself. The girl, whom the boys’ name ""Hikari"" (light), is taken in by Takeru when she confesses to having no memory of who she is.They are later joined by Jennifer Portman, an American scientist with an interest in the boys and Hikari; Ioneos, a shape-shifting robot loyal to Hikari; Kuon, a little floating alien; and Akari, Hikari\'s ""sister"". The series follows the daily lives of its characters as they learn about the human condition and face the incoming monsters.Now upon watching this series, I started to notice a trend within the show, such as taking in an unknown possibly non-human young girl into your place, the main male characters somewhat hate their current life based on stuff in the past (very horrible things), robots are involved, the kicked-in sci-fi element, an older but annoying character who drunks a lot, a harem of girls who crushes on you, the tsundere who’s really has a crush on you, the other alien girl also completely unknown of Earth’s customs.In fact, this is more like the twin of Mahoromatic. Unfortunately, this is the ungrateful/unimaginative twin who can’t think of anything significant besides basically being a copycat to the older source. The story is very generic from the get-go, if you know much of Gainax or Shaft properties.  The characters give or take, are basically the anime stereotypes we know but hell, I don’t love them that much. Takeru is the miserable pessimistic yet turns a little optimistic teenager who’s often lazy & unmotivated but can transform a powerful primal being……but only for a few episodes that’s ever mentioned. Ryou is Takeru’s best friend who captured the hearts of many girls at his school (including Sakurako and Amika – yeah, that’s all they get for character description) and always has this feel-good position whenever about something and also his sister Kimi, who is the stereotype of kid sister who knows way too much of their age…..and yet I don’t give a damn. Mari is the typical tsundere character, who is also in love with Takeru and oh yeah, she’s also his cousin.  Then comes the lone foreigner (or American) Jennifer Portman, who I swear is more like the molesting teacher in Mahoromatic or Misato & Ritsuko in Evangelion but more annoying, drunk, and not that funny. She’s just being unbearable whenever she appears. There’s also Shinichi Asakura and Daijirou Matsumura, who always want to fulfill their sexual fantasy ever since meeting Hikari and they are really just beating (or in this case, fucking) a dead horse with that stereotype.For the animation, what did you expect from Gainax and Shaft? Fan service is all around the place from her, but that isn’t why the anime isn’t that great and the budget constraints do show many times here with speed lines, weird and awkward movements, and often contrived pacing. The opening theme is actually very intense and has the dramatic feel set for the show while the ending theme is too much fluff and no twist. BGM is marginally okay but nothing home to write about. The dub by ADV Films was decent but some of the voices just felt too irritating, especially from some of the female characters (mostly Jennifer), but other than that, there was nothing noteworthy of the dub but passable.FINAL VERDICT: This has the same elements of the other Gainax/Shaft series, but this is just pure laziness and dribble from beginning to end.  I can’t recommended this series unless you want to experience déjà vu but shorter.

Renai Flops,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51403/Renai_Flops,"['Renai flops came out of nowhere and became one of my fave shows of Fall 2022. While the first half follows the usual path of a generic fan-service harem rom com, it becomes something more substantive in the second half and truly won me over.If you’re someone with a short fuse and low tolerance for non-sense, I can tell you right now Renai Flops won’t be for you. Its first episodes are intentionally trope-y and very generic. But if you’re too quick to drop the show, you’ll miss out on seeing how the show actually deconstructs some of these generic tropes. While the first few...episodes largely feature your usual harem shenanigans, the second half contains a pretty major plot twist that turns the world upside down and changes how you look at the reality these characters are living in. Many of those generic tropes from earlier episodes will take on a totally different meaning if you’re able to stick it out. The closest thing I would compare it to is Muv luv, of which it clearly takes some inspiration and in a way parodies.While I am a sucker for ecchi fan service moments and harems, I actually enjoyed the second half of the show more. I thought the fan service was a little half-assed and weak compared to other shows like this, so getting an actual good story that made sense and fleshed things out more was welcome. The MC is actually pretty solid which is a rarity in shows like this as well. While he is not Kiyopon or Yuichi levels of cool, he’s pretty competent and makes smart decisions which is nice to see.I enjoyed the art style and designs of the characters a lot. The girls were intentionally made to appeal to different peoples’ “ideal” and they did a good job of making a diverse set of looks for sure. I’m very partial towards Mongfa, but the other girls are good as well.While Renai Flops may seem like a mediocre show that you can skip, I really do highly suggest checking it out if you’re into big plot twists and the intersection of technology/reality. There’s some legitimately good writing in this show that has unfortunately been under appreciated.Renai Flops gets 8 out of 10. episodes largely feature your usual harem shenanigans, the second half contains a pretty major plot twist that turns the world upside down and changes how you look at the reality these characters are living in.

While he is not Kiyopon or Yuichi levels of cool, he’s pretty competent and makes smart decisions which is nice to see.I enjoyed the art style and designs of the characters a lot. The girls were intentionally made to appeal to different peoples’ “ideal” and they did a good job of making a diverse set of looks for sure. I’m very partial towards Mongfa, but the other girls are good as well.While Renai Flops may seem like a mediocre show that you can skip, I really do highly suggest checking it out if you’re into big plot twists and the intersection of technology/reality. There’s some legitimately good writing in this show that has unfortunately been under appreciated.Renai Flops gets 8 out of 10.', ""Too bad for those who didn't continue to watch this.This is not your typical harem and ecchi anime there's even foreshadowing every episode but a lot of people ignored it.The characters is so good it truly fits on your typical harem and ecchi anime so I can't blame them to stopped watching on 1st episode.Also I don't want to read reviews anymore because even the show is not finished yet they give it negative ratings and focus their reviews on 1st episode.If there's anime you enjoy just enjoy it and don't listen to other people because they have different taste, if they hate it you...might hate it too that's society for you. might hate it too that's society for you."", 'It\'s honestly pretty surprising checking in on this series and seeing that, despite the signs being there from the very beginning until now, when I\'m writing this review, the reviews prior to episode 7 don\'t mention even a wink of it. And so here I am, to attempt to give a more proper assessment of this series.As you\'re probably aware of based on trailers or the MAL summary, this series comes across as just another harem/ecchi-esque series, with all of your typical anime tropes. We have the high school setting, a bundle of girls all after the MC , including a red-haired tsundere, can you...believe it?), the onee-san sensei, you name it, it\'s probably in here in some form. Our protagonist, Asahi, comes across each of our harem prospects, each of them involving some wacky hijink that gets them into absurdly risqué situations. Eventually each and every one of those characters confesses to MC, seemingly out of the blue considering they\'ve all just met him. Typical harem shenanigans ensue from this point on.Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""This sounds incredibly generic. Just another harem where all of the girls inexplicably love the MC because he looked at them funny."" And that wouldn\'t exactly be wrong. At least, on the surface.Yes, on the surface. Because there\'s more to it than that, and if you\'re paying close attention to each episode, you\'ll definitely notice. And sure enough, eventually, everything starts to come together and make sense in a way that I genuinely believe is solidly executed. What\'s been lurking underneath the traditional surface-level harem antics takes center stage and you\'re served the real meat and potatoes.Now, having said all of that, I\'m still giving this a mixed review. Primarily because, at the end of the day, whether you\'ll want to get through the earlier episodes to get to the reveal is up to you. At the end of the day, it does still have those harem romcom elements, which could be a turnoff depending on your tastes.  Maybe the humor of the early episodes doesn\'t hook you and it\'s a slog getting through the episodes so that you can experience what the story really has to offer. Or maybe it\'s right up your alley and you have fun keeping an eye out for every little detail like a detective.The main issue with these sort of series that like to keep the real nature of the series hidden when promoting them to hit you with the shock factor is that, you run the risk of people not being interested at all since what is being shown doesn\'t appeal to them, even if the real deal would. Or of the people that do, if it doesn\'t pass the ""3 episode (or sometimes less) rule"", it\'ll be written off as generic or uninteresting, much like what happened here.I\'m not going to say the series is great and a must-watch. Where the story goes from here is still important, and considering how subjective the humor of the series is, perhaps you\'d simply rather spend your time watching something that immediately hooks and entertains you throughout if this does not. The point of this review is merely to give a fair perspective of the series and make it clear that it\'s more than what you see on the cover. If it\'s intriguing enough for you to give it a shot, go right ahead. If not, maybe come back when the season is over and reviews will have the whole picture to work off of. believe it?), the onee-san sensei, you name it, it\'s probably in here in some form.

Cringe?Don\'t get me wrong, this is a good anime and I\'m pretty sure that if you\'re into harem and romcoms you will like this anime, the production is original, the characters are well made, the comedy is good sometimes. This is pretty much a entry-anime for those who never watched one before, or for those who don\'t care at all.If you get through the first episode, you will find yourself laughing and appreciating the characters. That\'s it, nothing more, nothing less.- ""But the anime is generic (nerd emoji)""who cares, there\'s even a real femboy inside...the cast. the cast.', ""If you're reading this, please get past the first 5 episodes. Episodes 1-4 can come across as being cringe, gay, mid, but the show really picks up in episode 5.You might be wondering how weird this anime is, setting an ecchi harem in a sci-fi world. Boy, just wait until you see the later episodes. This mid cringe-fest ecchi completely transforms itself in every meaning of the word, adding in humor, decent visuals, and some WTF moments that improve it quite a bit. No, it's not the next peak sleeper hit, but it's definitely worth your time.And yes, I also agree that episode 1 was...extremely cringe and lowkey trash. But give it the time, and Renai Flops will unravel itself and deliver some decent writing and twists. Definitely worth a watch. I genuinely feel sorry for all the bad reviews coming from folk who quit before episode 5. extremely cringe and lowkey trash. But give it the time, and Renai Flops will unravel itself and deliver some decent writing and twists. Definitely worth a watch. I genuinely feel sorry for all the bad reviews coming from folk who quit before episode 5."", 'I\'m not mad, just disappointed.I will give it this, this show certainly knows its marketing. First, it introduces itself as so generic and cliche a harem anime that people will actually end up checking it out if the studio is really going to invest an original anime on this. Then halfway through it brings in the plot twist so that a new set of viewers will be released into the wild, grabbing passing people, shaking them and screaming, ""Guys don\'t give up, this changes everything!""But what matters in the end is the entire product. Does this show feel complete in its story and characters, and...does it succeed in the themes it wants to tackle? I think my score and recommendation should speak for themselves.The first and probably biggest issue with Renai Flops is that unless you are truly a fan of harem rom coms, you will probably drop this anime from the first episode. The show initially promised some wacky harem stuff, filled with all the tropes and cliches imaginable, and that is indeed what you get for six and a half episodes.During that time, we get small individual arcs with the heroines in typical harem fashion. That itself isn\'t a bad thing; it is a way to appeal the heroines to the viewers, and also build up their love towards the main character. The issue is that the show only invests a single episode per heroine, and wraps up a good chunk of their emotional arc within that episode. This means that we mainly skim over their actual development, and also don\'t get a deeper picture on what sort of people they are, other than their basic trope. Admittedly, the arcs get more and more bizarre and some of the antics introduced are pretty funny, almost feeling like a parody than anything else. But that only means we don\'t get enough genuine character study on them or the main character. They are just roles for a harem scenario for those episodes.Now, you might say, ""Well this is a harem story after all, it\'s usually par for the course, so you should set your expectations accordingly."" Normally, you\'d be correct. But then the show suddenly brings in a twist (come on, let\'s not pretend that the fact that there\'s a twist to this show hasn\'t already been leaked to high heaven) which then turns this show into more of a techno-drama that\'s much heavier and serious.So now we have a deeper, emotional second half that\'s built on a tropey, style over substance first half. The emotional bits don\'t hit as hard as they should because they are based on characters we only got caricature versions of before, and also because the pacing is rushed due to only having about five and a half episodes, most of which is filled with some techno-thriller plot rather than genuine character exploration. It\'s like trying to build the Eiffel Tower on a bed of key lime pies. You ruin the pies and also fail to set up the tower properly.It\'s really a shame. I feel if the tone and characters were better handled, or if it had more episodes for better pacing and fleshing out its arcs, we could have had a clever subversion of harem stories, and also a thoughtful exploration of technology and loss. As it is, both its harem bits and its dramatic bits feel artificial. How ironic. does it succeed in the themes it wants to tackle?

Renai Flops sure made my heart flop. Not in a good way… for at least the first 6 episodes. We’ll get to that way later…Before we begin, let me backtrack to the beginning… the very very eye stretching beginning… Renai Flops (at least the first half) is what you get when you put together all the possible rom-com tropes into one show and press copy and paste 1000 times. True Insanity… For example the guy (let’s call him Steve) “falls” down a set of stairs only to “accidentally”...pounce on an unexpecting girl walking by. Sound familiar? If you do know what I mean, you know what happens next in the story… Oh and of course there is “accidental” groping in this rom-com and I don’t know where to begin with the other crazy shit that I saw here… So original… And yes this is basically copy and paste for the first couple of episodes. Holy shittt… It really was hot shit with no set storyline. I felt like I was drunk watching the show even though I was sober the entire time. Not good… 🙁It was almost uncanny sort of bad. Too trash to be true... Like the whole show is supposed to be geared towards Steve, a teenage dude going through that rough patch in his adolescence with his hormones. *wink* *wink*. The first half of the show feels engineered like it's supposed to be a fantasy world to help a certain someone escape reality, a certain someone like Steve… Maybe…. Who knows? Do you know because I dunno. Are we humans living in a simulation? Are anime and manga just a figment of our imagination? Yes… Who knows which question I could be answering above? It could be one of them… all of them… none of them…Thiz werlde iz notslddl;fksd’;f’asdadksdd;’ddsfdlfllk,rsdlvksedlvkadkvldsk………………………………………………..*Error…* *Error…* Error…**Brain Overheating…**System Rebooting*Sorry about that, I had a mental system error there. Had to restart my brain… Basically that’s how abrupt the plot twist hit me when it occured during the show. I won’t tell ya what happened or when it did but oh boy did it change the tone and really gave the show points for creativity and dedication to the storyline. Still very trippy though.All I can say is that Renai Flops flopped but in a somewhat good way. The show’s slow start and confusing story in the beginning is what turned off the show for many viewers, and I can understand why viewers felt that way. However, real show showed its true colors during the second half, and you MUST watch it all the way through if you decide to pick this one up. The concept of Yin and Yang are everywhere in our world, so you must watch through the painful and bad beginning to enjoy the latter half of this misunderstood title. Balanced.I’m not saying it's great, it’s not even that good either but it ain’t bad for a rom-com show. 5 out of 10 for me.*Disclaimer* I have nothing against any Steve or Steve’s in the real world. Steve was the first name I could think of. Using the MC’s real name is boring… Steve is more relatable imo… Sorry in advance if your name is Steve. Anyways, what are you still doing here… Go watch the show… or not… ok bye…Overall: 5/10 pounce on an unexpecting girl walking by. Sound familiar?

I usually don't write many reviews, I watch and don't write. But with this show, I had to come and write. My first rule of Rom-coms is you always watch till the end before making a decision. The reason that rule exists is because unlike other shows where the 3/4 episode rule usually works, they usually are slow start shows that build the world and relationships first before actually starting the interesting part. This show is exactly that, yes it is goofy...and seems over the top and cliche but it's absolutely key that you PAY ATTENTION AND DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY ALL THAT!The show was already a solid 7 for me from the start and with the current latest episode after steadily rising with each episode it's now at an 8. Avoid any spoilers, avoid reading up on the plot, just go in with the mentality of no matter what I will power through the episodes and you will be more than pleasantly surprised. What makes it unique is that it covers multiple genres and each episode you learn more about the world and the characters in very unique ways and if you are paying attention it definitely catches your interest as to how it will all turn out.It's hard to speak on it properly as the final episodes aren't yet out at the time of this review, but I assure you don't fast forward the episodes, don't get deterred by the first few either and you will thank me for it.

This was truly a wild ride of an anime if I ever had one. I fairly enjoyed the first half of the anime to some degree, thinking it was just another of those trash over the top harem comedy anime, but boy was I wrong. The second half, or especially the last 4 episodes made such a ridiculous turn that it entirely threw me off. I would have never predicted those twists in a million years, this was probably my biggest surprise this year.After watching...the whole anime it makes the first half so much better, since it explains why the ridiculous things that happened in the beginning even took place. I would almost go as far as to call it a stroke of genius, since it took up the common tropes for this type of anime and executed them the perfect way one would expect them to happen, only to make a 180° turn and throw off the audience completely. To then end it with some heart wrenching drama and finally lifting up your spirit once again in the epilogue.The characters in this show are your typical harem comedy tropes that you would expect but only for a part of the anime. The girls and the mc as well have genuine emotions that they go through and are portrayed greatly in the later part of the anime. The music in this one was pretty good, I especially liked the way they played with the ending song in a way that fit the plot, something very ingenious that I have also seen in Akiba Maid War this year. The animation was decent, but what made this anime so great was the unpredictable twists of the story that enhanced everything that came before to a major degree. The finale knows what it does, it pulls at your heartstrings in all the right places and after shattering your soul offers some relieve to leave you with a bitter sweet smile on your face.In the end I am glad I watched it and hope many people that may have dropped it after a couple episodes will come back to fully experience this. I never would have imagined this anime to be such a wild ride of emotions ranging from laughter and ridiculousness over disbelief to sadness and finally relief. This places ridiculous high on my list, but as I feel deservedly so, I give it a 9/10. the whole anime it makes the first half so much better, since it explains why the ridiculous things that happened in the beginning even took place.

There are specific reasons for this, but for the sake of avoiding spoilers, I will just tell you: trust me on this.Some people have given poor reviews of this show. One such review complained that ""the femboy"" didn\'t get them up. And to that I say, correct. This show is not intended to be jerk-off material.

""As time goes on it becomes more sophisticated, in short, an AI created by humans that is programmed to make human life easier in reality, there is AI in the virtual world, and I wonder if there now do they live side by side with humans and become a kind of robot?"" unfortunate, and I think this anime is highly recommended.

In the beginning, generic plot, general love interest development, character per episode, up until things change, for the better, or for the worse. Overall, interesting 12am speed watch. If you're looking for MORE THAN JUST romance-ecchi bait to hook you in the beginning of an anime, this anime is not it. However if you just want to zone out and watch something to occupy your time, and maybe don't mind romance-ecchi elements, then give this a try. "", ""Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (10)The story is about a man who's living with 5 girls in 1 house. The girls are very unique and they love him so much.

The first 7 or 8 episodes were genuinely hard to watch as it was just a generic harem with no substance, and of course, you do learn eventually why all the girls were attracted to him in the first place, but even after their stories conclude they all seemed so one dimensional. While it's not all bad, as I do think the ending was pretty decent, and the stuff with...Ai does actually hit, but overall, this anime was not that good.Art: 5The art in this anime isn’t the best, but it’s not terrible. I do like the character designs a lot, as every character introduced had their own certain charm to them, but other than that there aren’t any positives.

Honestly, there just isn’t anything here to write home about.Characters: 6For starters, the main love interests are all pretty one-dimensional, and the Main Character isn’t anything special either, but I do think the last 3 or so episodes really did them a little bit of justice, I also think Ai’s background was done pretty well too.Story: 4So, while I don’t hate the ending, and in the grand scheme of things, I thought they ended it pretty okay.

There was genuinely no substance to it at all. I think that there was potential for this to be better, but the execution was not the best, Overall, I’ll give this 5 bananas out of 10.

Cliché, is the story of the premise and its setting. Plot armour, is the plot of the simulation. And when you add all up together, it becomes a Flop. No, not what it actually stands for (though it is a much prevalent theme in the story itself), but rather, the entire original-made anime felt like a whiplash of emotions, both good and bad enough that it honestly, really isn\'t even worth the meaning of its given name (though slightly I\'ll presume). And this guilt trip in Renai Flops a.k.a Love Flops, it will take you through...layers of dimensions that the human mind can barely understand, yet comprehend, all in the space of 12 underlying generic-but-not episodes that\'ll boggle the freak out of those who dare watch this show. Spoilers be warned.Arguably the most generic show of the season at face value, Renai Flops does look and sound what it feels like: a stereotypical romance that compares to the likes of the most akin of rom-coms: Gotoubun no Hanayome a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets, only except that this show races to the finish line right in Episode 1, like blazing Speed Racer record time. The main character in question, the unassuming Asahi Kashiwagi, is your typical low-ball male that\'s honestly nothing to write home about, and within the flashing space of time present, encounters 5 girls that all suddenly lunges towards him, only to confess their love in the most generic of ways of how rom-coms have always done this over the years that it already feels tropey to begin with. Of course, how would you expect the virgin to understand what\'s going on with all of the womanly madness that is strung like the Red Thread of Fate strewn towards him, and even then, he\'s not given even a minuscule\'s worth of time to even digest this illusion that doesn\'t feel like one at all. As the show settles into a plot that is just like the recently relased Netflix show Romantic Killer, character aspirations are learnt, motivations are heard and their reason for living, while stereotypical, feels like there\'s heart put into it that I just could not understand how it was able to pull it off so elegantly. And then there\'s the plot twist that changes EVERYTHING, taking an extra dark turn into psychological horror being the gyaru game harem version of said show. And Oh, My Freaking God, never have I seen such a ballsy move that it got everyone, including me, thinking that it\'s all gonna warp into a time-space continuum involving actual memories in the coined term of ""Flops"" a.k.a ""FLoating-point Operations Per Second"" going into the subterranean to finally put all of ""illusion"" to rest.There, see what I did? This is the TL;DR for the show, because why would it use cliché to show us something generic that\'s only like a clause (or rather, a disclaimer) in the show\'s terms & conditions, where it is built upon a more sinister path of its origin story, giving birth to such contrived story plots like these, but in a Doki Doki Literature Club a.k.a DDLC-like fashion. It\'s so overly cliché it\'s bad, but I\'ve gotta give credit to 1st-time lead series composer Ryo Yasumoto penning this absurd script for this original show, given that it came from the production committee as a collaborated project.The characters though, they also subvert expectations by initially being the stereotypical cliché character trait, only to be revealed that they\'re just like the Flops in memories, or more specifically, memory caches that are all birthed and stored in a processor, only to be picked up again when it is refreshed. That being said, Asahi\'s introduction to the 4 girls plus a woman: the classmate Aoi Izumisawa, the exchange student Amelia Irving, the tomboy Irina Ilyukhina, the foreign teacher Bai Mongfa and the model Karin Istel, certainly gets a bad rap initially when it felt like an overwhelming clusterfish proportions of Asahi\'s luck coming true with a fortune-telling program on TV determining his compatibility. But as it turns out, it\'s actually quite nuanced that their personalities begin to shine and take hold of their place towards Asahi\'s life, save from whatever backstories that all 5 women came from that felt over-the-top with defying levels of logic and belief. And when it all comes together when the central system goes haywire, it all clashes like fireworks: the damning indictment of a world that takes advantage of its growing technology and whatever program that this ""simulation"" of sorts is meant to bring to the masses, with Asahi being the guinea pig test model aided by his good buddy pal Yoshio Ijuin overseeing his progress to define its version of Japan in a futuristic nature.Believe me, it sounds like ass, but mark it when I say that as inclusive as it is, it just really works with feelings and emotions running wild, like penguins scuffing up an iceberg to avoid being eaten in water. Like I mentioned, I don\'t know how this was pulled off so shockingly well that it elevates the anime out of its bad rap as the series progresses, and it certainly earns the mark of a death-defying stunt that\'s just speechless, that you\'ll only know how all of this wraps up right at the end of the TRUE route\'s finish line.Of all of the directors chosen to lead this original anime, I for sure did not expect Nobuyoshi Nagayama to be in for the taking, given that the last few shows he directed (Uramichi Oniisan, Runway de Waratte a.k.a Smile Down the Runway etc.) was so far away from the diverse expertise, when compared to this show. That being said, as the men of culture studio chosen, Passione hasn\'t let us down in the recent years, regarding to the shows they adapt that has the ecchi theme, from the likes of Ishuzoku Reviewers a.k.a Interspecies Reviewers, Mieruko-chan and  Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo a.k.a Harem Labyrinth, so it\'s definitely surprising to see that Renai Flops has some kind of censoring filter that\'s quite unlike the studio\'s ethos. It\'s certainly something that has to be taken into regard of why this the case was initially, only to realize that the story beats is the highlight of the show that it takes precedence over everything. And for that I can understand why it\'s done quite like so that it soon doesn\'t become a hindrance to the overall production quality which is astoundingly consistent all the way through.I\'ll be frank here: Konomi Suzuki\'s comeback after what seems to be a rather lengthy year-long hiatus (if talking about any kind of noteworthy show from the likes of last year\'s Higurashi\'s remake/reboot and Deep Insanity: The Lost Child), I felt that the once-prolific Re:Zero OST Anisong singer has gradually lost her touch once all the heavy titles were taken away and the concurrent nature of generic ones come in. It\'s clear that with the stagnating quality of anime that we get now, people like Konomi Suzuki get the short end of the stick if their songs do not fit the mood of the source materials adapted, and even then, songs like her OP here are just mediocre to decent at best. On the ED side of things however, this is easily the most obvious of the show\'s changing arcs with the 2 ED songs, especially with Miku Itou\'s 2nd ED song being the most soothing, yet heart-wrenching song ever to grace the show thematically. This is one show where the ED truly matters more than the OP, which actually is a good way to foreshadow future events in the episodes to come without giving too much away. It definitely was a calculated risk, but a good risk paid off in full.If I can mention ANY kind of pre-warning before dabbing your toes in this show, it\'s that the 3-episode rule DOES NOT apply here. Forgo reading the show\'s synopsis wherever you see this (because it spoils the main story plot) and go in blind, and I can promise you that whatever the hell that this show is trying to do, it certainly does to the endeavour of a one-trick pony. It definitely will not win any awards (except for the topmost contrived cliché shows of the year), but it\'s technological whimsicality will have you feel so much that as much as it starts to get ever so confusing, it pulls you back to where it wants to be: Back to the starting origin point.Being easily controversial for its take on the rom-com and harem genre, and though it\'s nothing special, there truly is some entertainment to be had. And so be it, that this love/hate relationship that the show gets from now on, there is one thing for certain: Renai Flops, no matter how good or bad the series was intended to be from the get-go, it certainly isn\'t a Flop at all. layers of dimensions that the human mind can barely understand, yet comprehend, all in the space of 12 underlying generic-but-not episodes that\'ll boggle the freak out of those who dare watch this show.

Good pacing and screentime too, cast is not too big or too small and great interactions."", '(Texto em PT/BR no final)Renai Flops was probably the most flop viable anime of the season, and that expectation wasn\'t wrong. The harem, despite being the key point of the work, does not make it dependent on it, on the contrary, there is an attempt to work with something more in line with the universe, than with the novel itself. The idea, although good, does not work as expected, there is a clear division between the first and the second half, more than that, this division is significant, after all, as the old saying goes ""the first impression is the one that lasts"".The initial idea...of Renai Flops is simple and its execution even more so, Asahi a boy who following the words spoken in the horoscope of the day has encounters with 5 girls who in the future would be revealed as his possible wives, the boy starts to live with them about the same ceiling and must decide to marry one of them, or none if he does not fall in love. The rhythm of the first two episodes is chaotic, many things happen in sequence without having much free space between them, getting rushed at a certain point. It is worth mentioning that there is no attempt to explore the characters and add depth, since even though it is a kind of competition for Asahi\'s hand, there is a friendly atmosphere between the competitors and all the desperate advance of the beginning starts to bring a sense that it will take time for something relevant to actually happen.Later, after all the characters have gained their prominence and are introduced to the public, there is the plot twist of the whole universe being a simulation and the girls being IAs in a test to develop romantic feelings. Information about the universe being actually a simulation existed from the beginning, so much so that after learning about the fact, this information becomes even more evident, the work already begins with a flashforward showing the disintegration of the virtual world, the flashbacks of the girls with Asahi, since they had never seen each other before, raised questions, the supposed bug occurred in the draw for the thermal house... Even the girls who at first seemed shallow, gained a certain quality when seeing the change in behavior after falling in love with the Asahi and the first episode where they were just running a schedule, so the initial rhythm itself starts to make sense. So the script is excellent correct? Hmmmm, not exactly, on paper the idea is indeed amazing, but not quite like that in execution.A first existing problem is the script itself, despite its successes there is something stronger, which is its obviousness, its structure contains a sequence of episodes focusing exclusively on a girl with the sole intention of introducing the characters and generating flashbacks with the Asahi, a common thing to happen in several works, and is usually negative in all of them. In the final stretch, even before Mongfa is eliminated, it is already suggestive that there will be the famous ""run, I\'ll sacrifice myself for you"" and that there was only a greater focus on Mongfa because there was no time for the others. And of course, you can\'t forget about Aoi, who was clear from the first second that she was the favorite among the candidates, what is expected of a harem is that at least there is a suspense in which one will be chosen.The second problem becomes more evident when the work is divided into its parts and only looks at the first half. The universe has its chaotic beginning, followed by a part that becomes lukewarm, presenting some rare moments of exaggeration and finally losing its sanity, from the moment that Mongfa faces a human with a good part of the body of metal and Karin turns into a Mahou Shoujo. Yes, the work will gain positive points with this, maybe funny scenes will happen, like the dogs that attack Asahi and the scrotum-stealing robots, but at that moment the work has already been sold as something bad, any and all success in that part is due to later being proved as a simulation. The universe fails to take root to prove itself convincing, the events are not enough to create an expectation about the future of the work, the novel is mediocre and the rest is rest.That is, as previously said, ""the first impression lasts"", so it doesn\'t matter what the great idea was to be executed, and even the fact that it has successes turns out to be ignored, since the moment when it was supposed to be structured the universe and the narrative for this idea to work, it proved to be of no value, probably most people even reached the plot twist because they didn\'t feel the slightest interest in seeing where the work wanted to go, even because it didn\'t show going anywhere any. Renai Flops at the end had a very interesting idea, but ironically it flopped.(Sorry for any mistakes, the text was translated by Google Translate)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Renai Flops era provavelmente o anime mais viável ao flop da temporada, e essa expectativa não estava errada. O harem apesar de ser o ponto chave da obra, não a deixa dependente dele, pelo contrário, é tentado trabalhar algo mais condizente com o universo, do que com o romance em si. A ideia apesar de boa não funciona como o esperado, existe uma divisão clara entre a primeira e a segunda metade, mais do que isso, essa divisão é significativa, afinal como diz o velho ditado ""a primeira impressão é a que fica"".A ideia inicial de Renai Flops é simples e sua execução mais ainda, Asahi um garoto que seguindo as palavras ditas no horóscopo do dia tem encontros com 5 garotas que futuramente seriam reveladas como suas possíveis esposas, o garoto passa a viver com elas sobre o mesmo teto e deve se decidir em casar com alguma delas, ou nenhuma caso não se apaixone. O ritmo dos dois primeiros episódios é caótico, muitas coisas acontecem em sequência sem ter muito espaço livre entre elas, chegando a ser rushado em determinado ponto. Válido ressaltar que não existe nenhuma tentativa de explorar os personagens e acrescentar profundidade, já que mesmo sendo uma espécie de competição pela mão do Asahi, existe um clima de amistosidade entre as concorrentes e todo o avanço desesperado do começo passa a trazer um sentido de que vai demorar para algo relevante de fato acontecer.Posteriormente, após todas as personagens terem ganho seu destaque e serem apresentadas para o público, existe o plot twist de todo o universo ser uma simulação e as garotas serem IAs em um teste para desenvolverem sentimentos amorosos. As informações sobre o universo ser na verdade uma simulação existiam desde o começo, tanto que após saber do fato, essas informações passam a ficar ainda mais evidentes, a obra já começa com um flashforward mostrando a desintegração do mundo virtual, os flashbacks das garotas com o Asahi, sendo que nunca tinham se visto antes geravam questionamento, ocorreu o suposto bug no sorteio para a casa termal... Até mesmo as garotas que em primeiro momento pareciam rasas, ganharam certa qualidade ao ver a mudança de comportamento após se apaixonarem pelo Asahi e do primeiro episódio onde só estavam executando uma programação, assim o próprio ritmo inicial passa a fazer sentido. Logo, o roteiro é excelente correto? Hmmmm, não exatamente, no papel a ideia de fato é incrível, mas não é bem assim na execução.Um primeiro problema existente é o próprio roteiro, apesar de seus êxitos existe algo mais forte, que é a sua obviedade, sua estrutura contem uma sequência de episódios dando foco exclusivo em alguma garota com o único intuito de apresentar as personagens e gerar os flashbacks com o Asahi, coisa comum de se acontecer em várias obras, e normalmente é negativo em todas. Na reta final até mesmo antes da Mongfa ser eliminada, já é sugestivo que existirá o famoso ""corra, eu me sacrifico por você"" e que só teve um foco maior na Mongfa porquê faltou tempo para as outras. E claro não se pode esquecer da Aoi que estava escancarado desde o primeiro segundo que ela era a favorita entre as candidatas, o que se espera de um harem é que ao menos exista um suspense em qual delas será a escolhida.O segundo problema fica mais evidente quando se divide a obra em suas partes e olha apenas para a primeira metade. O universo tem seu início caótico, seguido de uma parte que fica morna, apresentando alguns raros momentos de exagero e enfim perdendo sua sanidade, a partir do momento que a Mongfa enfrenta um humano com boa parte do corpo de metal e a Karin se transforma em uma Mahou Shoujo. Sim, a obra vai ganhar pontos positivos com isso, cenas talvez engraçadas vão acontecer, como os cachorros que atacam o Asahi e os robôs ladrões de escroto, mas nesse momento a obra já se vendeu como algo ruim, todo e qualquer êxito nessa parte é devido a depois ser provado como uma simulação. O universo não consegue criar raízes para se provar convincente, os acontecimentos não são suficientes para criar uma expectativa sobre o futuro da obra, o romance é pífio e o resto é resto.Ou seja, como dito anteriormente, ""a primeira impressão é a que fica"", dessa forma pouco importa qual era a grande ideia a ser executada, e até o fato dela possuir acertos acaba por ser ignorado, já que o momento onde era para ser estruturado o universo e a narrativa para essa ideia funcionar, demonstrou não ter valor algum, provavelmente a maior parte das pessoas se quer chegou ao plot twist por não sentir o mínimo interesse em ver onde a obra queria chegar, até porquê não mostrava ir para lugar algum. Renai Flops no fim tinha uma ideia muito interessante, mas que ironicamente flopou. of Renai Flops is simple and its execution even more so, Asahi a boy who following the words spoken in the horoscope of the day has encounters with 5 girls who in the future would be revealed as his possible wives, the boy starts to live with them about the same ceiling and must decide to marry one of them, or none if he does not fall in love. The rhythm of the first two episodes is chaotic, many things happen in sequence without having much free space between them, getting rushed at a certain point. It is worth mentioning that there is no attempt to explore the characters and add depth, since even though it is a kind of competition for Asahi\'s hand, there is a friendly atmosphere between the competitors and all the desperate advance of the beginning starts to bring a sense that it will take time for something relevant to actually happen.Later, after all the characters have gained their prominence and are introduced to the public, there is the plot twist of the whole universe being a simulation and the girls being IAs in a test to develop romantic feelings. Information about the universe being actually a simulation existed from the beginning, so much so that after learning about the fact, this information becomes even more evident, the work already begins with a flashforward showing the disintegration of the virtual world, the flashbacks of the girls with Asahi, since they had never seen each other before, raised questions, the supposed bug occurred in the draw for the thermal house... Even the girls who at first seemed shallow, gained a certain quality when seeing the change in behavior after falling in love with the Asahi and the first episode where they were just running a schedule, so the initial rhythm itself starts to make sense. So the script is excellent correct? Hmmmm, not exactly, on paper the idea is indeed amazing, but not quite like that in execution.A first existing problem is the script itself, despite its successes there is something stronger, which is its obviousness, its structure contains a sequence of episodes focusing exclusively on a girl with the sole intention of introducing the characters and generating flashbacks with the Asahi, a common thing to happen in several works, and is usually negative in all of them. In the final stretch, even before Mongfa is eliminated, it is already suggestive that there will be the famous ""run, I\'ll sacrifice myself for you"" and that there was only a greater focus on Mongfa because there was no time for the others. And of course, you can\'t forget about Aoi, who was clear from the first second that she was the favorite among the candidates, what is expected of a harem is that at least there is a suspense in which one will be chosen.The second problem becomes more evident when the work is divided into its parts and only looks at the first half. The universe has its chaotic beginning, followed by a part that becomes lukewarm, presenting some rare moments of exaggeration and finally losing its sanity, from the moment that Mongfa faces a human with a good part of the body of metal and Karin turns into a Mahou Shoujo. Yes, the work will gain positive points with this, maybe funny scenes will happen, like the dogs that attack Asahi and the scrotum-stealing robots, but at that moment the work has already been sold as something bad, any and all success in that part is due to later being proved as a simulation. The universe fails to take root to prove itself convincing, the events are not enough to create an expectation about the future of the work, the novel is mediocre and the rest is rest.That is, as previously said, ""the first impression lasts"", so it doesn\'t matter what the great idea was to be executed, and even the fact that it has successes turns out to be ignored, since the moment when it was supposed to be structured the universe and the narrative for this idea to work, it proved to be of no value, probably most people even reached the plot twist because they didn\'t feel the slightest interest in seeing where the work wanted to go, even because it didn\'t show going anywhere any. Renai Flops at the end had a very interesting idea, but ironically it flopped.(Sorry for any mistakes, the text was translated by Google Translate)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Renai Flops era provavelmente o anime mais viável ao flop da temporada, e essa expectativa não estava errada. O harem apesar de ser o ponto chave da obra, não a deixa dependente dele, pelo contrário, é tentado trabalhar algo mais condizente com o universo, do que com o romance em si. A ideia apesar de boa não funciona como o esperado, existe uma divisão clara entre a primeira e a segunda metade, mais do que isso, essa divisão é significativa, afinal como diz o velho ditado ""a primeira impressão é a que fica"".A ideia inicial de Renai Flops é simples e sua execução mais ainda, Asahi um garoto que seguindo as palavras ditas no horóscopo do dia tem encontros com 5 garotas que futuramente seriam reveladas como suas possíveis esposas, o garoto passa a viver com elas sobre o mesmo teto e deve se decidir em casar com alguma delas, ou nenhuma caso não se apaixone. O ritmo dos dois primeiros episódios é caótico, muitas coisas acontecem em sequência sem ter muito espaço livre entre elas, chegando a ser rushado em determinado ponto. Válido ressaltar que não existe nenhuma tentativa de explorar os personagens e acrescentar profundidade, já que mesmo sendo uma espécie de competição pela mão do Asahi, existe um clima de amistosidade entre as concorrentes e todo o avanço desesperado do começo passa a trazer um sentido de que vai demorar para algo relevante de fato acontecer.Posteriormente, após todas as personagens terem ganho seu destaque e serem apresentadas para o público, existe o plot twist de todo o universo ser uma simulação e as garotas serem IAs em um teste para desenvolverem sentimentos amorosos. As informações sobre o universo ser na verdade uma simulação existiam desde o começo, tanto que após saber do fato, essas informações passam a ficar ainda mais evidentes, a obra já começa com um flashforward mostrando a desintegração do mundo virtual, os flashbacks das garotas com o Asahi, sendo que nunca tinham se visto antes geravam questionamento, ocorreu o suposto bug no sorteio para a casa termal... Até mesmo as garotas que em primeiro momento pareciam rasas, ganharam certa qualidade ao ver a mudança de comportamento após se apaixonarem pelo Asahi e do primeiro episódio onde só estavam executando uma programação, assim o próprio ritmo inicial passa a fazer sentido. Logo, o roteiro é excelente correto? Hmmmm, não exatamente, no papel a ideia de fato é incrível, mas não é bem assim na execução.Um primeiro problema existente é o próprio roteiro, apesar de seus êxitos existe algo mais forte, que é a sua obviedade, sua estrutura contem uma sequência de episódios dando foco exclusivo em alguma garota com o único intuito de apresentar as personagens e gerar os flashbacks com o Asahi, coisa comum de se acontecer em várias obras, e normalmente é negativo em todas.

However, as fate would have it, I found myself caught up with other anime, circling back to give it a second chance.The opening episodes danced along the familiar lines of a cringy harem, but then, a peculiar metamorphosis unfurled—a transformative twist amid the archetypal beach episode. Instead of the predictable harem trajectory, it deftly veered into the realm of slice-of-life, tackling poignant themes and navigating through deeper waters.Surprisingly, redemption found its way in the latter segments, steering away from...the anticipated trappings.

Wodurch sich auch meine Meinung zu dem Anime stark wandelte.Im folgenden wird es Spoiler geben, da ich mich hauptsächlich auf den Letzten Akt beziehe.Was ist passiert? Die Mädchen sind verschwunden und Asahi wacht auf.Ihn im weiteren Verlauf zu begleiten und die Hintergründe der geschehnisse zu erfahren war für mich eine so unglaublich gute Entwicklung, dass ich meine Bewertung von 4-5 auf 7-8 Punkte ändern wollte.In diesen Szenen war sowohl die Erzählweise als auch die musikalische Untermahlung mehr als nur mitreisend, etwas das ich von diesem Anime beim besten willen nicht mehr erwartet habe.So starten wir voller Spannung und Hoffnung in den letzten Akt und... die Spannung und Logik verfliegen vollständig.Das Ziel das im letzten Akt verfolgt wird ist so wage und alles so schlecht vorbereitet, dass man schnell vergisst worum es eigentlich geht. Ich versuche nun so gut wie möglich zusammenzufassen was alles los ist und ihr entscheidet dann für euch ob alles Sinn ergibt.Deal? Deal!Die Mädchen sind Ki\'s die auf einem Sataliten gespeichert sind, der von den auf ihm laufenden Programmen in der Umlaufbahn gehalten wird. Doch da AI (oder Aoi?) die Kontrolle über alle Systeme Japans übernommen hat und alles den Bach runter geht, sollen alle Daten von dem Sataliten gelöscht werden.Der Grund für AI\'s übernahme wird nicht genau behandelt oder nur in einem Nebensatz genannt aber es scheint als wolle sie das Asahi zurück kommt und das obwohl sie ihn selbst aus der Welt geworfen hat. Soweit so unschlüssig.Um die Daten vom Sataliten zu löschen soll nun ein Programm eingeschleust werden was dem anschein nach auch kein Problem darstellt.Das Seltsame ist, dass sie das Programm zwar einschleusen können aber nicht die KI\'s deaktivieren können.Aber gut nun ist der Löschvorgang gestartet und das neue Ziel ist es die Mädchen zu retten. Doch wie genau das geschehen soll ist erneut nicht geklärt.Wenn die Daten einfach auf einen Speicher der Erde übertragen werden können dann muss nur die Datenverbindung sichergestellt werden und alle Daten übertragen werden bevor diese gelöscht wurden.Zu dem Stellt sich die Frage warum das Löschprogramm auch jene daten löscht die den Satelit in Position halten.Anscheinend ist aber das Ziel Asahi so schnell wie Möglich zu Aoi zu bringen, damit diese it der verwüstung der Welt aufhört und damit die Löschung gestoppt wird bevor die KI\'s gelöscht sind.So weit zu den Zielen. Ich hoffe ihr erkennt besser als ich warum Dinge geschehen.In der VR zeigt sich nun das Löschprogramm als Monster.Das ist zwar ""anschaulich"" aber erneut unlogisch, hätte man einfach Objecte verschwinden lassen wäre es realistischer und gleich gefährlich. Aber dann hätten die Mädchen ja nichts gegen das sie kämpfen müssen  mit Kräften von denen zwei noch nicht einmahl vorher erwähnt wurden.Spätestens an dieser Stelle wächselte ich zurück zu der Bewertung von 6 Punkten bei der ich nun geblieben bin.Natürlich kommt es im folgenden wie es kommen muss und Stück fr Stück opfern sich die Mädchen, wodurch das Ziel diese zu Retten komplett verfehlt wird aber am Ende wird es nochmal etwas besser wenn wir die geschichte von Ai erfahren, welche sher emotional dargestellt wird und den letzten Akt somit zumindest ein Bisschen rettet.Wenn der Anime an dieser Stelle sein Ende gefunden hätte, könnte ich sogar verstehen wenn man ihm auf Grund des letzten Aktes 7 Punkte gibt doch da er offentsichtlich als werbung für den Manga gedacht war muss natürlich ein Fortsetzungsköder ans Ende.In diesem sehen wir, dass ca. 3 Jahre vergangen sind, da Asahi vor dem Zeitsprung gerade an die Oberschule kam und nun gerade an die Uni kommt. Zudem sagt er seinen Freunden ab weil er noch was erledigen muss un geht nach hause. Zuhause begrüßen ihn Pakete von denen er nichts wusste und in diesen sind die KI-Mädchen.

I actually almost dropped it after it’s incredibly boring first three episodes, but the fourth had enough crude yet, good humour for me to keep going, and once...each episode started getting weirder and weirder, I was pretty much hooked.It takes a huge risk asking the audience to sit through six episodes of quite frankly mediocre yet, insane harem shenanigans with surprisingly tame and conservative ecchi scenes for a studio Passione production and incredibly hit or miss humour, in order to arrive at the pay off which I personally, am not sure it was worth it.I think the mystery angle and the ending ruins its very strong commentary about sad, lonely, loser nerds relying on waifu’s for escapism instead of trying to overcome their issues and make real relationships with real people to fill the void. In the hands of a better writer with a stronger vision for the narrative, the twist would’ve been way more impactful and effective.That being said, I did enjoy most of my time with it. It is certainly a show that will catch you off guard with some of the outlandish situations it presents, and the world building is pretty interesting.I can’t say I recommend Love Flops, but if you want to give it a try then y’know… do it.5/10 Mediocre. each episode started getting weirder and weirder, I was pretty much hooked.It takes a huge risk asking the audience to sit through six episodes of quite frankly mediocre yet, insane harem shenanigans with surprisingly tame and conservative ecchi scenes for a studio Passione production and incredibly hit or miss humour, in order to arrive at the pay off which I personally, am not sure it was worth it.I think the mystery angle and the ending ruins its very strong commentary about sad, lonely, loser nerds relying on waifu’s for escapism instead of trying to overcome their issues and make real relationships with real people to fill the void.

After the first few episodes, I also thought this was just another copy paste rom-com anime with your typical harem, but it gets better.The introduction to the characters, with each of them having their own episode, makes the later episodes very heart-warming and uplifting. Each of them play a good role in the story, and it just gets better the longer you watch. I am very excited to see the last episode as I\'d like to believe we\'d get a satisfying ending for the series.I haven\'t seen a rom-com anime take this route in...a hot while, it was definitely worth my time and I can assure you guys that it is worth the watch. I wouldn\'t consider it as ""one of the greatest animes of all time"", but I had so much fun watching it. It is definitely a good watch during the winter break. And trust me guys never judge a book by its cover. a hot while, it was definitely worth my time and I can assure you guys that it is worth the watch.

And trust me guys never judge a book by its cover.', '(WARNING: This review contains MAJOR spoilers. Proceed with a LOT of caution.)Spend enough time around the anime block, and you’re bound to at least hear about anime that have a particular combination of genres: ecchi and harem. The premise of one guy being involved with multiple girls has been done time and time again and will continue to be done, and most of those times, fanservice will be sprinkled into the mix. A couple of my favorite anime may be part of these two genres, but like many others, I have grown slightly weary of them. For that reason, when I came across a screenshot...from a certain ecchi/harem anime that had just started airing, I expected it to just be another generic ecchi/harem anime; looking into it, however, led me to discover that it was an original anime (as in, not based on a manga, light novel, visual novel, etc.), and for some reason, that convinced me to watch the first episode. Despite thinking I’d drop it after that first episode, something about it made me feel like there was more than what meets the eye, so I kept watching.One entire season later, here we are, with me trying not to do a victory dance over being proven that I was right that something was going on with “Renai Flops”.Although it takes place in a more futuristic setting than most, Renai Flops starts like any other rom-com anime, with our hapless hero, Asahi Kashiwagi, having five different risqué encounters with five different people - Aoi Izumisawa, Amelia Irving, Ilya Ilyukhin, Bai Mongfa, and Karin Istel. When he finally arrives at school, he discovers that Mongfa is his new teacher, and the rest of them are transfer students in his class. To top it all off, these five all confess their love for Asahi and even move in with him. So begins Asahi’s life with these five, with their feelings for him developing more with each episode. Pretty standard setup for a harem anime, right?Well…. you know what? We’ll get to that later.First and foremost, I should talk about the technical aspects of this anime, starting with the art. The character designs are pretty solid for the kind of anime this is, the backgrounds are quite pretty, and the animation was nice and fluid. At the very least, it’s easy to see that Passione put some passion into this project! (Cue someone throwing a banana peel at my face.) The voice cast is full of all-stars - such as Ryouta Oosaka and Ayana Taketatsu - who also do a solid job at their roles. The music is probably the best part of the anime, with the opening and ending themes being quite pleasant to listen to; heck, I went out of my way to purchase the opening theme, “Love? Reason why!!” by Konomi Suzuki, on iTunes! One song that stands out in my mind, however, is the insert song that plays during the final episode; as of now, I don’t know the name of the song, but I do know that it’s sung by Miku Itou and that it, accompanied by the scene that it played in, almost made me cry!Unfortunately, Renai Flops’s story and characters aren’t entirely at the same quality as the art and sound….although that statement might be debatable. At the very least, the first half of the series will take a lot of patience to get through. Not only are there almost all, if not all, of the clichés that can come with an ecchi/harem anime, there tend to be played out in such an over-the-top way that I found myself cringing. There are a few moments that make it stand out among the crowd, but those moments are few and far between. In the first half, the characters are also pretty standard for this type of anime, with not a whole lot to make them stand out among other characters like them. All of this is on purpose, as is made clear later, but even knowing that doesn’t make the first half of Renai Flops any less exhausting to watch.There is one thing I can honestly praise the first half of Renai Flops for, though, and that is its foreshadowing. From episode 1, there are hints that something isn’t quite right here. These hints range from pretty obvious, like when Asahi fails to remember his “best friend”, to blink-and-you’ll-miss-it-type moments, such as the date on Asahi’s alarm clock inexplicably changing. A conspiracy theorist could have a field day with those hints, and ultimately, by the time episode 7 ends, they would be doing a victory dance over how correct they were all along.Well, if their theory was that none of your waifus were real, anyway.To be more specific, Asahi was part of a simulation, and Aoi, Amelia, Irina (Ilya), Mongfa, and Karin were all artificial intelligences. This plot twist is probably a predictable outcome given the anime’s setting and all of the hints that were dropped previously; however, those who aren’t paying close enough attention will be caught off-guard, and even those who are may not be able to predict the full extent. The moment the plot twist is unveiled, the story steadily begins to improve. There is less fanservice, the characters develop in a way that make you care about them more than before, and as I briefly mentioned earlier, there are some nearly-tearjerking moments during the second half. The ending does raise a few questions, but I wouldn’t say it was a bad ending, by any means.Overall, I think Renai Flops was alright. Fans of the ecchi and harem genres and those who have a lot of patience may find themselves appreciating what it has to bring to the table. Those who don’t like those genres and don’t have the patience to sit through it, however? Sorry, but you’ll probably see this as a flop. from a certain ecchi/harem anime that had just started airing, I expected it to just be another generic ecchi/harem anime; looking into it, however, led me to discover that it was an original anime (as in, not based on a manga, light novel, visual novel, etc.), and for some reason, that convinced me to watch the first episode.

And a shitty dated, and super stereotypical dating simulator? Coupled with fanservice and harem, obviously... Well, i'd say nothing good, and i'd be right, but its not the entire truth.The premise had me interested, i won't lie... NOT the anime itself, its was frankly dreadful, but the premise. Dreadful isn't the right word here though. It was bad... INTENTIONALLY bad, which doesn't make it less bad, don't get me wrong, but how well it relayed the feeling of 'something is wrong' and made it all look super nonsensical and cliche, driving one to think...this is some kind of shitty full dive dating simulator is definitely impressive and deserves some points.It also dropped clues to this not being real very generously, and so despite not really enjoying this, i kept watching, and questioning the people dropping the show without waiting for the big reveal to come, because it was clear it was coming! ... And waiting... And waiting. That's the first big problem i find with the show aside the obvious ones - they delayed said reveal for far too long. I understand there was a need to create more bond to the characters... But the ridiculous and fanservicy setup just made the upper limit to that far too low, so there really was no point, nor was there a point to introduce THAT many girls, 3 or even 2 would more than cut it, which would increase attachment even with 2~ less episodes of buildup.The sad part is, when the reveal and development of the actual story and its resolution came, it ended up being far too badly executed and thought through to justify this show's existence, almost to the point the people dropping it in the beginning would be validated, but only almost, and for the wrong reasons... Because you see, the idea itself WAS somewhat interesting, its just the execution that failed horribly, the main reason behind that being the lack of central theme and uniting point to it all, it also made ZERO sense story wise.The point of logging into the satellite and risking his life was to steady the global AI network, was it not? The greater good was also the argument that got him to decide going in... And yet the satellites FELL..? What the... Okay, let's pretend that wasn't the point. Maybe point was to save the 5 AI girls that gained proper sentience? Nope, wasn't the point either, they also got them deleted... And saved too..? Not sure how that works but whatever. Then WHAT was the point of it all? Helping mc move on and get closure, meet his dead childhood sweetheart and talk to her for 4 minutes..? I'm not sure.It was nice and emotional, don't get me wrong, but it was pointless, and the story fell apart so bad i had no idea what the whole show was trying to achieve. If Ai was deleted and the satelites got saved for the system to stabilize, and/or if the  girl got him to move on and taught him some valuable life lesson instead of extending the pain and disappearing as if it somehow solves anything in his head, i'd get it... But literally all the possible reasoning behind him being there and RISKING HIS LIFE was utterly destroyed, including the 5 girls, and the fact they somehow got saved changes nothing. There's a whole list of other things that could have been handled far better and developed to a far greater degree the show would benefit from but aren't there, but frankly, its not worth my, or anyone's time. So despite thinking it had the potential to do well, i hope there's no need to say i'm rather disappointed with how underwhelming it turned out to be?Final verdict - 6/10, not recommended. Go watch plastic memories instead, while its not all that similar, it deals with the main issue of this show far better, and provides better insight and closure into the unpleasant, downright disgusting, and yet absolutely essential and necessary, scar rippling reality of having how to learn to let go and move on. this is some kind of shitty full dive dating simulator is definitely impressive and deserves some points.It also dropped clues to this not being real very generously, and so despite not really enjoying this, i kept watching, and questioning the people dropping the show without waiting for the big reveal to come, because it was clear it was coming! ...

To begin, plot development. Because holysh** you have to go through so much pain to go through the first half of the show, it's horrendous beyond words. It's stupid, unbelievable, and downright just defies all logic that I dropped the anime at one point in episode 4. But once I heard that there's a major twist to the plot in the second half I decided to persevere.That brought me...to this point, is it worth the 6 episodes or-so pain filled watchtime? Lets discuss, from this point onwards I will mostly talk about the second half of the show. First of all,  the anime does drastically improve its quality in almost all aspect. Character design is nothing I've never seen before so lets scratch that off our list. The story and theme of the anime changes almost 180° in the second half, and it was executed rather smoothly. The anime does a great job in transitioning from lighthearted and stupid to a more serious tones.Second, how well does the anime portray its main theme which is romance sci-fi? For the latter I can say that I've seen much worse. The anime does the bare minimum at explaining the overall theme without leaving the audience confused. For the former, don't have much to say other than I was satisfied, the romance felt natural all things considered.Back to the elephant in the room, is it worth the horrendous 2 hour+ watchtime? I think that as sh**ty the first half was, it was somewhat necessary to set the tone for the rest of the anime, they still handle it so poorly in my opinion that if you felt like dropping it you don't need to hesitate. And despite what I said about the second half above, the story is still your run of the mill generic tragedy romance. And the ending of the show negates most of its impact anyway.

It is just the opposite of first half with great pacing, a story that makes sense with a cover-up of mess...of first half, good direction & romance emotional stuff. This is the best part of show. Surely its not as invincible as I had mentioned about it but its still great.Now that I have covered the story & direction aspect of the show above, I'll cover remaining three points here : Art & Animation, Sound & Character.Art & animation is quite good. It clearly gives off a Echchhi Sci-Fi Anime vibe. There are no major issues observed by me in animation department.Sound department has done a fiarly good job too. Backgroud effects, music & dialogues are done well in English Dub.Character Designs are good & their development is quite good. We were quite aptly introduced with the characters over the whole series to create a connection with them. I have no qualms in this department.All that being said, I have no mixed feelings about this show in recommending it to fellow MAL users.

Renai Flops is a nonstop adrenaline rush of love, action, and humor, while still fulfilling it's intended goal of tugging at your heart strings.What begins as seemingly a simple ecchi harem gag anime ends up becoming a full-fledged work of art, with a beautiful story that plays on cliches and tropes, deep, relatable characters, and a climax that will blow your mind.Avoiding the topic of the plot for spoilers'...sake, the characters in Renai Flops are not to be glossed over. From Amelia's tsundere antics to Mongfa and Irina's inner struggles with keeping their secret side hidden, every character feels as though they have had life breathed into them.At times, the show can seem to be unrealistic and completely whacky, but even this fact is tied into a plot twist that will leave you wondering why you didn't notice sooner.You will be left wondering why you shed tears to what you thought was just a dumb ecchi anime.If you enjoy romantic comedies, consider this a must-watch for your list.By the way, I encourage this to be watched spoiler-free, as it is an entirely different experience. sake, the characters in Renai Flops are not to be glossed over.

That's probably the question when it comes to this anime writers.

It all seems to end up building something to a past of them being known before, but it all doenst matter, since its an actual bad stereotype, trying to, i dont know, be a parody or something like that. Everything that hapens seems...meaningless, like, it introduces you the idea of girl routes by every episode, until now, but you don't see nothing being builden up, for me everything seems inorganic and strictly made to the screenplay to work, nothing seems actually connected or relevant, more like forced up. My guess is that is gonna be a 'minblowing' plot-twist at the end, that is just gonna make it even worse. There's not much to talk, in the end its essence is bad and the execution... worse. In the end, its not drama, not comedy, not the main idea thats expressed in the first episode, its just bad, and will probably worsen by the time passes.

Transcendent! Magnificent! Sublime! Stupendous! Extraordinary! Unparalleled! Ineffable! Resplendent! Superlative! Prodigious! Enchanting! Majestic! Breathtaking! Captivating! Spellbinding! Sensational! Astounding! Unrivaled! Grandiose!Are just some of the words that fail to fully describe the masterpiece that is Renai Flops: an anime that smacked me right in the face with its wild rollercoaster ride. It was as if I had incarnated into Chris Rock\'s body as Will Smith slapped him at the Oscars (sorry for using this dead joke, but you should get the idea). Oshi no Ko? Attack on Titan? Farmland Saga? Chainsaw Man? Bleach? All inferior; RENAI FLOPS is the true GOAT of modern anime.Should you...watch Renai Flops? Short answer, yes.My first exposure to this anime was from Gigguk\'s Fall 2022 Nutshell video. Can\'t lie, I was deeply intrigued by what da dog was doin, but still restrained myself after seeing the considerably low MAL score it had received. From my biased point of few at the time, all anime under an average rating of 7 are simply mid. Sorely mistaken I was. I had only given this anime a try after watching Kamikatsu, that one anime you probably know for the ""terrible"" tractor CGI. Let me tell you this, Kamikatsu was miles superior to 99% of the stuff I have watched and read. Honestly, I believe these often overlooked and perhaps misunderstood anime with fresh concepts and bold humor to be wayyyyy better than widely accepted favorites like Spy x Family and Bocchi the Rock (no disrespect to those anime and fans of course, I\'m just raising an example). Because I was exposed to certain amounts of spoilers, I walked into Renai Flops with caution, but it turned out to be completely useless as nothing could prepare me for this. Comedy? A lot, maybe even too much. I found myself laughing out loud and hardly controlling myself, something I haven\'t done for an anime perhaps except Grand Blue and Gintama, 10/10. Plot? A lot of plot, in more ways than one, 10/10. Characters? Very relatable. Everyone definitely has 5 beautiful ""brides"" pestering them, 10/10. I say this with sarcasm but the characters really are amazing. Saying too much will be spoiling, so I\'ll hold off on it. But, I have to yet again salute to Renai Flops, for it has moved me to tears, something that never happens to me with seasonal anime, and I can really only recall being this emotional for One Piece and Gintama.Does Renai Flops have a sophisticated plotline with deeper meanings like AOT? No.Does Renai Flops have peak animation like Demon Slayer? No.Does Renai Flops have fleshed out characters like One Piece? No.What Renai Flops has is change. If AOT, Demon Slayer, and One Piece are the sky, sea, and earth, then Renai Flops is the drill that will pierce the heavens (I couldn\'t resist the Gurren Lagann reference there, MB).Just go watch it!

Love Flops goes through transformative progression that is awful, incredible and it somehow sticks the landing.The first 3-4 eps start off as your classic recycled and generic harem show. Nothing special besides some funny interactions. Ecchi but in the most obvious and mundane way we have seen. Each candidate bonds with our main character Asahi with some genuine and cute moments and break throughs. A nice twist is added when we discover that Asahi’s father was...the one who arranged this situation as to find him a bridesmaid in typical harem fashion. It sticks to this formula for the early part in the show.Then for episodes 5-6 we are suddenly propelled into some of the most deplorable, out the ass, and immature twists. A couple of the girls have their bonding time with Asahi but it quickly turns into this ridiculous turn of superpowers and abilities for all the girls. The middle school humor is also horrendous. They had this plot line of male chastity or something and they needed to put this device on 69 people. Yeah…. Going into this anime, all I heard about this show was that it was ecchi and it contained this twist but it was not revealed. Surely, this out-of-nowhere element of shounen and magic girl inclusion would be the twist that I had been hearing about, right?Episodes 7-9 is a tale of two cities as it has this incredulous reveal of the presence of AI and simulation. This harem that Asahi is experiencing is all simulated and AI generated. They also are gathering and using other people’s idea of life to give the Ai those capabilities. This system has AI’s trying to learn how to love through the time spent with Asahi which connects the earlier part of the season. Asahi goes through some intense emotions and is disturbed by the separation. The shifts in tone are jarring and realistic since he’s so hopeless and confused. I love the perspective that this harem is actually taken away from him and erased in a blink of an eye. It’s an angle I have not seen in my experience with harem anime. it was unnerving and unbelievable how this was the same show that I started.Finally, episodes 10-12 is the acceptance of the madness from this story as it intertwines all the underlying stories and uses all the time these characters spent together along with the AI twist. Since the AI gains sentience, it has the objective to delete all the other girls and take over the network. One of the more fascinating parts of this show is the character of Ai/Aoi. The origin of Aoi came from this scientist whose daughter died young, her name was Ai. He used Ai’s remaining brain data to preserve her life in his Ai project and girls. This same dying girl, is also directly related to Asashi as this was his childhood friend he grew up with. When she died, he struggled immensely and resorted to this AI program that needed volunteers to humanize and evolve their AI. It becomes this beautiful but morbid coping mechanism as Asahi used this AI program to escape the reality and pain of Ai dying. We discover that the reason this Ai takeover occurred was because there was a simultaneous combination of the actual Ai that was stored from the father and the Ai that Asahi was spending time with. These colliding feelings caused this error as those worlds started to become one since the programmed Aoi was reliving and reexperiencing asahi’s and AI’s relationship. As previously stated, the father inputted the remaining brain data into this Ai program so now those 5 girls are essentially small parts of an unawakened Ai or entirely Ai, whichever way you want to look at it. This is where we see the AI’s process of learning how to love starting to heavily relate and reflect to the experiences asahi and Aoi shared. Then, Each of the 4 remaining girls have their interactions and moments with Asahi. They are really sweet and touching as they have to sacrifice themselves for Asahi to reach Ai. This type of depth in the characters connection and this entire AI projecting and juxtaposition is not what I expected as it’s so brilliant. It’s this eerie comorbidity that is gradually built up to which is ingenious.With Ai and Asahi reconnecting, we are shown their history from childhood until her unfortunate death. They relive their past, the times they could have had, and go on this intense and emotional dramatic argument about regret, dreams, love, and grief. It’s touching and genuine. This resolution was quite heavy and harrowing as they both need to get the closure of their situation, love, and accept the thing they both have been running away from. Not only did the childhood friend win, but this becomes one of my favorite love sequences in any anime I’ve seen as this show is a lot deeper than meets the eye. They sort of drop the ball with the ending as all the girls come back and it was a missed chance to leave this anime on an impressive and growth filled end note which does make this another weird blemish.Going into this show, I simply wanted big ol titties and shameless fan service. What I got was a fever dream that was unconventional and peculiar which still was able to result in satisfying and great moments which has me conflicted. There’s equally many weak points and blemishes as there are brilliances that are high quality and gradually established or hinted about. To go from generic harem, to trashy, to sci-fi, and into an emotional and reflective love story was kind of fascinating. This experience feels like how the usual Visual Novel adaption goes with it being confusing and messy and it being a coin flip whether it works or not. I don’t know if what I watched was trashy, great, or a masterpiece but that’s okay. It was a unique experience that I think rarely happens. It truly does challenge the way I review and view media, that’s for sure.7-10/10 the one who arranged this situation as to find him a bridesmaid in typical harem fashion.

Between the odd bits of action, the 'romance', and the overall theme of letting go of one's past in order to progress; I could not stop subconsciously comparing this to Angel Beats!. Even the ending was practically the same, although it was a bit more heavy-handed with the erasure of any real loss of characters (which is to be expected with this medium).I can't be all critical though. I enjoyed some aspects, mainly how Asahi's emotions were dealt with when his entire world fell...apart in front of him. It was most definitely not the cookie-cutter harem romance story, although of course it had many elements that one would expect from such a genre.All in all, it was alright.

All of a sudden though, things shifted in a very different direction, and I'll be honest, I don't think it was for the better. At least not entirely. Yes, the last episode is pretty bittersweet, and I admit, it made me feel something, but the overall tonal shift I can't say I enjoyed very much.Still, I...can say that this show was alright. I'd give it a mild recommendation, particularly for some of the voice acting (I watched the English dub for reference).

That's right, the Eve no Jikan & Harmonie studio. It was released in 2002, making it the oldest Rikka anime I've looked at by over half a decade. It's also the shortest by a pretty wide margin. Let's see how it holds up.Story:Our narrative is set in a quaint cafe where a group of patrons are all holding their own conversations. Our main focus is on the young man at the counter and the barista who's trying to cheer him up after he broke up with his girlfriend.One thing to note about the story-telling...is that the conversations from the people besides our main character all, in some form, foreshadow what he's going to experience towards the end of the short. Which, I don't really think is necessary. You could honestly have the cafe be basically barren and show some quick, visual hints and get the same effect.I will credit the short with capturing a very interesting moment. It does keep your attention from start to finish. Which doesn't seem like a great feat for something that's only nine minutes, but I've seen other short anime/ anime with very short episodes where there was just nothing compelling. Hi, Chokotan. In some ways, this feels like a very short story that Ibis could tell. It also does a good job of giving you enough of the world to get you interested. This could make an effective lead in to a longer series if it wasn't just a stand alone thing.Characters:The characterisation in this isn't anything special. Our main protagonist has a basic level of verisimilitude and about as much depth as you could reasonably manage with nine minutes. The waitress comes across as almost a trickster type with her eagerness to help and her guiding our protagonist to a strange area. Until you learn the truth about her, any way.The rest of the patrons aren't really worth mentioning. They're all kind of boring if I'm being honest.Art:I'm not completely sold on the art style. This is one of those anime where all the characters have dead looking eyes and the facial expressions are a bit awkward. It doesn't really look bad. It's serviceable enough. It's just a bit of a blah style. And they do get lazy at points and just show text.The only point where I genuinely like the art is towards the end when things get a bit surreal.

At the time of writing this, it\'s available on youtube with english and spanish subtitles.Mizu no Kotoba, or Aquatic Language, it\'s the first short of Yoshiura Yasuhiro, in which he expunges his views on Kotodama, the belief that words are living things, with inherent power when they\'re spoken. This idea isn\'t just present in this short, not by a long-shot, but it\'s one of the few I\'ve seen that name-drop the concept directly. Another one that comes to mind is the movie, Kimi no Koe wo Todoketai, that funnily enough it\'s about cute girls doing radio. But what...is Mizu no Kotoba about and what does it say about Kotodama?I\'ll talk a bit about the character models and the animation. Since it was done by one person(at least he\'s the only one credited) it\'s clear it was the best he could do, but it isn\'t a shame really, because in a way, I don\'t think he needed more assistance than that. The characters look stiff, but I think in an endearing way. The movements that need to be emphasized, are, and there\'s nothing stopping the camera from moving in interesting ways, or to have moments of dashing artistry were things get weird.Now, starting for real, lets talk about the setting. The story follows the conversation of people inside a coffee shop. It\'s one of those one-location shorts I, for one, really enjoy. One of the goals it achieves flawlessly is the portrayal of spatial relation inside the building. We know where every character is in relation to the others, and we also understand the layout of the shop, being a sort of mix of café and aquarium(though this isn\'t yet clear). Everything else is readily apparent and the movement of the camera makes it, like Kotodama, a living thing itself, with the light, fans and even the paintings, gently nudging the viewer and the characters around the shop. Everything inside seems relevant to the situation, working the cross purpose of acquainting the people with both a consistent verisimilitude reality and then betraying those expectations. Apart from that, there\'s something else that\'s special about this shop, and it\'s the sound design.If anyone has ever listened to those white noise channels like Guild of Ambience and others like it, which I\'m a big fan of, you\'ll immediately picture what the atmosphere is like. It\'s like stepping aside from yourself and simply taking in the sounds and the talking. This coffee shop becomes like a small music box with a weirdly playful tone, that sees almost in jeopardy with itself. While watching there\'s some urgency that something is coming and the sound makes a point in making that come across. So now that I established that it ""makes you feel"" like you\'re in a coffee shop; that it\'s advocating for the eavesdropping culture, lets peel back the layers and throw you directly into the hotpot of conversations.First things first, the dialogue is very well done. From the (apparently) natural flow of speech, to the dynamics forming around the characters, to the different topics that seem to relate to each other in interesting ways. But first, lets talk about the least interesting of these conversations because there\'s very little of it; some would say none, if you don\'t consider talking directly to the audience to be a valid form of dialogue at least.So the most forgettable character is the boy reading the coffee shop books in the furthest table from the action. It\'s like he isn\'t even part of the story and his inclusion seems artificial, but unlike that of a omnipresent narrator with a pompous monologue, he just feels at first glance like an undeniable outlier, because he doesn\'t really ""speak"", reacts to what\'s happening, or interacts with the other characters. Whenever the camera pans out to him, it focuses, not much on him as a person with ideas, but on a quote from one of the books he\'s reading, which then covers the whole screen in one of those text-box screens.There\'s two of them. The first one is from I robot, by Isaac Asimov and the other one is from 20,000 leagues under the sea, by Julio Verne. It\'s important noting that they are from a science fiction book and a fantasy book respectively. Both of the quotes are plot relevant, since the first one suggests the robot/android ""plottwist"" later and the second one is about being in an aquarium, that relates to the fish we see on the paintings and later swimming in the air near the end. You could say that his only role in the story is to foreshadow these things, but I would put him a step above that. I do think this guy is the directors surrogate for suggesting what will happen, but I think the suggestion it\'s done in a clever way, using the mechanic of ""Language has power"". Before the quotes, none of the fantastic or science fiction events have happened. But when the author stamps them on the screen, they become reality. Before the quote about robots, we don\'t know the girl behind the counter is a robot. Before the quote about the aquarium, we haven\'t confirmed that the fish is indeed alive. He\'s the literal trigger of the story beats. The words he\'s reading have an impact, showcasing the power of fiction basically.The conversation most directly involved with him, is the one of the two guys that are next to him in the coffee shop. One of the guys is talking about an unnamed person who explained Kotodama to him, while the other doesn\'t really pay attention, because he\'s remembering that the fish in one of the paintings was moving. This kind of world-building it\'s fairly interesting, since in his flashback, we sort of get clued on the logic of this place, since whoever is sitting in that table, will notice when the ""fish"" is triggered through the Verne Quote, which is in itself a reaction to the ""robot"" part which is triggered by the Asimov quote. Those, I think, are the mechanics of this shop. Someone comes in, starts reading the books, and if someone needs help, the lady will then direct them to the easel and then, the aquarium. It\'s a mathematical calculation, with falls neatly into the artificial intelligence spill.Next, the topic of the conversation between both of the girls is about compatibility, with one arguing that after a certain point, it\'s impossible to date someone, while the other\'s being skeptical about the whole basis of that information. Then again, words are important, because the friend is just repeating words she heard from others, implying that the regurgitation of information without much substance loses power, specially because she\'s not getting it straight from the source like, for example, the guy reading the books. Anyways, leaving both of them behind, lets talk about the main conversation, that relate in some way to the other conversations.The guy who just got dumped by his girlfriend is being schooled about love by the girl behind the counter, which tells him superstitious nonsense like half of the people in the world are supposed to be women and he still has a chance to find another one. It\'s pretty telling when she then sends him out into the upper levels of the store for him to literally see that there are other ""fish"" in the sea. That\'s the type of nonsensical symbolism that I really love. (Furthermore, it\'s suggested that he got dumped because he ""didn\'t listen to the other part"". That could mean many number of things. His girlfriend, his own feelings, the right hemisphere of his brain that doesn\'t speak because it\'s mute. Who knows… It\'s interesting to note that if this coffee shop is a microcosm of the world, then there are 3 women and 4 men. If you don\'t want to consider the robot girl… well, a girl, then it\'s down to 2 when and 4 men. You might also have a theory that the guy reading the book\'s is also a robot, which… I wouldn\'t disagree to that being the case. The point being that in any case, it\'s less than half.So, then there\'s the ending. Clearly this world is both fantasy and science fiction inspired, and the way that was shown in little time was really interesting and inspiring. Him reaching the apex of the store, seeing all the words that were spoken, popping at different intervals. We don\'t hear what he says, but he exhales a bubble that then floats to the air without bursting and disappears through the rafters. It\'s interesting to note that when he comes down, everyone already left; moreover, all the chairs are hung upside down on the tables, like the coffee shop wasn\'t even opened. Either what he saw up there left him paralyzed for a while or maybe he was alone in the shop from the start, and it was all a simulation. It\'s down to interpretation from here.I think the fact that in this world(coffee shop), showing people a giant fish and a recollection of all the words they\'ve spoken is how a robot thinks of helping a person get over a break up, are fairly interesting, if nonsensical, ways of approaching it. I, for one, ate it all up for sure. I just hope I was able to elucidate the ways why I think it worked so well for me, and why I consider it one of my favorite anime. is Mizu no Kotoba about and what does it say about Kotodama?I\'ll talk a bit about the character models and the animation. Since it was done by one person(at least he\'s the only one credited) it\'s clear it was the best he could do, but it isn\'t a shame really, because in a way, I don\'t think he needed more assistance than that. The characters look stiff, but I think in an endearing way. The movements that need to be emphasized, are, and there\'s nothing stopping the camera from moving in interesting ways, or to have moments of dashing artistry were things get weird.Now, starting for real, lets talk about the setting. The story follows the conversation of people inside a coffee shop. It\'s one of those one-location shorts I, for one, really enjoy. One of the goals it achieves flawlessly is the portrayal of spatial relation inside the building. We know where every character is in relation to the others, and we also understand the layout of the shop, being a sort of mix of café and aquarium(though this isn\'t yet clear). Everything else is readily apparent and the movement of the camera makes it, like Kotodama, a living thing itself, with the light, fans and even the paintings, gently nudging the viewer and the characters around the shop. Everything inside seems relevant to the situation, working the cross purpose of acquainting the people with both a consistent verisimilitude reality and then betraying those expectations. Apart from that, there\'s something else that\'s special about this shop, and it\'s the sound design.If anyone has ever listened to those white noise channels like Guild of Ambience and others like it, which I\'m a big fan of, you\'ll immediately picture what the atmosphere is like. It\'s like stepping aside from yourself and simply taking in the sounds and the talking. This coffee shop becomes like a small music box with a weirdly playful tone, that sees almost in jeopardy with itself. While watching there\'s some urgency that something is coming and the sound makes a point in making that come across. So now that I established that it ""makes you feel"" like you\'re in a coffee shop; that it\'s advocating for the eavesdropping culture, lets peel back the layers and throw you directly into the hotpot of conversations.First things first, the dialogue is very well done. From the (apparently) natural flow of speech, to the dynamics forming around the characters, to the different topics that seem to relate to each other in interesting ways. But first, lets talk about the least interesting of these conversations because there\'s very little of it; some would say none, if you don\'t consider talking directly to the audience to be a valid form of dialogue at least.So the most forgettable character is the boy reading the coffee shop books in the furthest table from the action. It\'s like he isn\'t even part of the story and his inclusion seems artificial, but unlike that of a omnipresent narrator with a pompous monologue, he just feels at first glance like an undeniable outlier, because he doesn\'t really ""speak"", reacts to what\'s happening, or interacts with the other characters. Whenever the camera pans out to him, it focuses, not much on him as a person with ideas, but on a quote from one of the books he\'s reading, which then covers the whole screen in one of those text-box screens.There\'s two of them. The first one is from I robot, by Isaac Asimov and the other one is from 20,000 leagues under the sea, by Julio Verne. It\'s important noting that they are from a science fiction book and a fantasy book respectively. Both of the quotes are plot relevant, since the first one suggests the robot/android ""plottwist"" later and the second one is about being in an aquarium, that relates to the fish we see on the paintings and later swimming in the air near the end. You could say that his only role in the story is to foreshadow these things, but I would put him a step above that. I do think this guy is the directors surrogate for suggesting what will happen, but I think the suggestion it\'s done in a clever way, using the mechanic of ""Language has power"". Before the quotes, none of the fantastic or science fiction events have happened. But when the author stamps them on the screen, they become reality. Before the quote about robots, we don\'t know the girl behind the counter is a robot. Before the quote about the aquarium, we haven\'t confirmed that the fish is indeed alive. He\'s the literal trigger of the story beats. The words he\'s reading have an impact, showcasing the power of fiction basically.The conversation most directly involved with him, is the one of the two guys that are next to him in the coffee shop. One of the guys is talking about an unnamed person who explained Kotodama to him, while the other doesn\'t really pay attention, because he\'s remembering that the fish in one of the paintings was moving.

Mizu no Kotoba is like someone who started an ambitious 3000-piece puzzle, but gave up half-way through. One can somewhat see what the larger picture was supposed to be, but the overall image is marred by empty swaths of space.The cast of characters isn\'t the most memorable - or likable. Short anime are constrained by their run time, but it is not impossible to develop interesting characters despite that (just look at She and Her Cat). This is not the case here. We have a guy who has become embittered with women...after breaking up with his girlfriend over a petty fight; two women gossiping over a friend of a friend who had a crush on a man, but they refer to him twice as ""not really a guy""; a quiet woman reading \'I, Robot\' by Isaac Asimov; and two men debating whether a koi fish in a painting moved away from its frame. Given that most of the characters had the charm and charisma of a dead rat, I was only engaged with the latter\'s conversation.The meat and potatoes of this anime is the conversation that the aforementioned two guys were having over the metaphysical quality of a fish painting. This serves as a backdrop for the power of words or \'language spirits\' as they call it. Strong words or weak words can dissipate and lose their impact if obscured by the extraneous noise that permeates our everyday lives. Due to its ethereal quality, words can float away and pop like bubbles. Beautiful to look at, but can disappear in an instant if one is inattentive. The problem, however, is while the themes presented are thought-provoking, the ending did not deliver on the the groundwork it was building up to. Yes, there is trippy imagery laden with meaning, but it feels hollow.Animation is unrefined and choppy; characters look better when they are talking, sitting motionless at a table, but anything more ambitious than that looks unpolished - as if the characters momentarily became popsicle stick puppets when they walked. Character design is bland at best, with one caveat: everyone has big, expressive eyes which conveyed what they felt perfectly. Color palette ranged from a warm sienna to a dark salmon, which complemented the cozy feel of a hole-in-the-wall cafe.There\'s one main smooth jazzy piano piece that plays throughout most of the OVA; it\'s forgettable, but not unpleasant. The other music worthy of note is at the very end, a synthesizer melody starts playing as soon as the short goes from the mundane to the surreal; I liked it much better than the main tune.Do I recommend this? Yes, but mostly for Yasuhiro Yoshiura fans. As a standalone piece, it\'s crude and incomplete, but as an introduction to Yoshiura\'s works, it gives insight to where his ideas for Pale Cocoon and Eve no Jikan came from.

And that\'s a bit of a shame, because in my opinion her drama stories are more interesting.  If you\'ve seen any ten episodes of Ranma 1/2 or Urusei Yatsura, there\'s no need to go further because you\'ve already seen every joke she knows.  But there\'s a wider range when it comes to her non-humor stories.  Like Mermaid Forest.Except this is one of her more flawed efforts - it has its good points, and yet...there I have some issues.  First of all, the artwork and animation are pretty par for the course - every Takahashi character looks the same, and the animation is decent enough.  Where this story succeeds the most is in evoking a mood or feeling, she seems to have a good handle on what makes Japanese horror interesting.However, it feels like you are dropped into the middle of a much broader story, and in fact that\'s the case as Yuta has already been around for a few hundred years by the time it gets going (and there is also a flashback to much earlier to help explain things, too).  But I never seemed to get a good ""feel"" for the character, or his motivations (or lack thereof) - it seems like he was just going through the motions.  Which, I guess, would make sense for a reluctant immortal - but even so, it\'s not exactly enjoyable to watch.  And I could never understand Mana; the two sisters were not relatable in any way, it seems the only sympathetic character was the long-suffering doctor.I read the Mermaid stories in manga format a couple decades past, and I recall them making a more coherent story in that format.

Kaizoku Ganzack”, and I'm sure that even then, a lot of people ended up sleeping on its true...potential to flourish, and look at it now. Brighter than ever.Ok, let's get it out of the way, the animation, for something from the 90s, you can easily get a fuzzy picture on what it would look like on your head, that's probably why I was surprised the most, of course, not because of the out-of-nowhere insane high resolution of the time (and it had none of that), but mainly because of the satisfactory fluid animation that spans almost the entirety of the OVA continuously, something even early Toei One Piece never scaled up to.The main cast, composed of Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, making it the story fit somewhere in between of Orange Town and Syrup Village arcs, Nami is as betraying as ever, Luffy just as goofy and glutton as they come, and Zoro as infamous and widely recognizable as he's always been. The trio got themselves involved into saving an island that was overrun by pirates, and to be honest, it was as generic of a setup as the classic One Piece we're grown to love.Dock into an island or be forced to land on it, make a move on the villain, get captured, escape death, learn about the story of the island, head back for a second round, beat the bad guy, set to sea for more information. Grindy but effective.As I was waiting for One Piece episode 884 to download (slow internet), it was a great deal of time for until then, I'm sure it's going to be weird shifting between a pre-One Piece adventure to the intense events of the Levely arc, but for what it is, it sure made for a good watch.Overall score: (6.8/10) potential to flourish, and look at it now.

Strangely enough it is made by an entirely different studio, and for that reason it also has a very different animation style, as well as voice actors.I have heard from most viewers how they didn’t like it because it looks weird and has different voices but these reasons are mostly aesthetic since we were accustomed to the Toei style. It is not bad at all...for the year it was made and actually has some very good names in the production team. Studio I.G. has far better budgets than Toei and poured enough in this short to make it look ok. The director of it was Taniguchi Gorou, and this was also his first wok. Later on he went on to direct many other famous/cult anime, such as Infinite Ryvius, Planetes, and Code Geass. As for the voice actors, the villain is voiced by none other than Wakamoto Norio, one of the most distinguished and cherished ones in the field.All the bright people in the world though are not enough to make a good omelette out of rotten eggs, and it is true that the plot is too short and simple to mean anything. In just half an hour, we get a more than linear story of the gang having to beat a pirate for food. It also plays out quite anti-climactically, as there are only three of them, they don’t even have their first ship yet (just a small boat) and the villain just wants to build a ship and a base. Not that the later movies were doing a much better job but at least offered a bit more time to building up the tension and fleshing out the secondary cast a bit. Yet here we have this child trying to protect the island and the bad pirate exploiting the population and we barely get anything worth remembering them about. And seriously, having a kid asking from the heroes to help turned out to be an overused and lame trope for the franchise.Now something regarding the pirate Ganzack. Aside from being a filler character without a backdrop that we will never see again, he is also a very weird blend of various cannon villains. He has the clothes of Baggy, and the mechanical weaponry of Don Krieg. And if I stretch it, since Oda eventually took ideas even from the movies for his later arcs, Ganzack also uses a crab weapon like a very minor pirate captain in Merman Island. But hey, he is voiced by Norio and that alone gives him some style, lol.The action scenes are good for their time; simple yet with fluent motions for the most part that make them a bit likable. The problem is, they last too little to get you into the proper mood but they are not bad. The sound part is unimpressive in terms of music and terrible if you can’t get past the different voices the characters have.In all, it is quite the passable little OVA but the open minded should accept that it’s well made or how it was meant to promote what was to be the most adorable long-term shounen of them all.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 2/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 2/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Analysis: Art 1/1, Sound 0/2, Story 0/3, Characters 1/4VERDICT: 4/10 for the year it was made and actually has some very good names in the production team.

The animation is incredible, the music is a lot of fun (the jazzy ending song is going to be stuck in my head for a long while), and it's very true to the kinds of stories being told in that part of One Piece. The change in artstyle from Oda's unique cartoony look to something a bit more typical for the era is actually a lot of fun and somewhat refreshing, but I think if the actual show had continued like this it would have garnered a lot...of criticism for the decision. It's obviously going to appeal to fans of One Piece as a bit of interesting ephemera, but I think this is just as good for people who haven't made that tremendous commitment yet. I wouldn't use this as a way to gauge whether you'd like the anime or not, though; it's an entirely different beast given that it doesn't have to contend with a weekly-airing budget and pacing, and is frankly a lot better than the anime because of that (I am a manga-only, though, so take my views with a grain of salt).Get out your CRT, turn down the lights, and have a nice little break from modernity with this OVA.

Really miss the use of saxophones and electric guitars in soundtracks, makes them more action filled and lively, like they feel more triumphant.

This is an original story that doesn’t take place in the manga. ‘98” it was a film festival featuring three shonen jump comics adopted into short animated films. This is an original story that doesn’t take place in the manga."", ""After watching this OVA and seeing other reviews, I gotta write a quickie to defend this first foray into the animated world of One Piece.First of all, I feel like the majority of those writing negative reviews of this short movie have really weird expectations. They're judging the movie (which predates any other OP animation) by the Studio Toei series that wouldn't begin until next year (comparing the voice actors, art style, etc.), which makes no sense. The movie should be seen in the proper context, as something preceding other attempts to bring OP into the world of anime. I think it does a splendid...job of this, so let me get to the meat of it:Story - 8/10The plot of this little adventure is classic early One Piece. The Strawhats arrive at an island, find its inhabitants oppressed by some cliche evil villain, then they take him down. I honestly found it really satisfying. It serves as a great introduction to the typical formula of most of East Blue, and if you like what you get in this OVA, you get more of it with even more detail in the Toei adaptation. Nothing to complain about here.Art/Sound - 7/10Some of the weirder complaints about this OVA refer to the art. I just don't get it. Of course it's somewhat dated, it's from 1998. The quality is hardly different from that of the first Toei saga. It's nothing spectacular, but it stays true to the vision and style of the manga for the most part. I am quite mixed on the sound however. There were a few tracks in the OVA that STUNNED me for being so quality in such a short one-off thing. However, I did have a problem with the sound design. For some reason the way the tracks were played felt... off. It was the one part of the OVA that felt unduly rushed to me, both in the sense that it was as if proper time wasn't put into doing the sound design, and also in the sense that it felt like the music was really speeding along and changing frequently. Not that big a deal though.Character - 10/10You get everything One Piece out of this. Luffy, Zoro, and Nami get all of their most prominent character attributes displayed in a very short amount of time, giving a viewer all the characterization they need to decide if these are characters they want to see more of. The OVA also does a good job of showing what other typical OP characters seem like, from the over-the-top and cruel villain to the hapless but loveable villagers (I especially liked Medaka and wish she was a canon character).Enjoyment - 8I like this OVA better than a lot of regular One Piece episodes as it contains a full story in such a short amount of time, and I happen to find one of my biggest issues with the main series to be its pacing. It really works as an example of what One Piece is, and I enjoyed it a lot for the short runtime it has.Overall - 8Taking into consideration that this animation was the first foray into animated OP and is separate from the popular Toei adaptation, I really liked this OVA. It's a nice little self-contained story with the characters every OP fan loves, only 28 minutes long. Definitely worth the watch and gives you little to complain about. job of this, so let me get to the meat of it:Story - 8/10The plot of this little adventure is classic early One Piece.

Just like the ""Parallel World Pharmacy"" but with sweets and pastry, and with the MC opening a bakery or sweet shop. But sike! It\'s actually ""How a realist hero rebuilt the Kingdom!""While I don\'t hate the show for what it was, I can understand why others dislike it for this very reason. The actual story was relatively decent, but it seems to be diverging from its initial...premise. After all, the show is called “Sweet Reincarnation” for a reason. We were expecting a cooking and baking show centered around pastries and sweets, not another politics and war isekai.It\'s a slow burn show with an okayish pace.

Sweet Reincarnation is no masterpiece. Indeed, if you compare it to other similar fantasy anime, not necessarily isekai, that go over similar themes, it falls short - you won't see the in-depth analysis of Middle Age market rules and currency or the complex psychological relationships between the characters you find in, say, Spice and Wolf (with which it shares a superficially similar 'merchant-y' vibe), and while you get a glimpse of politics, war, and management, we're not yet close to, say, The Genius Prince's Guide or Realist Hero.

But the plot is solid and doesn't fail to keep you interested in what's happening: most importantly, the MC is not the typical super-OP edgelord we see in many isekai, so he needs to play smart and figure out how to work his way out of his predicaments to achieve is final goals instead of just kicking everyone in the butt with his super OP skill. In general, the characters are all but flat and stereotyped, and there *is* some development in their personalities and stories, with them facing drawbacks and failures and learning how to deal with them.Long story short, there is a story - and a good one, at that, with compelling characters.

It’s another low-quality, low-effort isekai set in another European medieval light-novel fantasy land, sure, but unlike all of the other isekai garbage (excluding The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen and Mushoku Tensei) there was a certain charm to Sweet Reincarnation that kept me coming back each week.Unlike other protagonists of this season’s isekai ilk, the reincarnated pastry chief who died after being crushed by his own cake (no, seriously, that’s how he dies) and now is the nine-year-old son of a noble lord...called Pastry (no, seriously, that’s his name) has an actual long term goal for us to follow. He wants to create a land of sweets where everyone sits down and eats cake and cookies instead of going to war and murdering each other. Unfortunately, the village and land he lords over are poor and lacking in suitable ingredients for him to bake with. This means that he first needs to build up the village with his father, gather funds and learn how to act like a noble before he can get into the kitchen.Whilst it is satisfying to watch Pastry slowly but surely work towards his goals, this does mean the show about a reincarnated Pastry chief is caught up in a lot of the typical isekai clichés such as learning magic, fighting bandits and playing politics instead of making sweets. In fairness, his magic ability is very interesting and the way he uses it plays into the politics which is very well done, but it’s a bit disappointing getting five episodes in to see the only thing he’s cooked is an apple pie or a “bonka pie” in this world… because the apples are called bonka’s… even though honey is still called honey and tea is still called tea- its stupid. Why even rename them? I think he bakes maybe five times throughout the entire season.I enjoyed the characters and the relationships Pastry forms with them, especially with his father and mother which is very wholesome if not a bit slapstick. I especially enjoy Lady Brioche Salgret Mille Leteche's comical reactions to getting bamboozled every time she and Pastry have a conversation. Pastry does an excellent job of balancing his reincarnated adult personality with his nine-year-old new personality to where others around him could believably view him as a prodigy.Unfortunately, the villains boil down to corrupt nobles doing a bad thing and that's all we get from them for maybe an episode or two before they’re defeated and tossed aside and forgotten.Sweet Reincarnation is held back by its lacklustre production and light novel isekai clichés, but with a satisfying pacing, interesting magic and politics, something about it reminds me of Ascendance of a Bookworm.

The series revolves around the concept of a sweet-loving pastry chef finding nobility in a new world. It is simple, engaging, and soothing, making it easy and enjoyable to watch.If we talk about the shortcomings: Firstly, there is a rather bland nobility system and confusing aristocrats. Yes, there is a general lack of clarity and meaning in the plot. Look, this baron, that duke, this count—okay, now you\'ve learned about them, and the story throws you into their troubled world. Additionally, while the characters are not explicitly portrayed as overpowered, they somehow...manage to overcome every challenge. However, the mind games are significantly lacking and resemble second-rate detective movie style.

But, sugar is expensive in this world, so his poor ass can't do any baking :(This show's main focus is about managing (and developing) his lands with the help of isekai tropes and a few baking puns. The plan is to eventually get rich/resourceful enough to provide for his baking needs. As with most Isekai, this is also filled with tropes. The characters are really boring. MC is OP (although he rarely uses his OP skill) and is a smoother talker who can negotiate/deal...with even the most experienced nobles. Nobody questions his knowledge (especially HOW this barely 12 year old kid knows baking recipes that nobody ever heard about). All female characters (except one red haired noble lady) are useless.The only good thing about this anime is the relationship between MC and his father. It is rare to see good (and alive) fathers of male MC in Isekai. They do a lot of bonding, respect each other and are almost always in sync. When MC learns about his OP skill, the father discusses about this properly and makes sure to keep this a secret to avoid unnecessary attention. MC's father kinda saves this show by being an almost secondary MC.There is no harem (yet), which is maybe another positive.Anyway, it is still generic isekai trash, but slightly better than the usual trash.

That\'s unique...but retracting to the ""copy-paste"" Isekai formula that\'s plagued the AniManga industry for years now, that\'s a lowbrow, bruh.It\'s just sad how many authors thought they have a unique premise to the ever so saturated Isekai genre, but forgetting that the premise has to be backed up with the plot, and that\'s where the entire work is doomed even before the work could get an upstart. Yet, this is exactly the scenario for novelist Nozomu Koryu\'s only work that is Okashi na Tensei a.k.a Sweet Reincarnation, a perfectly average work that got its start in Syosetu in early 2015, and then...spawning with the LN with 24 volumes ever before the anime got its start. And yes, if you\'re thinking of giving this anime a go, please hear me out first before you do so.So first up, I\'m going to spare you the pain of watching a rather mediocre Isekai: this anime describes the VERY definition of the word ""misleading"" at best. Yes, it features patissierie...food like sweets and pastry to be exact, but most of the time, it\'s stuck to the very same tropes that we the audience have been and now suffer from in Isekai every season, and Okashi na Tensei is clearly no different from the rest of its contemporaries. Moreover, I\'m just sensing that Japan sure doesn\'t care, and by some perchance, makes the trick to propose old works that only will see anime adaptations years down the road, only to forget that Isekai is the safe cash cow that will make profits even if losses are predicted beforehand.That said, what Okashi na Tensei does well in is its simple plot of a reincarnated adult-turned-kid who wants to run a business selling sweets, and surprisingly, its characters, whom of which many are references to real sweets in life. Though I will say for the MC that is the bright kid of Pastry Mille Morteln: ""Boy, you\'re in the wrong show! If you want to really make sweets, join Anne from Sugar Apple Fairy Tale, and you two can become child prodigies together to make sweets and build a sweets empire together!"" Aside from the copy-paste repeated plot that has Pas (name in short form) fight for his lowly Morteln family by ascending to the likes of bigger kingdoms like the Hubarek family, forcefully getting engaged to the children (because that\'s a thing that the adults will capitalize on to build the next generation) with names like Petra and Licorice, yeah...give your children unique names so that you can have a sweet marriage when they grow up, I see your game there, ah hah? Aside from the adults having names like Pas\'s father Casserole, the caveat is that you\'ll have to see all of the usual BS like kingdom politics and family infighting, not to mention arranged family marriages, just to see the plot progress for Pas to finally make baby steps in his venture to create his sweets kingdom.It feels like the patisserie segment is only a piece/slice/share of the pie while the usual Isekai tropes are just slathered everywhere else being the filling of the pie, almost like a bonka (apple) pie that is not filled enough, or if it has a bad taste due to the wrong mixtures of fruits and spices. The baking takes at most 5 mins, while the rest of the episodes are all your usual Isekai shtick, and that should say something about either if Nozomu Koryu was a clown or a genius that he/she managed to fool his/her audience into thinking that: ""If you want to see some real sweets baking, please read my work...and I promise you that as much as you love reading Isekai and put up with all of its nonsense, the sweets will come and make your time worthwhile."" To which I say, it\'s total BS, it\'s clear which parts of the story makes the entire work profitable, and it\'s definitely NOT the sweets portion that makes this show and its original source material, the way it is.Everything else surrounding Okashi na Tensei is average at best, from SynergySP\'s art and animation, and even to the music, which I\'ve definitely heard better from sajou no hana (given that it\'s only Sana), and YuNi\'s ED is just...kinda annoying to hear after awhile.If you want shows that aren\'t complete white lies to its premise, try Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi a.k.a Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill, which I still believe is one very recent show (from Winter 2023) that sticks its guns better, or even Isekai Shokudou a.k.a Restaurant to Another World, which is a rather soothing good time of an Isekai/fantasy show. It\'s just a shame that all of the Isekai BS we\'ve seen and tolerated for years now, it\'s happening to unique-but-not-so-unique works like these that has got producers and directors thinking that they have a small gem, but they\'re diamonds in the (literate) rough.If only I rather not take this show at face value, then it\'s a pretty decent show, all things considered.

It's basically a painfully generic issekai but instead of filling episodes with pointless romance or flashbacks they talk about food.

Pucca (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/6609/Pucca_TV,"['Ninjas, noodles and kisses. It sounds like the formula for a run-of-the-mill shouo anime where all the characters have twinkly or flowery backgrounds and stare doe-eyed at each other until the next bout of melodrama.Thankfully, Pucca is nothing like that.Originally created between 2000 and 2004 by the South Korean production studio Vooz Co. as a series of internet flash animation, the show proved to be insanely popular not only in South Korea, but also in Japan and China, and the series gained a dedicated cult following across the world, even going so far as to spawn lines of stationary, greeting cards, keyrings, and a horde...of other merchandise.  It may even be the case that the franchise is second only to the mighty Sanrio (Hello Kitty), in terms of merchandising revenue.The tale is a very simple little ""romance"" about an 11 year old girl called Pucca, who lives with her three uncles in a noodle restaurant. She has a crush on local ninja-in-training Garu, and will do almost anything to give him kisses.Cue the madness.Pucca is essentially an episodic tale that has no real plot aside from the lead character trying to express her love for her extremely reluctant beau. Now normally this would be a problem, however this show works surprisingly well with that handicap for one very important reason - the premise is only there to give the comedy something to stand on. The important thing to remember when watching this show is that it never takes itself or the viewer seriously, and this in itself makes a refreshing change as while the series has no real conclusion, the viewer will find themselves wanting more without realising it.Given that the comedy is the most important aspect of this show, it\'s important that it\'s done well, and in this respect Pucca really delivers. There\'s very little in the way of speech, however the visual comedy is amongst the best in anime, and many gags last only a few seconds before the show moves onto the next one. In truth, one of the reasons I like this show is because there\'s a certain ""Pythonesque"" quality to the humour, and some of the jokes are very clearly aimed at a more ""mature"" audience.Unlike the original series, Pucca (2006) was specifically made for TV, and the difference in quality shows in both the sound and the visuals. While I\'ve only seen the English dub of the show, the fact that it has very little speech means it is easily transferrable into any language, something which has proven a boon for the franchise as it now airs in numerous countries across the planet. That said, the acting is very well done for the most part, and the spoken comedy is often just as good as the visual slapstick. The effects are actually pretty diverse, and their execution is pretty good for what many people consider to be a ""kids show"".One of the bigger plusses for the show is the music. The theme tune is dangerously simple and catchy, and one viewing will make it stick in your mind for quite a while. The mixture of fast paced guitar music and techno dance tracks also add to the show\'s eccentric take on ""romance"".Where Pucca really struts its stuff though, is with the visuals. As I\'ve mentioned, much of the comedy is seen rather than heard, and because of this the characters are designed in a particularly ""cartoony"" manner. This decision works extremely well with the humour, and also allows for a certain freedom with the animation that the series relies on. The show retains the ""flash-like"" feel of the original series, but has improved in almost every aspect in terms of looks and movement.As for the characters, well, what can I say? Pucca is adorable, and her antics are sometimes hilarious. Garu is far too serious for his own good, and his attempts to escape Pucca\'s affections often lead him into more trouble.And that\'s just the tip of the iceberg.Pucca has a host of characters who take part in the show at one time or another, and almost every single one contributes to the comedy content in some way. From Garu\'s arch-enemy Tobe to Master Soo, from Pucca\'s best friend Ching to Santa Claus, there isn\'t a single wasted character in the whole show. Granted there\'s no development, but when the comedy\'s this good, who cares?Now, it\'s a fairly well established fact that I love shows that are quirky, oddball, off the wall, or just plain wrong when it comes to comedy, and to be honest, Pucca didn\'t disappoint. There\'s plenty of laughs on offer here, and the humour is designed to cater for just about anyone who fancie a chuckle. Granted the show may not be on a par with the likes of Gintama et al, but given that each epsiode is only around 7 minutes long, this series is definitely worth checking out if you want something short to brighten your day a little (before you go to work on a Monday morning for example).Sometimes it\'s nice to watch an uncomplicated show that has the simple goal of making you laugh :) of other merchandise.

Making a unique yet enjoyable CGDCT grows more difficult by the season. So studios and authors alike try out new concepts in an effort of standing out among others. For example, a Cute girl doing fishing (Slow Loop). Cute girl managing a cafe (GochiUsa). Cute girl camping (Yuru Camp), and many more. I am a huge fan of CGDCT, so when I heard there is a new CGDCT on Real Estate, by my favorite studio Dogo Kobo, I instantly got hyped and can't wait to watch it.Dogo Kobo is well-known...for making good CGDCT anime, and this anime is no exception. The art in this anime is way too good for a CGDCT anime. They managed to capture the theme of a medieval town wall, even though the scenery is beautifully drawn. Dogo Kobo has outdone itself in this department, and I am extremely grateful for it.The OP and ED are decent. I like it, but not enough to add it to my Spotify Playlist. The VA did a good job acting out each character's personality. Fa's VA did an exceptional job, successfully acting out Fa's child-like innocence in a very natural way while without sounding too over high pitched and fake.For plot-wise, at the start of the season, it seems like your typical CGDCT anime (not much ongoing plot, everyone seems to be enjoying their time, etc.). However, in the 2nd half of the season, the show takes an unexpectedly dark turn. (I will not spoil it, watch the show if you want to know what is about.) They capture the dire atmosphere very well, which pushes this anime to an 8.TLDR:RPG Real Estate is a CGDCT anime that focus on cute girls doing real estate. It is an above-average CGDCT anime. Please note that there is excessive fan service this season. I will give this anime a borderline 8.Story: 7/10Art: 9/10Sound: 8/10Character: 6/10Enjoyment: 8/10Total: 38/50 (7.6) for making good CGDCT anime, and this anime is no exception.

And wouldn\'t you know it, like Elaina and Azusa, the MC in RPG Fudousan has a big witch hat.I kid (not really), RPG Fudousan has got to be the most refreshing Kirara show I\'ve watched in years. As much as I love the comfort and familiarity of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things with some weak gimmick attached to them, they all start to feel very samey after a few dozen. RPG Fudousan, on the other hand, while also having a weak gimmick attached to it, somehow feels very novel by virtue of its setting,...its characters, and its slow burning but ever present plot (which unfortunately is nowhere near resolved by the end of the anime, but one which has a good jumping point to the manga proper).RPG Fudousan is gorgeous, full stop. I just adore the character designs, the world and how beautiful everything looks and how comfy everything is. Gone are the utilitarian streets of modern day Japan as many CGDCT shows feature and what\'s here is a lush setting that is just so pleasing to experience. Doga Kobo may have half-assed this show by a country mile (all in favor of some mediocre romcom no one will remember in a week), but the strength of RPG Fudousan\'s own source material in terms of design still manages show itself even in this adaptation.There isn\'t a single weak link in the main cast, and everyone has a memorable and distinctive role they play in the series. Sure one of the girls is basically a ripoff of Rize from Gochiusa (who is funnily enough voiced by Fuyu from the same series), but the characters still have a strong chemistry with each other and the world around them.As I alluded to earlier, the central gimmick of the main girls operating a real estate company is weak. It\'s real estate on a very surface level where the girls help their customers find a place to live every episode or so without going into the actual real estate stuff like financing or mortgages.  It\'s mainly there to serve as a vehicle for good jokes and to progress the overarching plot ever so slowly, but hey, it certainly is a more memorable gimmick than ""4 Schoolmates Hanging Out"" like many other CGDCT shows are.CGDCT shows largely live and die on their characters, but RPG Fudousan has the additional merit of featuring an intriguing plot as well. For that, as well as its gorgeous visuals, I have this as one of my personal favorite CGDCT shows in a long time, and I greatly long for a second season for the show to tackle some really interesting plotlines the manga eventually goes into.And the big hat.

I should've done some research before starting the anime because that was the hardest clickbait I ever received. I don't follow the 3-episode rule with an iron will. If an anime bores me before the 3 episodes, I'll just drop it. This was one of those instances. I've been pranked, bamboozled, coaxed into a snafu, among others. While this anime's concept is fantasy real-estate, this anime's practical execution is just weird nonstop fanservice and occasionally you see a house interior....The processes of agreements, contracts, etc. are boiled down to a kindergarten level; making any real-estate process no more than a bit or a gaff and it's boring and lame. Slime Reincarnation did a better job at fantasy real-estate and that's not even that anime's main aspect.In conclusion, all I know is pain.

Is your usual vacant pretty anime girls, 3 of which look like the FBI will raid your house for.   The show has no real story line, no real aims or ambitions, and of course no real RPG.If you're looking for an Isekai with monster battles and various creatures to explore, you're barking up the wrong tree.   Is your typical, everyone lives happily ever after trash.If someone is mean to you, is fine, if someone blames you for something you didn't do, that's fine, if you kill someone, that's fine or...if someone doesn't tell you someone with an obvious dragon tail is not an all-powerful dragon, is fine,    It not that it is unreal, it is more that it is absurd,It is the typical trash for some girls to say they want to look like x, or guy to think she is cute even though a poorly drawn image.   The show was boring, the monsters were miraculously social to adventures and of course no tension or hatred seeing as would usually be hunted by the other.   Makes me wonder what an adventurers guild hunts at times like these, when demons, monsters, dark elves etc can all just meld into sociaty.The story is weak on why people would come to a city, never train really, never adventure, but want positions above where they are e.g. high priest at a church, would never work at a real estate office, a warrior would be training their sword regularly.         So the plot holes quickly emerge especially on the difference in strength with those from the castle.So we have no real story, the art is mediocre, same with sound,   The characters are dreadful and lack loyalty, especially with their doubt over fa, and kotones doubt in trusting the others.   Is no depth to the characters, no special skills really or anything that stands out about them.      It just makes it poor to watch in general.For me the ending of the season was the worst with a shitty end, just to please people who like the big boobed character basically and the only one not likely to be a loli hunter.    Just send the people to an abandoned-looking island, to do the same again, on an island initially you see no houses on.

And one such prominent sub-genre will always be the CGDCT theme: Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, where this season, mangaka Chiyo Kenmotsu\'s latest Manga Time Kirara work has become an anime, after a fair few works to her (I assume it\'s a female) name. If you\'re a fan of Iyashikei / CGDCT themes, then RPG Fudousan a.k.a RPG Real Estate will certainly please you like Sweetness and Lightning, but I can understand why the score here...doesn\'t reflect so well because of its shallowness. This is directed by Tomoaki Koshida, who\'s also the director for Spring 2019\'s Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san, so if you\'ve been looking forward to watching a spiritual successor to Senko-san, please watch ""Shachiku-san wa Youjo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai."" instead.So first off, RPG Fudousan is on the contrary, not the first anime to have done the whole real estate shenanigan. That award goes to last Spring\'s Dragon, Ie wo Kau. a.k.a Dragon Goes House-Hunting, which is a show that even exactly after a year since it was released, while the majority still shrugged it off like the typical love-hate game, I still remember loving this show immensely and haven\'t quite forgotten that feeling. That is, until RPG Fudousan appeared this season for those memories to come back, and frankly, I can\'t envision this show being as enjoyable as the former. But, make no mistake that the latter is still good in spots, it\'s just that the show itself is what you would expect of a 4-koma a.k.a 4-panel manga adaptation.RPG Fudousan is just exactly as what the source lingers: a Manga Time Kirara SoL premise with no overarching plot and endearing characters to make up the charm of the series, and thankfully it does what it\'s intended to be done. The RPG (that stands for Rent, Plan, Guide) real estate small business firm that\'s run by its employees: the happy-go-lucky mage Kotone Kazairo, pragmatic priest Rufuria, the tomboyish warrior Rakira, and the adorable dragon demihuman Fa, selling houses to their patrons, one house at a time. And these houses can come in all sorts of settings and fashions that are always unique to the patrons that the 4 girls accompany throughout their business, it\'s a fun time of exploring both the outside world and its canonical themes that at times are nice to watch, that as highlighted, can feel shallow at times.The brilliant shining moments are always in characterization, something that themes like CGDCT will always tend to leverage, and I think that RPG Fudousan did a nice job giving the 4 girls each of their unique quirks and features of their personalities. I can always think of Rufuria and Rakira being like the Yuri couple where the clique needs a man-like figure to stand out, and the warrior Rakira fits the bill of being a cutesy stronghold that can go blush at times, while Rufuria is the mother figure of the business. Kotone is the typical employee that does her job as she was told to do, and Fa is the dragon demihuman that\'s the gel bond of the group, understanding creature language and even going as far as to do literal translations of it, which I feel adds to the strong points of the show for small comedic punches.When it comes to CGDCT, you can always trust that Doga Kobo will be tasked to produce it, and where it seems like a requirement to have at least one CGDCT show per season, it\'s a good chance that it will be done to the T, just as good as it looks. The Chibi/moe style is definitely a plus in portraying the light-hearted aspect of the show, and it is certainly enjoyable depending on the beholder of the person watching. Really though, no problems here at all. This also trickles down to the OST, which again, is what I have come to expect of a cheerful OP and ED, and of similar themes as the rest of the show as well.RPG Fudousan is a comfy show, where at the behest of many shows featuring heavy action and fantasy, a guilt trip like this is much needed for a stress reliever of sorts. While I admit that this show isn\'t for me, if you\'re looking for a show that isn\'t much to swallow for entertainment, I\'d think this show would do a great service to you. And even against yet another similar cusps of a feel-good show this season (Shachiku-san wa Youjo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai.), it just screams a good time, so ride those good times away for a comfortable watch. doesn\'t reflect so well because of its shallowness.

Fairly big headed, in artistic terms, i'd say they're four or five heads tall (a full chibi is 3 heads tall). They ALMOST look like...isometric chibi characters you'd see in some of the japanese videogames. Eyes are bigger than usual, and are set lower and further apart than usual. It doesn't look awful, but you sort of notice it, but then get used to it. There are few occasional non-chibi characters, but they're uncommon.The story is calm type, focused on all-girl cast, but unfortunately it also means that there's a lot of polite smiling at each other involved. The anime also attempts fanservice, and... the anime handles it poorly.There's cute genki/childish/comedic relief present, although characters usually act in somewhat stiff manner and do not show their personalities that well.There seems to be an overarching plotline going on, but so far there were only occasional hints at it. Aside from it, it is just slice of life in fantasy world.So it is average across the board, but not bad and might be worth checking out if you have free time and want something peaceful.5/10 story, 6/10 art, 5/10 sound, 5/10 character, 5/10 enjoyment, 5/10 overall. isometric chibi characters you'd see in some of the japanese videogames.

In the first place, all characters are kinda useless because no one ever tries to figure out where the spell came from and just does nothing except shout names and just wait during the fight.In the end, they didn't even care to find out who was the villain or the one responsible...for that except just suspect the remaining demon's army.Then, I'm just curious where the hell their Heroes go? They even show that they celebrate her birthday but she never shows up during the important fight to help them. That's what I say it's kinda messed up.But well, I didn't expect much from a slice-of-life and fantasy story like this. I just think the fighting scene in the 2 last episodes is unnecessary because it just makes me feel kinda messed up with a hanging story like that.Overall, I like the laid-back and comedy part but I really the way the last 2 episodes just go like that. It's just kinda unfair the villain does not get the punishment she deserves for making a mess and escape just like that without anyone know she the one who cause all that mess. for that except just suspect the remaining demon's army.Then, I'm just curious where the hell their Heroes go?

The group deals with finding houses for both humans & monsters (due to Fa's ability...to communicate openly with any race).While there are character classes present in the show (Warriors, Priests, Necromancers, Wizards) it does not take precedent over the fact of the girls just trying to do their jobs and put people in homes, which I enjoyed, it felt refreshing. They meet kind people and through Fa, they realize that they can befriend just about anyone in order to make them happy/fulfil their housing needs.RPG Fudousan is just a cute lil anime with a Red Herring story (which I personally didn't care for, I'd rather just watch these girls sell houses). The Red Herring felt extremely obvious from the get go, so much so that I wasn't even remotely surprised when it was actually proven in Episodes 11 & 12.But besides that, I enjoyed the series and would love to see the group get back to their daily ins and outs of life after the conclusion of Season 1. There's nothing special about it, but nothing boring about it either. I was perfectly complacent with the first 10 episodes, it was just after they tried to go off on a tangent of forcing a grand scheme that I started to fall off a little bit, but I understand why they felt the urge to add something a bit more suspenseful/dramatic.Side Note: I love the song that Kotone sings repeatedly throughout the series.

This is honestly great and the episodes where we actually got significant real estate agent content were quite nice. However -...and I wish I was exaggerating here - every other episode or even more frequently some kind of wholesome slice-of-life moment is interrupted by some kind of fanservice or breast comparison. Like what were the writers thinking here? It creates an effect where you get some calm and relaxing SOL content then randomly they're off to the beach or off to the onsen or off buying clothes.In addition to this, the writers decided they wanted a background plotline which can actually work well for some SOL but unfortunately here it just felt like suddenly these cute characters are off doing dangerous world-saving things in a world that the characters state should already be saved. The last 3 or 4 episodes are completely out of place. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into details but suffice to say you won't be missing anything really if you just watch the first 6 or 7 episodes.Also can I mention that the song Kotone sings is ridiculously annoying? Maybe other people like it but to me it's not a great melody and it is repeated far too often and sung far too poorly. Every time I heard it I hit mute automatically.Anyway, to summarize: I lightly recommend the first 6 episodes, and caution against the back half. and I wish I was exaggerating here - every other episode or even more frequently some kind of wholesome slice-of-life moment is interrupted by some kind of fanservice or breast comparison.
