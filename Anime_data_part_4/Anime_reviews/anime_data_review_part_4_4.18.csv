Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1166/Sakura_Taisen__Gouka_Kenran,"['One of the problems that faces all studios, regardless of their medium, is how to build on success. The most obvious solution is to create a sequel, however as most people know, the sequel is rarely on par with the original, and it\'s unfortunate that following the success of the Sakura Taisen game and the OVA Ouka Kenran, the follow-up anime is guilty as charged.Released in 1999, Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran is set between the first two games and follows the lives of the members of the Imperial Assault Force - Flower Division. The Demon Wars have ended, and the members of Teikoku Kagekidan Hanagumi...are finally able to rest, recuperate, and focus on their work in the theatre.Unlike the first OVA though, Gouka Kenran (which actually translates to The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Flowers - the first OVA was called The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms), focuses on the characters in a much more direct manner. Because of this, the second OVA is often called a ""character study"", and while there are nods in that direction, in truth this is nothing  more than a secondary introduction to the characters. Each episode is about one or more of the characters, and contain a mixture of drama and comedy, with little in the way of action over the course of the OVA.Deviating slightly from the main review here, there is one major factor that affects every aspect of this OVA, and it needs to be mentioned. The second OVA is not simply a sequel in the same sense as something like the Aria series, and the main reason for this is because of the owners of the franchise - Red Entertainment and Sega. The success of the game and first OVA caused them to try and capitalise on the franchise. Unfortunately they decided to do this by changing not only the series director, but the animation studio as well. This change has played a pivotal role in the creation of the OVA, and for those who have watched Ouka Genran, the differences are obvious and, at times, extreme.Going back to the review, there is a distinct lack of focus in Gouka Kenran. The decision to replace the original director, Ishiyama Takaaki, with Kudo Susumu, was a poor one indeed. That is no criticism of Kudo\'s skills as a director however, it simply means that it would have been preferable to have someone familiar with the characters at the helm. The change from one director to another impacts greatly on the pacing and style of Gouka Kenran, in particular the elements that made Sakura Taisen such a popular series. Kudo has tried to stamp his mark on the series whilst remaining true to the original game and OVA, and it\'s unfortunate that it hasn\'t worked for the most part. The plot tends to drag, or be overly dramatic at times, and without any real action to balance it, the OVA can become a chore to watch for some.Another aspect that has been adversely affected by the produciton changes is the art and animation. Where the orginal OVA was produced by Madhouse, Gouka Kenran was made by ANIMATE, and the difference is telling. The animation in the second OVA is a definite step down for the series, especially as the characters move in decidely rigid, and at times robotic, manner. The colours are as bright and cheery as they were in the first OVA, however the backgrounds have a far more ""cartoon"" feel to them. The only thing that couldn\'t really be changed was the character design, however the implementation makes them look odd at times.It\'s strange, but the one area that seems not to have suffered from the production changes is the sound and music. This may be partly due to the fact that the cast from the original OVA reprised their roles in the sequel, but on the whole the sound throughout the anime is of a decent standard. The music is well chosen, although some of the comedic scenes could have done without the comedic music. The effects are well used for the most part, however there are occasions when the vocals take a back seat.On the whole though, the sound is reasonably good.One would think that, given that this is supposed to be a character study, there would be some good characterisations and development. Unfortunately this is not the case. The fact that the series tries to focus on almost all of the members of Teikoku Kagekidan Hanagumi precludes any substantial development for any of them, and is the reason why I called this more of a secondary introduction rather than a study. If the intent was to study the characters, then the series should have been at least 26 episodes instead of 6 as there just isn\'t enough time to go into any kind of detail. That doesn\'t mean that the characters are bad though, as they are all likable in their own way. No, the problem is that there just isn\'t enough time spent with each character to make the audience relate to them.As with the original OVA, this is a tough one to recommend to any but fans of the franchise. It\'s unfortunate, but also true, that one should watch the original OVA before watching this as well, as this way the viewer will at least have an idea of what\'s going on, who each character is, and why they are in the anime. Although it lacks the same kind of pace and punch as the first OVA, the fact that the characters are effectively allowed to ""step out"" of their roles is an interesting approach that, due to time issues, doesn\'t actually work out.Ultimately though, the entire OVA is effectively all ""filler"", which is a shame as it could have been so much more. are finally able to rest, recuperate, and focus on their work in the theatre.Unlike the first OVA though, Gouka Kenran (which actually translates to The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Flowers - the first OVA was called The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms), focuses on the characters in a much more direct manner.

Queen Emeraldas,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1553/Queen_Emeraldas,"[""It's hard to really write a review, the last 2 OVA ep3-4. Are hard to find items.. in any form. For what was seen ep1-2.  This is worth the ownership, Great if a fan of any of the Harlock-Galaxy 999 Fans.  Again i feel i can not write a true review untill i see ep3-4 "", 'I’m going to start off this review with a disclaimer: If you’re thinking about using this OVA as a starting point for getting into Captain Harlock, turn away right now. With that said, for anyone who’s already a fan you’ll probably enjoy this OVA just because it’s loosely Harlock related and that you’ve probably come to expect very little from anything beyond the original series anyway.First off, the few good things the series has:1. The story. Despite the shortcomings of basically everything else, the story itself is actually quite good. The series has great pacing, fun characters, and an interesting overarching plot.2. The action...sequences. Although a little uninspired the fighting throughout is some of the best in Harlock. There are cosmo guns, gravity sabres, cloaking fields, energy shields, lasers, missiles, space battles, and a giant robot horse.Now, onto the bad:1. It’s not actually about Emeraldas. Despite what the title may have lead you to believe the series is actually about a young boy named Hiroshi who dreams of building his own spaceship. Emeraldas acts as his watchful guardian and that’s about it. If you were thinking you’d get to finally see a series with some focus on Harlock’s most alluring and mysterious ally you were wrong.2. Being an OVA you might assume its self-contained, well it’s not. The series doesn’t end on a cliff hanger or anything but it’s pretty obvious the plot was intended to continue on.3. The animation sucks (kind of). The first two episodes are pretty solid but the studio was switched halfway through and the latter 2 episodes are visibly worse. Especially the characteristic Leiji Matsumoto eyes which the second studio never seemed to get right. The series also has a penchant for 90’s 3D animation which I assume was all the rage at the time but now looks hilariously bad.4. The dialogue is terrible. By the end of this 4 episode OVA I estimate you will have heard Emeraldas say “I am Emeraldas” about 14 times. I don’t know what happened but the show really fell flat in this regard.Ultimately this is a series that you should only watch when you’ve exhausted all other Harlock options. In that regard it’s enjoyable enough, I certainly didn’t hate it but it leaves a lot to be desired. The real tragedy however is simply pondering what could have been. Emeraldas was a fairly underdeveloped character before this OVA and she continues to be afterward but it’s obvious they were setting up for something big. I’ll let you see how it plays out but there’s a lot of foreshadowing and then it seems to end before it even really gets started. sequences.

I\'m talking about the space pirate Emeraldas who had to wait for 1998 to come before she finally got an OVA of her own. I just finished watching it and hopefully this review will provide a considerably more objective assessment than my rampaging fanboyism logically would allow.Story: 5/10The Leiji Matsumoto pattern has made it clear that a young and ambitious male protagonist is likely to emerge whenever...a story needs to be told and Queen Emeraldas proves to be no exception. This time, the tale concerns Hiroshi Umino who ironically gets more screen-time than the titular character herself. Basically, the story is comprised of a series of coincidental encounters these two characters have with each other and the opponents they more or less face co-operatively as Umino aspires to grow stronger and explore the universe in the liberal spirit he shares with Galaxy Express 999\'s Tetsuro.I\'d like to make it clear that this OVA seems to exist in order to provide some background information on a popular heroine and as such does not bother too much on developing its narrative. There is a troublesome lack of continuity present and it seems like Umino\'s repeated meetings with Emeraldas are just random plot devices created to establish a friendly relationship based on coincidence. All in all the story is not particularly strong but comes off as decent.Animation: 6/10For the first time I got to witness a Leijiverse title with detailed scenery, fluid movement and wonderful character designs. A most welcome delight! Queen Emeraldas applies a few instances of horrible CGI but generally maintains a great and stylistic approach that qualifies to the contemporary standards.Sound: 7/10Emeraldas was apparently deemed awesome enough to get her own theme song and, musical appeal aside, it does match her personality and epic characteristics quite a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is decent but seems to be a lot more timid.As far as voice acting goes, the two protagonists are portrayed in praise-worthy manners and Emeraldas in particular has the virtue of being voiced by the same woman who starred as Oscar from Rose of Versailles.Characters: 7/10Sigh. Assigning a 7 to the ""character section"" of an anime in which one of my favourite characters of fiction resides doesn\'t quite seem right. However, as much as I\'d like to call Queen Emeraldas character-driven, even that term feels strangely out of place. There\'s nothing particularly wrong with the characterization, it\'s just that there isn\'t any in abundance. We get to witness Emeraldas\'s inner feelings; her motives and a past that has shaped her as the cynical heroine she has become. But those who watched Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express already knew those things about her and little of the material is actually new. Then there\'s the modernized Tetsuro and a few diabolic villains that create a diversity that\'s not as amazing as expected.All in all, the characters in this OVA aren\'t bad at all (look at the 7 damnit!) but given that most titles in the Leijiverse seem to be character driven, it certainly doesn\'t reach the standard.Overall: 6/10Despite my harshness I\'d like to emphasize that I greatly enjoyed this title as an opportunity to watch one of my favorite heroines show off in a story that seems to be designed in favor of her awesomeness. It quite accurately falls into the ""Guilty pleasure"" category with a heavy focus on space battles and fencing but still reaches at least mediocre heights of story-telling and disappointing yet sufficient character portraits. Recommended to somewhat initiated Matsumoto fans but might not work quite as well as a gateway drug. a story needs to be told and Queen Emeraldas proves to be no exception.

You could ding the animation for looking dated.That aside, I liked what I saw. She's a mysterious character. We were never going to see 2 hours' worth of an over the shoulder look at her life. It was always going to be her playing off of another character.That said, I liked where this story went. I like that the story wasn't her welcoming a stranger into her ship and into her heart within 2 minutes, or ever. She is heartbroken and it's almost like she's dead already. Her fearlessness in the...face of death and quiet acceptance of what will likely be her death at a pivotal point shows how dark some of the chapters of her life have been, and yet I wouldn't call it dystopian. She helps when she can, she has strong morals and is willing to die for them, and she is gregarious when it is called for. I'd call this a character study from a distance.I think she got the name Pirate Queen Emeraldas because she's presents as evil but she is clearly decent. Her morality is her guiding light, and she persistently walks towards that light. She's a good egg. face of death and quiet acceptance of what will likely be her death at a pivotal point shows how dark some of the chapters of her life have been, and yet I wouldn't call it dystopian.

Shaonu Qianxian: Renxing Xiao Juchang 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42949/Shaonu_Qianxian__Renxing_Xiao_Juchang_2,"[""Girls' Frontline Healing Chapter Season 2!They've added RO635, AK-12, AN-94, Scarecrow, Executioner and Hunter to the cast and the rest of AR Team and Squad 404 return for more shenanigans. The episodes are longer this time around (like 5-6 minutes I believe) and the stories are far more entertaining in my opinion (One of the episodes is about the girls engaging in a race and it was perfection). The art style is the same as before (very cute and precious), Vanguard Sound still does the BGM and all of the JP voice actors from the game return, so everything feels and sound as it...should (especially if you are familiar with the original game). I honestly wouldn't mind if MICA just made a 1:1 adaptation of the game's story but with the chibi style intact, haha.This is an anime for the fans of the game and series, so if you haven't checked it out yet, I recommend you do so.

Shi Fang Wu Sheng,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56981/Shi_Fang_Wu_Sheng,"[""his donghua is an adaptation of novel by the same (Chinese) name. I haven't read the novel so I won't be speaking to how this does as an adaptation.Plot Summary: Wei He, the youngest of 3 siblings, is a sheltered and somewhat naive young man. His family is supported by his eldest sister's reputation as a fierce martial artist of the slums. Believing that their parents are still alive despite their disappearance, his eldest sister regularly goes out on searches to find clues about their whereabouts. Before one of these trips, Wei He has a bad prenomination, prompting him to join his eldest sister. On...this trip, they encounter an accident leading to his sister going missing. Once without their protective shield, he and his second eldest sister are at the mercy of thugs around the slums. Faced with these new harsh realities, Wei He joins a martial arts school in order to become stronger so he can protect his family and continue to search for his parents.Plot and SettingOur MC (implied to be a transmigrator), first starts off as a sheltered and naive young man, who quickly mans up to protect his family once tragedy strikes. The transition is a bit abrupt, but given the condition the world is in, makes sense. While the story and plot are mostly focused on the MC, there is a factional war going on in the background over control of the city, which the MC becomes an unintentional catalyst in escalating the conflict. In regards the the ongoing factional war, it is a bit difficult to understand the web of alliances at first, but as you get furthur into the season, we can get a clearer picture. The highlight of the show is really the MC's growth and character.The setting of this donghua is fairly typical, set in an ancient world during a chaotic time (modeled after ancient China). However, what really stands out is the mature depiction of the world: casual murder, attempted kidnapping, attempted s**ual assault, selling one's children for food, etc are all depicted in the opening episodes. There are also rather gruesome displays and gore, though they tend to tone down some of this (likely for censorship reasons). All of these explicit depictions are quite unusual for donghua.CharactersThe main character of importance is, of course, the MC. He starts off as a bit sheltered and naive, but quickly steps up and grows once he loses his shelter. His growth throughout the season, his compassion for friends, cunning, and ruthlessness towards enemies makes him a compelling and relatable main character. As for the other characters, they have their own unique quirks and traits; there isn't anything that breaks the mold, but they flesh out the world.AnimationThe animation and character modeling is done very well for this donghua. The character models are detailed, reflecting a high budget style, and has the usual xianxia/ancient world type style. The models for characters are both unique and uniform, allowing viewers to easily identify characters and factions. The animation for normal movements is smooth and the choreography for the fights is good, though there are times when there are minor kinks in this fluidity.Final ThoughtsThis donghua was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. The story was engaging and characters likable. There was a greater conspiracy plot that gets a full reveal at the end (it does get hinted at throughout the show if you pay close attention). If you are looking for a cultivation style donghua with a more mature tone and world depiction, this is a highly recommended watch.Score: 8/10 this trip, they encounter an accident leading to his sister going missing. Once without their protective shield, he and his second eldest sister are at the mercy of thugs around the slums.

However, what really stands out is the mature depiction of the world: casual murder, attempted kidnapping, attempted s**ual assault, selling one's children for food, etc are all depicted in the opening episodes. There are also rather gruesome displays and gore, though they tend to tone down some of this (likely for censorship reasons). All of these explicit depictions are quite unusual for donghua.CharactersThe main character of importance is, of course, the MC. He starts off as a bit sheltered and naive, but quickly steps up and grows once he loses his shelter. His growth throughout the season, his compassion for friends, cunning, and ruthlessness towards enemies makes him a compelling and relatable main character. As for the other characters, they have their own unique quirks and traits; there isn't anything that breaks the mold, but they flesh out the world.AnimationThe animation and character modeling is done very well for this donghua. The character models are detailed, reflecting a high budget style, and has the usual xianxia/ancient world type style. The models for characters are both unique and uniform, allowing viewers to easily identify characters and factions. The animation for normal movements is smooth and the choreography for the fights is good, though there are times when there are minor kinks in this fluidity.Final ThoughtsThis donghua was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. The story was engaging and characters likable. There was a greater conspiracy plot that gets a full reveal at the end (it does get hinted at throughout the show if you pay close attention). If you are looking for a cultivation style donghua with a more mature tone and world depiction, this is a highly recommended watch.Score: 8/10""]"
Shutsugeki! Machine Robo Rescue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3098/Shutsugeki_Machine_Robo_Rescue,"[""I think it's good to watch a kodomo, shounen anime even in adulthood, because of two reasons:1. A good shounen anime would remind the adult fan their teenager motivations, and even is they are disappointed in life, they might rethink, what can they do in their life to make the most of it.2. Watching children's animations might bring us back to our childhood. Every time, when I watch an animation for children, I always imagine, if I could watch it as child, or not? Would I offer it to my child, (if I would have) or not?Well, Shutsugeki! Machine Robo Rescue is not the very...best children's anime, but worth to give a try to it.12 children are chosen to the Machine Robo Rescue program. In this program robots and the 12 children work together to save the people from the dangers and disaster. Oozora Taiyou (what an expressive name...) is late from the first training, when he goes for a rescue work with his JETROBO. Every 12 children are approved, and they are separated in 3 groups: Red Wings, Blue Sirens and Yellow Gears, and rescue the people from danger. The story isn't big, there are smaller stories in every episodes. Some episodes were made interesting with the children's background story, but those are only for curiosity, they don't give anything to the main story.The big mistake of the anime is the antagonist itself. I don't know, why is he revealed in about the 40th episode, otherwise, he's really ridiculous. I think, even children can't take him seriously. He just disappeares before the end of the anime. But why if he there? He hasn't any function in the anime.What I really liked in the anime, is the music. I'm a big JAM Project fan, so, I don't need to explain, why I like it. The opening is cute, Kitadani Hiroshi took his lovable childish self into the song, and it makes the opening good to listen. But the ending... is like masterpiece! That's an Endoh Masaaki solo, and as always, he takes seriously this song as well. The title is expressive, it's really like a march. I can imagine Endoh Masaaki as fire colonel, who leads the group with this great song. Anyway I think, Endoh Masaaki is the greatest japanese male singer, and this song confirmed this feeling inside me.So yes... I started to watch this anime because of the JAM Project opening and ending song (I know them for years), but I offer to give a try to this anime.

I could never imagine another ending other...than this. Tatsuya being out of the shadow of his brother and Minami devoted as ever to support him.If there was a nitpick within the movie is that the new characters are not that fleshed out, but acceptable for a 100 minute show.Overall, Touch will be forever in my heart as it reminds me of Brotherly love, Passion, funny skits, and the determination of Minami and Tatsuya to commit to one another as their future rolls to their new chapter. than this.

Warau Salesman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3077/Warau_Salesman,"['Warau Salesman is an episodic show with no real plot, where each episode is its own little story. Every episode has a different protagonist, Moguro\'s client, whose life almost always is ruined in one way or another by the end.One good aspect is how condensed the stories are, never being rushed. This anime does a very good job of presenting a different story in a short time every episode, usually the first 2 or 3 minutes, after which comes Moguro offering the miraculous, too good to be true, solution for his client\'s problems. The problems are realistic and mundane, with a big portion of the...clients being salarymen. A big part of the enjoyment comes from the expectation, each time you begin watching another episode, of seeing in what fucked up way will Moguro ruin someone\'s life. I don\'t recommend this anime to people who get upset at ""mean-spirited"" characters of shows. This one\'s not about justice or retribution. Moguro doesn\'t care if his clients are bad or good people, weak or strong. Many times someone will suffer without having deserved it.Moguro Fukuzou\'s voice acting is great at being both funny and creepy. The character, in appearance, is bizarre-looking compared to the rest, always having the same grinning expression, and his speech is equally distinct.

Essentially, if you have a pessimistic side to you and enjoy dark comedy, you’ll probably get a decent amount of entertainment out of this one. I’ve only been able to find the first season, so this will only be reviewing the first 25 episodes.In Warau Salesman, Every 10-minute episode features a brand new character. The...desires of said character are given to you at the beginning of the episode. Once Moguro appears, he offers a too-good-to-be-true deal for the character. Some characters fall for it right away, others he has to be more persistent with. Rest assured, he closes the deal and you get to see the aftermath of the character’s now-met desires. Depending on how scummy the character it is, the more satisfying Moguro’s wrath becomes. Or in stark contrast, the character doesn’t deserve the treatment at all and you end up feeling pretty sympathetic toward them.It started airing in 1989, so don’t expect too much from the quality of the animation, artwork and sound. I actually like the old school style, so this was a big plus for me. The thing I liked the most in the artwork were the scenes focusing on the city itself, as it often gives a polluted and sleazy feel to the show. You would also expect the new character’s personalities to bleed into each other and all be the same, but I was impressed that they were able to give new characters a personality of their own for each episode.Whenever I was having a bad day, I turned an episode of this on and it instantly made me appreciate my life again which is what I liked most about it. Though it has comedic elements, there are some pretty sad and relatable characters within the show. You are bound to relate to at least one of them if you watch long enough. It's an episodic show, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. Warau Salesman does what it does very well, so you are bound to enjoy the rest of it if you enjoy the first episode.Overall this is a great show if you are having one of those irritable days where you are annoyed by everything and everyone. I got a good amount of enjoyment of it in that respect.

I don\'t know why people always deem it as something else. But lets start at the beginning.The show is about a mysterious salesman, Moguro Fukuzou, who deals in human souls (the literal japanese translation is ""kokorou"" which means heart, but its symbolic for souls). He offers people a splendid deal that fits their deepest desires perfectly and that they won\'t possibly refuse. All free of charge of course. However, Moguro has always one...condition that he makes clear to his clients. If the client breaks that condition, the whole deal is void and Moguro can collect his soul (visualized by basically fucking up his former clients life). Now here is where the whole horror and also social commentary comes in. Moguro himself is of course not a normal salesman yet alone a normal human being. His true origins are never made really clear throughout the whole series, but its safe to say that he is some sort of a devils advocat if not the devil himself. He always hangs in a bar called ""Demon Nest"" so that basically covers that. And just like some demons Moguro,  in some way, has to be invited by the people. If the client is on the hook and agrees to Mogurus terms, from that point on Moguru is in his life for good watching him at all times without being noticed (except if he wants to be noticed). Now why would anybody break a good deal that last forever as long as one tiny condition won\'t get violated? Because human beings are selfish, ignorant and greedy scum who always want more! You give them the little pinky and they take the whole hand! And that is the premise of this show and Moguros transactions. He knows of that selfish nature and feasts upon it. He knows eventually every last one of his human clients will turn into a greedy and dishonest pig, so he can collect his souls in peace.While the first episodes are very tame in regards of violence, some of the later episodes turn out to be quite gorey. But despite all the gore and deep commentary, Warau Salesman is still a funny comedy show with some great humor in it. Not least due to Moguros crazy monologues and self awareness. The events in each episode make up for great situation comedy as well.If you want sophisticated and social critical, yet dark, crazy and unpredictable comedy this is the show for you. I definitely recommand it! condition that he makes clear to his clients.

I definitely recommand it!', '""The World is full of lonely men and women, both young and old. I\'m here to fill the gaps of your lonely souls. Completely free of charge I might add. A satisfied costumer is the only compensation I desire.""-Warau Salesman opening line.Warau Salesman is a work by the legendary duo Fujiko Fujio, creators of classics such as Doraemon and Ninja Hattori-kun. The series follows Fukuzo Moguro, a salesman with a permanent grim smile that offers his services to struggling citizens, with quite disastrous results. Like the aforementioned works, Warau is an episodic anime with each one being 10 min in duration....What makes this series stand out from Fujiko\'s catalog is the mature overtones of this work, deviating from the childlike nature of their most famous works, Warau Salesman\'s dark comedic elements come from the characters\'s misfortune and the unreal situations that they experience under Fukuzo\'s guidance, often ending up with their lives ruined.Every episode is unrelated and they follow a very simple formula: There\'s a citizen with a problem, (work, family, love, boredom, etc...) Fukuzo approaches them, hands a business card and convinces them he has a solution, it turns out that solution is either quite extreme or Fukuzo himself sabotages the situation and the poor citizen gets screwed. All the development is done within those 10 minutes and that\'s it.There isn\'t any kind of deep lesson to be learned other than the usual ""be careful what you wish for"", ""greed is bad"", that sort of thing, in fact, one of the things that surprised me the most is the fact that most of the people are quite innocent and end up traumatized for life. I personally advise not to question his methods as Fukuzo is inhumanly resourceful and preforms quite amazing feats sometimes so just assume he is some kind of demon and just go with the flow. Because of this, the best way to enjoy the series is to simply to go in with the mentality that you\'re going to get a laugh through someone else\'s misfortune. If this kind of comedy is not your thing or you don\'t enjoy episodic anime maybe this is not for you.The art is fairly old school with very simple character designs and everyone seems fairly short in height as if they all suffer from Dwarfism, with some of them ending up looking the same. This is a problem that some old Anime/Manga have. Personally, I grew up watching Doreamon and Ninja Hattori and it\'s quite nostalgic seeing those designs again. Also, the character\'s names are quite often related to the theme of the episode as their names are written with the Kanji for ""Clumsy"" or ""Unlucky"" for example, this is something that a normal viewer would not notice unless they are fluent in Japanese or in my case, having the translators pointing it out on the subtitles.The music is handled by Tanaka Kouhei who is well known for the One Piece soundtrack and it fits the mood quite well though don\'t expect to hear orchestral music of Wagnerian proportions. It is compromised mostly of Orchestral and Jazz pieces and some incidental music well arranged for the situations presented, the pieces that play during Fukuzo\'s opening lines are short but they set the mood for the anime very well, the Demon\'s Nest, a pub where Fukuzo takes some of his clients has a very good Cool Jazz piece that gives the scene that 1950\'s/60\'s warm and dirty feel.Overall, I believe that your enjoyment of the series depends mostly on your personal taste and sensibility in regards to humor and plot, if you like old school anime and you are having a bad day, I\'m sure you\'ll get a good laugh or two from this one, plus each episode is 10 minutes long so you can watch it even on lunch break. If you are looking for a new perspective on the universe and your own existence I believe you won\'t get that experience from this series.

I love this series, and if your looking for anything a bit dark this is for you. <3"", ""Story:  6warou salesman is about Fukuzou Moguro who is a salesman who tries to give people they want for free (without money) because he  has good motives as he cares about wanting to give them what they want as he thinks he is doing something good.Usually, he stretches the situations so much he really ends up hurting the majority of his clients even though some episodes those clients deserved this but most of the times they didn't.Each episode is a different story featuring different involving people.He either finds by a coincidence the people he decides he wants to help or by picking them...up.My main problem is that after some point the cases and the messages are a bit similarso it becomes a bit repetitive after some point which it makes sense  because for how long are they gonna keep  writing something that had entirely new different messages to give to the watchers of the anime  and to be honest it's a quite predictable once you get to know what is going on you know that the client of this guy is gonna get either in some jail or hospital or get divorced.Art 3The art style is quite different from the standard approaching the faces are looking a bit goofy  though even for the 89 eraSound: 3Well nothing specialCharacter: 2Well we only know his motives but other than that from the 10 episodes i saw nothing else it has  known  because each episode is different  and the focus is more on the clients he decides to take care of  the episodes are focusing more on the clients than himself so i am gonna give him a 3Enjoyment 4Well the humour is  like black comedy if you like black comedy and psychology well  you may like it and it focus is morals, desiresOverall 4  and this is not a random score but based on the multiplication from all of the categories with the exception of the overall category and then division by 5 that are the main categories and while the score went 3.6 since it's above 3.5 i gave it a 0,5 bonus to get to 4  since it's above 3,5 you know right?Well if you are the type of guy who will see behind the 1rst picture  then it's a not half bad anime i would say at least it  tries to give hidden messages to those who watch it and the messages are different since each episode  is an entirely different story and it is not around a story pattern that  the story progresses around it like most stories. up.My main problem is that after some point the cases and the messages are a bit similarso it becomes a bit repetitive after some point which it makes sense  because for how long are they gonna keep  writing something that had entirely new different messages to give to the watchers of the anime  and to be honest it's a quite predictable once you get to know what is going on you know that the client of this guy is gonna get either in some jail or hospital or get divorced.Art 3The art style is quite different from the standard approaching the faces are looking a bit goofy  though even for the 89 eraSound: 3Well nothing specialCharacter: 2Well we only know his motives but other than that from the 10 episodes i saw nothing else it has  known  because each episode is different  and the focus is more on the clients he decides to take care of  the episodes are focusing more on the clients than himself so i am gonna give him a 3Enjoyment 4Well the humour is  like black comedy if you like black comedy and psychology well  you may like it and it focus is morals, desiresOverall 4  and this is not a random score but based on the multiplication from all of the categories with the exception of the overall category and then division by 5 that are the main categories and while the score went 3.6 since it's above 3.5 i gave it a 0,5 bonus to get to 4  since it's above 3,5 you know right?Well if you are the type of guy who will see behind the 1rst picture  then it's a not half bad anime i would say at least it  tries to give hidden messages to those who watch it and the messages are different since each episode  is an entirely different story and it is not around a story pattern that  the story progresses around it like most stories.""]"
Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33023/Touken_Ranbu__Hanamaru,"[""Protip: don't start watching this if you don't know anything about touken ranbu.Protip2: watch it immediately if you're a saniwaReason? In short, you're most probably not going to enjoy it. In long, this anime obviously assumes that the watcher is familiar with either the characters or the concept of tkrb. It is too short to properly explain anything and half of each episode is dedicated to a different character. Needless to say, character development in ten minutes? I don't think so.But the thing is, I've played the game ever since it came out so all the swords are very dear to me. Seeing them being...animated like this made them more tangible for my smol saniwa heart. I recommend it to all fellow saniwas out there because this anime is seriously so heartwarming. (I hope you like Yasu-kun though bc he gets lots of spotlight lolol.) It gives more insight into the personalities and bonds of the swords, it even reveals some facts about them that you may not have known on beforehand! Anyway, it gets a 10/10 from me. I love my swords. animated like this made them more tangible for my smol saniwa heart. I recommend it to all fellow saniwas out there because this anime is seriously so heartwarming.

And I could say that thats the problem right now.Firstly, just play the game. Ive been hearing a lot of complaints and whining like, ""omg is this yaoi"" ""where is the time travelling"" ""why...are there so many characters"" ""ugh fujoshi bait again"" ""the fight scenes suck"" ""this anime isnt funny at all, the comedy is so forced"" blah blah blah blah gibberish.Secondly, the thing is, this anime was made specially for us saniwas, those who have played the game, and we love this anime from the bottom of our heart. We get every joke the characters make, their personalities, the places they go to, the story of each episode...etc. Why? Cuz we played the goddamn awesome game.Thirdly, If youve never played the game, then watching the anime will definitley be boring as flour. For example, you will have no idea what the characters are making jokes of, you will have no idea what a tantou or yari is, why the small kiddos are missing their dear ichi-nii, oh well you probably wont know who ichi-nii is anyway, and why the people who played the game love this anime so much, etc etc etcIf you dont bother to play the game, dont bother to watch the anime. That way, there will be less hate and negativity. Well, you dont have to play the game if you really dont want to, but the anime may be really bland to you though, just dont hate on it. (the game is really really really great, made me cry cuz its been a year and I still dont have jiji)Lastly, all the swords in this anime (and in the game), are beautiful and precious as hell , and I love them all.Thank you and goodbyeeeeeeeeeee :))))))) are there so many characters"" ""ugh fujoshi bait again"" ""the fight scenes suck"" ""this anime isnt funny at all, the comedy is so forced"" blah blah blah blah gibberish.Secondly, the thing is, this anime was made specially for us saniwas, those who have played the game, and we love this anime from the bottom of our heart.

So this review is based entirely on the anime. I strongly believe that if you need knowledge of the source material in order to enjoy an anime, then it has failed to be a good adaptation.However, despite not playing the game, I still really enjoyed Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru.I learned a term recently, that I think really describes Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru. ""Cute boys doing cute things."" Much like K On! is a ""cute girls doing cute things"" type of show. The plot of Hanamaru is not important, and never was meant to be.Hanamaru is meant to be pure...fluff, with wacky scenarios happening in every episode. The plot (if you can call it that), takes a back seat to the characters, and there are a lot of them.The characters are so vast, and fun, with their own unique personalities. And the way they work off each other is always really entertaining. Unfortunately, with so little episodes and so many characters, there were many characters that had very little screen time. Characters that I ended up really liking had very little focus.Now, on to the animation. The animation was beautiful at times, but still average. The slapstick was generic.I can say the same thing about the music, with the exception of the opening song. Hanamaru Biyori is so damn catchy I cannot get it out of my head. Other than that, the music wasn\'t bad per se, but I\'m not exactly going to be hunting down the OST to listen to more of it. It did it\'s job, but is mostly forgettable.In my opinion, Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru is more of a light, fluffy appetizer to hold us over until ufotable\'s Touken Ranbu airs later this year.In conclusion, if you want to watch cute anime boys doing cute stuff, then I think you will enjoy Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, regardless whether or not you\'ve played the game. fluff, with wacky scenarios happening in every episode.

On the contrary, they seek action, romance, violence etc.It may be based on history, but you don't really need to know anything,it's very easy to follow.There is gentle comedy going on, pretty often, and it makes you laugh because of the naive, sweet humor.The art is simple but beautiful, there is no intense drama or tension, and the script is minimalistic and relaxing.I am impressed by the huge number of characters, and...it's worth to be mentioned, they are male-ALL OF EM.Everyone has their own unique personality, and it's expressed by their clothes, hairstyle, makeup etc. I really liked that.Another thing I found extremely cute and touching, is the faith these sword-characters have in their master, and the strong bonds of friendship they share.Of course, there is no way someone remembering all of the characters, I think there are proximately 50 of em-YEAH :')You should watch it if you're lookin for sth peaceful, calm and relaxing. it's worth to be mentioned, they are male-ALL OF EM.Everyone has their own unique personality, and it's expressed by their clothes, hairstyle, makeup etc. I really liked that.Another thing I found extremely cute and touching, is the faith these sword-characters have in their master, and the strong bonds of friendship they share.Of course, there is no way someone remembering all of the characters, I think there are proximately 50 of em-YEAH :')You should watch it if you're lookin for sth peaceful, calm and relaxing."", ""NOTE : my first review - English is not my mother language =)Story :On contrary to what I expected I really love this anime .

I also love their daily life , how their personalities are exactly the same from the game, and how they really care about their master. I get really excited when a new sword come and their reaction towards it. I...enjoy every episode i watch ~Art :The art is not that good but not that bad either.

I just wanted to make this clear: just because it is an adaptation of a game, it doesn't mean it has to be shitty for newcomers who watches it without having played the game.  Let me repeat: it shouldn't be necessary to play the game to enjoy the show.  Don't try to pretend that the show delivers anything well.The show is quite pathetic in appealing to the people who haven't played the game in several ways.  They don't develop any characters; they are only busy adding more to the plot.  I can understand that this...happened because it was aimed at the people who played the game.  But it still doesn't change the fact that it fails to develop characters.The plot is laughable, the animation quality is mediocre and there are too many things wrong with it.  But hell, I love it.

This anime is for those who already knew who the characters are, what their backgrounds are, and what they are like. Really, stop whining and just start playing the game first. It really is an addicting game and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!So, moving on. The art is really good though some may find the animation of the fight scenes not as great as the others. The soundtracks are enjoyable, and I love the concept of each characters that are focused...on a specific episode will sing the ending song. As of now I have all the songs used in the anime and I love each of them. The characters are really like what they are portrayed in the game, which I find really touching.

KA KA KA!!!', ""I'm just going to start off by saying that I have never played the game this is based off of and probably never will. If you are in the same boat, then I would recommend that you don't even try to watch this. I honestly would have dropped it pretty early on if I didn't need to complete it for a MAL challenge. It's obvious that this show was made solely for fans of the game and they don't really even try to make it appealing to other viewers. As a newcomer to the franchise, these are my thoughts of the show based solely on...it being an anime rather than an adaptation of a video game.First of all, don't be fooled by the underlying plot of these swords being animated to fight an organization bent on changing history because the anime doesn't really focus on that most of the time. Instead, the series is pretty much centered around the characters and their interactions with each other in the citadel. Throughout the series, you will constantly see the same exact plot points being recycled such as introducing new characters, forging bonds between characters, and dealing with internal struggles of characters. It's kind of obvious once you know the background of the series that the whole point of doing this is to give fans the chance to see their favorite characters stirring up emotions inside of them. However, without that excitement of seeing someone you know that you can only get from previously playing the game, the cycle becomes repetitive and boring after awhile. On top of that, they introduce like 50 different characters in the span of the series, so it is hard to keep track of them all without having prior exposure to them. By having so many characters, I felt a lot of the shows attempts to deal with internal struggles fell flat because it's really hard to be impacted by a scene involving a character you are still trying to figure out the identity of. I will admit that there were maybe 2 times where a scene involving a character actually made me feel something, but most of the time attempts to make me sympathize with them were unsuccessful and even the times I did feel something I get the impression it didn't impact me as much as it was supposed to. This series is definitely built around character interactions, so not developing characters before emotional moments and cycling through so many of them in such a short amount of time because you assume the viewer already has an understanding of them through the game is definitely the fatal flaw in this anime for viewers who haven't played it.Honestly, I was just bored most of the time watching this series and you probably will be too if you haven't played the game. I understand that the anime would have been a lot better if i did play it and this may even be considered a masterpiece if you view it as an addition to the franchise rather than as an adaptation of the game. However, I don't think you should have to delve into a game in order for an anime to be good because if a show is good it should be able to stand on its own. Yeah, the series probably was more successful pandering solely to fans of the game considering it's getting a second season, but as far as being a stand alone anime, it is pretty bad in my opinion. The whole aspect drawing viewers into the series is their connections to characters from the game, so without that, there really isn't too much about the anime that keeps you interested. If you really want to watch this then do yourself a favor and play the game first. Based on the numerous top rated 10 reviews I've seen on this show's MAL page, it may be worth the time and effort. However, if you don't want to do that, then don't even bother watching this because you will probably just continuously lower the score to an anime that wasn't even meant for you to begin with. it being an anime rather than an adaptation of a video game.First of all, don't be fooled by the underlying plot of these swords being animated to fight an organization bent on changing history because the anime doesn't really focus on that most of the time.

Epic plotline,  action battle, characters developent?? If you want to get that, i think you shouldn\'t try this series since this anime had none with that or at least very decent amount.Story :Story is almost nothing.The synopsis says :""The ""historical revisionists"" have begun attacks on the past...in their plot to change history. And The Saniwa, who have been charged with protecting history, can imbue life into objects, and has the ability to bring famous historical swords to life as male warriors"" . But, in reality this show are mostly taken place in one place : ""the fortress"". Then, the majority things you\'re  got here is Slice of Life-comedy feeling. I saw there\'re nothing different with other common SoL anime unless it\'s not filled with any single girl. And you will find some historical things on Japan history and they combined it with some action and drama, but it\'s decent.Art and Animation:About the art, they are doing good. The drawing, colouring, shadowing background, characters drawing, and enviroment looks suitable with this anime, not too bright as Moe anime and not too dark like Death Note. Something not good is when they drawing in action battle. After the drawing animated, it looks too fast to me but i know they put the effort in other aspect (SoL aspect). This is made the battle is mediocre and easily to forgot. About the animation , they\'re just look given standard animation with about 5-14 fps and without any single CGI.Sound :The sound in this show is mostly relaxed (they used relaxed classic Japanese music) in peace scene at the fortress while the SoL-comedy happened. And on the serious scene, the sound are pretty dramatic and with classic japanese music too. So this added more atmosphere at the scene itself. The insert song is so catchly, combined with classic Japanese music (classic Japanese guitar and flute) and modern music (drums) makes it worth to hear in my every week watching this show and i didn\'t skipped it. Then the attractive animation while the insert song is makes this much better. And plus they put the most of effort in the 11 different ending song! with different characters for each ending. It\'s give huge positive effect to me because i\'m too cared about the insert and the ending song on an animeCharacter :This part are the reason why this anime are limited for fans of the game. They put much characters in this anime (about 45 characters with different trait and personality). It\'s almost impossible to remember at least the name of each characters if you don\'t play the game. In other hand, you must be easily to remember all characters in this anime with their trait and personality in one piece if you play the game. In addition, no female chara here that make this show feel sour and there are few male characters that looks like female (commonly called trap). Which some people doesn\'t like that.Enjoyement :I came to this show simply because it adapted by Doga Kobo. Their SoL-Comedy that they make are always amusing me. I rated 7/10 on this anime (Fine) if it based for my enjoyement.Overall :Based on my review above, i\'d give this show 6/10 (Average) (5,92)Added :In conclusion, this anime are for fans of the game only. If you\'re try hard or masochist users like me (not played the game but still watching this), this show are recommended for you . in their plot to change history.

If you\'re try hard or masochist users like me (not played the game but still watching this), this show are recommended for you .', 'Still only watched for 5 episodes, so my opinions may change later on.If you guys watched Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru simply because ""Hey, there is a time travel element on it! Might be interesting to watch!"", then don\'t.Remember, they already repeated this line in each episode and even in their web:""This anime is about a certain Citadel and certain Sword Warriors in the cheerful daily lives.""So, non-Touken Ranbu fans will probably have a hard time liking it.Story: 8Well, personally up until now I find the story not too bad. Being a daily lives anime, it doesn\'t have any specific goals or anything. But I think...the story is focusing on how Yamatonokami and Kashuu develop as a person and as a sword, with the help of the others around them and with the happenings around them.Art: 9I\'m glad that Doga Kobo does not destroy the original character design. That\'s all. The 3D CGs in the endings are especially beautiful.Sound: 6Sorry, but I found the music unmemorable, except for the Citadel BGM (since it always plays in the game)Character: 9Each sword have their own personality and emotions, and I\'m glad that it does not differ much from the game itself. However, since there are too much characters (originally it is around 50 or more), it might be hard to go in-depth with them, if we only have 12 episodes. Thus, I personally think Doga Kobo will focus on Kashuu\'s and Yamatonokami\'s character development since they are the protagonists.Enjoyment: 9I find this anime enjoyable, really do. I look forward to every episode in order to find out who will come next.Overall: 8I rate this anime 8 overall. So will I recommend it: Yes, if you are a Touken Ranbu fan! For those who don\'t know Touken Ranbu, it might be best to know about it firsthand before watching. You don\'t have to play the game, but at least know their personality and gags so you won\'t be so confused in the anime.That\'s all and thanks! the story is focusing on how Yamatonokami and Kashuu develop as a person and as a sword, with the help of the others around them and with the happenings around them.Art: 9I\'m glad that Doga Kobo does not destroy the original character design. That\'s all. The 3D CGs in the endings are especially beautiful.Sound: 6Sorry, but I found the music unmemorable, except for the Citadel BGM (since it always plays in the game)Character: 9Each sword have their own personality and emotions, and I\'m glad that it does not differ much from the game itself. However, since there are too much characters (originally it is around 50 or more), it might be hard to go in-depth with them, if we only have 12 episodes. Thus, I personally think Doga Kobo will focus on Kashuu\'s and Yamatonokami\'s character development since they are the protagonists.Enjoyment: 9I find this anime enjoyable, really do. I look forward to every episode in order to find out who will come next.Overall: 8I rate this anime 8 overall. So will I recommend it: Yes, if you are a Touken Ranbu fan!

Most of the 20 minute episodes are divided into two 10 minute segments focusing on different characters or a different topic in the show and the show itself does NOT focus on the sharp action and battles that the game can speak...for, instead this anime serves as a forerunner to the story based anime ""Touken Ranbu"" coming next year. It focuses very heavily on characters and interactions, and it\'s good that the characters keep some of their quirks from the game, giving fans a lot to live for.The art style is pleasant and mediated which is good to see as the art in the actual Touken Ranbu game is drawn by over a dozen different artists due to the sheer number of characters the game boasts. The animation is smooth for the most part and doesn\'t cut corners and I think that the show makes great use of the contained Citadel setting that the swords live in.In terms of story, it does not have a story and although many may complain about this aspect it even says in the intro that it is based around the lives of ""A certain group of swords who live in a certain citadel"". Although the recurring issue of Yasusada\'s strength complex in comparison to Kashuu is interesting and really the only solid recurring plot point the anime can stand for.IN CONCLUSION:This anime should be watched by the fans as it was created for the fans-!! It is not a piece to be analytically picked apart [although i could do that for the characters i\'ll refrain from it]. It is a great starting point for someone who wants to get into the game, and the show even picked up my extinguished passion for sword boys!!-Clio for, instead this anime serves as a forerunner to the story based anime ""Touken Ranbu"" coming next year.

I'm so glad the adaptation turned out so well and it made me miss all the guys since I don't have as much time to play anymore but all episodes give me so much feels, it is really heartwarming. Both the opening as well as the ending(s) are absolutely beautiful and I can't wait for the OST release. All in all I'm super happy, makes my Sundays so much better after a rough day. I'm already excited for the other adaptation next year,...hopefully it will be done with as much love as this one! hopefully it will be done with as much love as this one!"", 'Okay I get why this anime has such a low overall score, the reason is because many people bash these kind of shows for now reason. If it isn\'t about cute lolis or a dumb main male character who has a harem of 20 big boob ladies then the majority of the anime community will bash it because they are just salty. Also most people don\'t understand that this anime is adapted from a game!!! And it did an extremely good job adapting from that game!! So simple try playing the game before watching this you will get more enjoyment out of it promise! Also...I watched this anime before playing the game because I was interested in Touken Rambu  I just didn\'t play it yet, but then after playing the game for awhile I cam back and re-watched the whole series and enjoyed it even more!Story 9/10The anime did a good job adapting this story because the story in the game is a bit vague unless you get special cut scenes in the game with certain swords talking to each other. I also know that the anime didn\'t have much story but it also was mainly a slice of life/ comedy/ ""cute show"" and it did a good job.Art 8/10The art could have been better but for a show like this the art was pretty well done. Also I am hoping the show will look even better when season two comes out. But the shows animation fit the show well and each character design was pretty accurately portrayed.Sound 8/10In terms of sounds the bgms were not bad, but I love that there are character songs because each ending is done by a different character and the voice actors did awesome jobs singing.Character 9/10Each character felt like they had a personality, and each character was colorful and distinct. The show also focused on each character for a little bit some more than others though.Enjoyment 10/10I loved this show and I love touken ranbu as a series, so I got a lot of enjoyment out of this cute/comedy show with tiny bits of actions here and there.Overall 9/10Everything balanced out for a 9/10 for me I watched this anime before playing the game because I was interested in Touken Rambu  I just didn\'t play it yet, but then after playing the game for awhile I cam back and re-watched the whole series and enjoyed it even more!Story 9/10The anime did a good job adapting this story because the story in the game is a bit vague unless you get special cut scenes in the game with certain swords talking to each other.

You just gotta admit that you are not the target audience of this anime. And yes, anime is allowed to have a specific target audience. A good anime does not have to please everyone.Why do I say this series is a ""gift"" to the game players? Because if you have ever played this game,...you\'d quickly realize that the gameplay is quite boring and is totally free-to-play. So, how does the company keep the players interested and how do they make money out of this? They mostly gain profit by selling merchandise and by selling tickets for musical and stage adaptation live shows of the game. This anime series is really just another way for them to please the fans, to keep them interested in this game and get them attached to the touken danshi (sword-boys).All that being said, I can review that me as a game player, I am incredibly pleased by this anime. I love how each small story reveals different sides of the touken danshi as well as their relationship with each other. Every time I feel tired from the game, I will re-watch the whole series and I immediately gain motivation. The enjoyment is 10/10! Yes, I have watched this series for over 5 times already! you\'d quickly realize that the gameplay is quite boring and is totally free-to-play.

At the beginning, I found it confusing but after looking into the details and plot of the game it is based off, it was easy to understand the gist of it. Touken Ranbu Hanamaru focuses on the daily lives of a bunch of sword boys and how they interact with each other. This anime just shows the viewers what happens in their daily lives - something not seen much in the game.The amount of characters and trying to remember all of their names was a challenge though, as most has long and complicated names, but after...some time, you could basically recognise the character anywhere due to their unique characteristics.The music was nice and though it was not the most memorable, it was still recognisable. The art style, however was outstanding. Most anime character designs are simple so it would not take too long to draw but there is a lot of detail and effort put into designs, especially being able to have scenes where the characters are in their intricately designed battle gear.The anime was funny and had many moments where you could just laugh at the characters getting up to no good or just generally doing their own thing. Besides being just a slice of life comedy, there are some action parts like battles and serious moments.There is a lot of character development and history behind the characters that may not be explained in the game and it is commendable that it is done in such a short series. The episodes are split up into two parts and showcases the different antics of characters which gives them a fair amount of screen time rather than a few seconds and the rest to the main character, however, the main character does get more time but that is to be expected.The anime does need some knowledge of some important Japanese historical figures and events but other than that and the idea of the actual plot in the game, this anime can be easily understood and enjoyable. some time, you could basically recognise the character anywhere due to their unique characteristics.The music was nice and though it was not the most memorable, it was still recognisable.

Also very impressed the creators made an awesome anime from a game, a good if unconventional reason to be impressed with something.The series greatest strength are the many characters of which I'm sure people will like based on looks, oh and there's awesome fight scenes too, what's not to love.Very good interactions as well, I assume they're based on the game so some people have their own groups but still cool seeing which people in different era's interact, overall has a real nice vibe about it which is always handy in an anime....There was also a crazy blue duck/bird/thing with human teeth for some inexplicable reason which was funny.

Especially the ones that was sung by Kiyomitsu - Yasusada and Iwatooshi - Imanotsurugi. I'd like to buy the CDs!!

SPOILERS AHEAD: When he saw his master in episode 11 OMG it was what I was craving. LET MY SAD BOYS BE SAD show us these amazing emotions!!!

They are funny and they love their master (and former master) so much.I also got excited with sword warriors related to Shinsengumi (After all, I'm a Hakuouki fan... haha!).Lastly, this anime might be helpful for those who want to watch Katsugeki Touken Ranbu... I mean, to...know the characters better and the bond between all the sword warriors. know the characters better and the bond between all the sword warriors."", 'Okay… I’m reviewing this now while finally playing the game.Initially when this came out, I hadn’t played the game. My encounter with the franchise started with my Twitter timeline being plastered with beautiful character fan art (mainly Munechika and Kogetsunemaru) and eventually collecting the nendoroids (starting with Kiyomitsu). I was particularly drawn to the designs and aesthetic, of course with the ikemen theme as well, so I wanted to get acquainted with any bit of the franchise I could. Then, Hanamaru came out. It was a bit confusing because there are a LOT of characters that I had to remember. Having watched this season...3 times through the last few years and now playing the English release of the game, I think I can write a review on it now.Story: 6I liked the slice-of-life angle before, but now I can really appreciate it. It was interesting seeing what new character would join the citadel in show and now I get excited when I find them myself in the game. Naturally, the anime exists to promote the game so it isn’t particularly “deep” or anything, it’s not too different from the games premise of eliminating threats to history. The main swords (Okita’s Kiyomitsu and Yamatonokami) have their own challenges they must overcome and that’s what the story mainly follows, in addition to some other swords here and there. It’s not impressive but again, I appreciate it. I actually do love the way the sword danshi express whatever feelings they have for their previous masters. It’s an interesting concept on its own, factoring in real historical events and people.Art: 7Very visually pleasing. Designs are the same and the backgrounds are great. There are moments in a fight where we get the glorious shot of the character slaying the enemy and the frame is decorated with patterns and symbols, and the characters’ pose is a callback to their art in the game. However, the animation quality does suffer sometimes and becomes painfully average both in and out of battle. Hurts when you think about how epic a lot of it really could have been.Sound: 6In the moment, the soundtrack is nice to hear but even I can’t readily remember  any single track that stood out after re watching this show so many times. The OP is a banger, easily the most memorable. Some of the EDs are fun too.Character: 7I really enjoy the characters. Their interactions with each other (which wouldn’t ever be possible outside of this series) are the reason why this is one of my favorite shows to keep watching. There are so many that there’s usually been something I didn’t pick up on the previous time. However, because there’s so many, there isn’t a whole lot of development (if that’s what you’re looking for) for most of them because they may not have an episode dedicated to them, they may just have a few minutes on screen.Enjoyment: 10Max enjoyment. I’ve just come to really enjoy the heck out of this series, so much so that I hope it keeps going, even as a spin-off. It wasn’t what it could have been here but I hope that some day, it gets another chance to be.Overall: 7It’s a pretty fun show to just turn on and just experience, whether you’ve played the game or not. There are some things that make more sense when you’ve played and things that go unanswered (because game) but they really don’t detract from overall watchability like you’d think they would. If you want something deep and thought provoking, go look somewhere else but if you want a lighthearted good time with a sprinkle of drama, give it a try. 3 times through the last few years and now playing the English release of the game, I think I can write a review on it now.Story: 6I liked the slice-of-life angle before, but now I can really appreciate it.

Toaru Majutsu no Index III,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36432/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_III,"[""“Disappointment is a sort of bankruptcy – the bankruptcy of a soul that expends too much in hope and expectation”. – Eric HofferWatching Index Season III is like procrastinating a school project where hope seems lost with you clinging onto a tiny bit of hope that somehow, someway, everything may be ok. I began watching Index since 2011 and got into the light novels around 2014. While the first two seasons certainly had its share of flaws, both series managed to capture a good deal of concepts that I applauded for. It’s not easy to craft a story with so many characters, conflicts, and intersecting...storylines altogether in a complex system of magic and science. Here we are in 2018-2019, and we are gifted for the long anticipated third season. And with my sincere and deepest regret, I proclaim Index III as a disgraceful abomination.I remember watching some of the Dengeki Festival events in the past few years. Every time, it seems we are so close to the Index Season 3 announcement, it ends up with a tease of “please, just wait a little bit longer!” The long wait ended on September 30, 2017. I jumped in joy realizing that the dream came true and we are finally getting a continuation. It didn’t take long for the show to announce its airing date either just a few months later. Flash forward to Fall 2018 and here we are, the first episode of Index III. What aired on TV seemed like a miracle at the time with many familiar gimmicks. We are reintroduced to level 0 Esper, Touma where he is still unlucky as ever. After getting bitten by Index and running into a slew of misadventures with other characters, it seems the show had a flow going. It also didn’t take long for an ominous feeling to settle in with the realization that the God’s Right Seat are on the move. In fact, the first few episodes covers Touma clashing against God’s Right Seat member Terra of the Left with some unlikely allies. (such as the towel girl Itsuwa) More importantly, we also learn that Touma is suffering from a case of amnesia. As a recurring trend, girls like Itsuwa gets their fair share of screen time when it comes fan service. Indeed, these are just a few elements you’ll get have to get used to throughout the third season. But unfortunately, Index III quickly began to wore itself out.If you recall from the previous season, Academy City is well known for its darker storytelling when it involves espers and its underworld activities. The first season and even its spinoff Railgun had level 5 esper Accelerator undergo an experiment project known as  the Level 6 Shift Project where he would have to kill 20,000 Misaka Mikoto clones to become level 6. Of course, that project never reached completion thanks to the intervention of Touma. My point for bringing this up is because in this season, we are introduced to new forms of esper conflicts. As a show with an expansive cast of characters, the third season decided to set 5 different factions in a plot known as the “Battle Royale Arc”. This was actually one of my favorite arcs in the light novels but the anime adaptation made my stomach sink upon seeing how they treated this. Make no mistake, if you are an anime only viewer, confusion will be a common thought. Once again, Accelerator becomes a prominent character in this arc due to his status as the strongest level 5 Esper. Hamazura Shiage is upgraded as a protagonist while we are also shown with other familiar characters such as ITEM (if you’ve seen Railgun Season 2). The newer characters introduced includes Level 5 esper Kakine Teitoku, Teshio Megumim, and the Professor. The big problem? All of these characters are little more like actors in a poorly constructed script. For whatever reason, the directors thought it would be a good idea to cram such an important arc into a mere set of just 4 episodes. Once I realized this, it became immediately obvious that the producers had little intention to make an impact of its story or characters. Because let’s face it, there’s far too many characters to get invested into in the Battle Royal arc. There’s also too much going on that puts you into a state of confusion. At the apex of this arc, we have two of the strongest espers clashing against each other but the outcome lacked depth and instead replaced with endless screaming of pure absurdity. It felt like these entire few episodes limited what potential it could have been. Even with certain deaths of several characters, I felt nothing for them. In essence, what could have been one of the most memorable plot in the franchise turned into a depressing fallout of rushed execution and poor story craftsmanship.Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there.At this point, we’re around a third of the show and I had to put down my thoughts and wonder how long this would last. Indeed, the next arc had me worried although to my delight, Acqua of the Back had probably the most consistent arc in this season. Perhaps this is because the anime only had one volume to work (Volume 16) so locking the arc to three episodes is actually consistent. Nonetheless, we are shown more conflict against the God’s Right Seat. Kaori Kanazaki also makes a big return from the previous seasons although she’s given more of a role as a combatant. The purpose of this arc wasn’t made entirely clear although it suggests that Touma would have some significant role in the upcoming struggle with the God’s Right Seat. Nonetheless, we can’t forget that Touma is a prominent character regardless how you feel about him. Ironically, titular Index remains mostly in the background despite having a significant role in the previous seasons. Here, she lost a lot of relevance and is even absent for quite a bit during the first half of the show.With the British Royal Family arc that followed, the anime again suffers problems with pacing and many characters stuffed together in one place. Featuring new characters such as the United Kingdom Princess Carissa, it will really make us wonder how Touma fits in all of this. The British Royal arc basically drops him into the magic side of the story without emphasizing its main purpose. Meanwhile, the plot twists didn’t feel meanginful even with some of the characters face-heel turns. Index actually becomes somewhat more relevant although I didn’t feel her role as nearly as memorable as the first two seasons. So in essence, the anime could have done more to capitalize itself by explaining more as everything is too frantic to absorb.Honestly, if you made it this far into the third season, I have to applaud you. It takes commitment after seeing how much Index III has degenerated. The final story arc of this season covers the World War III saga covering from episodes 18-26. It also covers the final light novels of the Index series (before New Testament) Meanwhile, I’m sitting wondering how the hell we can this can be accomplished through just 8 episodes. The World War III arc involves God’s Right Seat leader Fiamma of the Right pushing his goals for domination. Three different protagonists are actually featured in this final arc although all with different purposes. I’m not going to spoil it but the season makes it clear that all of them are important in some way or another. Again, Index III continues to suffer the problem of confusing storytelling. It doesn’t get viewers invested into what it’s telling us. Instead, what it does is trying to mix too much content at once. It’s like putting all the fruits into one basket and the customer isn’t sure what to pick in the end. Here, Index III chronicles the storytelling of three different protagonists without really getting us to fully invest into any of them. It’s very messy and we are pretty much left to figure out their motives and purpose. Most of these characters suffer development too as the show devotes much of its time on the plot. Oh dear God, how many times do we have to see Accelerator suffer more?In perhaps the worst kept secret of the franchise, studio J.C. Staff once again decided to tackle this show with its production staff and talent. Honestly, it’s not too bad if you go with the flow for its action elements. If there’s anything actually worthy about Index III, it would be the technical quality. Sure, it’s not a masterpiece polished art piece but is able to sell an acceptable degree of animation. Character designs are carried over from the previous seasons with little change in style. There are some scenes that makes the action more overdramatic than it should be though. (such as Accelerator vs Kakine) This also extends to the emotive performances of certain characters such as Accelerator and Hamazura. And as previous Index shows, fan service returns with girls such as Misaka, Ituswa, and even Kaori to an extent. We just can’t have a full season of Index without bath scenes, right Mr Director Nishikiori?After waiting for years, Toaru Majutsu no Index III turned out to be nothing more than a big fest of mushy questionable content. In fact, you could probably learn from reading Wikipedia than watching the show. It’s crystal clear that we needed more than 26 episodes but instead, this came out like a procrastinated school project. Sometimes, I wish certain franchises aren’t revived so it can't be killed anymore. Index III became another example of tragic adaptation with what’s shown us. As someone who has read the light novels, I recommend reading through volumes 14-22 to get a much better understanding of this series. But it’s too bad really. What could have been a big hit of the year instead showed us how some big franchises can’t live up to its reputation. I just hope Accelerator spinoff or Railgun Season 3 doesn’t become another victim. storylines altogether in a complex system of magic and science.

(such as the towel girl Itsuwa) More importantly, we also learn that Touma is suffering from a case of amnesia. As a recurring trend, girls like Itsuwa gets their fair share of screen time when it comes fan service. Indeed, these are just a few elements you’ll get have to get used to throughout the third season. But unfortunately, Index III quickly began to wore itself out.If you recall from the previous season, Academy City is well known for its darker storytelling when it involves espers and its underworld activities. The first season and even its spinoff Railgun had level 5 esper Accelerator undergo an experiment project known as  the Level 6 Shift Project where he would have to kill 20,000 Misaka Mikoto clones to become level 6. Of course, that project never reached completion thanks to the intervention of Touma. My point for bringing this up is because in this season, we are introduced to new forms of esper conflicts. As a show with an expansive cast of characters, the third season decided to set 5 different factions in a plot known as the “Battle Royale Arc”. This was actually one of my favorite arcs in the light novels but the anime adaptation made my stomach sink upon seeing how they treated this. Make no mistake, if you are an anime only viewer, confusion will be a common thought. Once again, Accelerator becomes a prominent character in this arc due to his status as the strongest level 5 Esper. Hamazura Shiage is upgraded as a protagonist while we are also shown with other familiar characters such as ITEM (if you’ve seen Railgun Season 2). The newer characters introduced includes Level 5 esper Kakine Teitoku, Teshio Megumim, and the Professor. The big problem? All of these characters are little more like actors in a poorly constructed script. For whatever reason, the directors thought it would be a good idea to cram such an important arc into a mere set of just 4 episodes. Once I realized this, it became immediately obvious that the producers had little intention to make an impact of its story or characters. Because let’s face it, there’s far too many characters to get invested into in the Battle Royal arc. There’s also too much going on that puts you into a state of confusion. At the apex of this arc, we have two of the strongest espers clashing against each other but the outcome lacked depth and instead replaced with endless screaming of pure absurdity. It felt like these entire few episodes limited what potential it could have been. Even with certain deaths of several characters, I felt nothing for them. In essence, what could have been one of the most memorable plot in the franchise turned into a depressing fallout of rushed execution and poor story craftsmanship.Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there.At this point, we’re around a third of the show and I had to put down my thoughts and wonder how long this would last. Indeed, the next arc had me worried although to my delight, Acqua of the Back had probably the most consistent arc in this season. Perhaps this is because the anime only had one volume to work (Volume 16) so locking the arc to three episodes is actually consistent. Nonetheless, we are shown more conflict against the God’s Right Seat. Kaori Kanazaki also makes a big return from the previous seasons although she’s given more of a role as a combatant. The purpose of this arc wasn’t made entirely clear although it suggests that Touma would have some significant role in the upcoming struggle with the God’s Right Seat. Nonetheless, we can’t forget that Touma is a prominent character regardless how you feel about him. Ironically, titular Index remains mostly in the background despite having a significant role in the previous seasons. Here, she lost a lot of relevance and is even absent for quite a bit during the first half of the show.With the British Royal Family arc that followed, the anime again suffers problems with pacing and many characters stuffed together in one place. Featuring new characters such as the United Kingdom Princess Carissa, it will really make us wonder how Touma fits in all of this. The British Royal arc basically drops him into the magic side of the story without emphasizing its main purpose. Meanwhile, the plot twists didn’t feel meanginful even with some of the characters face-heel turns. Index actually becomes somewhat more relevant although I didn’t feel her role as nearly as memorable as the first two seasons. So in essence, the anime could have done more to capitalize itself by explaining more as everything is too frantic to absorb.Honestly, if you made it this far into the third season, I have to applaud you. It takes commitment after seeing how much Index III has degenerated. The final story arc of this season covers the World War III saga covering from episodes 18-26. It also covers the final light novels of the Index series (before New Testament) Meanwhile, I’m sitting wondering how the hell we can this can be accomplished through just 8 episodes. The World War III arc involves God’s Right Seat leader Fiamma of the Right pushing his goals for domination. Three different protagonists are actually featured in this final arc although all with different purposes. I’m not going to spoil it but the season makes it clear that all of them are important in some way or another. Again, Index III continues to suffer the problem of confusing storytelling. It doesn’t get viewers invested into what it’s telling us. Instead, what it does is trying to mix too much content at once. It’s like putting all the fruits into one basket and the customer isn’t sure what to pick in the end. Here, Index III chronicles the storytelling of three different protagonists without really getting us to fully invest into any of them. It’s very messy and we are pretty much left to figure out their motives and purpose. Most of these characters suffer development too as the show devotes much of its time on the plot. Oh dear God, how many times do we have to see Accelerator suffer more?In perhaps the worst kept secret of the franchise, studio J.C. Staff once again decided to tackle this show with its production staff and talent. Honestly, it’s not too bad if you go with the flow for its action elements. If there’s anything actually worthy about Index III, it would be the technical quality. Sure, it’s not a masterpiece polished art piece but is able to sell an acceptable degree of animation. Character designs are carried over from the previous seasons with little change in style. There are some scenes that makes the action more overdramatic than it should be though. (such as Accelerator vs Kakine) This also extends to the emotive performances of certain characters such as Accelerator and Hamazura. And as previous Index shows, fan service returns with girls such as Misaka, Ituswa, and even Kaori to an extent. We just can’t have a full season of Index without bath scenes, right Mr Director Nishikiori?After waiting for years, Toaru Majutsu no Index III turned out to be nothing more than a big fest of mushy questionable content. In fact, you could probably learn from reading Wikipedia than watching the show. It’s crystal clear that we needed more than 26 episodes but instead, this came out like a procrastinated school project. Sometimes, I wish certain franchises aren’t revived so it can't be killed anymore. Index III became another example of tragic adaptation with what’s shown us. As someone who has read the light novels, I recommend reading through volumes 14-22 to get a much better understanding of this series. But it’s too bad really. What could have been a big hit of the year instead showed us how some big franchises can’t live up to its reputation. I just hope Accelerator spinoff or Railgun Season 3 doesn’t become another victim."", 'I love the Toaru series, I really do, I have seen all the spin offs, read the novels, read the manga, will watch the third season of railgun and will watch the Accelerator spin off. Despite this I will be giving this particular adaptation of the show a low review, not because the source material is bad, but because its just a terrible adaption. If you want to actually enjoy this series, please just read the damn novels. This adaptation was basically JC Staff butchering the plot, stitching it back together incorrectly, throwing out important parts because hey we need to save budget for Misaka’s...ass shots, and then setting it on fire. Anyway, now that I cleared that up we can get onto the actual review.Story: 4I have never seen such a poorly executed story in anime before, and I have seen that one isekai anime involving a Kirito clone and a smart phone. Nothing in the story actually makes sense, and this is from a novel reader who knows exactly what is supposed to be going on. The anime was already very fast paced in season 1 and 2 and those 2 seasons adapted 12 novels combined, while this season tried to adapt 10 at once, this lead to a great portion of the plot being cut out.The battle Royale Arc, one of the best arcs in the novel, with mind games, extremely well written fights, great conflicting motivations, was turned into an endless blood bath. What happened was a bunch of characters you don’t care about got killed, some soldiers got shot up, and all for a bunch of reasons that they don’t expand beyond a single line here and there.The British Halloween arc? One of the best political stories I seen in an LN, one that successfully predicted Britain in real life leaving the EU before it actually happened, was turned into a half ass coup by some bratty girl who was really tsundere about Great Britain.Don’t even get me started on the acqua of the back, arc with more focus on Misaka’s ass than the motivations on WHY acqua was in the city, how he got there, when in the timeline he got there, and why Academy City dint put him down as fast as possible.Also the exposition in this season was some of the worst, it was already bad in previous seasons, when they start explaining character abilities, half of it sounds like chuuni nonsense someone on drugs came up with, the other half shouldn’t even be included since it wastes a good portion of the episode with someone just talking. Would it be so hard to just simply explain their abilities, since clearly going into the origins of the abilities in depth won’t work in an ANIME, it works well in novel because they can dedicate 3 pages to something like that. They also don’t do this once, they do it like 30 times, every time some new character shows up.Art: 3The animation is honestly disgusting, and I have seen shows released in 1998 that are much better looking, I am serious, we have scenes that look worse and more broken than that bad berserk adaption a few years back. The fights which in the novel were described as shattering mountains, tearing space, explosions in every colors as reality was distorted, had no weight to them at all. Most of the fights were just the characters talking, them using their abilities 2 or 3 times and then eventually one of them backed down or got knocked out.The effects for the abilities looked terrible, curtana was supposed to cut through space, what were those stupid cubes of jello???? Or how Accelerator’s black wings were not consistent between this season and last season, heck it wasn’t even consistent in the 2 fights this season alone. Also, what the heck were the gods right seat abilities, seat of the left had some weird look blade that moved slowly through the air, acqua’s speed was downplayed the entire time, fiammas holy right looked so ugly and did not do any of the cool sounding stuff it was supposed to, like teleport to the target and knock them out without force, oh by the way his sword was supposed to be 40KM long and on FIRE.This being said, the only reason the art gets a 3 instead of a 1 was because of the second opening, after seeing it though it made me even more angry, how can they make an opening so great visually, and then make a show that looks so awful after. The opening visuals were possibly top 10 out of 100s of series I seen, if JC staff is capable of that, then it’s clear it was not even a lack of talent but just laziness on why the show looked this garbage.The sound: 8The openings were absolutely amazing I will admit that, and the soundtrack is as good as ever, I guess they managed to get one thing right. I have nothing bad to say here, the sound effects used were interesting even if it was not consistent with the previous season, and I really enjoyed the soundtrack that played during major fights.Characters: 2Accelerator became the epitome of edge and stupid justifications instead of a well written anti hero, the MC became an endless platitude generator who quotes basic lines about justice and punches out his enemies without understanding their view point, and hamazura apparently survives every situation by luck. This is essentially how the anime adaption portrayed them, one dimensional cardboard characters with no nuance, who can’t think beyond the most obvious solutions to their issues, and who win by luck or plot armor. I will tell you that the novel does not do this and the characters are much more likable but I think I already said this enough, the character writing and development in the series is just awful.Another issue in the series is that they add like 100 new characters without developing any of them, some of them genuinely have great character designs, interesting abilities, and look really cute or cool. However, we will never get to know them because they either die, or are forgotten about in the next arc, and you don’t care much about them because the show skipped any significant development or backstories for the characters.Also outside of fan service some of the most popular characters got no screen time, we dint even get to see Misaka do anything substantial or have any of the Academy city students show up outside of 3 minutes of screen time.Enjoyment: 5I really wanted to enjoy this series, since the source material is something I love, and I was looking forward to seeing this anime. However I just could not get myself to like it for the most part, I know the story from the novel and could barely follow it, I feel sorry for anime only viewers who likely understood nothing through the entire show. Now I wouldn’t say I hated all of it, but a majority of it except some highlight scenes were pretty bad. I used to like JC staff as a studio, however after this adaptation, and whatever they are doing with Date a Live 3, they are garbage to me. All I can hope for is that the railgun season 3 director manages to put on a good show despite the studio, like he did last time with railgun s.Overall: 5I give this show an 5, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show a lower score since it was very bad and disappointing, however I will give it a 5 just because I love the source series, and because I rarely ever give a show under a 7, if its under a 7 on my list it means the show it hot garbage and I would never recommend it. ass shots, and then setting it on fire.

I don\'t regret this decision. Toaru Majutsu no Index is the best light novel I\'ve ever read. And I\'m not overrating it, I loved almost everything about it. Besides La Regina del Mare Adriatico Arc, even in light novel it isn\'t good. I\'ve read whole...OT in about a year, and then started NT, which in my opinion is worse than OT and I never ended it.After I heard that there will be 3rd season of Toaru Majutsu no Index I was scared. I know J.C.Staff very well and I was sure that they will ruin it. But this is even worse than I imagined. But let\'s start from the beginningStory: 9/10Even if it is executed poorly, it\'s still the story that I love so much.Art: 5/10After I heard about 3rd season I thought that it will have similar art to that in Railgun S. Wrong. It\'s even worse than in previous season, but maybe a bit better than in first. The fights could have been epic, but they aren\'t. I thought about rating it even lower, but I\'ve seen anime with worse art than this, so I won\'t do itSound: 8/10Soundtrack is good, it fits this series and I like it. After it comes out on youtube I\'m sure that I will add it to my playlist ""Favourite Music""Character: 3/10Inner thought of characters from light novel are cut off. Because of that the characters lack depth and I can\'t identify myself with them. And I\'m not only talking about supporting characters, even the main trio is bad. I really liked Hamazura in light novel, I felt he is very similar to me, but I don\'t feel the same in anime. I hate this anime because of it, characters were the strong point of TAMNI light novel series, but in anime adaptation they\'re the bad point.Enjoyment: 2/10As I writed in the beginning. Watching this anime is painful. It\'s so painful that every episode I think about dropping it. But I\'m still watching, only because I still had hope in J.C. Staff, that maybe when one of the best arcs in the whole series starts up, it will be adapted properly. But after watching episode 6 I think I\'m done with it. I\'m dropping this series.Overall: 3/10Good job J.C. Staff, you ruined one of my most favourite series. I wish that season three would never come up, or that other studio would animate it properly. You had very good source material, how could you fuck this up. I\'m done with you, it\'s my last time I ever watched something made by you.

Index was one of the earlier series that I saw, and at the time I really enjoyed it. However, a lot has changed in my life since then, and I’m not the same person I was back in 2013. I’ve been looking at this third season as an opportunity to reevaluate the series, and unfortunately, it doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. Many of the preliminary reviews suggest that this dissatisfaction is purely with the quality of this particular adaptation, but I feel the source material isn’t blameless...in this matter.First off, I’m going to talk about the author of the series, Kamachi Kazuma, who is best known for the absurd rate at which he puts out light novels. A while back, there was a period of over two years in which he managed to release a volume every single month, and though he has slowed since then, his publishing speed is still well above just about anyone else in the industry. This rapid release schedule is a powerful tool for increasing audience engagement, since there will almost always be a new release to keep him fresh in mind, and it also generates pressure for readers to stay up to date or risk falling behind.However, while this model was no doubt successful in getting his work acknowledged, it is also to the detriment of its quality. For some arcs, it feels as if Kamachi was only putting something out for the sake of it, and not because it contributed to the overall narrative. Some of the middle arcs in this season drop a lot of information on the viewers to keep track of, but end up hardly mattering to the main plot. There’s so much going on, and a lot of it doesn’t amount to anything.Another product of this release schedule is how the powers have been simplified over the course of the series. I still think that Academy City is one of the coolest settings in any anime that I’ve seen, but only because of how unique and thought-out all the different powers that occupied it felt initially. But as the rate of releases accelerated, this deliberateness was lost. Gradually, the new abilities introduced have become less interesting, and even the application of existing abilities has become less creative. This is best illustrated through Vector Change, a power which is limited only by the imagination of the user. Accelerator’s greatest strength over the first two seasons was the flexibility of this ability, but now he primarily uses it as a force field and those dumb tornado wings.But yes, I’m not going to disagree that this adaptation is rough. This season covers the last nine volumes of the original light novel, which is a lot of material to cover (for reference, the first and second seasons covered six and seven volumes, respectively). A lot had to be cut to fit everything into 26 episodes, and the gaps are apparent. The biggest casualty of this is the characterization. It’s a frequent occurrence that the villains from previous arcs return as allies in new arcs, though the process by which their allegiances shift is often unaddressed. This material ties in with the series’ main theme of great strength coming from the unification of different perspectives, but it doesn’t get the attention it deserves. The show ends up having an impressive ensemble cast, but with all the material that has been removed, any episode that tries to follow too many of them comes across as completely incoherent.It’s always interesting to revisit media you’ve consumed in the past, and see how your opinion has shifted on it over time. Unfortunately, Index doesn’t hold the same appeal that it used to, but I’m still going to try to end this review on an optimistic sentiment. We’ll also be getting a third season of Railgun this year, which has always been my preferred side of the franchise. I plan to cover it as well, and I choose to believe that it won't let me down in the same way. in this matter.First off, I’m going to talk about the author of the series, Kamachi Kazuma, who is best known for the absurd rate at which he puts out light novels.

Staff? What have you...done to Index! Why were you breaking the rule of 24 ep to make 26 ep instead, only to disappoint us with more cuts?

The first 2 seasons were pretty good, you knew what was going on, why people were doing things and the arcs felt fleshed out. Season 3? ""Naw bro, you gotta read the books to enjoy the show."" NO! That\'s not how it\'s supposed to work, the viewer needs to know what is going on while readers get to enjoy nuance and animated fight scenes they imagined.This season is a waste of time. I hate what they\'ve done. I hate that I\'ve wasted 6 hours on it and I hate that they\'ll probably ruin Railgun too. ', ""I'll be brief. This particular adaptation failed. Hard.Either they tried to adapt everything in a short timetable, or the opposite, but J.C.Staff cut too much of the novel content in the process. I would prefer it if they decided to animate less in this season, but with better detail, instead of rushing through the story abandoning valuable pieces left and right. Story 4/10.Characters' inner thoughts are omitted, some characters were not even introduced and just appeared with no backstory. As a result, their motivation is unknown, their actions seem irrational and forced. Even an off-screen narrator would do, like when Touma narrates about his situation....Why not give Hamazura the same opportunity to introduce the viewer to his situation? 5/10.And it's all too rushed. We should have had 4-5 episodes dedicated to ITEM alone before Fre//nda happens. Because like this we feel nothing, it just doesn't faze us. The constant jumping between POVs is also not appreciated, not with THAT pace.Art is passable (6/10), but fights are pathetic. Special effects are just... total trash. Accelerator vs Dark Matter was supposed to be epic. It was instead a short sequence of bad choreography mixed with garbage CG (especially Accelerator's attacks - wtf is that black thing?). And then... the conclusion of the fight happens off-screen on top of that. Other fights are also bad. Mercs and drones that shoot bad CG lines of yellow and never can hit any named characters (who stand still and scatter only AFTER the shooting starts), constant speaking in the middle of the fight, characters teleporting (not via ability, but through scenarists' oversight) all over the city...The sound is not praiseworthy either. Touma's canceling sound was changed from glass breaking to... something. It just doesn't suit the situation. Music is fine but nothing fantastic. The rest is normal. 5/10.While original story and characters are good, in this adaptation we can't see any of that. Enjoyment 3/10.So, overall - poor. 3/10.

So here we go:The story for Index III isn\'t that bad. Personally I didn\'t think that it was rushed nor did I thought that it was confusing. Index has always been like this when if you don\'t pay attention there is a high chance in which you would be lost. Though I do admit that plenty of things were explained a lot better in the novels but this isn\'t a review of that but more as if I were an anime-only watcher.The art...is fine. Like the characters do look different from each other. But the only reason why it\'s a 6 in this category is because I know it could have been done better as some of the CG wasn\'t that great (I\'m looking at you tornado wings) and that sometimes the characters can look off-model.Sound wise it is quite good. The voice actors feel like they did a really good job and gave me performances I wasn\'t expecting to hear (like Mugino and Misaka Worst for example). The OST was pretty good though a nitpick I had was that an emotional scene could have something that would fit an exposition scene for example.Of course like any anime there has to be good opening and ending themes to go along with it to help with the experience and I\'ll start with the openings. While I do really like Graviation, I feel like it overstayed its welcome a bit more than it should have. And as for ROAR... I feel like it is the most visually impressive of all the ops in the Index series (even if the ""Engrish"" can sound weird during the chorus).As for the endings... well it is hit or miss just like the other eds in the series. ED1 might be my least favorite of the endings mostly for how forgettable it is while I will be able to remember ED2 pretty well even if I am not sure if it fits the WW3 arc...One of the things that I always liked about Index would be the character cast and how well they interact with each other and the situations that they get in and it didn\'t disappoint me this time around. Though just don\'t expect Misaka to do much as there\'s always Railgun 3 coming up and Accelerator is just Accelerator doing his own thing.And while I would like to continue talking about the cast... I shouldn\'t really be going to spoiler material (hence why this section might be the most vague of them all).Now I don\'t think Index III is anywhere close to being a butchered adaptation compared to something like Date A Live III or even Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria. Instead I see this as a flawed adaptation but that didn\'t meant that I didn\'t enjoy myself. In fact I thought it was a really nice ride getting through this weekly as there were plenty of moments that I was glad to see getting animated.I am not here to make you change your mind as I am perfectly fine with you being disappointed with the way this series turned out and if I had to say one thing about this season it would be: I am glad that it exists. is fine.

J.C Staff are trying to adapt so much this season, that they crammed too much in each episode, causing it not to flow cohesively anymore.They skipped a lot of content from the Light Novel, as a result the story is extremely rushed and most anime watchers don’t know what the hell is...happening.Index III has a plethora of problems: the bad direction, poor animation, unexplained plot points and plot holes. The story bouncing from different groups of characters without giving us enough time for events to sink in or get acquainted with the characters. Inner monologues are being cut out. Characters are constantly teleporting from one scene to another, the villains motivations are vague, there’s meaningless deaths and stupid organisations like: ITEM, SCHOOL, BLOCK, GROUP, MEMBER fighting for unclear reasons.Honestly, I gave up trying to understand what’s going on in the story because it’s been confusing and hard to follow.

Lecturing his opponents how they’re wrong and he’s always morally right, until they become dumbfounded as he proceeds to punch them in the face.If you’re a Misaka fan then prepare to be disappointed because [SPOILER!!] Misaka barely does anything for the entire season and when she eventually does get some focus it’s only for 2 mins at the end.Accelerator remains the best part of Index. His character development into a hero is amazing and watching the lengths he goes to protect Last Order is a joy to watch.On the other hand, one of the worst decisions was having Hamazura become one of three MCs along with Touma and Accelerator. I despise Hamazura with a passion because he’s like a bland, discount version of Touma. I don’t know why Hamazura gets so much screentime when nothing he does is plot relevant. I don’t care about his goal to save his girl. He’s blantantly protected by plot armour and the guy can’t do anything without plot convenience or enemies being dumbed down to save him. This is why you don’t make a fodder civilian a MC because he’s just boring to watch.

The first thing I loved about the third season is the stakes, this season is a direct follow up of Index ii so we all know the God's Right seat are the villains this time around. It starts off with Touma facing off against them as always but what I particularly like about this season so far are how multiple protagonists are popping up. In fact, I think this...is the first time we have so many character perspectives in a single season. FYI this season alongside Touma we are getting two new protagonists, Accelerator and Hamazura.There's, of course, the usual amalgamation of pacing problems, completely new characters that end up fighting and killing without any explanation. The character introduction scenes have been cut short is what I can tell as an Anime-only viewer. Particularly if you ask me the episodes 4-6 were a mess, but if you are the kind of viewer who follows every single dialogue like me then it isn't much of a problem as the essence of the arcs are conveyed. However, I will suggest reading the Light novels if you want to enjoy this season as that's what most of the LN readers have said.Characters: To Aru's strong point has always been its characters and it has plenty of those.Art: 7 is the best rating I can manage, either JC Staff is lazy or they are just not invested in Index III.Enjoyment: 8, if you are okay with a few unexplained details I'm sure better arcs are coming up! is the first time we have so many character perspectives in a single season.

It just had this certain ""something"" from the getgo, that kept me entertained. I couldn\'t express how excited I was when I heared about all the news about the new anime adaptations coming in 2019: so then, why am I so disappointed?Sidenote: I\'ve seen the entire ToAru franchise (5 seasons including the new ""ToAru majutsu no Index III"" (up to episode 19). I\'ve rewatched the previous installments multiple times, both in release order and chronological order and I\'ve bought all the source material (Lightnovels + Mangas). I...know what I\'m talking about when I say that this season wasted pretty much all its potential so far.The ToAru Franchise takes place in a world, where magic and science have long both been part of our daily lives. One much more than the other, as the magical side tends to work hidden rather than open. In the most advanced city in the world ""Gakuen Toshi"" or ""Academy city"" millions of students live in ""peace and harmony"", where they train their supernatural powers as espers. However, the mascerade of this city is nothing more but a construct of illusions: Human laboratories, clones, warfare and abductions as well as murder all take place in the darkest places of this brightest city. Its a world doomed by the illusion, that with great power, great responsibility follows and that people will use their power to protect those, that can\'t do it themselves. Its sadly an Illusion, that Touma (male protagonist) has to destroy. Sacred with the mysterious power to negate any supernatural force by simply touching it with his right arm, the ""Majutsu"" branch follows his daily life as he keeps getting involved in these dark, brutal things that take place in this city and how he has to give it his all to fight back and protect those that are close to him.The ToAru franchise is filled with intruiging plots and sidestories that all come together to one big clash. Again and again. No matter how weird it seems, it always ends up in something way bigger than you originaly expected. This however is sadly also why the anime adaptation of this genius series often sucks ass. Excuse my words.Due to the sheer size of source-material and its complexity, a H U GE part of the entire narrative gets lost in its adaptation - even with 24 episodes per season. Some arcs may be lighter than others but in general you\'d need at least 10 - 12 episodes per arc. Often times sadly they get broken down in 4 - 6.Story: 5The story itself would get a straight 10/10 from me. But sadly the series cuts so much material that its just confusing - even after you read 17 goddamn lightnovels about it.Art: 7It looked pretty decent in the beginning but it suffers from its rushed nature and often times you have a very neatly animated clash only to be followed by a static close-up battle and an ""evil explanation of why they have to destroy the world for the greater"" for 5+ Minutes (once again, its just too rushed...)Sound: Oh lord. I loved the new sounddesign, instantly felt in love with it when the first episode aired of this new season. It also has a lot more epic OST and some absolute banger OPs. So why not 10/10 or at least 9? Simply because there are some soundtracks that are nice to listen to - maybe for 20 seconds. But you\'ll hear the looped for the entirity of 5 minutes whilst someone has a monologue about their motives and past.The VA did an amazing job - especially ""Accelerator"" is just insanely (hehe~) talented ;)Character: Standart bunch of okay characters. Could\'ve been a lot better but pretty much all their detail gets lost - once again - in its rushed nature.Enjoyment: 10/10 cause boi, why would I spend 500 Dollars on source material if it ain\'t good? Its my fravourite series of all time and I\'d love to see it come alive as an anime more lively. But this installment just falls flat because it cuts so much source off and keeps having very blunt moments stretched out to eternity.Overall: 7Yeah. I\'d love to give it a higher rating but this season falls very flat compared to the previous ones (especially considering that the sidebranch ""ToAru kagaku no railgun has a waaaaay better anime adaptation) know what I\'m talking about when I say that this season wasted pretty much all its potential so far.The ToAru Franchise takes place in a world, where magic and science have long both been part of our daily lives.

The only reason I was able to sit through this entire series was Accelerator. I remember being so excited watching season 1 with the premise that I started to read the light novel. Season 2 wasn’t great but it was still bearable. This show is an utter train wreck. Don’t waste your time on it. Tomua is a bland protagonist. He drags the show down. You never know what is actually going on. I still can’t believe this was my favorite arcs in the light novel. After this disaster I am done with all Toaru content. ', ""Toaru Majutsu no Index III (2018-2019)I know it is normally unheard of but this really needed like 32 episodes or perhaps even a season 4 or a part 1 and part 2 because they really did rush it towards the end. I mean the final episode crammed so much in you don't even get the happy return to the normal scene you normally expect in Academy City.That said the season is absolutely watchable and great in many aspects, just it did let the team down with being so crammed.Notably good things:- Misaka sisters and the way they speak in phenomenal still.- Imagine...breaker has superb sound in this.- Other such areas of sound especially towards the end taking a very familiar sound from No Game No Life Zero which came out just prior.- Finally from all the anime videos I have seen online seeing the cheeky blonde from the puritans church in the OP was great. (A specific scene looking slyly over her shoulder).- Itsuwa finally getting the development she deserved before like many main characters falling off the face of the show.- Accelerator has some of the most powerful development yet with an amazing scene with the cute Last Order.- Misaka Worst needs to marry Accelerator or what is life.- The Royal Family Arc is fun.- The witches are always fun to see.- Lessar was an unexpected delight through this.- Episode 26 has a scene at the very end whereby you get a reminiscent scene similar to Bioshock Infinite. This is where you have Leivinia Birdway and Mark Space appear like the Lutece twins (Not twins as such play the game).Odd notes:- Cannot miss the seats of god since they all look insanely evil generally when in actions initially.- In episode 8 keep an eye for the moment that Itsuwa lost her under top whilst falling but not the outer layer by some magic.- The ending was just mind-blowingly bad and episode 26 in that seems to cram a good 4 episodes of events into its second half literally.The art of the season is amazing. It really holds up well and will stand well in time.The soundtrack is great, SFX is deep and well planned. Voices are great, especially the Misaka sisters as always. The first op of the season with Gravitation by Maon Kurosaki is by far the best OP visually and musically of the show.Characters do develop but some also just disappear unexpectedly and randomly during the season. Like Index is important then not there and then sort of a sideshow, just like Itsuwa. One character that stood out the most which as already stated was Accelerator who is incredible. For the most part, the characters are great but as the show began rushing they became blurred.Honestly, up until maybe episode 24/25 the show was brilliant regardless of rushing. Episode 24/25 onwards went full turbo and just lost the plot, literally if I am honest. It is almost like they made it and was like oh no! we have to wrap this up.Aisa Himegami is still the best girl for me, I suppose since she is the most traditional Japanese girl in the show. She needed more air time but like many characters, she sort of just dropped off the face of the earth.In the end, we needed another season or the show to continue. I wish I was a billionaire so I could fund it to happen because it just leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth with how it ended. That said the series has been a blast and I would still recommend watching this and it as a whole.8/10 says Misaka, Misaka with gleeful intent. breaker has superb sound in this.- Other such areas of sound especially towards the end taking a very familiar sound from No Game No Life Zero which came out just prior.- Finally from all the anime videos I have seen online seeing the cheeky blonde from the puritans church in the OP was great. (A specific scene looking slyly over her shoulder).- Itsuwa finally getting the development she deserved before like many main characters falling off the face of the show.- Accelerator has some of the most powerful development yet with an amazing scene with the cute Last Order.- Misaka Worst needs to marry Accelerator or what is life.- The Royal Family Arc is fun.- The witches are always fun to see.- Lessar was an unexpected delight through this.- Episode 26 has a scene at the very end whereby you get a reminiscent scene similar to Bioshock Infinite. This is where you have Leivinia Birdway and Mark Space appear like the Lutece twins (Not twins as such play the game).Odd notes:- Cannot miss the seats of god since they all look insanely evil generally when in actions initially.- In episode 8 keep an eye for the moment that Itsuwa lost her under top whilst falling but not the outer layer by some magic.- The ending was just mind-blowingly bad and episode 26 in that seems to cram a good 4 episodes of events into its second half literally.The art of the season is amazing. It really holds up well and will stand well in time.The soundtrack is great, SFX is deep and well planned. Voices are great, especially the Misaka sisters as always. The first op of the season with Gravitation by Maon Kurosaki is by far the best OP visually and musically of the show.Characters do develop but some also just disappear unexpectedly and randomly during the season. Like Index is important then not there and then sort of a sideshow, just like Itsuwa. One character that stood out the most which as already stated was Accelerator who is incredible. For the most part, the characters are great but as the show began rushing they became blurred.Honestly, up until maybe episode 24/25 the show was brilliant regardless of rushing. Episode 24/25 onwards went full turbo and just lost the plot, literally if I am honest. It is almost like they made it and was like oh no! we have to wrap this up.Aisa Himegami is still the best girl for me, I suppose since she is the most traditional Japanese girl in the show.

I started the story through its anime replica 2 weeks ago at the time this review has been posted, and I accumulated a deep interest into the franchise, so naturally being aware of the 8 year gap between season 2 and season 3, I was thrilled to see the differences in quality between the two, however, this season has proved that we shouldn\'t take its situation into fave value just because of hypothetical...improved quality in story telling and visualsStory: The Toaru series overall contains a very intriguing story, mainly because of the elements it toys with and utilizes them to build its geographical setting and narrative purpose. Unfortunately, the way the has chose to adapt the source material into 26 eps is a complete joke by some, including me to an extent. Unlike the other seasons, the story is fairly rushed, and as a result it leaves a lot of plot holes open and doesn\'t bother to fix them, which ruins the way we consume the narrative. The content itself is really good, as it continues right after season 2, but the production team clearly didnt show enough love to it. To point out a few examples, some arcs, like the Battle Royale arc and DRAGON arc that are 3 eps, involve a lot of characters perspectives into the play, to the point where it\'s difficult to process what\'s going on, considering that the material itself can be a pain to analyse, not to mention it skips a lot of important details and skips character interactions, with one shot having the character on that location and right after, transporting the character in a brand new area . It\'s not an impossible task to comprehend what\'s going on, but the speed it\'s going is the embodiment of 100 miles per minute, showing how it doesnt leave room to breathe in between. Because of this, arcs such as the DRAGON arc are made from good original story parts into trash. In contrast, despite this issue, all the arcs can be fairly enjoyable and some others are just as good as precious arcs, such as the early arcs. One thing I want to point out, which is an aspect I really like is the geography of season 3. Unlike past seasons, this season takes place in many locations, from Academy City, France, London, and Russia. It isn\'t a huge deal, but the changd in atmospheres makes the content more intriguing and creates greater anticipation of what\'s to come. Overall, the story is not bad, but it could\'ve been a lot better if they chose to slow down the pace it adapting the source material.Art: The quality overall has pros and cons. To start with the pros, the drawings are noticeably better than previous seasons, which is expected from a 2018 anime. Also, whoever made those background designs deserves a metal. The backgrounds are fucking gorgeous and one of the best in the series. Finally, some of the cgi implemented is pretty good. Although it\'s bad at some points, the CGI fits with the environment in certain occasions. Contrastingly, the cons are a different matter. Although the art style has improved, the animation doesn\'t follow that trend. There are a lot of fights where the animation is deficient, and as a result ruins those fights, and finallises them as underwhelming. Some fights however have good use if the animation, for example, Accelerator vs Kakine from the Bottle Royak arc, where both mostly battle mid air, where the 2d animation is mixed with the 3d buildings. This mix is utilized really well and makes the fight extremely pumping and unique; although some fear this use of animation choice, JC Staff has showed that it can succeed in that medium when it tries.Music: To put it simply, I adore the music. It reinforces the kind of atmosphere the series gives and is consistent in doing so. The opening themes in Season 3 are impressive and some of the best ops in the entire franchise. The ed themes dont scream ""Amazing"", but the are nice relaxing songs, considering the VA of Index songs both if them. The OST is pretty great as well, as the techno music and dubstep direction they were going for depicts the scientific side of the world the Toaru series is based in.Characters: Just like the story, characters are another controversial point the toaru fans bring up. To give you an idea of the reasons, season 3 introduced wayyy too many characters than it needed to, especially in the first half. Arcs such as the Battle Royal arc, with the introduction of different teams, and the Britain arc introduce too many characters at once, to the point where it becomes a full time job to keep track of all those boys and girls, especially when perspectives are constantly changing character to character. Because of this, characters ,such as Misaka, who have a great potential to shine, dont get enough screentime, and other characters such as Toma Kamijou, the main character of the Index series, feel undeveloped. However, there are some characters that are established really well in this season, with my favourites being Hamazura and Accelerator, with both undergoing an evolution into their character traits and learning to change as people and their perspectives. Hamazura transforms from an annoying pussy to a hero by following the ideology that Toma Kamijou has taught him in season 2, and Accelerator developing from a killing psycho to a caring character who learns the value of protecting other people instead of exploiting them for power. If you give the characters a chance, I\'m sure you would appreciate some of themConclusion: With all the cons that I bestowed and described, you might be wondering, why I gave it a 7/10, and the reason being that toaru season 3 doesnt feel completely different to its ancestors. When you put it into action, Season 3 is no more than a procrastination of a school project, but the season still explores familiar characters, such as Toma, Index, Misaka, Accelerator, and still bases Academy city as its main core of the story, even though some arcs take place in different geographical locations. At the end of the day, it is a rushed and uncared project that didn\'t receive a lot of love from watchers, due to the unfeeling commitment the production team has put, but if you care about the series as a whole, I suggest giving a go, but you should lower expectations in order to appreciate it more improved quality in story telling and visualsStory: The Toaru series overall contains a very intriguing story, mainly because of the elements it toys with and utilizes them to build its geographical setting and narrative purpose.

It was promising at first but as the season went on, it starts to get more and more confusing to the point to where I almost forgot what I was watching. Now, with my personnel experience out of the way, let\'s get into an actual reviewStory:  4The story overall was interesting at first. As we got more and more into the show, the story becomes a confusing mess. However, it is not because of plot holes, or at least from what I can tell....No, it is because of the lack of explanation of what is happening in the plot that makes it confusing and at times, unwatchable. With other anime, you make the plot confusing and still have it be a good anime. But Magical Index is not that kind of show. You need to understand what is going on in the scene first, but this season hardly does any of that. That is a shame since all of the arcs seemed very interesting, but completely flopped because of the execution of them.Art:   5Now the art is a wild one. In order to talk about this I am gonna split into two parts: the animation and everything else...-Animation: The animation was all over the place in this season. There were some points were superb and absolutely amazing and other times, it would seem lazy and pretty choppy (there were huge points of time where the ""animation"" was literally a frame of that character that was moving from left to right... so annoying). A good way to understand this is by looking at the two OPs of this season. The first OP had some good animation but at times it was super choppy at times. However, the second OP was abosolutely beautiful. It was crisp and clean and the coloring was... WOW! But seriously, consistent animation is better than incosistent animation almost 99.9% of the time. One of my favorite animation failures was when Touma just watched on his allies fall from a pretty high height and his face looked as if he was annoyed rather than scared for his ally that she fell high enough to kill anyone.-Everything else: The CGI in this season was par to all of the other seasons. Nothing say about that. But what really shines is the amount of detail that went into the backgrounds! Every fricken background in this show is absolutely STUNNING! There was obviously so much time and care that went into everything single bit of each and every background. Whoever did the backgrounds deserves a massive pay raise or something because it was just that amazing!Sound:   9The sound was absolutely amazing. Music and voice acting were really good. Both of the OPs slap. EDs are fine; not great just fine. There is nothing to really say about the sound other than that though.Character:   5Here is where is starts to go down hill quite a bit. In this season, a lot of side characters from both A Certain Magical Index and A Certain Scientific Railgun come back into play with bigger parts for the overall arching story. The probably is that there wasn\'t enough time in the season to flesh out all of the side characters and even some of the main characters. A lot of growth for characters were rushed feeling pretty jarring. However, I did like there was an arc involving a pretty insignificant character. It was a very nice character arc that suprisingly liked.Enjoyment:   3This show really didn\'t entertain me. It was so confusing with a lot of what is happening not being explained. It seemed like they did this at the last minute. I found out later that they were trying to catch up with light novel since they were behind quite a bit. They tried to put too much into one season and I hate it.Overall:   5What saved this show from being rated less was literally the sound and the backgrounds, both of which were amazing. Other than that, everything was wildly inconsistent with me being confused from more than 3/4 of the season. It was way more confusing than like 90% of ACTUAL mystery series. Such a big letdown. If you wanted to get the full picture, read the light novel. I haven\'t read it yet, but from what I heard, it is better than the show. However, I am still looking forward to the next season. It better be good. No, it is because of the lack of explanation of what is happening in the plot that makes it confusing and at times, unwatchable.

So whatever effort the studio put into these factors, the fact that you don\'t know what\'s going on makes it absolutely pointless.Story and Plot: 2""Who the hell is that? How are they doing that shit? Why are doing it? What is heppening?"" Are pretty common questions while watching this anime.I know there\'s a good story buried somewhere deep under the convoluted mess J.C. staff made, but I just can\'t see it.The story arcs move way too fast and are...explained in such a confusing way. As an anime only viewer, I had to be reading the wiki after watching an episode just to figure out what was going on. The only thing I\'m thankful for is the fact that this anime pushed me to read to novels.The main reason the story is bad is they tell you the motivations of the characters and reasons behind events the story in such a confusing way, if they even tell you at all. Characters are all thrown into mix wihtout a care at all, and the abilities of those characters are explained in such a needlessly-confusing way. This results in event happening in the story, which you don\'t know why those events happen at all, and it seems like the story just happens around Touma for no reason at all.The shifts between arcs are abrupt, jarring, and just leave you confused. Because of these bad arc transitions, characters are just put into the story and out again without a proper introduction and this results in you not giving a shit about any character in the story, excluding those introduced in previous seasons.All this results in confusing events happening around some stupidly explained characters, neither of which you care about at all. Seriously this story is butched to hell. explained in such a confusing way. As an anime only viewer, I had to be reading the wiki after watching an episode just to figure out what was going on.

In season 3, the Toaru Majutsu 3 index failed. knowing that a lot of stories have to be spent in one season so that a lot of parts are wasted, there are a lot of espers and top ranked wizards but in season 3 it looks like they are just a display. even I am reluctant to accept this as season 3, this is just a joke adaptation of jC...staff. something that has to be the most climax, JC staff makes it trash. although it is almost impossible, I still hope that season 3 will be remake.I feel they are working on index 3 by force, so they can work on the accelerator and railgun T.

I saw so many 5 and below out of 10 for this.Let me tell you something! It is OK at best! A solid 7. Let's get down to business then.So my main gripe first. How do you construct a series so much that the three side protagonists are more interesting than the main protagonist. It baffles me. Rail-gun, Accelerator, and Hamazura are all very interesting. Like... They should have their own series.*Looks at a Certain Scientific Rail-Gun, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, and a Certain Level Zero Hamazura*OH WAIT! That last one is fake....When a Certain Level Zero Hamazura or something like that happens though... I will be on that shit!This 3rd season is full of action, drama, and an actual moment that got me so invested I got a lump in my throat. Seriously. It pulled off the redemption arc so god damn well that it made me feel things. So why the hate? Is it because it takes until the finale of the 3rd season to finally really begin to develop Kamijou's abilities and answer some questions. Not all, but some? ...Ok fair enough on that. This show is suppose to be about Index and Kamijou but honestly the other three protags steal the show. Literally. I was glued when ever they came on.Ok ok... Kamijou wasn't that bad. He just... Needed more done. Look One Punch Man finishes off people in one punch so they have a competent cast to back it up and draw out tension wonderfully. In a Certain Magical Index... You have a competent cast that does almost nothing when Kamijou is involved and he has to be the one to win the fights. Fine. I get it, but you are making all these other characters look lame by comparison when you have established them as big players prior.I do like the development Kamijou got and that other characters other than the other 3 protags could shine some but... Index is regulated to Damsel in distress mode once again. No big surprise but I hoped it wouldn't do that. I get it though. I wasn't a fan but I get it why it had to be that way.74 episodes of this and they also leave it on a cliff hanger note for a fourth and final season if they do it. I hope they do.

We will see...Story: 8 - Improvements were made but Kamijou is still Kamijou so... Ya know.Art: 9 - Fantastic Fight scenes and visuals will keep you gripped all the way through. I had a blast for most of it. They didn't try to do the whole tragic backstory crap as much so the art and flow didn't lose focus.Sound: 7 - I love the OST a bit more. Maybe because I heard for the better part of 74 episodes but some of the new songs were fire. The new Imagine Breaker Sound effect hurts my ears though. Season 4 needs to go back to the sounds it used in S1 and S2.Character: 7 - You will love Rail-Gun, Accelerator, and Hamazura's stories. In fact, 2 of those 3 have their own shows!

I am an anime-only and so I have no basis to judge as to how well they have adapted the source material. However, as I have watched all of the Toaru series back to back in the span of 1 month, I found Index iii to be the most gripping and enjoyable by a mile.Perhaps due to less slice of life elements being incorporated, and focusing more on the magic and science worlds colliding parallel to world war 3, I've never been more compelled throughout consuming this...series to start on the light novels. series to start on the light novels."", ""The character of Accelerator is an interesting one. He gets a lot of development through out the series and it appears to culminate with this season's finale.

I never found him interesting but the last episode changes everything, that passionate laughter, that insane look on his face and that loli fetish he has: it all makes sense now, it all comes together. He is an angel. He was an angel all along and now I understand what drove...him so mad, for the first time I shared his rampant laughter as he Accelerated towards the heavens and the shitty flute music made it even more hilarious.

Studio. Simply by reading the studio name, a problem was bound to occur.With the earlier two seasons, I found myself in love in the world that was created. The power systems were amazing, as so much reasoning was thrown behind each power and tactic. And the characters all had their own interesting motivations and stories, with characters. It was amazing...how this studio actually succeeded in adapting one of the most popular light novels to date.Unfortunately 2019 proved to be a sad year for this studio. If a budget can speak, it\'d be yelling for help. 2019 had a lot to live up to, especially after the 2018 fall season and because of the hype surrounding continuing series.A theory can be proposed as to how the studio had stretched itself thin with its many projects, one being the second season of the fan-favorite One Punch Man. This can be seen as a case of overwork. The studio having so many teams and projects working, could have led to problems with production.My disappointment with the studio, and their handling of the climax of the franchise is immeasurable.Even if this wasn\'t the case, production problems were still evident with the show looking and sounding as half-baked as it is.Story: 6/10If you\'re adapting a good story, then that\'s half the job done. The other half is in executing it.It\'s amazing how the execution fell so flat to the point where the story becomes incomprehensible. The source material is a genuinely great read and I highly recommend it, but the anime cut out too much and rushed way too quickly through the arcs.The anime had attempted to cover as much as they can, instead of succeeding in what they had room to tell.The arcs are way too quick to actually enjoy and understand for that matter. The show just throws you straight in without any explanation or re-introduction, unwise for a series that wasn\'t airing for nearly a whole decade prior. This hurts even more as you\'re introduced to a whole bunch of new characters, ideas, and plot lines. It was an information overload that confuses nearly every watcher.Again, it\'s hard to see how the studio made these mistakes when adapting such great source material.There was too much they tried to tell, and too much where they failed to.Art: 4/10At least the show has movement, despite how badly it looks.Unfortunately, whether this was a staff allocation issue or a skill and time issue, the show suffered. After all this time, one would expect at least a good looking show both art and animation wise. Especially since the previous two entries were at least mediocre in this department. But, the show looks worse than both of them. I never thought a show\'s saving grace in this department would be that not everything is a still frame with some tweening.Action and fight scenes are a treat, one that was left out in the sun for a week and regurgitated by your neighbor\'s dog. Everything becomes inconsistent and characters are nearly always off model. It isn\'t off-model in a way to show expression, but in a way that shows ineptitude.Look at any fight scene in this season. Actually don\'t, I\'ll spare you the trouble. Even some of the more important fight scenes look hideous and the show seems to lack any interest in proper budget allocation.Admittedly, the second opening of this series is actually both good art and sound wise. I genuinely don\'t understand how the show couldn\'t have its consistency.Sound: 3/10Just listen to any time Touma uses Imagine Breaker, it sounds like a pitch-change of a whale yelling.Character: 7/10The show\'s only saving grace, and it\'s only props for the original author.Index is a series where big casts work amazingly. Index season 3 forces the rescinding of that statement. With too many characters coming up with the plot progression and the awful pacing previously mentioned, no one really has time to shine.

The first two seasons had me hooked on this whole new world of magic and science. I\'ve never seen a world as well built as this aside from Fate.Index Season 3 had so much potential, especially when it\'s adapting some of the novel\'s best arcs. But, it failed even after I stuck with it for so long and waited so long.I dropped the show on episode 21, 3 episodes from its conclusion. I knew if I saw it I\'d be hopelessly disappointed. It\'s gone to the point where I picked up the light novels because I love the franchise so much.It\'s gone to the point where I wish for an animated reboot to the series for it to be given the chance it deserves. My hatred comes from a spot of love for the franchise.Whether or not it was a problem rooted into the studio or just ineptitude production-wise, I was thoroughly disappointed.Overall: 5/10This is most likely going to be the harshest grade I can give, coming from both a subjective and objective perspective.Don\'t watch Index season 3, just pick up the light novels for an infinitely better experience. how this studio actually succeeded in adapting one of the most popular light novels to date.Unfortunately 2019 proved to be a sad year for this studio.

I can\'t imagine recommending this to someone who wasn\'t already a big fan of the anime series at least, and I\'m sure even fans of the manga would be frustrated and perplexed after watching this adaptation. I don\'t like to disparage anime, but this was a mess of a show. Foremost, there were far too many characters being introduced to keep track of on top of the already...extensive cast, which resulted in each character getting an insignificant amount of screen time for them to really develop. Not only that, but with the collision of both the ""science"" and ""magic"" sides, there were simply too many rules and deus ex machinas out of left field. The anime expects the viewer to accept and understand the events that are happening on screen, despite their incoherence, and because of that, much of the scenes lack impact. Especially later in the anime, during the major action scenes, there was inconsistent, questionable animation quality, although the action scenes really could look swell at times. The OST was forgettable, but at least the sound effects and voice acting were what we have come to expect from this series. I\'m not sure how well the series will be able to recover from this season. extensive cast, which resulted in each character getting an insignificant amount of screen time for them to really develop.

I\'m not sure how well the series will be able to recover from this season.', 'A train-wreck that I cannot stop watching.Seriously what is going on? I didn\'t read the novels but I can tell for sure that a lot of content was skipped. The objectives are hardly ever made clear, and even if they do, somehow they find a way to rush it or make it so cheesy that I swallow my own vomit.The art, the animation, the music are well done. And when they want to make it look good, trust me they make it look really good. The music is the typical Index type music we all know, nothing amazing but gets the job done well.The...show is just a big disaster but yet I cannot stop watching it. Perhaps its the concept of everything that makes me want to watch it. Because if you look at the franchise as a whole, the plot is really interesting. A war between science and magic? Hell yeah that\'s cool. A power system that is made through real world physics? Why the hell not? And an internal, political power struggle between the higher ups and the ones below them? Count me the hell in. And yet, the show does nothing with that. The plot is good, but the execution is so bad that sometimes it makes me sad, because I wonder, how awesome would this show be if the people at J.C Staff actually gave a shit about the plot.The war is carried out in such a boring way that it feels like they\'re making me do a Try Not to Sleep Challenge. The interesting power system is kept in the side in this season and more focus is put on the ""just because"" element of magic. And oh man the power struggle can make no sense at all some times. I\'ll give credit to some of the characters. Accelerator is carrying the show because of how interesting he is, and Misaka\'s is still charming in her own quirky way but man I wish she had more screentime. Touma and Index are... boring. GROUP as a whole are very fun to watch even if I can\'t understand a lot of what they\'re doing.The problems in this season is nothing new to anyone who has been following the main Index series, but it\'s like they went Plus Ultra with the problems this time. If you\'re someone who has been following this series for a while, you\'ll still watch this even if you know the problems. If you\'re a casual fan who recently got into this franchise you\'ll probably will drop this after a few episodes. And if you\'re new to the franchise and are thinking about if you should commit fully to this franchise, eh.. go ahead? But know that its hard to get into. I myself am going to read the novels from now on to understand wtf is going on. show is just a big disaster but yet I cannot stop watching it. Perhaps its the concept of everything that makes me want to watch it. Because if you look at the franchise as a whole, the plot is really interesting. A war between science and magic? Hell yeah that\'s cool. A power system that is made through real world physics? Why the hell not? And an internal, political power struggle between the higher ups and the ones below them? Count me the hell in. And yet, the show does nothing with that. The plot is good, but the execution is so bad that sometimes it makes me sad, because I wonder, how awesome would this show be if the people at J.C Staff actually gave a shit about the plot.The war is carried out in such a boring way that it feels like they\'re making me do a Try Not to Sleep Challenge. The interesting power system is kept in the side in this season and more focus is put on the ""just because"" element of magic. And oh man the power struggle can make no sense at all some times. I\'ll give credit to some of the characters. Accelerator is carrying the show because of how interesting he is, and Misaka\'s is still charming in her own quirky way but man I wish she had more screentime. Touma and Index are... boring. GROUP as a whole are very fun to watch even if I can\'t understand a lot of what they\'re doing.The problems in this season is nothing new to anyone who has been following the main Index series, but it\'s like they went Plus Ultra with the problems this time. If you\'re someone who has been following this series for a while, you\'ll still watch this even if you know the problems.

I myself am going to read the novels from now on to understand wtf is going on.', 'I really liked how this series started. I meant the whole To Aru series, including side stories like Railgun. This is due to how fascinating the world adapts to people with ""Abilities"" how the whole story revolves around those. But sadly this series just made me lose interest on the whole thing. I find most episodes ""tiring"" to watch as there\'s so many random characters that probably showed up on the prequels and it\'s like it\'s expecting me to know who they are and what they did in the story. I\'m partly at fault because the anime is there, so I should watch it, right?...Still, I try to go to some sites to read up on these characters and as I do, I just get more confused and it spawns questions causing me to read up. In the end, I am more confused than I started out with and I spent more time than the 24 mins of episode just reading.The plot became quite convoluted that I don\'t really know what\'s happening aside from Touma using his hand to fight ""bad guys"" that after a few episodes, would be his allies/lovers. This will probably the last of the series I watch. Still, I try to go to some sites to read up on these characters and as I do, I just get more confused and it spawns questions causing me to read up.

If they ask you something, this season never happened.The animation was horrible, and because of that we could not enjoy the fights.The story was completely rushed, there were 9 volumes in 26 episodes, 9 volumes is what SAO: Alicization is putting in 50 episodes and still suffering with cuts.The director? is busy directing the movie of Trinity Seven.This season is a huge disregard for any fan of the franchise, they simply showed the middle finger to us.And I bet, that Railgun 3 and Accelerator, will come out much better than that. Even if Index is...what sold the most.I hope they do not touch those dirty hands of the J.C Staff and the Nishikiori in the New Testament.INDEX 3 DOES NOT EXIST!!!#RebootTheOldTestamentNow what sold the most.I hope they do not touch those dirty hands of the J.C Staff and the Nishikiori in the New Testament.INDEX 3 DOES NOT EXIST!!!#RebootTheOldTestamentNow', 'This sequel was doomed from the day it began to be planned. Why? Because it was decided that they would only animate the ""highlights"" of the following arcs from the Light Novels. It\'s like trying to watch someone cook a complicated dish but instead of being step-by-step, it rushes forward every few ones so you\'ll be left not knowing how to make it, just what it\'s supposed to look like at the end.Animation:1) I always thought that the Toaru series had gorgeous visuals but this sequel just kept messing things up. It\'s very inconsistent and not even the action scenes are pretty to...look at, except for the 1st Accelerator fight and the 11th episode.2) I hate CGI because it breaks immersion for me. There\'s quite a lot of CGI in this and only on a few occasions it blended nicely with the rest of the visuals3) I don\'t understand what was the need to have so many gunshot wounds censored4) SPOILER: to have a bearded pope is incredibly weird, considering that since 1700 no pope hasn\'t been clean shaved all the time. The reason? So the drinking stuff that happens in religious ceremonies and events don\'t get ruined.5) SPOILER: it\'s incredibly weird how japanese people think that Britain royalty would still use horses and medieval carriages to transport themselves in a world where everything is way more advanced that the present technology that we have in 2020Sound1) the sound effects are terrible from start to finish. This audio catastrophe begins with Sphynx making whatever noises those were and I\'m convinced that whoever was in charge of the Sound Effects Department has never heard a cat meow.2) the sountrack is a mess that often made my ears bleed and didn\'t fit with whatever was going on at all. A lot of the tracks are meant to be dubstep but they\'re nothing more than a mixture of unpleasant noises. I can only think of 1 or 2 tracks that I\'ve liked.3) there were a lot of instances where the dialog wasn\'t synced to the characters\' animation, including some lines that were not recorded (we can see the characters reacting but we can only hear silence)Story and characters:1) I\'ve already mentioned why this season never had any chances of being good but I just want to make sure everyone that reads this review understands that after 3 episodes, you\'ll be constantly wondering what the heck is happening, why is it happening, who are these people, why are they doing whatever they\'re doing...  and those questions will never be answered unless you read forums or the Light Novels.2) The best part of the Toaru series (for me) have always been Misaka, Accelerator, Last Order and Kuroko. They barely get any screen time, they barely get any action scenes (and again, those are poorly animated) and the overall enjoyment is really low whenever they aren\'t present.This was a 5/10 for me and excuse me because now I\'ll have to read forums and whatnot to understand whatever the heck I just watched. look at, except for the 1st Accelerator fight and the 11th episode.2) I hate CGI because it breaks immersion for me.

Dropped. Second Season. Dropped. Then decided I wouldn't bother with the third... But then in Railgun T it's kinda sorta implied something might've happened to a MINOR character, which made me decide to watch this.Now for the review[SPOILERS FOR THIS AND RAILGUN S]So basically when I watched this I couldn't help but compare it to Railgun, the pacing is so much worse, the character development is quite a bit worse, and even the animation is worse. I...do love the premise around all the magic and stuff, but when everything else is so much worse it's hard to give Index much credit.Now take into account the death of one of the sister's in Railgun S, I almost cried. It showed how despicable Accelerator truly was and made you immediately care about saving the clones... Meanwhile in the sister's arc of the first season Accelerator is barely shown and the scene showing Touma's trauma isn't touched upon all that much.Anyway back to this season, the thing I completed the season for was solely Frenda's death, and damn Railgun made me more sad by her not responding to a text than this made me. Railgun had her I the spotlight for ONE EPISODE and I cared about her. Meanwhile this show kills her and carries on (literally, a police officer saw her body and ignored it) without batting an eye. That goes to show that terrible pacing I was talking about😪So in summary having magic in this world is cool, and the show itself isn't the worst... it's just terrible compared to Railgun. Sorry that my first review on MAL was just complaining about how much worse this is compared to Railgun, but I really wanted to tell someone how I felt.(oh and yes i decided not to finish this) do love the premise around all the magic and stuff, but when everything else is so much worse it's hard to give Index much credit.Now take into account the death of one of the sister's in Railgun S, I almost cried.

After years of waiting all we got was this mess. It would've been better to just end it with just season 2 and not bother with a third.The pacing is very confusing, almost reminds me of Tokyo Ghoul : Re season 2. Very fast and makes no sense. A lot of the things that happens is questionable, a few main thing is power scaling. Someone who can booty clap on people 1 moment, but after a few hours later (literally says in anime) they're almost on equal footing for a brief moment??? What kind of power up is...that?Very questionable with how some people are perfectly fine, mainly looking at the main character who is JUST A NORMAL HUMAN BEING WITH NO SPECIAL POWERS, somehow gets to second floor underground when there's no elevator and had to have jumped like everyone else yet somehow made it fine??? Trying my best not to spoilEverything in this anime is questionable. Overall not recommended, is confusing with its pacing, they jump from scene to scene and you're left wondering y tho that?Very questionable with how some people are perfectly fine, mainly looking at the main character who is JUST A NORMAL HUMAN BEING WITH NO SPECIAL POWERS, somehow gets to second floor underground when there's no elevator and had to have jumped like everyone else yet somehow made it fine???

I was wondering what sort of adventures Kamijou Touma will have and what opponents will stand in his way.After watching first few episodes i thought what the heck?The plot is all over the place, many new characters appear out of the blue.There's war inside academy city. I was shocked. For starters, why is Accelerator main character?I managed to watch all 26 episodes, but i'm totally sad. The studio really made a crap out of this season. I just hope that if there...will be another season coming, they won't make another blunder like that. will be another season coming, they won't make another blunder like that."", 'LA loves the Index/Railgun franchise, with all it\'s flaws and strengths and this third season is no different...buuuutToaru Majutsu no Index III comes about 7 years from the second season and LA was clamoring for another season with the lukewarm movie and specials to keep LA vested in the franchise, in which LA thought oddly enough the Railgun series, a ""spinoff"" series featuring Misaka was in a ways superior to the Index series. Anyways LA heard lots about the ""World War III arc"" and how great that was so without a doubt LA was hyped by the third season\'s announcement.Ok, so enough brass tax and...let\'s see whether this third season tops any installment of it\'s previous seasons or Railgun by that matter.Progression is the name of the game and man how RUSHED do they pace this anime, without a doubt one of the biggest issues with Toaru Majutsu no Index III is it\'s erratically rushed pacing throughout the anime. But on the upsides the To aru Universe grows with the progression of ALOT of plotlines , new and old woven together into this complex tapestry that leads into the World War III arc.Touma deals with the remaining Four Seats of God members (from the second season) and well things escalate quickly to say the least, from the Four Seats of God attack towards Academy City, from Touma being whisked away to Italy and with the help of Itsuwa, help defeat Terra of the Left then moving along with the Amakusa Church along with Kanzaki helping to subdue Acqua the Back, to Touma going to England to help the Queen of England get the original Curtana back which leads into his confrontation of Fiamma the right which triggers the World War III and Touma going to Russia to save Index and defeat the ""final boss"" Fiamma the Right. To say that Touma gets into a whole lot of trouble is an understatement but yes Touma\'s arcs deal ALOT with the rushed pacing LA aforementioned.Accelerator gets his progression as the ""anti-villain"" in all this as he\'s become a mercenary for Academy City and his ""call"" to World War III is what else, Last order being comatosed and Awaki saying that Fiamma & Russia has the means of stopping Last Order\'s coma and fix her. Accelerator in this season, his sense of ""villainous intent"" is questioned, as he still thinks he\'s a ""villain"" or ""has to be a villain"" in order for him to do what he needs to do and this easily is seen when he interacts with anyone cept Last Order, like Accelerator ""wants"" to be seen as a hero especially towards Last Order, but he just hates the concept of it and rather be the villain, but ""villains"" can only destroy. Much like Touma getting a harem along the way, Accelerator DEFINITELY does this season, smaller than Touma\'s of course but the parallels to his harem is noticeable, as Accelerator already has an ""index"" in the form of Last order, but Misaka comes into the mix and well, this ""Misaka""...is ohh soo WORST in a good way that his chemistry with her is actually quite amusing. But yeah, once again, the rushed pacing of his progression though not as harsh as Touma still lingers, but his progression as a character was a vast improvement, what with season essentially making this a redemption arc for him and seeing the error of his beliefs as a ""villain""Rounding out the trio of main protagonist, we are introduced to Hamazura Shiage a Level 0 much like Touma and a member of ITEM along with Mugino and her co. and Hamazura at first was directly opposite Accelerator due to Hamazura being in the bottom of the totem pole of the Dark Side of Academy City. Once again, the Touma harem parallels are seeping through with him and Hamazura\'s Index comes into form as Takitsubo Rikou, the AIM Stalker user and when Mugino goes utterly rogue, it utterly tears ITEM apart and both Takitsubo and Hamazura has to fend for themselves while both Mugino and GROUP are after them, to say that Hamazura is ALSO unlucky is a freakin\' understatement, but like Touma, he is EXTREMELY lucky at the same time with all the situations he gets himself into. Yes, Mugino is the Misaka of Hamazura harem...no seriously. Like Accelerator, Hamazura wants to save Takitsubo after a defect occurs with Takitsubo and thus takes them to Russia where Fiamma the right is.So with all three main protagonists heading to Russia and Fiamma the Right, incomes World War III and it\'s.........Ok, not amazing or anything but what this climax leads to with the revelation of each of the protagonists and some major fights leading itself it was just fine, LA could see it being MUCH MUCH better but what LA got, it ""mildly satisfied"" LA. Well at least the climax to all this each of the main protagonists goes through tons of development about themselves as well as the relationships and villains that form around them. Accelerator and Hamazura goes through some of the same thing, just in the opposite spectrum alot of the time and some similarities of them wanting to protect those close to them and showing a bit more about themselves, Accelerator of again the aforementioned ""villain dilemma"" and that just doing the right thing is proof enough at times, while Hamazura gets out his inferiority complex and not only wants to protect Takitsubo but everyone (much like Touma). Touma is the only one in LA\'s eyes that gets any intense development what with Touma being somewhat integral to Fiamma the Right, both in ideology and powers, see Fiamma the Right has a ""right hand"" that can create miracles and destroy evil, so in a ways like Touma\'s right hand and Fiamma ""wants to save humanity"" with his plan, but Touma is also tested with what Fiamma\'s idealogy of why when Touma always tells someone to there is always another way besides violence and whatnot and Touma\'s entire ideology of white knighting those he protects are questioned, but strengthened when confronted with Accelerator and his final fight against Fiamma as a result. LA liked the ideological clash and questioning Touma\'s beliefs in justice to say the least in World War III arc along with what Accelerator and Hamazura\'s involvement in all this, it felt like a climax to the majority of the threads, even from the first season to get some major payoff in this arc, without a doubt.What the problem however and say it with LA, the rushed pacing and the long expositions drag this season down and LA thinks it\'s even worse from the second season. Look exposition is necessary, but having entire episode dedicating itself to some much detail just bogs the plot down and slows it down and as a result latter on rushes the arc to finish the quota and quite obviously it leads into confusion at times with how erratically paced it is and it\'s not just World War III arc, it\'s the ENTIRETY of this third season and quite easily this installment is the biggest victim of rushed pacing.The animation done by JC Staff, well LA KNOWS alot of people utterly hated the animation, but to be honest, it was actually decent, flip flopped alot but still decent. See though the animation dips ALOT, JC Staff seemed to have dedicated it\'s animation to World War III arc the most as it has some decent quality control put into it, making it as much of a climax as possible. Yes even the World War III arc does dip in the animation at times, but JC Staff did the best they could in LA\'s eyes and was the probably the most consistent during the World War III arc, but nonetheless some arcs from this third season still had the quality LA was expected from Index, just erratic in places. In all and without ANY bias to JC Staff, the animation was erratic as hell, bottom line.Voice acting at least was great, from Nobuhiko Okamoto\'s screechy Accelerator back at it again, Atsushi Abe as Touma, Rina Satou as Misaka, Satonshi Hiro as Hamazura and Yuuki Takada as Lessar. Toshiyuki Morikawa (wait...YOSHIKAGE KIRA!) as Fiamma the Right was just oozing villany to heck Kei Shidou as Carissa was impressive as well. Seriously LA would be here all day if LA noted everyone that even caught LA\'s interest, so to that the majority of the cast fit the bill, new and returning ones of course and to say that LA was impressed with this voice cast of this magnitude is an understatement...what with how large of an ensemble cast of revolving characters comes along.So, yes To aru Majustu no Index III has a MAJOR MAJOR pacing problem that does utterly cripple this season to no end, LA still sees Railgun as the better series to this front, and towards the Index series, it\'s...unfortunately the worst installment of the franchise, even though it\'s suppose to be the climax to all the plot threads that leads itself into a huge evolution of the majority of the characters, it\'s kinda a damn shame as if it had much better direction and kept consistent animation World War III arc would had been bloody amazing.-sigh- at least there still will be Railgun III and Accelerator spinoff that might carry the mantle of ""best installment of To aru"", but for now that title stays with Railgun II (yeah LA said it).Fukou da To aru Majutsu no Index III...Fukou da... let\'s see whether this third season tops any installment of it\'s previous seasons or Railgun by that matter.Progression is the name of the game and man how RUSHED do they pace this anime, without a doubt one of the biggest issues with Toaru Majutsu no Index III is it\'s erratically rushed pacing throughout the anime.

Turns out that ASCR actually a spinoff of the ""A Certain Magical Index"" & quite enjoy it despite confused by the plotthen in 2017 i heard that the Season 3 of Index is being announced & i\'m a bit of hyped back then.

Let\'s do this.Story: 7/10. The story CONCEPT is really cool. The execution.... heh. We\'ll get to that later.Art: 5/10. I\'ll admit that I\'m no expert on anime artwork. But even I could tell that this seemed.... a bit lackluster? And others appear to have agreed.Sound: 7/10. I\'m actually not as peeved about the sound as some other people are. I thought it was fine, and had some good moments.Character: 4/10. Oh boy. Here we go. Look, the main characters who we ACTUALLY care about are lovely. Touma, Index, Mikoto, Accelerator, Hamazura, Kanzaki, Itsuwa, Stiyl, Tsuchimikado, Kuroko, Uhiharu, Last Order,...Miguno, Misaka Worst, Fiamma, Crowley,.... And I\'m sure that I\'m still missing some others. Now, you might be thinking, ""Wow! That\'s a LOT of characters! Surely, they can make a compelling story from that alone!"" Hah. Yes, maybe in the first two seasons, that was somewhat the case. But in Index III, there are tons of new characters introduced in very quick intervals, and many of them hardly get any explanation or are killed off almost as soon as they show up. By the end, your head is spinning trying to keep track of who\'s who and who\'s fighting for which side and what the motivations are. And that leads me to.....Enjoyment: 5/10. This is going to seem more like a continuation of the \'character\' category, but there\'s a reason for that. The storyline is enjoyable in concept, and would have probably gotten at least a 7 or an 8 out of 10 from me, if not higher. But its *execution* with its characters is just.... yuck. I already mentioned how this show likes to throw more characters at you than you\'re able to shake a stick at. But furthermore, half of their motivations are hardly even explored. Now, this might not be the end of the world, except for one teensy little problem. This anime has made a staple out of bad guys being redeemed as good guys CONSTANTLY. Well, it\'s not very enjoyable when a bad guy just suddenly does a 180 degree turn and starts fighting for the good guys for no real descernable reason. When there is little to no exploration as to WHY the bad guy\'s motivations have changed for the better, it just comes off as confusing and cheap. Plus, people like Touma are always just punching people and giving them little pep- talks which seem to change everything in the course of 30 seconds or less. The first two seasons seemed to just barely keep this in a reasonable balance which kept it right below the threshold of absurdity. But this 3rd season just blew the freaking lid off.Overall: 5/10. I still love this franchise. And for that, I\'ll rate it as \'average\' instead of anything below average. But I\'m sure as hell not going to put it above average either. This season was so unbelieveably rushed, with so many characters and arcs flashing before your eys faster than you can even comprehend what\'s supposed to be going on. Many folks seemed to have been fairly lost this season, me included. Add to that the fact that even our beloved staple characters, let alone the side characters, seem to just be doing random stuff all the time and switching between good guys and bad guys at the drop of a dime, with no real explanation of WHY their motivations have suddenly done a 180 turn in 30 seconds.... yeah. No. Miguno, Misaka Worst, Fiamma, Crowley,.... And I\'m sure that I\'m still missing some others. Now, you might be thinking, ""Wow! That\'s a LOT of characters!

No.', ""Ok Imma keep this short since most reviews have already said what I wanted to.Story: 5The original was supposed to be good, like there was a lot, and by a lot I mean A LOT of character development, especially for the side of Accelerator and Hamazura BUT the anime skipped over it like what? The pace was also way too fast, like really. There were times where I expected the anime to pause to a character's emotion and the like to emphasis something but NOPE.Art:4A lot of inconsistencies. Heck, I noticed Terra of the left suddenly had white flour/ash whatever in his back...when the rest of the scenes show that he doesn't have them. There were also a few scenes that weren't really up to par. Not to mention the fight scenes where I expected really EPIC STUFF to happen.Sound: 9Ngl, it was awesome. Even though the rest were bad, I loved how they developed the sounds to fit the scenarios and the like. Still, it doesn't really bring up the disappointment for the rest of the series.Character: 3THE DEVELOPMENT WAS LOST REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Ngl, the unofficial groups in the darkness of academy city were skipped/skimmed over. By a lot.Enjoyment: 5I still enjoyed it. I mean, it's fun to see some scenes you were expecting to turn into an anime, but it still hits you hard if it's really REALLY disappointing.Overall: 5Heck, I'm really disappointed though.

I am afraid the 3rd is awful. To be frank I have no idea what it is about, who half of the characters are or what they are even trying to achieve by resurrecting the show.To be fair the artwork is still very good and the OP is enjoyable and even Touma is pretty much the same as he was...in the other series. However, Index has become a pain, all she does is irritate and seems to add nothing to the story. Story? there is one? I wish I knew what it was supposed to be about.  I was hoping to oggle Misaka too while I was about it, but she is really just eye candy with no real definable role.I will be honest and admit that this is a waste of time, I have watched up to the 12th episode and I am sure that if I watch the last episode and nothing inbetween I will not have missed much. The current rambling discourse is some mumbo jumbo in England, but what the back story to it is I have no idea.Nope, I am dropping this one, it does not even come close to the first series all those years ago, this is really a dead horse that should have never been made. in the other series.

I would say that its my favourite of the 3.As an anime only viewer, I dont think its as confusing as other reviews make it out to be. It has a faster pace but in my opinion thats very welcome with the other seasons feeling too slow. Only one arc stands out to me as a little rushed and undeveloped and thats the battle royale arc (eps 4-6).This season was super entertaining, it had a faster pace, two new interesting protoganists, exciting storylines that felt progressive and its lack of...downtime/filler episodes made it very enjoyable. downtime/filler episodes made it very enjoyable.', 'I want to make it clear that I am a Railgun fan. I like Railgun. Railgun S & T in particular are fantastic shows. Which makes it all the more baffling as to how a spinoff show like Railgun came to be hundreds of times better than the original source material, which is Index.Here\'s the TLDR short answer: This season of Index is bad. But a lot of the problems with this show are actually the same as they were for seasons 1 and 2 of Index. Many corners are cut on the animation (unlike with Railgun), the direction is terrible (unlike with Railgun), the...writing is lazy and nonsensical (unlike with Railgun), there is noticeable filler dialogue where the characters repeat themselves or shout a bunch to pad out the runtime, the characters are underdeveloped and are mostly token baubles, so much happens and yet it is mostly just filler and serves no purpose outside of bloating the number of characters in the cast. The reason why people are making a fuss about this season more than the others is that in addition to being bad (which is a given apparently), the studio also butchered the source material this time around, to the point where the ""Battle Royale Arc"" - which I gather is well regarded in the books - is made into an indecipherable garbled mess.Otherwise, the show has some parts that are better than past seasons, and parts that are significantly worse. If you liked previous Magical Index seasons and haven\'t read the books, you will probably like this show. It\'s fine to like the idea of this show, I think. But if you think that it\'s actually unironically good, might I recommend that you watch something more like Railgun S & T (if you haven\'t already) to get a better grasp on what the genre can offer when it\'s firing on all cylinders.Now for some HOT TAKES:- Index shouldn\'t be in the show. She\'s not a character, she\'s not likeable, she does nothing, she\'s utterly pointless. She\'s what the show is named after, yet you could remove her from the plot and almost nothing would change. And the author makes no effort to remedy this at any point. She is ""I\'m hungry"" and ""I bite you when I\'m angry (\'cause get it, I\'m hungry)"" the character. It was a case of a joke that was never funny and never will be funny. Random ""towel girl"" crush Itsuwa is just the superior character and arguably what Index should have been from the outset. The time we get with Itsuwa is one of the bright spots of this season, even though it\'s relatively pointless and she will probably be demoted back down into being little more than a cameo again in future. Imagine if we wrote Itsuwa out of the script for this season, and instead gave all of her character development and character moments to Index herself. It would fix so many problems with the show, and make Index more human, but the author doesn\'t care, why would he care? He\'s too busy adding in horny middleschooler jailbait number #55 as a pointless throwaway cameo, he can\'t sacrifice that to work on his actual characters.- Misaka Mikoto shouldn\'t be in the show. She\'s not a character, she\'s not likeable, she does nothing, she\'s utterly pointless. She\'s the number 2 girl and number 1 waifu in the show, so popular that she got her own spinoff title, yet she is entirely sidelined in Index and is just turned into a mindless simp for Touma (the MC). Compare that to Misaka in Railgun, who is genuinely an amazing character, a nuanced and relatable protagonist with an incredibly interesting and versatile powerset, and who has meaningful character development and heartfelt relationships with the people around her. Utterly wasted in this show.- Touma is an asshole. In Railgun, things are different: he comes across as an apologetic bumbling average nice guy who\'s trying to do the right thing while muddling through life, and he is hot enough and helpful enough to attract Misaka\'s attention, but he manages to make her feel flustered and embarrassed, leading to her overreacting and being a bit of a Tsundere. It\'s a solid dynamic. Unfortunately, if you watch Index, this is recontextualised: the only reason why he achieves this likeable impression is because we don\'t get to hear his whiny self-righteous inner monologue, which upon being exposed to, quickly makes him come across as being a bit insufferable. He\'s painfully generic as a protagonist, and spends his entire time using very basic logic to demolish the hilariously nonsensical worldviews of (insert villain of the week). The author sets up a strawman and then has Touma beat it down with one punch. Every single scenario that Touma gets involved with has him giving a self-righteous lecture, which is usually just common sense that everyone in the audience was already thinking upon analysing the villain\'s laughably stupid worldview, that is resolved with the same stock standard punch to the face. And it happens over and over and over and over and over again. As a formula, it was stale during season 1, it was stale during season 2, and it is even more stale now in season 3. I guess they thought it would be like a running gag, in that it gets funnier over time because of how ridiculous it is? Or maybe they are just appealing to the domestic violence fetish crowd, punching them ladies in the face.- Hamazura shouldn\'t be in the show, yet he is elevated to co-protagonist status in this season. He\'s basically just Touma, but with a sleazy criminal past and no powers. This arguably makes him more interesting than Touma in some small ways, as him being a normal guy means he has to be smarter than just punching his problems. But the thing is, he isn\'t different enough to be his own thing, and you could remove him from the plot completely and nothing about it would really change, he\'s just off doing his own mediocre filler content. He was also always the least interesting person in ITEM, so putting the focus on him rather than the girls that people liked is not good. ITEM are the characters most affected by the butchering of the Battle Royale arc, and it\'s extra painful to watch them as a result of that after the arc has concluded.- Last Order is underserved. It was a real highlight in previous seasons that after Accelerator gets brain damage, he is tied into the MISAKA network so that he can think more clearly and use them to perform the complex calculations he needs to use his powers. It was also supposed to be a nerf that gave him some interesting limitations. Unfortunately, in the Accelerator show and also in this season, they just ignore these limitations entirely and he\'s basically just as strong as ever. That is lame. It would be nice if Last Order (as the control tower of the MISAKA network) could be more proactive in helping him use his powers. Even if it\'s just her having to concentrate real hard when he\'s doing some particularly monumental feat. She also needs more moments of actually contributing to the plot, she\'s basically just a little cuteness bubble that floats around vaguely nearby Accelerator now and again. Her and Accelerator are two more characters that are greatly affected by the butchering of the Battle Royale arc, which is deeply disappointing, as they get so few moments together as it is.- Magic shouldn\'t be a secret. If there is a cold war between the forces of Magic and the forces of Science (plus the English weasels who side with Science against Magic even though they themselves are a Magic faction, although in fairness that\'s totally in character for the real life C of E, and I\'m allowed to say this because I\'m English) then have everyone in the world know what the stakes are, even if they don\'t know the full scope of what is going on or how any of it works. It\'s ludicrous to have had Accelerator interact with magic users in depth on multiple occasions prior to this, and then make a plot point of Season 3 that he has no concept that magic even exists still. It\'s a ludicrous proposition.- The morality in Season 3 is utterly mad. It\'s out of control on drugs, while having a seizure. That\'s the only way I can describe it. Multiple instances where characters get to murder people and/or attempt to murder countless innocent people and yet they are forgiven unconditionally just like that. Characters get to torture people and that\'s just swell. But lie to protect someone\'s feelings? Damn, man, that\'s just unforgiveable, how will you ever live with yourself? Hold on, I\'ve just got to sacrifice my life to rescue this mass-murderer over here, maybe that\'ll help make up for my lie. Utterly bonkers.- Teenagers are horny. It is okay to portray teenagers as being a bit horny if it is within character and makes sense within the fiction, because yes, it is true to real life, for better or for worse. It is not okay to have 13-year-olds randomly perform strip-teases directly to the audience for no in-character reason, just because on a meta-level the show wants to declare: ""And this is for all you sweet beautiful paedophiles out there!"" I don\'t like the show consistently treating me like a paedo, it\'s gross. Now, this has always been a problem with Index/Railgun, it has always walked uncomfortably close to that line and even crossed it occasionally before now, but Season 3 of Index walks waaaaay over the line multiple times. Author, you can include ""fanservice"" without making it this genuinely creepy (and downright lazy to boot). Please desist.- I\'m gonna be vague about this last one, although maybe don\'t read it just in case if you haven\'t watched the show yet: Characters should be allowed to die occasionally. Without the prospect of death (or at least severe consequences), there are no stakes, and if there are no stakes, the audience has no investment in what is going on. There has always been some death in the show, of course. But it isn\'t utilised at all well. To the point where people make it out alive from situations where logically they should 100% be dead. This harms the credibility of the show, and this season is particularly guilty of that. Although as has been mentioned above, it instead lectures to you that ""you\'re a bad person for thinking some of them probably should die"" while it does it. And when there is death, it tends to be incredibly arbitrary and is done without any adequate explanation or fanfare. It\'s like: ""People might have liked that character. They were cool. And yet you just did that to them out of nowhere and moved on. And you also let all of those other cringe characters survive ridiculous situations, or deliberately spared them, when people don\'t like them nearly as much. Huh. What a bizarre creative decision that was.""I sincerely hope this show gets better. Three seasons and a movie, and it\'s not done it yet. But as one of the other reviewers put it, I\'m clinging on for dear life, even though it seems like there\'s no hope. If you\'ve come this far into Index, either you\'re like me (in which case, what we are doing is questionable, but I guess stay strong), or you are somehow able to look past its problems, in which case, you may yet get some small joy out of it (and I suppose to be generous, I hope you do). writing is lazy and nonsensical (unlike with Railgun), there is noticeable filler dialogue where the characters repeat themselves or shout a bunch to pad out the runtime, the characters are underdeveloped and are mostly token baubles, so much happens and yet it is mostly just filler and serves no purpose outside of bloating the number of characters in the cast.

Without the prospect of death (or at least severe consequences), there are no stakes, and if there are no stakes, the audience has no investment in what is going on. There has always been some death in the show, of course. But it isn\'t utilised at all well. To the point where people make it out alive from situations where logically they should 100% be dead. This harms the credibility of the show, and this season is particularly guilty of that. Although as has been mentioned above, it instead lectures to you that ""you\'re a bad person for thinking some of them probably should die"" while it does it. And when there is death, it tends to be incredibly arbitrary and is done without any adequate explanation or fanfare. It\'s like: ""People might have liked that character. They were cool. And yet you just did that to them out of nowhere and moved on. And you also let all of those other cringe characters survive ridiculous situations, or deliberately spared them, when people don\'t like them nearly as much. Huh. What a bizarre creative decision that was.""I sincerely hope this show gets better. Three seasons and a movie, and it\'s not done it yet. But as one of the other reviewers put it, I\'m clinging on for dear life, even though it seems like there\'s no hope. If you\'ve come this far into Index, either you\'re like me (in which case, what we are doing is questionable, but I guess stay strong), or you are somehow able to look past its problems, in which case, you may yet get some small joy out of it (and I suppose to be generous, I hope you do).', 'Throughout my life as an otaku I have witnessed many anime(over 250 if I may say). However A certain magical Index has by far piqued my interest the most. It’s ability to create unique characters whom can’t be catergerized as simply hero’s or villains, but individual protagonists of their own inherent stories. In this sense a Certain Magical index is not a story of a boy with the ability to nullify the supernatural, but a boy and the people he has affected with not just his power but his weakness. The story focuses on Toma Kamijo, a boy who in my opinion is one of...the greatest anime protagonist of all time. An individual whom is sucked into the world of magic and esper abilities. The thing that I find most striking is that his ability of nullifying the supernatural is neither an offense or defencive ability. In its stead his ability is the ability to make overpowered characters unoverpowerd. In other words this is a story not of an individual with fighting potential but in its stead a story of an individual tearing down the small logic of our worlds, of those with exceptional capabilities and revealing just how stupid we are as individuals, and how admirable.StoryThe story is good in the sense that it’s ability to utilize phenomenon and other fundamental ideologies to produce a logical plot line is amazing. However the terminology and requirements for understanding this are high level.

The details that are shown don\'t correspond with the actions surrounding them, and on a few occasions facial emotion and character actions are completely disconnect from the voice acting and context of the story (Think Touma saying in a pained voice ""No!"" as someone falls down a cliff, but his face...is deadpan like a fish).

I also want to explain that my opinion is solely based on just the anime series itself as a whole, as I'm not familiar with the material from the manga.Now, from the get-go starting in season I, I saw a lot of potential in this anime as the world seemed pretty interesting and I really liked the idea of everyone having their own skillset and special abilities to bring to the table. It wasn't until...the first arc ended that I pretty much started to nitpick common tropes and gags that didn't fit in with what I like in my anime. The characters had a lot of annoying and childish moments, the main mc is a stereotypical and op spokesperson of justice who also has uncanny resilience and endurance for being a lvl 0 esper, and of course the dreaded fan service. This pretty much carries on into Index II, and by the time I was in that season I noticed I'm just kind of watching arcs happen with no real master plan or goal in toe. Eventually, midway through the season I found myself skimming each episode and inferred what probably happened. And as someone who's a stickler for needing to know everything that happens down to post credit scenes, I just didn't care anymore. But I was already so well invested in the universe that I had to see each installment through (and believe me if Railgun S wasn't able to turn the tides as it did, this would probably be my last season watched in said universe).Now for Index III. After my experience with RS, I thought going back to the male mc side of the story I should at least finally expect better art/animation style and fight scenes. Wrong. Both were just as sub par as previous Index seasons. Another downfall was the convoluted story I was looking for, suddenly made its appearance for this season and all it ended up doing was spew an overwhelming amount of information and world lingo I had no interest in making myself familiar with. A bunch of interesting characters with decent art design and failed potential just kept getting added and I felt as if I missed something. I can't help but wonder maybe it would've been more bearable if the structure was shared with the first two seasons, just so it didn't feel like so much in just one season. I can see the story had so much to offer, but unfortunately loading most of it out into one season didn't seem to pay off. All of this structure change this season, and they still found a way for the mc to finish off every intimidating boss with a punch to the face....Story: 6.5I believe, as I stated previous, the world had a lot to offer and if the previous seasons could've included some of the characters and storyline that was barely made aware this season, it could've been something great if I'm being honest.Art: 5Nothing special. Especially coming out after RS. The animation in the fight scenes could've been more fluid, but unfortunately it wasn't.Sound: 8I will actually praise the soundtrack I think when the intensity of a scene calls for something dramatic, the music definitely delivers. Also the sound affects really made a difference in the fight scenes but all in all wasn't enough to save the quality of the fights themselves.Characters: 5Don't really care for the mc or index, but all other characters had so much potential with decent character design, attitude, drive, and abilities. Too bad it was all wasted in an effort to quickly wrap up their respective arcs.Enjoyment: 3Watching each season besides RS felt like a chore. By the time I got to Index III, I skimmed each and every episode just to really get down to business and it was slightly less aggravating to deal with that way.Overall: 6I'm going to be really fair and give this specific season a 6 just because it had the elements to be the best Index season, it just didn't pay off at all and unless theres going to be an Index IV I'm happy to be able to move on to RT & Accelerator and finally be done with this franchise. the first arc ended that I pretty much started to nitpick common tropes and gags that didn't fit in with what I like in my anime.

You\'d be better served watching a summary of the light novels by someone on youtube.  I\'m not much of a light novel reader, but I will probably do so for this one since so much was skipped in this adaptation.As others have said, something like 9 light novels are crammed into 26 episodes.  Any semblance of a cohesive story is gone.  Scenes jump around, there are exposition dumps, and new characters to the series don\'t have any of their backstories or motivations explained.  Even old characters like Accelerator have their narrative arcs and motivations...simplified.I\'ll give an example.  There is literally one scene in the middle of an episode where Toma says, ""I got out of the city, and I managed to board a train."" And this is supposed to explain how Toma got to that point after he was chasing down a group of terrorists in London.  Why are you on the train Toma?  What did you do with the terrorists?  Where is your intended destination?  The world may never know.  But we don\'t have time to care because now he needs to escape the train with some girl he meets two seconds later.

It also might contain a couple of spoilers for those seasons.Overview:“A Certain Magical Index” is, in my humble opinion, one of the most underrated anime series ever created. While even a die-hard fan like myself can admit that it has its flaws, it has nevertheless managed to keep a special place in my heart over the years. The reasons for this include, but are not limited to, a fantastic setting, consistently fascinating “magic vs. science” conflicts, brilliant fight scenes and, perhaps most importantly, its expert handling of an increasingly large and diverse...cast of characters. Released over eight years after the second season, season 3 has just about managed to maintain what the series does best while at the same time expanding on the franchise’s world and concluding what was started in its predecessors.Story & World (8.5/10):Continuing after Touma and Index thwarted an invasion of Academy City at the end of the second season, season 3 opens with the unlikely duo hoping to return to a normal life, or at least as normal as it gets in city filled with teenagers who utilize supernatural psychic powers on a daily basis. That hope, however, is short-lived when the two, Touma in particular, end up coming into conflict with the Right Seat of God, a quartet of extremely powerful sorcerers who were responsible for the aforementioned invasion, with Touma having fought and defeated one of their members. Now the rest of the organization is plotting various things that threaten far more than just a mere city, and it is up to Touma and his ever-growing group of friends and allies to stop them. At the same time, Level 5 esper Accelerator and Level 0 Shiage Hamazura both encounter their own problems, and- surprise, surprise- these problems eventually turn out to have a connection to Touma\'s, evolving into a sinister conspiracy that threatens to reshape the entire world.One thing that season 3 has going for it in comparison to its predecessors is that the focus is taken away from Academy City in order to focus on other parts of the world. In three of the six major story arcs, which together make up about two-thirds of the whole season, Touma and others travel to different countries in order to stop whatever threat looms large there. Not only does this allow for more intricate world-building, since we get to see what different parts of the world of ""Index"" are like and how they compare to Academy City, but it also makes for more unique set-pieces, particularly for those who are tired of the characters going down the same old corridors or streets. It also makes perfect sense within the context of the story since, as I mentioned already, the conspiracies that are uncovered threaten far more than just Academy City. And while I understand that I\'m probably being a little vague, that\'s because it\'s hard to delve into the story without giving away major spoilers, so it\'s better to just watch the series and figure things out for yourself.Unfortunately, that\'s precisely where the story problems lie. ""A Certain Magical Index"" has always been a fast-paced series, but the third season manages to surpass even those standards, and that\'s not a good thing. This is largely due to the fact that it tries to cram 9 light novels worth of content into 26 episodes, resulting in quite a few parts of the series going a little too quickly for my liking and some aspects of the story being pretty confusing, which will force you to do some outside digging, either by reading the novels or the wiki of the series, to truly understand certain parts. While I personally didn\'t mind doing this, and didn\'t find I had to do it too often, I can nevertheless understand if it\'s something you just don\'t want to do. Pacing problems notwithstanding, the plot still kept me invested enough to watch it all the way to the end, and while there are still a few questions and loose ends even in the final episode, the story as a whole is wrapped up decently enough that I honestly wouldn\'t mind if they don\'t make another season.Art & Animation (9/10):""A Certain Magical Index"" has always had fantastic art, which is surprising considering it\'s animated by J.C. Staff, who while not hated, aren\'t exactly favourites within the anime community when it comes to studios. Season 3 has just about managed to keep up with those high standards, in some ways even surpassing them since it lacks the occasional rough edges of its predecessors. That being said, there are some occasional stiff animations, particularly during fight scenes, though you would most likely have to look very hard in order to notice these. I probably wouldn\'t have noticed them at all if they weren\'t pointed out to me by someone, which in turn had them pointed out to him by someone else.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):""A Certain Magical Index"" season 3\'s soundtrack is fantastic. Not only are the two opening themes (""Gravitation and ""Roar"") and two ending themes (""Kakumei Zenya"" and ""Owaranai Uta"") very memorable and well worth listening to, but the season features a lot of stellar tracks throughout, with ""Madness"", ""Kiseki Oshinjite"" and ""Oitsume Rarete"" being only a few examples. The voice acting is just as excellent, and thankfully, with a few minor exceptions, every voice actor from the previous seasons reprises their role here and deliver performances just as great as always, particularly Micah Solusod and Monica Rial, the voices of Touma and Index, respectively. As a whole, everything about the series sounds great and consistently pleasing to the ears, not that I would have expected any less.Characters (9.5/10):While the four main characters of the first two seasons all return for this one, they are joined by a fifth addition, Shiage Hamazura. Some of you might remember him since he made an appearance at the end of the previous season, where he was a member of an esper-hating gang called Skill-Out before he had some sense beaten into him (both literally and figuratively) by Touma. When we first see Shiage again, he\'s become the lapdog of an esper criminal group called ITEM, and is thinking about what Touma said to him, namely how he should be trying to make a real difference instead of lashing out for what he doesn\'t have. Upon realising that Touma was right, Shiage proceeds to do exactly that in his own unique way. Indeed, due to the fact that he doesn\'t have any powers, not even a unique one like Touma, Shiage\'s solutions and approach to problems are completely unlike almost any other character in the series, with him relying on stealth, trickery and whatever tools he can get his hands on to defeat his enemies, many of whom are far more powerful than he is. Some of the ways he comes up with to outwit people are damned ingenious, which makes him very entertaining to watch. Besides his methods, Shiage\'s motives also differ greatly from other characters- while Touma helps others because it\'s the right thing to do and Accelerator helps people to atone for his sins, Shiage focuses mainly on protecting those he cares about, in particular his love interest Rikou Takitsubo, a Level 4 esper and a member of ITEM who defects with him. The fact that he\'s in love with an esper despite initially hating them is as heartwarming as it is ironic, and the two share some very sweet moments together, with the lengths Shiage will go to protect Rikou being almost as admirable as Touma\'s willingness to help anyone. Character-wise, Shiage is ultimately the weakest of the quintet for the simple fact that he feels pretty tacked-on in comparison to Index, Touma, Mikoto and Accelerator, all of whom we\'ve been getting to know since the first season. However, that\'s not to say he\'s a bad character by any stretch. I found him to be a far better surrogate for the audience than Saten from ""Railgun"" and his arc is used sparingly enough that he never overstays his welcome.I\'ve always loved the series for its highly interesting villains, and in that regard, this season easily delivers what I have come to expect, featuring a number of great antagonists that brilliantly tie in to the themes that have been set up by the series thus far. The main villain in particular has all the right ingredients that make him worthy of such a status- he more than lives up to the threat he\'s built up to be, is a great foil to the protagonist Touma (granted, this isn\'t essential but it definitely helps) and, above all else, has a clear, comprehensible motive and end-goal. Unfortunately, I can\'t really say anything concrete without spoiling something so it\'s best that you see things for yourself. Granted, there are some villains who just go around wreaking havoc and killing people for petty reasons, but they are few in number and tend not to last long.As a whole, the characters are easily just as good and well-written as I\'ve come to expect from this series, with the season giving the new characters their chance in the spotlight without taking it away from the old characters we\'ve grown to know and love. While not everyone gets their chance to shine, and there are still a few characters the show could do without, that\'s honestly to be expected considering the absolutely massive size of the cast. I personally think the series does a pretty damn good job at handling such an absolutely whopping cast of characters, though your mileage might vary.Enjoyment (9/10):""A Certain Magical Index""\'s first two seasons had me laughing my ass off more than once, and this third season easily manages to be just as funny and entertaining, if not more so. Undoubtedly my favourite parts are when the series subverts the typical running gags we\'ve come to expect from the series, resulting in moments that somehow manage to be even funnier than if they had just gone along with the gag. The action is also just as epic and frantic as it\'s always been, with some of later fights in particular being some of the strongest the series has ever seen.Overall:Season 3 of ""A Certain Magical Index"" is everything I had come to expect, bringing enough new to the table to keep the formula from getting stale while also bringing what was established from the beginning to a great, if somewhat open, conclusion. There isn\'t anything particularly outstanding in comparison to its predecessor but there didn\'t really need to be, especially since the quality I\'ve come to expect is pretty damn high. Basically, if you\'re a hardcore ""Index"" fan like myself, this season is an absolute must-watch. Just don\'t everything to make sense unless you\'re willing to do a little digging.Score:8.5+9+9+9.5+9=45/50=9.0/10Mean Score: 9.0/10 cast of characters. Released over eight years after the second season, season 3 has just about managed to maintain what the series does best while at the same time expanding on the franchise’s world and concluding what was started in its predecessors.Story & World (8.5/10):Continuing after Touma and Index thwarted an invasion of Academy City at the end of the second season, season 3 opens with the unlikely duo hoping to return to a normal life, or at least as normal as it gets in city filled with teenagers who utilize supernatural psychic powers on a daily basis. That hope, however, is short-lived when the two, Touma in particular, end up coming into conflict with the Right Seat of God, a quartet of extremely powerful sorcerers who were responsible for the aforementioned invasion, with Touma having fought and defeated one of their members. Now the rest of the organization is plotting various things that threaten far more than just a mere city, and it is up to Touma and his ever-growing group of friends and allies to stop them. At the same time, Level 5 esper Accelerator and Level 0 Shiage Hamazura both encounter their own problems, and- surprise, surprise- these problems eventually turn out to have a connection to Touma\'s, evolving into a sinister conspiracy that threatens to reshape the entire world.One thing that season 3 has going for it in comparison to its predecessors is that the focus is taken away from Academy City in order to focus on other parts of the world. In three of the six major story arcs, which together make up about two-thirds of the whole season, Touma and others travel to different countries in order to stop whatever threat looms large there. Not only does this allow for more intricate world-building, since we get to see what different parts of the world of ""Index"" are like and how they compare to Academy City, but it also makes for more unique set-pieces, particularly for those who are tired of the characters going down the same old corridors or streets. It also makes perfect sense within the context of the story since, as I mentioned already, the conspiracies that are uncovered threaten far more than just Academy City. And while I understand that I\'m probably being a little vague, that\'s because it\'s hard to delve into the story without giving away major spoilers, so it\'s better to just watch the series and figure things out for yourself.Unfortunately, that\'s precisely where the story problems lie. ""A Certain Magical Index"" has always been a fast-paced series, but the third season manages to surpass even those standards, and that\'s not a good thing. This is largely due to the fact that it tries to cram 9 light novels worth of content into 26 episodes, resulting in quite a few parts of the series going a little too quickly for my liking and some aspects of the story being pretty confusing, which will force you to do some outside digging, either by reading the novels or the wiki of the series, to truly understand certain parts. While I personally didn\'t mind doing this, and didn\'t find I had to do it too often, I can nevertheless understand if it\'s something you just don\'t want to do. Pacing problems notwithstanding, the plot still kept me invested enough to watch it all the way to the end, and while there are still a few questions and loose ends even in the final episode, the story as a whole is wrapped up decently enough that I honestly wouldn\'t mind if they don\'t make another season.Art & Animation (9/10):""A Certain Magical Index"" has always had fantastic art, which is surprising considering it\'s animated by J.C. Staff, who while not hated, aren\'t exactly favourites within the anime community when it comes to studios. Season 3 has just about managed to keep up with those high standards, in some ways even surpassing them since it lacks the occasional rough edges of its predecessors. That being said, there are some occasional stiff animations, particularly during fight scenes, though you would most likely have to look very hard in order to notice these. I probably wouldn\'t have noticed them at all if they weren\'t pointed out to me by someone, which in turn had them pointed out to him by someone else.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):""A Certain Magical Index"" season 3\'s soundtrack is fantastic. Not only are the two opening themes (""Gravitation and ""Roar"") and two ending themes (""Kakumei Zenya"" and ""Owaranai Uta"") very memorable and well worth listening to, but the season features a lot of stellar tracks throughout, with ""Madness"", ""Kiseki Oshinjite"" and ""Oitsume Rarete"" being only a few examples. The voice acting is just as excellent, and thankfully, with a few minor exceptions, every voice actor from the previous seasons reprises their role here and deliver performances just as great as always, particularly Micah Solusod and Monica Rial, the voices of Touma and Index, respectively. As a whole, everything about the series sounds great and consistently pleasing to the ears, not that I would have expected any less.Characters (9.5/10):While the four main characters of the first two seasons all return for this one, they are joined by a fifth addition, Shiage Hamazura. Some of you might remember him since he made an appearance at the end of the previous season, where he was a member of an esper-hating gang called Skill-Out before he had some sense beaten into him (both literally and figuratively) by Touma. When we first see Shiage again, he\'s become the lapdog of an esper criminal group called ITEM, and is thinking about what Touma said to him, namely how he should be trying to make a real difference instead of lashing out for what he doesn\'t have. Upon realising that Touma was right, Shiage proceeds to do exactly that in his own unique way. Indeed, due to the fact that he doesn\'t have any powers, not even a unique one like Touma, Shiage\'s solutions and approach to problems are completely unlike almost any other character in the series, with him relying on stealth, trickery and whatever tools he can get his hands on to defeat his enemies, many of whom are far more powerful than he is. Some of the ways he comes up with to outwit people are damned ingenious, which makes him very entertaining to watch. Besides his methods, Shiage\'s motives also differ greatly from other characters- while Touma helps others because it\'s the right thing to do and Accelerator helps people to atone for his sins, Shiage focuses mainly on protecting those he cares about, in particular his love interest Rikou Takitsubo, a Level 4 esper and a member of ITEM who defects with him. The fact that he\'s in love with an esper despite initially hating them is as heartwarming as it is ironic, and the two share some very sweet moments together, with the lengths Shiage will go to protect Rikou being almost as admirable as Touma\'s willingness to help anyone. Character-wise, Shiage is ultimately the weakest of the quintet for the simple fact that he feels pretty tacked-on in comparison to Index, Touma, Mikoto and Accelerator, all of whom we\'ve been getting to know since the first season. However, that\'s not to say he\'s a bad character by any stretch. I found him to be a far better surrogate for the audience than Saten from ""Railgun"" and his arc is used sparingly enough that he never overstays his welcome.I\'ve always loved the series for its highly interesting villains, and in that regard, this season easily delivers what I have come to expect, featuring a number of great antagonists that brilliantly tie in to the themes that have been set up by the series thus far.

We\'re treated to several different story archs, most of which are fun to watch. You\'ll find that it does jump between archs a bit abruptly, but since some of the archs are supposed to be happening at the same time, I didn\'t find that a distraction.The issue comes as the stories being...to converge. Once again, the series\' pacing issues return. What ends up happening is the final arch feels more like a ""stuff every character"" set of episodes. It\'s so bad that you have a few characters show up and literally serve no purpose, like Mikoto Misika. Then you have other characters go from being bad to good at literally the snap of a finger. Hardly the transition any character deserves in media. It\'s truly a shame because the smaller archs are some of the best in the series, in my opinion. ITEM, Accelerator and Index all have great sub archs that are over shadowed by the slop that is the large arch.Art remains the same as before, if not slightly better as does sound. They are both far from perfect, but don\'t detract from the overall enjoyment.Characters slip a bit. Mikoto\'s useless cameo in the end plot is distracting and Accelerator continues to be a weak character. The continued persistence that he is a ""villian"" and his growth out of that ""phase"" just lacks the authenticity to make it feel genuine. Lest I forget the main villian\'s 360 at the flick of a light switch.Overall, I enjoyed Index III until the final few episodes of the final arch, where everything felt rushed and gave me a bit of whiplash. If you liked the rest of the Raildex universe, you\'ll also enjoy Index III. I think the show is worth it for the decent sub plots, but suffers gravely with the final major arch, leading it to come up short of being something magical. to converge.

Lets start off with how Tsuchimikado in the beggining is fighting off mechs from academy city when im pretty sure a few eps later he is fighting in Aleister's side. Then theres Uiharu, which doesnt even question why last order looks so much like Misaka and keeps refering to herself as Misaka. This next part of what im about to say ive heard it gets explained in the LN and that its just Index...III being rushed, but Mugino just straight up kills Frenda in cold blood when in Railgun she was really chill with the rest of the group, so they rushed that really hard. And finally, in ep 5 the girl with teleporting powers (whom i forgot the name of but you probably know who im talking about) teleported the pins inside a guy and next scene she has to fight hand on hand with the girl who didnt want to take hostages, when she couldve done the same to her as she did with the guy. Also, im pretty sure its not just me but the story is just being so hard to follow that even me who was able to understand the entire Monogatari series is completely lost. These are all my thoughts so far, now onto the review.Story: 1Very hard to follow even for someone who has binged the entire series before watching.Art:6Theres not much to say about the art, its just averageSound: 6The openings are very good through out the entire series but unlike most people, i rate sound by sound effects. Touma's right hand now has a new sound effect when it sucks in magic, most people dislike it compared to the original, but in my opinion it sounds eargasmic, even tho it does sound a bit like someone put their ass on the mic and their fart got edited a bit. the reason I put sound lower than what im saying is because of Sphynx's meow. it just sounds like some random effect they got from the internet and sometimes he sounds more like a tiger instead of a cat. the quality on that is not very good.Characters: 8Unlike most people, I prefer Touma and Misaka more than Accelerator. Personally I find the characters in this series to make it more enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately one of my favourites die (her name starts with an F) but by the time im writing this the three mains and Misaka 1032 are still alive (thankfully).Enjoyment: 3this would've been at a 2 if the characters were just a bit lower. but the story is just centered around action, making the writing lower than it should be (unlike Railgun where they actually follow the plot and give explanations to most things)Overall: 2Very bad story, disappointment for a railgun series fan such as myself. I recommend watching Railgun first to not get spoiled of the things that happen in there (since railgun is mostly a prequel to every Index season) III being rushed, but Mugino just straight up kills Frenda in cold blood when in Railgun she was really chill with the rest of the group, so they rushed that really hard.

I have watched all of the FL:CL series and enjoyed those, but this? This was something nobody wanted.Where FL:CL did the whackiness in a humourous way, Index III has the same lack of coherent plot and random contextless scenes and characters who play no role other than to be eyecandy for 5-15 minutes total screentime before moving onto the next.I only finished this trainwreck of a season because stockholm syndrome had taken hold of me.Going from a show I once absolutely adored to eventually getting to this point...I wish that the creators had never made the movie,...and had especially not made this.The season has none of the charm of the original, and completely ruins it. I cannot express just how horrible a job was done here. and had especially not made this.The season has none of the charm of the original, and completely ruins it. I cannot express just how horrible a job was done here.', ""when I watched the first two seasons of Toaru Majutsu No Index I thought that they were decent or pretty good, but I thought that they were wasting potential in quite a few areas. there are quite a few things that aren't explained in the anime or are just left out, so some events don't really make much sense. this third season, however, takes all of the issues of the previous seasons to the next level. there is absolutely no cohesion anywhere. nothing makes sense. things seem to happen at random. it was definitely enjoyable to watch but it only really left me with questions,...not answers.STORY: 4/10the story for the adaptation is not good. in fact it's actually very bad. they screwed so much up here. the plot is just Touma running around from one European country to another and punching people in the face without any explanation whatsoever. the ending is just a guy who gains infinite power due to his master plan and it crashes and burns along with the rest of this season. I don't doubt that the light novel is much better, even though I'm only really at the very beginning of that at the time this review was written.ART: 5/10it's JC Staff as usual. I finished Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T right before finishing the rest of this season and it was insanely underwhelming, but I didn't have any other expectations for it. a lot of the anime is just still frames with shaky cam or camera panning. sometimes they have the revolutionary idea of using both. when there is movement it usually looks choppy and weird. some things look like they were made using blender's video editor. overall this is bad, but it's not abysmal or anything. you can still look at it and it gets the job done. it just doesn't do it well, especially after watching a ufotable movie trilogy and something made by the same studio that looks much better.SOUND: 6/10the soundtrack wasn't actually that bad. I wasn't the biggest fan of the openings or the first ending but the soundtrack itself isn't that bad, although it is a little generic. it gets the job done and that's all that matters.CHARACTER: 7/10the characters are worse than in the previous seasons or in Toaru Kagaku no Railgun but they're still the best part of this season, especially Accelerator. not only is his laugh funny, he also gets quite a bit of development this season. there are other characters in this season that are fun to watch, like Tsuchimikado for example. most of the characters are average though, and they don't bring much to the table.ENJOYMENT: 9/10this was very very fun to watch. from Accelerator getting pissed and screaming to Accelerator going insane and laughing, there's a lot to enjoy here. I liked how stupid and random a lot of things seemed to be, even though it negatively impacted the season as a whole. Tsuchimikado doesn't seem to get old and Touma pulling random stuff out of nowhere never fails to amuse me.OVERALL: 5/10I can't give this anime anything higher than this in good conscience, despite how good episodes 19 and 20 were. there's so much that this season gets wrong, and it feels like JC Staff just gave up on this series for the most part. episodes 19 and 20 were actually very good, but those are only two episodes out of 26. there could've been so many simple fixes like showing more of what happened in the light novel, or just including a narrator. these are simple things that are in other anime, and while I understand that it can be hard to include a narrator for a light novel adaptation, that doesn't mean it's impossible. this adaptation really just felt like it had no heart put into it, and they just made it for the sake of making it. it was completely different from the first two seasons and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun. not answers.STORY: 4/10the story for the adaptation is not good. in fact it's actually very bad. they screwed so much up here. the plot is just Touma running around from one European country to another and punching people in the face without any explanation whatsoever. the ending is just a guy who gains infinite power due to his master plan and it crashes and burns along with the rest of this season.

It's almost like a good preview for the entire series because its short and lets you get a good idea of what...the series is about. the series is about.""]"

One sudden day the grave of his grandfather is pillaged and he has to find out why. On his way to his dear grandfathers grave, he finds goku, no wait i mean Fuu Houhou. Fuu just like Soran, are supernatural humans who can freely control their Ki and use Martial arts as their weapons,...called outsiders. In a world filled with people like them Soran is extremely special and is headhunted by many evil organizations, but fret not, during the story you will find out why, but not really :)This anime is trying to be something original and to follow the whole martial arts ki-superpower thing to an extent that it\'s just horrid. What could have been key-parts of this anime ended up as dull battles with zero progress(not even one good battle at the end of the anime), a main character that is your typical young ""i want justice, i have this awesome superpower, i am stronger than you think"" attitude with no character progression. The other characters except our Fuu ""GOKU"" Houhou are so miniscule you won\'t even bother thinking about them as none even leave a single trace of impression.Oh did i mention that there is comedy in this anime and most of it is about Soran being a virgin? I also feel that the mix the anime is trying to do between comedy and action, just can\'t be taken seriously, the comedy is slapstick and dry humor about being a virgin. Now the worst part is, this anime tries so hard to reach a Shounen level that is just dosen\'t know how to deal with the story, because there literally is none.This is the new generation of anime, thats so horrible i can\'t even imagine why this got produced at all. With each episode you keep expeting, ""wow when is an amazing battle gonna start with our main character doing something really cool?"". Well don\'t bother. If a fight starts, it\'s 30 seconds long and in the end goku comes, kicks everyone and it\'s over. No fights last longer than 3min.There is just nothing, this anime lacks soul. Nothing to captivate it\'s audience and being so damn slow paced, it even ended in a way so that they can get a season 2, if they sell well... Let\'s be honest, that will never happen.

It\'s about ""Outsiders""--seemingly ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. One of those Outsiders is a girl who can control zombies, but she is NOT the main character.Secondly, if you haven\'t started watching, I must pre-warn you of this part in the 1st episode which caused a fair number of people to give up in disgust. It\'s the scene where Houhou is trying to bury the MC, Soran, and he just sits there  like an idiot. Why doesn\'t he just get up and run...away? See, in the original webcomic (which I checked out), that pit is supposed to be much deeper than shown in the anime (it\'s over Soran\'s height even when he\'s standing up and he likely had to jump to get over its edge--at which point he was easily kicked backed down by Houhou.) For some reason, the anime depicts the pit as being really shallow, which makes this particular scene not credible...but I\'d put this down to bad art, rather than bad writing.***Ratings***-- Plot/Pacing: BAt first, the mystery behind Soran\'s background and the Outsider world in general made me anticipate each new episode, as I found myself wanting to know more about the Outsiders and the different organisations and to see the development of the various characters and their relationships. However, after the whole Outsiders thing was explained (episode 5), I felt it wasn\'t that big of a deal/reveal at all. Worse, the pace slowed considerably (around episode 7 onwards)--and it was already quite slow before. The comedy bits are also a bit overdone and can be quite jarring, but you kind of get used to them after awhile.-- Seiyu/Sound: B+I\'m watching the Japanese dub (with sub-par English subs.) I think the voice actors did a fairly decent job, giving the characters enough of their own life and personality, such as the indifferent Houhou, the slutty Natsuka, the cunning Lo Ryu, etc. The soundtrack is pretty much standard J-rock, but the OP managed to get stuck inside my head after awhile.-- Art/Animation: BThe character designs are nothing out of the ordinary, and the quality of the art is inconsistent (from ""not bad"" to ""ugly/lazy."") I don\'t know if it\'s just me but I felt there was a noticeable drop in the quality from episode 7 onwards.-- Bonus/Bias: +10%I\'m giving bonus points solely for the character of Fuu Houhou. Normally I detest those ""stoic"", emotionless-girl type of characters, but Houhou just seems different somehow...her messy hair, poor fashion sense, ignorance of societal norms and conventions, and her insane skill with kitchen knives and choppers all combine to give her a very unique appeal (read: ""moe."") Her character significantly helped to sustain my interest in the series--and I know there are a number of people out there who feel the same way.***Additional  info***The original source is a Chinese webcomic and the anime is a collaboration between Chinese and Japanese producers. I watched the Japanese dub and a bit of the Chinese dub (just to compare), and I think the Japanese dub was produced first, the reason being that the animation matches the Japanese voices better, while it is a bit out-of-sync for the Chinese voices.In terms of differences in script, the Chinese one is more crude. For example, in one scene, a female character in the Japanese script says something like, ""it would be better if we were on a date"", while the Chinese script has her saying, ""it would be better if we were in bed"". The Chinese script also has more cussing.As for English subtitles, unfortunately the fan-made one is very far from perfect. Some terms weren\'t translated at all. For example, the following terms:(1) Kinkou - literally ""golden light"". It\'s a visible aura manifested from one\'s inner energy. Soran\'s kinkou is supposed to protect him from harm.(2) Xiangxi ganshi - ""Xiangxi"" is the name of a place in China (where the practice of animating corpses to transport them was popular in the past), and ""ganshi"" literally means ""corpse-driver"".

This time it’s a Chinese-Japanese led project fulfilling our dreams of being able to called this anime a Chinese cartoon. OK all jokes aside this series does have something interesting to offer as it incorporates both martial arts and psychic powers to give us a predominantly action focused show.***Note I’ll be using the translated names as I watched the Japanese dubbed version with English subtitles.***The start of this show at one point led me to think that it was another zombie apocalypse show like High School of the...Dead but only to realise that certain people can manipulate the corpses freely. Our main protagonist Chou Soran in the dead of night, is making a visit to his grandfather’s grave only to find himself in a precarious situation with the moving corpses. Out of nowhere, he is saved in mesmerising fashion from a powerful women called Jo Houhou who is talented in every way possible. This is the first encounter between the main duo who later find themselves attending the same college, only to the dismay of Soran who was semi-traumatised from the earlier meeting.Chou Soran is then made to be subservient to Houhou, after getting his ass handed to him while retaliating at the thought of being obedient to her. She then leads him to an organisation called the Express Delivery Company who are pretty much composed of psychics called ‘Outsiders’. The abilities between individuals vary from super strength, manipulating the elements to controlling the mental state of people through their emotions. The Express Delivery Company’s main objective is to act as the police for these outsiders who are a minority but nevertheless still need to be monitored to avoid engaging in criminal activity. This makes sense as the regular police would get battered by attempting to deal with the psychics, so it’s only natural that the Government made a subdivision to respond to these situations.There are other groups who inhabit these individuals such as Zensei and Tengekai. The former is just a random collection of users with similar interests. They are the first group to provoke our main duo when it is revealed that they have possession of something close to Soran. The group are just bizarre and uncoordinated when they have a little kid in charge, a woman whose lust knows no bounds and some black guy (not race-wise) whose has no purpose despite having many cameos. Tengekai are more interesting as they at least have a proper hierarchy in place with its bureaucratic rules. The magnanimous leader of the organisation directly tries to recruit Soran, when it is known that he has acquired psychic abilities from a young age. His abilities obviously matured as he grew up around the presence of his grandfather who was a well-respected individual.The characters in this show are not impressive by any standards when they don’t have any unique selling points. Chou Soran resembles another shounen protagonist who tries to get past every obstacle through sheer power, only to realise its futile when facing much stronger outsiders who have fully mastered their powers. He doesn’t really have any motivation whatsoever when all he thinks about is wanting a nice girlfriend, lamenting the fact that he is useless in that department. The girlfriend he desired for so long does happen only for events to change drastically.Jo Houhou at first looks like another monotone girl and is a mirror for reflecting dreariness. The only time she shows any emotion is being violent towards Soran which is a feature found in most tsunderes but thankfully she does not follow that archetype. Her actions make me cringe at times when it feels like everything she does is robotic; to the point she is just a yes-man. The supporting cast of Jo San and Jo Yon don’t really offer much as they are insistent on abiding by the rules of the company. They do participate in battles alongside the main duo but do not get sufficient characterisation for me to talk about them adequately.This art style/animation aspect is something I wanted to avoid because it is obvious that it will end up being me giving a scathing attack on it, hence sounding like a diatribe. The animation is not comparable to the anime produced in Japan when series from a decade ago have similar or in fact better production values. There were instances when the fights looked visually appealing, through good usage of special effects but it did look choppy at times with the in-between animation needing further improvements. The colour scheme used throughout the show is very basic but does it job when trying to complement the appropriate background such as the countryside in rural China. The only information on the staff of this show is that Komatsu Arisa was the colour designer. I really hope someone updates the key staff involved.The sound here is quite lacklustre with nothing of the soundtrack being memorable or worth noting to the point it is just abysmal. Good thing, the sound staff are confidential which makes it difficult to expose them for their average work. The opening and ending have been dubbed over and were quite the delight to listen to if that means anything. The voice actors used in this show aren’t household names here in the anime community. The man who voiced Ayato from Asterix War is back to offer his voice for a complementary dull protagonist, truly befitting one must say. The wonderful voice of Hayami Saori is back, this time for Houhou which is a good match for her easy sounding speech patterns/mannerisms.This series is not really a must watch in any category and is a very average show at best with mediocre production values.

Most of the characters are cheesy yet well thought out at the same time.The biggest negative trait this anime has is a middle school immunity level and poor start. While this anime might be an acquired taste and take self-discipline the creators did not have; If you can handle the flaws it is an amazing Anime. While I was bored at moments others caught onto me fairly solidly. My favorite part being balancing...slice of life, laughter and Action fairly well.If you can not find anything good or even ok to watch; you should watch this.Overall 7.85 slice of life, laughter and Action fairly well.If you can not find anything good or even ok to watch; you should watch this.Overall 7.85', ""Before writing down anything here, I’d first like to say that all audiences should go to watch the unedited completed version of this anime which has a half-hour-long 11th episode and 43-min-long 12th episode AS WELL AS THE ORIGENAL MANGA that has already been updated to nearly 200 episodes. Plus if you can speak fluent Chinese I highly recommend you to watch the Chinese cover and you can discover more unique sides of this anime.To begin with, I have to state that the anime is INDEED disappointing. The enjoyment and the overall score highly depend on my view to the original comic instead of the...animation. A few points of this anime were about to make me to drop the series. What came out first was the absence of so many frames that turned continuous scenes into some PowerPoint or ‘moving manga’ stuff. Apart from that, the sound effect was not adjusted just right and sometimes was not even simultaneous with the scene. What was more unforgivable, neither the storyboard nor the composition satisfied a sophisticated creation of animation. Despite all of these, I still feel thankful to all reviewers on MyAnimeList because you guys scored The Outcast much higher than Japan and China locally on average (6.64). When I checked the scores on Accessify.com (Japan) and Bangumi.tv (China), I was surprised that those who could watch the completed version and the most fabulous part of the animation scored it an average of mere 6. How low it is! What a pity!I was not trying to make you feel bad about this animation in the last paragraph, but I rather aimed to put the problems of this animation forward and then to suggest you not focusing so much on those defects. This animation is actually one of those ‘big steps’ of current Chinese anime production, and it marked a lot of brave attempts of Chinese artists even though the attempts might not have been so successful. Chinese creators were really trying their best to make an art piece as well as a commercial product that belongs to their culture, and they have showed us how fascinating an anime could possibly be if it was adapted to a different society (what I’m referring to is the completed Chinese cover). Plenty problems of the animation were results of low investment, arrogance of Japan-side anime makers and discords between Chinese and Japanese directors.The animation would only have pleased and enchanted a watcher if one had been able to settle down and be enthusiastic to learn about the background, because it had involved so many Chinese cultural as well as historical elements that had been alien to Japanese, let alone us Westerners. In the original unedited Chinese cover, the animators even used a Chinese folk song as an opening and for every single character they let them speak unique dialects like Mandarin (Zhang Chulan), Sichuan Mandarin (Feng Baobao), Chaozhou Mandarin, Cantonese etc. The 12-episode series also revealed us some history of China, for instance, the World War II, the period when the communist government was suppressing bandits, the golden age of Chinese pop songs and the return of Hong Kong. Chinese religions (Daoism and Chinese side Buddism), traditional weapons, philosophy, pop culture, literature and humours are also all merged organically in The Outcast, especially in the story after the end of episode 12 in manga. The Outcast banged us with decisiveness of Chinese and a story line that is so disjoint from what we normally call Anime: something that has gradually filled up with Moe, fan service, cliché, ‘harem’ of male characters and unrealistically kind people who doesn't kill to leave the enemies coming back with stronger powers.Hence I highly recommend The Outcast, it should not be the edited animation but the complete version and manga though. It will open for you a new world and tell you a story of heroes and heroines that have new charms. COME AND WATCH OR READ! It is undoubtedly an unmissable great work for those who truly love ACGN and those who are interested in an exotic story! animation. A few points of this anime were about to make me to drop the series. What came out first was the absence of so many frames that turned continuous scenes into some PowerPoint or ‘moving manga’ stuff. Apart from that, the sound effect was not adjusted just right and sometimes was not even simultaneous with the scene. What was more unforgivable, neither the storyboard nor the composition satisfied a sophisticated creation of animation. Despite all of these, I still feel thankful to all reviewers on MyAnimeList because you guys scored The Outcast much higher than Japan and China locally on average (6.64).

He has a goddamned seal on his d*** to make sure that he remains pure and has good cultivation. And the way it's discussed is funny. I, for one, enjoyed every second of the comedy aspect of this show. I have to say season 2 is remarkably better than season 1.The fights are AWESOME! I love them. Especially in season 2. I was really impressed with how...varied the character design was and how even the characters in supporting roles get so much attention and even their own ending credit songs sometimes.In my opinion, people are not judging the anime as a standalone but comparing it to other great animes in a completely different genre and whining about how it's not like them. I mean, keep watching those anime. Why you gotta complain about how OP the lead is? I mean, aren't the leads supposed to have golden fingers that make them all-powerful?

It cleared up a lot of the, why is this like this or how come those things are doing this, etc., etc.. The groundwork has been laid with great action sequences, which have implied that...they are only going to get a lot more action packed and suspenseful.

My only problem with it is that it only have 12 episodes and no manga to continue.I saw someone saying ""Chinese Zombie Stuff"", but only one character uses zombies as weapons, all the rest have different superpowers, and the story is about them, or more precisely about the grandfather of Chou Soran.I think the plot was cool, and the development was just right. I even like the characters, usually the emotionless steriotype still have some level of emotion, this one is really a psycopath. That doesn\'t mean...she is evil, she just don\'t understand what are feelings. She could be called a Tsundere, since she beats the main character, but different of all the Tsunderes out there, Soran, the beaten main character, gets to the point that he says, NO! And even knowing he could die, he still go away. This is taking matters more seriously outside the masoquist main character cliche, and I really like that.I also liked the tone the anime makes. It gets things serious but backs the humor just after and never gets the viewer in a despairate situation. I know this doesn\'t create tension, but it isn\'t bad by itself, and can still render some good fights. Damn, One Punch Man follow the same principle, and it is good. This of course, builds more tension to when the fights gets serious, but unfortunately it doesn\'t show, or it have a climax.The big point for me is really the characters, even without much background, they are flashed out by their actions, not just steriotipicals characters copy and paste. And they do that without backing for when they were children, Suck that, Naruto!Whatever. I really liked it, and really would like a second season or manga to  follow, I hope it eventually happens, but with this average score, I doubt.

Personally I liked it obviously because I gave it an 8 overall and see a lot of potential if they continue beyond season 1.  I also liked the art and animation styles. The story follows Chou who is an ""Outsider"" (someone with supernatural abilities). He catches a lot of flack about being a virgin but is actually a straight up bada**. Like most anime the whole thing revolves around random bad guys popping up...complicating the mc\'s life and pushing him to reveal more and more of just how far his potential goes. While it is a bit slower paced at points that is to try developing the back story and characters alongside the current events in the story. The humor does tend to revolve a lot around the fact Chou is a virgin and how to manipulate him because of that. But hey we all know what it was or is like to be a horny teen virgin desperately trying to solve that problem with anything that would sit still long enough to let us, and that\'s one of the things I enjoyed about the comedic moments. Also, there are SOME zombies and lets face it everyone loves zombies whether they admit it or not, but be warned its not just about zombies. complicating the mc\'s life and pushing him to reveal more and more of just how far his potential goes.

It’s one of those anime you need to watch after a few episodes to judge for yourself. As I a picky anime fan, I had to binge watch this. The characters are interesting and leaving you wanting more especially Fou Houhou. There are some bits that are funny (not sure if that’s my dark humour) give it a good watch before really playing any attention to the reviews.I live in the UK and have only been to Japan once. So at the time of visit, it wasn’t included in Shouen Jump. But after watching the second series it...is and that alone, left me wanting to re-subscribing to more English translated Shouen Jump. is and that alone, left me wanting to re-subscribing to more English translated Shouen Jump.', ""HUMOR - it has some funny slapstick moments, but they're added in awkwardly, totally disrupting the build-up of tension sometimes. I don't think this series is as bad as some people think, because I don't think it takes itself too seriously. I mean, Dumbledore and Snape show up in the second season randomly with no explanation.PLOT - the only interesting thing about the plot is wanting to find out about Houhou's past. They keep inventing random reasons to push back the reveal, ie that Soran has to be the next Tenshi. It's predictable though.CHARACTER - I did like the MC a bit in...the beginning, but it quickly devolved into him somehow being way trickier than everyone else and powering up suddenly, and everyone around him either despising him or remarking on how amazing he is. The same thing that happens in a lot of shows with good premises, like Darwin's Game and cough cough SAO. As for the other characters, what of them. Houhou is cool of course. It's pretty neat to see people underestimate her and then she's way stronger than the MC.FIGHTS - They do have a tournament at one point (season 2) and throw some brand new randos together to fight without giving any of them a motive, other than to be wowed by the powers of the ones with a backstory.ANIMATION - uhm ok this doesn't really have any redeeming qualities. The 3D animation was sometimes just so bad.OVERALL - not bad as an anime to watch while I'm doing something else. I did keep watching to find out about Houhou, so it's at the very least compelling. the beginning, but it quickly devolved into him somehow being way trickier than everyone else and powering up suddenly, and everyone around him either despising him or remarking on how amazing he is.

Many reviews I have read complain about the slow pace of this show. Make no mistake this is not kung-fu action. This is in essence a drama with SOME action weaved into the plot. This is why I do not dislike the generic magic kung-fu concept, it's merely a small aspect to help drive the plot.Art - 7The modern art style worked well with the concept of the show.Character - 3The main characters are a little over the top.

The first you must know is that the original Chinese version is a lot better. The main reason is its uncut and uncensored. There is also the small aspects like accent that comes into play that help people understand the region they are in. But most importantly there are keys scenes that the Japanese miss out.The story starts and develops in an abrupt manner, with a grave robbing which introduces us to our two main characters Zhang Chouran and Fang Baobao who have a weird chemistry and relationship.Both of each work quite well as individual characters. The story is convoluted in the sense the...plot and the story slowly unravels itself from grave robbing to the world of Chinese martial arts and secret societies and its many secrets and unexplained mysteries.Both dubs do a good job in bringing the characters alive, but as I mentioned there are nuances that the Japanese could not translate or adapt to. The story also is lacking in the Japanese version, I assume because they had to air it they had to remove the blood and gore, there are also some key fight scenes that are noticeably missing from the Japanese version that are relevant to the last few episodes of this season, but also some other key scenes in the final episode.Art is anime but with distinct Chinese art style that you won't find in anime or manga, noticeably its the facial animations and features that appear. The fights are also well done, not great, but to par. The cut scenes I mentioned are worth seeing mainly cause they show as side of Baobao that you would never see otherwise, and it will bring you to understand her character more.Sound, now this is were there is a noticeable difference, one is that the Chinese voices sometimes can be drowned out by the background sound or music. Where as the Japanese dub comes out clear at every turn.The background noises you will notice in the Chinese dub are lacking consistency and quality. for example the sound for pouring a drink or a syringe falling to the floor don't match expectations.The one noticeable difference is that the final episode in the Chinese version is based in Guangzhou, where the dialect is predominantly Cantonese. Which is different from the Mandarin that is present in every episode. The Cantonese dub was well done and gave the characters present their uniqueness. For those who grew up in Hong Kong, there are probably a few familiar voices in the dub, and also there are some local culture references like a canto pop singers name and song, giving us a timeline.To be honest just this alone is worth a watch but the fact its a Baobao key scene makes it a must watch if you love Baobao's character.The opening music and ending music for both is different. Chinese is more folk song before rock enters. and Japanese is usual Japanese opening style.I personally have held back from watching this, due to the fact no one bothered to sub the Chinese version. I eventually gave in, and just watched the Chinese version one episode at a time and than watched the Japanese episode after to see if I understood the context of it. This is one of the reasons I noticed the differences right away. But I reckon this is a way to enjoy both versions. The new and unfamiliar Chinese voice acting.

There hardly is any. We follow Chou Soran on his journey to… nothing to be honest. For all of the show he doesn’t have any kind of goal. He’s just there to react to what’s happening to him and around him. He’s the worst kind of protagonist - passive. For most of the time he talks big but rarely he is able...to put his money where his mouth is, and the moments he is able to rise up to the occasion… he does so by pulling a new technique out of his ass. No build up, no prior training shown, nothing. He just has this skill that could have been useful a few episodes prior but he only just now remembered about it.His companion Fuu Houhou isn’t much better. Granted she doesn’t pull new techniques all the time but she suffers from Superman syndrome. There are no stakes in her fights. In a fight there is no one who can hurt her without a really pathetic excuse. Even then she just walks it off. Now don’t get me wrong, those types of characters can work. The aforementioned Superman has some really good runs when he struggles, suffers and You just can’t get enough of the high stake non-combat conflict You witness. The writer knew about this. Towards the end we get some info about Fuu’s past that’s there to make her a more tragic heroine and show her suffering. Too bad the writer lacks the skill to write something like this and what we get is lazy and pathetic.As this is categorised as a martial arts anime I was hoping for some gorgeous fight choreography and long fights that challenge fighters to their limits. Yeah… I was dumb for expecting that. There is only one fight that’s not a pathetic copout and it’s pretty much in episode 4, on top of that it doesn’t even last 3 minutes. If You are a fan of martial arts animes You’ll gonna have blue balls during this show. There are no good fights in it.The whole show is just Soran getting pulled towards different organisations that have a massive boner to get him to join them. They use a wide array of methods from temptation, threats and even some more… carnal methods.There is no way to sugar coat it.

I don\'t have a problem with premise itself but I do have a problem with its execution and delivery. Like a good joke, you need good execution and delivery. Nowhere in these episodes did I see good execution or delivery. For example, the first time we find out the MC is actually OP is when he defeats a bunch of zombies off screen. Then later we see he actually knows of his abilities but he\'s hiding it. But then...actually, he doesn\'t have full control yet so he\'s actually not even that strong. So which is it? You feed us this impression that he\'s OP as hell, then tell us he\'s just a whiny brat? I already took a bite of that delicious steak you gave me, you can\'t take it back and expect me to sit still.The comedy in this one is just *chef\'s kiss* magnificent. Way to ruin the flow and mood of the scene, by adding this cringe comedy right in the middle of a serious scene. This is another issue that completely ruined the anime. They can\'t decide if they want to be serious or not and it doesn\'t help that the character\'s themselves are inherently not funny to begin with. Take for example the glasses guy. His character has been shown to be serious, has a calm voice, and seems rational. But throw in a scene of him squawking like an idiot, you ruin his character.Art/animationI thought the art was pretty solid. I\'m not mad at it, but the animation can be a little stiff at times. Fighting scenes were alright as well but there\'s definitely weird continuity issues. The knife girl is one hell of a jumper and sometimes she looks like she\'s teleporting. Yes I know she\'s fast, but I still would have liked to see how she got to places. And sometimes it looks like she\'s flying. As far as I know, she jumps high, but she doesn\'t fly.SoundNothing that comes in mind that I would consider bad. I barely listened to Op or Ed so I can\'t comment on those.CharacterAh, my favorite part about reviews, is when I can talk about why I dislike characters.MC is a drag. Literally so annoying. You\'ve had all these questions your life about who you are, your existence has been gnawing at ya, and here, these ""outsiders"" who are the same as you appear with open arms, and you don\'t take it? What? There\'s also inconsistencies with him. Sometimes he asks these deep compelling questions about his powers, but at other times, he just wants to be normal person? I don\'t know. Pick one. Not to mention his one stand out quality as a MC. Being virgin. It\'s shoved in your face since episode 1 how much of a virgin he is. It\'s not a personality trait China, stop it. I don\'t care how much of a virgin this kid is, stop making it the reason for his existence. That\'s just bad writing. If your main character can be summed up as ""he\'s a virgin"" then you\'ve got a problem on your hands.Knife girl. She can be described in two words. Ninja cardboard. As I already mentioned, she is a monkey. She is jumping everywhere, slick. But she is bland. No taste. No personality in sight.Telekinesis glasses guy. I would describe him as telekinesis glasses guy, because that\'s who he is. He seems rational, calm, and the one who takes jobs seriously. I don\'t like or dislike him. He just exists.There\'s one last guy, an older man with gray hair. He just appeared in the episode before I dropped so I don\'t have much to say about him. First impression, I kind of like him. He doesn\'t look like he takes shit from people and has a clear personal goal in mind why he\'s interested in the MC.EnjoymentNah. I saw that there was 3 seasons already so I thought this would hold me out for a while before I start searching for more anime to watch but nah, not like this. actually, he doesn\'t have full control yet so he\'s actually not even that strong. So which is it? You feed us this impression that he\'s OP as hell, then tell us he\'s just a whiny brat? I already took a bite of that delicious steak you gave me, you can\'t take it back and expect me to sit still.The comedy in this one is just *chef\'s kiss* magnificent. Way to ruin the flow and mood of the scene, by adding this cringe comedy right in the middle of a serious scene. This is another issue that completely ruined the anime. They can\'t decide if they want to be serious or not and it doesn\'t help that the character\'s themselves are inherently not funny to begin with. Take for example the glasses guy. His character has been shown to be serious, has a calm voice, and seems rational. But throw in a scene of him squawking like an idiot, you ruin his character.Art/animationI thought the art was pretty solid. I\'m not mad at it, but the animation can be a little stiff at times. Fighting scenes were alright as well but there\'s definitely weird continuity issues. The knife girl is one hell of a jumper and sometimes she looks like she\'s teleporting. Yes I know she\'s fast, but I still would have liked to see how she got to places. And sometimes it looks like she\'s flying. As far as I know, she jumps high, but she doesn\'t fly.SoundNothing that comes in mind that I would consider bad.

It starts off as a zombie anime but then does a full 360 and turns into a superpowered Kung fu shitfest. The story pacing is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. (Yes...that's right ladies and gentlemen even worse than SAO.) I watched each week because I felt like it  was slightly interesting and the ingredients were there for something great. After week 12 of the anime, I sat waiting for the next episode to see how this little saga would conclude. But nothing came, yes that's right, they finished off this anime with a 3 episode flashback of Houhou's past.Art 5/10The art wasn't bad, it was very lazy styling and it didn't really do anything to leave an impression, I don't have anything to say about this really because it was neither good nor bad.Sound 5/10Once again sound wise there isn't really much to touch on.  The OP isn't bad but it doesn't really strike me as anything special, and sound wise through the episodes the little background music there is, is all pretty normal stuff.Character 4/10Now this is the part which was rather hit and miss. The MC is made out as super OP and he doesn't really have any down points . The way he reacts in all situations is pretty much how you would expect someone to so that's fine. HouHou is an interesting one and once again is strong which is interesting. To be honest, if it weren't for the fact that it was enjoyable watching HouHou kick the crap out of people I would have dropped this.  As far as antagonists go I can only think of 2. One is a weak idiot who tries to kill HouHou, fails and then dies. The other was actually more interesting than the main cast.Enjoyment 2/10I had a shred of hope for this season and it honestly disappointed me so badly. There were a few cliffhangers which were interesting but to be honest the only time I wanted another episode was to see if HouHou was alive or not.Overal 1/10While the story is interesting and I feel that good things could come from this, the story never actually gets past the scene setting phase. I can not accept that someone would think that it's a good idea to air a half-assed anime like this.

It's slightly unique in its own way. And I do have to admit that I might be captivated because of our female lead's voice actress.

There are two dubs for this anime. A Japanese dub and a Chinese dub.I highly recommend the Chinese dub because the Japanese dub censors/cuts off some pretty important scenes that lessens the impact of the story.Even if you chose to watch the show in Japanese, at least watch the last two episodes in Chinese. The animation quality is also better with the Chinese dub.The budget for this series is not that high, but they made it work with that they had. I...personally feel that the fight scenes are really smooth and enjoyable.The story is a slow burner because it does a lot of worldbuilding that is fleshed out throughout the series. This whole first season is like a prelude to a much bigger story. For the first few episodes, we only get introduced to the main characters and the plot advances kind of slowly. But it is very interesting and well thought out. There is a huge cast of characters in this show and each of them is unique in their own way.The power system in this world is deeply rooted in Chinese folklore and religion, mainly influenced by Taoism. So sometimes the series will bring up references that is completely missed by the average viewer. But it also has lots of creative elements that anyone can enjoy.However, you really need to pay attention to the exposition provided by the characters or you will be totally lost on what is happening.I also want to point out that the original manhua that the anime is based on is still ongoing. Currently, the manhua is reaching 500 chapters and the story is still nowhere near finished. While the first season of this anime only covers Chapters 1-57 of the manhua. The second and third seasons that are currently out only goes up to around Chapter 200 in the manhua.So unfortunately, you most likely will have a lot of unanswered questions about the story. But the plot is really interesting and I highly recommend you at least give it a try.I must say however, I believe the original manhua has a much better quality than its adaptation. Unfortunately, most of it is not available in English and the translated parts cannot really reflect the style of the story.Overall, I think this anime is really worth it for those willing to try it. However I must warn you that the first few episodes will seem pretty cringeworthy, but it definitely improves mid-season.I will also list elements you should NOT expect from this story.THIS IS NOT A POWER FANTASY: Although this series contains a lot of action scenes and a complicated power system. The main protagonist does not fight his way through all his problems. He starts off the series already with a average level of power and gradually gets stronger. But most of the time his opponents are way stronger than him. He really has to rely on his wits, the help of his allies, and employ underhanded tactics to solve the situation. This is will be evident in seasons 2 and 3. While in season 1 the main female character handles most of the fighting.THIS IS NOT ECCHI/HAREM: There will be some ""fanservice"" scenes throughout the first season. But they will be non-existent later down the story. The protagonist literally have no genuine love interests even at this point in the original manhua.THIS IS NOT A HERO STORY: The main characters are not ""heroes"", they do their jobs and does help people in need. But they are mostly after their own goals and does some ""unheroic"" things to achieve them. The antagonists are not all ""villains"". Most of the time they are just in conflict over their goals. There are full-on evil villains, but even then they are not always in conflict with the main characters. This will be evident in Season 2 and 3.THIS IS NOT ABOUT ZOMBIES: While they make a huge impression in episode 1.

Most characters have interesting back stories, and you felt affection for most of them as well.I do have several tips for watching it: 1) watch it in Chinese, that's the original language, Japanese is an awkward dub. 2) watch through a couple episodes before making your judgement.The animation quality is not so great at the start, but keeps getting better with each episode and gets a huge boost in the second season. Seems like they didn't have a lot of budget at the beginning. "", ""Overall score : 7This is a decent anime, albeit a pretty bland start because it looks like your generic shonen shit at first glance (assuming you're using 3 episode rule).The story itself wasn't about zombie, nor shonen hero MC (retarded justice). It's about a successor of a hunted legendary martial artist. It starts with MC seemingly being a normal guy, and gets exposed to the world of outsiders/outcasts.. nah not really, MC actually has the knowledge and shits, just zero contacts with this world, which he was trying to avoid, thus him being clueless most of the time.I shouldn't really comment on other review...but seeing that some people trying to paint this series as something which it isn't, maybe i should. The 1st season starts slow, but it gives the groundwork for the exciting 2nd and 3rd season. The 1st season gives the knowhow about this world of outsiders/outcasts, while revealing some mysteries about the casts. It's not about zombie nor stupid justice type heroes. The MC develops (or actually regress back) to his 'outcast' mental state as the series progress, while staying comedic. He is pretty cunning himself, while not being a completely scheming type, he'd need more than just brawn to unravel his predecessor past, and his own story.I kind of get it that some people dislike wuxia type stories, or find them unfamiliar and strange so they will have varying opinion on this donghua. However, i myself believe that this donghua is in the rank of being decent as wuxia.The art itself (or the animation) is pretty meh, they have problem doing fast action scenes, and this lasted till the end of 2nd season. The 3rd season is on another studio with better animation and better action scenes.The sound (BGMs) is pretty standard, the voice acting is decent, and the OP and ED is actually pretty interesting ( the Chinese version), the JP ver. however, sounds very bland,the voice acting was really dead and the jokes didn't translate well as speech, resulting in the seemingly weird nonsense dialogue without tonal feature that tells you 'it's a joke'. The OP ED of JP ver., i don't really remember, it doesn't really leave any impression and im not really bothered to relisten.I'd tell people who are planning to watch this to start with the Chinese version, but it all boils down to preference, I've met people that actively dismiss donghua simply because 'Chinese sounds weird' in their ear. but seeing that some people trying to paint this series as something which it isn't, maybe i should.

He is pretty cunning himself, while not being a completely scheming type, he'd need more than just brawn to unravel his predecessor past, and his own story.I kind of get it that some people dislike wuxia type stories, or find them unfamiliar and strange so they will have varying opinion on this donghua. However, i myself believe that this donghua is in the rank of being decent as wuxia.The art itself (or the animation) is pretty meh, they have problem doing fast action scenes, and this lasted till the end of 2nd season. The 3rd season is on another studio with better animation and better action scenes.The sound (BGMs) is pretty standard, the voice acting is decent, and the OP and ED is actually pretty interesting ( the Chinese version), the JP ver. however, sounds very bland,the voice acting was really dead and the jokes didn't translate well as speech, resulting in the seemingly weird nonsense dialogue without tonal feature that tells you 'it's a joke'. The OP ED of JP ver., i don't really remember, it doesn't really leave any impression and im not really bothered to relisten.I'd tell people who are planning to watch this to start with the Chinese version, but it all boils down to preference, I've met people that actively dismiss donghua simply because 'Chinese sounds weird' in their ear."", ""The story is really intereresting and it's different.It's a mystery, but you do not have a feeling of a mystery story because it's made like a comedy.All in all, this review is SPOILER FREE.You should keep in mind this is a CHINESE STORY, DONGHUA NOT ANIME.The main DIFFERENCE between most DONGHUAS and ANIMES is that anime shows a ''complete'' story (at least an arc per season) and adds something at the end so you know there will be another season, but DONGHUAS show parts of the story through every season and usually have multiple seasons, not always, but in a lot of cases (Fox...spirit matchmaker has 10 seasons out, 11 is announced and it doesn't look like they will stop there; it's the best example of non-3D Chinese franchise (I personally prefer drawn, not 3D donghuas and animes); there is also A Will Eternal with 52 episodes in season 1 and it will have season 2, or Mo Dao Zu Shi with 3 seasons and the whole story is completed and explained in the last season; there is Cinderella Chef as well where they just continued the story in 2. season; than there is Be My Wife (Xie Wang Zhui Qi) which is in my opinion awful anime, but second season is a bit better than the first one, and in the end of the second one there is clearly shown there will be 3. season if not more; etc. there's a lot more examples).SO DO NOT JUDGE THIS DONGHUA BASED ON YOUR ANIME EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT JAPANESE IT'S CHINESE. EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.From what I watched Chinese donghuas tend to have more comedy side to them even in more ''serious'' settings, like Shuangsheng Lingtan.That's the most common problem with this donghua I saw in reveiws. You all expect Japanese style and way, but it's not, of course, it's different when it's Chinese, and China can make some masterpieces like Mo Dao Zu Shi and this one has a lot of promises, just wait until the last season (maybe it will be 4. that is currently airing or 5,6, or 20. you never know whit Chinese animation how many seasons and episodes you will see, they usually are long). spirit matchmaker has 10 seasons out, 11 is announced and it doesn't look like they will stop there; it's the best example of non-3D Chinese franchise (I personally prefer drawn, not 3D donghuas and animes); there is also A Will Eternal with 52 episodes in season 1 and it will have season 2, or Mo Dao Zu Shi with 3 seasons and the whole story is completed and explained in the last season; there is Cinderella Chef as well where they just continued the story in 2. season; than there is Be My Wife (Xie Wang Zhui Qi) which is in my opinion awful anime, but second season is a bit better than the first one, and in the end of the second one there is clearly shown there will be 3. season if not more; etc. there's a lot more examples).SO DO NOT JUDGE THIS DONGHUA BASED ON YOUR ANIME EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT JAPANESE IT'S CHINESE.

Zombie-Loan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2404/Zombie-Loan,"[""I have noticed that I haven't written any reviews on bad anime lately so I'm definitely going to try.Zombie Loan is quite a lame excuse for a zombie anime that contains more plot holes and inconsistencies than a George Romero movie (look him up)Story (Poor)The story is quite laughable in every sense of the word. It is a mix of fan service, action, and comedy. Of course there are ways to execute a combo like this well, but it doesn't pull it off at all. They do well to suck you into the show with the first few episodes, but further down the road,...you will notice it gets more and more ridiculous to even an open-minded person such as me to accept. The enemies are also pretty unimpressive. When I expect brutal zombie fights, the least I would expect would be puppies, nuns, and otakus. To give the story some credit though, it does get fairly decent towards the end after all the characters have established themselves. Also, don't forget the fan service as they try to hit all points of fan service from bishoujo to loli to bishonen. It's all there.Art (Mediocre)Theres nothing wrong with the art, but theres nothing great about it either. It's obvious from the start that the main aspect of the characters are their sex appeal and their HAIR. Yes their hair, its noticeably more detailed than an average anime, and pointy. I'm surprised no ones eyes gets poked out from all the pointy hair flying around. Suffice to say, they drew most of the men in a bishounen style whereas the women were drawn with a cute moe style (again with the fan service). Girls who love that style will like the boys and the same goes to the boys who love the girls. As for me (being a guy), I loved how all the girls were drawn and even their characteristics weren't bad at all. Aside from favoritism, everything else from backgrounds to static objects and stand ins were just average in my book. Nothing to write home about.Sound (Decent)The sound is also not very stellar for such a short anime. A lot of MAL users didn't seem to appreciate the opening theme song (ref: MAL forums). As for me, the OP was average it seems like they were trying to steal a page from Death Note with a hard j-rock theme with no real relevance to the show. The sound effects throughout the show are also average. You'll encounter more comedy sounds than anything else. Also, theres a lot of music in the show, but in the same token, theres a lot of 'dead air' (like a faint wind blowing). But for the most part you will wish they lightened up on the background music. It's only saving grace from a &quot;Pathetic&quot; score (1 point), is the voice casting. Well you can tell the girls are all voiced in a cute or 'typical' manner but some of the guys didn't sound too good in my opinion. One of the main characters even has a nasally tone to his ranting and raving which was quite irritating at times.Characters (Decent)Although it's very hard to take an  anime like this serious when ALL THREE main characters special abilities are horrible from the start. One can see a band on their neck showing if that person is alive or dead. That ability is fine, but the other two have to switch hands with each other in order to call forth a sword or gun. Which begs the question... why not just keep your own hands to yourself (the reason is also pretty lame IMO). Now I could understand if there was a decent explanation, but its lame. Theres holes like this throughout this show as you would expect from an 11 episode show. Some of the holes are big, like how did they get so good at fighting, or why even bother going to school when your dead and broke. I'm sure you'll find your own issues to pick on throughout your viewing. A good point of the characters though is the fan service aspect as they again cover as many aspects as they can, but even that can help the score that much.Overall, it's an all right anime that looks like it tries too hard to please a broad audience in such a small time. Even the manga felt to ambitious as well. I believed if Peach-Pit focused more on the story rather than the fan service, it would have been a much better show. Its a shame that such a bad story came from the same person that made Rozen Maiden, Shugo Chara, and Di Gi Charat.Verdict (4.4) you will notice it gets more and more ridiculous to even an open-minded person such as me to accept.

Although the story could have probably developed even more and a lot better if there were more than 11 episodes. That just cut the story too short, which was kinda disappointing.ArtPersonally, I don't like this type of art style that was used in Z-Loan too much. Usually I'd prefer artwork more like that of Death Note. However, I think the art fit this particular series well, however it isn't the best art out there.SoundUsually I like loud songs and metal songs, but the opening song was just horrendous. I couldn't stand listening to it. The...ending theme was fine though. The background music fit the scenes it was used in well, so they did that good. Nothing else really so say about the music work. It was overall good.CharacterVery good characters. The tension between Chika and Shito was great for the story, especially because no matter what, they were stuck together because of their hands. All of the characters were pretty interesting themselves. Michiru had a good background story. Koyomi was my probably favorite, with her energetic normal self, and then becoming the lesbian Yomi, her alter-ego. Then there's all the others like Yuuta, with her &quot;talking&quot; hands, Bekkou (or ferryman), who's the leader of Z-loan, even though he appears like somebody you wouldn't really expect to be in charge, Chika's father, who looks like a girl, Chika's sister, who does nothing but text message on her phone, Shimotsuki, who's a younger girl, yet a chairsperson, Shiba, who at first appears to be a good guy, and the Shinigami, who becomes a like a small creature after losing his core.The cast is all very interesting, however, since the series is too short, it didn't allow for too much development, so that's why I give a 8, and not 9.EnjoymentDefinitely a great series if you're bored one day and just wanna watch a whole series, packed with parts of action, comedy, and horror. I watched it all in one day, since it's only 11 episodes, and I think it's best viewed like that.

Eleven episodes is just too short for a series, considering most have at least 12 episodes.StoryIt's an interesting story, very original if you ask me, and it has it's good and bad parts. It's somewhat predictable from time to time and there aren't many plot-twists that could surprise you. Plus, I really would have liked more action in it, sometimes it just takes too long for the fighting to start even though it would look like an action anime first. Aside from that, it was pretty good. The worst...part is that it ended abruptly in episode 11, just when the REAL action seemed like it would start. Just the producer's way to say &quot;read the manga if you wanna know what happens&quot;.ArtI really liked the art, it was quite new to my eyes. The characters are each drawn in their own style and it was interesting to see how the male leads were tall and athletic, with almost no muscles on them and so on. Considering their &quot;status&quot; it suits them well. For the fans, it has some chibi scenes and stick-art scenes some fo the time to add to the fun. The art for the combat scenes was good but not the best, I enjoyed it nevertheless.SoundWell, the soundtrack was good, nothing much to say about it, each song was fit for the scene. The only thing that bothered my ears was the opening song. Sure, the off-vocal was totally awesome, I really liked the guitar sounds, but when the  singer started &quot;screaming&quot; in I would immediately skip forward. Ending song was fine, though not the best, with a great off-vocal.CharacterThe characters were very well made, though most didn't have such a detailed background. Each had it's own unique personality and you could easily start liking one of them. Too bad some characters didn't have enough screen time (even though I liked them more than the main characters) and some had more than they really needed.Overall I enjoyed this (too) short series. I'd give it a 7.8 as a grand total (but I rounded up to 8).If you're into action, comedy, zombie related things and some drama here and there, watch Zombie Loan.

Zombie Loan was a manga written by the duo, Peach-Pit, also responsible for Shugo Chara, Rozen Maiden, DearS and some other stuff I have never seen nor read. It was published by Square Enix. The anime version was handled by Xebec in 2007 with eleven episodes airing  two more being released only on the DVD. Let's delve into the series and see what awaits us.Story:Kita Michiru can see something that no one else can when she takes off her glasses,...a dark ring around the neck of a person who's fated to die shortly. One day, she spots a pure black ring around the necks of two classmates, Chika and Shito, who had shortly before survived a bridge accident that had killed everyone else involved. Following the two to warn them, Michiru discovers a secret. They didn't survive the crash. They died and were given a loan that allows them to keep going. To pay off this “zombie” loan, they fight mindless and illegal zombies for bounties. At first, Chika and Shito plan to kill Michiru to keep her quiet, but once they learn of her ability to see the rings they decide to put her to work. She just has to use her shinigami eyes to help them in their endeavours, but it won't be easy. There's a rise in zombies like Chika and Shito, except these zombies operate without authorization and they turn both animals and people into the mindless variety of zombie.There are two significant problems with the narrative. The first is that the series has an issue with continuity. There's a major retcon that comes out of absolutely nowhere because... the plot needed it to work. The series also establishes that zombies start to lose their emotions, outright states that it's happening with a specific character and then proceeds to show us that character experiencing anger, distress, and all manner of other emotions in subsequent episodes. There are also some real contrivances for the plot to work. The biggest one being the reason why Chika and Shito are working together.Those complaints aside, there are some positive aspects to the story as well. The premise is interesting and the tension is developed very organically. The series is also very good in terms of progression. There's always something compelling happening and the stopping points for the individual episodes are very well chosen. The series proper ends at a good point as well, with the completion of a major arc.   Although the extra episodes start a new story arc, but only do the basic introduction for it, which didn't bother me since they are added episodes, but I can see why it might bother someone else. The series also excels at emotional investment. There are some really strong tragic scenes, some good triumphant moments, some touching scenes and amusing comedic moments. That isn't to say that all of the emotional moments work, there are certainly some that don't, but the majority of them do hit the mark.Characters:There are some really interesting characters in this. Initially, it looks like Shito, Chika and Michiru are all going to be pretty archetypical, but all of them develop beyond that fairly quickly and grow into fairly complex characters. The same is true for a lot of the side characters. Even if I'm not sure whether they're using a pseudo-scientific understanding of dissociative identity disorder with Koyomi or there's something else going on with her. It's probably explained in the manga at some point, but the anime either leaves it out or doesn't get to it.Really, the only weakness is in the familial dynamics. Chika's interactions with his father and sister are questionable at best. There are also some disturbing implications involved in Shito's back-story. Really, the most natural family relationship is Michiru's dynamic with her aunt and uncle and they barely appear in the anime, act like jerks and are banished from the story.Art:The art is a bit odd. Most of the time it does look really good with some strong character designs, action sequences and backgrounds. However, there are quite a few more light-hearted scenes where the art style switches to a very lazy, minimalistic style. I'm not certain whether they thought stick figure drawings were funny or they just decided that they didn't need to put an effort into drawing those particular scenes. Either way, it looks pretty bad.Sound:They got some great actors for this series. Chika is voiced by Suzumura Kenichi (also the voice of KnK's Mikiya Kokutou) Kuwashima Houko (Kurumi 2's Nako) voices Michiru. Shito is voiced by Sakurai Takahiro, the actor known for his work as Cloud Strife. Although he plays against character a bit since he doesn't cross dress or chase after a childhood love interest in this one. The music is decent enough except for the stuff with lyrics. The stuff with lyrics is a cacophonous mess.Ho-yay:There's a fair amount of ho-yay in this. Shiba gets some homo-erotic moments with both Chika and Shito and they also get some with each other. During the extra episodes Shito even asks another guy if he can kiss him. It does, however, have more les-yay. Koyomi's second personality, Yomi does quite a few things with Michiru. Things which she really should have asked before doing, but to be fair she does stop when Michiru tells her she doesn't like what she's doing. Although, even with that scene it's hard to call it a one-sided thing. Since, during the two extra episodes, Michiru does demonstrate some feelings for Koyomi. So, there is some pretty blatant stuff both between men and between women but none of it amounts to a full fledged romantic relationship, at least not in the anime. It might in the manga, but I haven't read through it yet so I don't know. So, the ho-yay factor for the anime is going to be a 6/10.Final Thoughts:Zombie Loan is a good action adventure series with an interesting premise, compelling build up, strong acting, and good characters. Unfortunately, it also has some serious drawbacks in terms of narrative continuity and character dynamics. So, it is good but not great. My final rating is going to be a solid 7/10. If it sounds interesting to you, check it out. It's only eleven episodes, thirteen if you get into the specials, so it's a pretty fast watch. Well, that's another horror anime month complete.

If so, I believe you'll enjoy this series.Story:Zombie-Loan's story... well, to be honest, I haven't seen any animes that really focus on zombies, so this was definitely a first for me, so if anyone says this is a rip-off, don't believe them. The story centers mainly around 3 people, Michiru, who has Shinigami eyes, and can see if someone will do soon by seeing a black ring around their neck; and then Chika and Shito. I won't go into detail about their story, because it could spoil everyone, but let's just say that they hunt for zombies...for a living... in the meantime. The goal is to hunt down zombies, or those that should have passed on but did not, and destroy them and give them a proper funeral. But that;s just the beginning. The story gets much better near the end.Art:Well, the art is good, if you ask me. Especially when it goes into those comedic moments. It made me laugh countless times, that's for sure. The art is suitable.Sound:The sound was GREAT! I heard everything crystal clear and the music and score was great also. Awesome ending theme, eh?Overall:Just watch this series. It is good, I had to keep watching it because I just had to see what happened. It's a shame that the studio cut this series short, because it was scheduled for 20+ episodes. But hey, there's a 2 episode OVA afterward and who knows, there may be more in the future.I recommend this series to any hardcore anime fan. for a living... in the meantime.

I highly doubt it is though.  I overall liked this anime but it did lack some good qualities.For starters, Zombie Loan is only 11 episodes long so the storyline lacks depth and moves way too fast.  The concept is a good but really you need more episodes in order for it to work.The animation was good.  I'm a sucker for hot anime guys and this anime gave me 2 more.  XD  I also like that they brought a little...humor to the anime with the characters when they were irritated or happy and their heads and eyes would get big and they'd start waving their arms around.  I do think that the colors could have been brighter and the zombies could have been more rotted and gross looking.The music I have mixed feelings about.  The opening music I liked up until the singing.  The background music was sometimes good but I did notice that sometimes it was saxaphones and that made me go wth??  Zombies + Saxaphones= Epic Fail.I liked the characters a lot and the voice actors did a very good job I think.  And I love how the same guy that did the voice of Hikaru in Ouran High School Host Club was Chika because in a way, those 2 characters are similar.I did enjoy watching this anime for the most part but when I got down to the last few episodes I got bored with it because as I said before, the storyline moved way to fast.  I give this a low rewatch value.So overall, it was a good anime.  Not the best I've seen but good.  Now if they came out with a second season, I might be happier because I really didn't want it to end so fast. humor to the anime with the characters when they were irritated or happy and their heads and eyes would get big and they'd start waving their arms around.

Now if they came out with a second season, I might be happier because I really didn't want it to end so fast."", ""Well, having just finished this series, I can actually say that I found this to be a really enjoyable short series (IMO too short but I will mention this as I go through the review)Story: Well my whole reason for starting the show was because I thought the plot was so unique and instantly grabbed me from the few lines, the idea of somebody being able to know when someone is about to die was an instant appeal, throw in some already dead zombies and I was set. Unfortunately as i stated, the show was only 11 episodes long, and for me that was just...waaay too short, and as a result left quite a few questions to be answered at the end. An example being that it is never explained why the two male characters have to switch hands in order to summon their weapons, it says WHAT will happen if they dont switch, and WHAT will happen if they didn't switch back. There are many other little plotholes and things that I would like to have been answered but I shant bother you with them all, because tbh if your going to give this series a try (which I think you should) then you will realise what im saying, it is said that this series was originally going to be 20+ episodes... why did it not?! I really think the story could have had so much more depth and so many of these 'unanswered questions' actually answered, and us not craving a second series. But the actualy storyline was great, and I was thurally gripped from beggining to end, I just wish that it had more time to develop and go into detail but I think that was impossible in just 11 episodes, so theres no suprise as to how many plotholes there was.Art: Well I'm not a big expert an Art, but on this series I really enjoyed the artwork used, I loved the style of the female characters (they were very cute... especially Michiru) the males... I liked, although Chika's hair was mental and spikey as hell! I felt they semt a tad plain and scruffy compared but still nothing too bad, and there personalities and everything else made up for it IMO, I must say i'm easily pleased when it comes to art, I will hardly ever come out and say 'god that art was pathetic'  or 'I hated that artwork' but thats just me.Sound: Well there wasn't much music throughout the episodes (or none that I can really re-call) so if there was, then obviously nothing really spectacular if I can't even remember there being any, as for the opening and end themes. The opening was... neither good nor bad for me, after reading some reviews and everyone saying how bad the screaming was, I was expecting it to be proper death metal screamo style. But it wasn't although yes the man was screaming/shouting, I would not say it was heavy.. If anything I found the scappy guitar to sound a little like libertines but obviously just much heavier vocals. The ending theme.. I actually had to go back to have a couple of listens, which tbh says it all, again.. neither good nor bad, it goes well with the whole them of the series, and nice still shots of the characters and even had a catchy verse. But yeah.. nothing that really stood out for me.Character: I pretty much liked all the characters.. even the villains, with it only being 11 episodes I found Chika and Shito's relationship to be the most intresting, they were both total....well...... you get the idea, yet at times they semt to really respect each other and come together as a team. But at times they were just hilarious, and I thought they were too very intresting characters (again if more episodes were made, I think they could have been made into even better characters). Michiru played the shy, coy character very well, I especially found her hilarious towards the end, especially the last episodes.. and well her relationship with Koyomo is really quite outstanding, and even though it was fan service stuff, I found more hilarious than anything, and really had me laughing. I also thought there was a couple of useless characters who didn't really bring anything to the series such as Momoka (Chika's younger sister) who.. well did notthing but text on her phone, and also Yuuta who I thought was actually an intresting character whenever she popped up, and I personally would've liked to have seen her in abit more, but unfortunately didn't really think she brought much to the show.Enjoyment: Thurally enjoyed seeing this series, from the reviews I saw, they were pretty much spot on in that it had a great concept, but unfortunately was let down by there only being 11 episodes, therefore major plotholes etc etc. But nevertheless for what it is, and for what you are given its a great short horror series, with great and likeable characters, an overall very good plot. Also very funny, with it being a horror I expect minimal laughter and gags. But quite a few times I was actually left in stitches from some of the scenes/comments made by characters, and I found that to be a really nice touch seeing as it was something I wasn't really expecting. One thing that I might have wanted to see for more enjoyment was better fight scenes, none of them felt action packed and long enough. Although some of the villains were kinda creepy, they didn't put up much of a fight.Overall: Unfortunately (without trying to repeat myself over and over which I know I am doing) due to the shortness of the series the story/plot left a lot unanswered and major plotholes revealed, not really giving it time to sink in, and also for some of the characters to develop fully. But on the other hand for what the story is, its a very good idea, and I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Enjoyable characters, humour, zombies. An anime I am not regretting seeing. waaay too short, and as a result left quite a few questions to be answered at the end.

An anime I am not regretting seeing."", ""What drew me to this anime was the fact that it was a zombie anime, I mean you dont see an anime with zombies too often usualy its just demons and vampires.the zombies are not the typical zombies you see in movies, they are quite intelligent and capable and arn't rotting corpses which puts some originality to this anime.Well, lets start with the characters Kita Michiru is a girl who has the gift of shinigami eyes, but starts to hate it when she sees black rings on her parents, when they die she starts using glasses to negate the effect of the shinigami eyes. she...has no goals or any aspirations and does not even care if she dies.Kita usualy has a hard time speaking her mind and always does what people tell her to do no question(no backbone whatsover!).Chika and Shito are the zombies who work to repay there debt to zombie loan office(some sort of office that leases life instead of money)which saved them from a tragic accident that happened prior to the series.Chika is lively and out-going kinda, but he has a short temper, he uses a katana! Shito is the more calm one, while Chika is cocky and impulsive one, although Shito can be cold at times. Along the way we meet some more wacky and weird characters in this 11 episode anime although most of them are quite forgettable. The art in this anime is excellent and stylish, while the animation is pretty bad and dont even get me started on the opening theme, which is the worst opening theme I have heard, of course the horrible vocals dont help, ending is only a LITTLE bit better.One of the bad things about this anime is that its way too short, I read somewhere that the manga had 9 volumes, they could have made at least 26 episodes from that.I GIVE THIS ANIME A 7/10 its pretty good, but I wish it was longer.Yeah, this is one of my old reviews I did for a site about 3-4 years ago,  hope you enjoyed reading it. has no goals or any aspirations and does not even care if she dies.Kita usualy has a hard time speaking her mind and always does what people tell her to do no question(no backbone whatsover!).Chika and Shito are the zombies who work to repay there debt to zombie loan office(some sort of office that leases life instead of money)which saved them from a tragic accident that happened prior to the series.Chika is lively and out-going kinda, but he has a short temper, he uses a katana!

I didn't have too much of that.Shito seems to throw off that air of arrogance but since he gets an equal amount of punishment in the series, it seems balanced.The story was a tad confusing but the arcs are pretty easy to figure out, from what I can understand it's about two dead guys that have to kill zombies in order to...come alive again using the main character girl as help for it. Seems pretty straightforward to me and that's what I enjoy.Once I ignored the fanservice and the occasional mood switch of Shito (a prime offender because he pingpongs between being nice and arrogant in less than an episode) and Chika, this series was pretty fun to watch.As for the artwork, I expected some skinny bishounens simply because I mean, let's face it, the manga was made in '02.And I can't lie, I didn't like the opening but I loved the ending theme song.My overall enjoyment is simply that I liked it, personally. The simple storyline, the cool ending theme, the different characters. I just wish that there were a few more episodes to explain some more stuff but it was a nice little series for what it was.I recommend it just to get some kicks out of an old school supernatural series. come alive again using the main character girl as help for it.

Overall, I thought this was a pretty good anime. It had a well developed storyline, but I was hoping that it'd be longer, because of its outstanding and creative characters. It's kind of like the other animes, where theres a kiddsh guy and a cold guy and a girl in the middle, but it's a little different, too. I mean each character has their own kind of way to react in a different situation. Like, all the characters in this anime are different from each other, yet the are similar, too. I just like it, because it's a lot of personalities and action all...mixed together into a great anime! mixed together into a great anime!"", ""Zombie Loan was a very short anime, but partly I think that's a good thing. If it had continued for an extra 50 episodes it probably would have become a series full of fillers and other rubbish things still managing to cut a lot of things from the manga. But as the manga is still ongoing I think hope for a second series is good, but it will probably be short too (a lot like Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty).Overall it is a good anime and you should watch it if you have a day spare.

Story: 7, I gave this story line a 7, it's a really cool concept, however the zombies aren't really the whole infectious- destroy their brains to kill them. They're just people who died and are still living. I think what would have made this story better is if here was more episodes, the lack of episodes did make this anime have less of a plot to grow.Art: 7, there is nothing particularly special about...the art, the characters are quite lanky though.Sound: 4, I watched this a few months ago and the music hasn't really stuck with me; not very memorable.Character: 6, There was bit of a backstory to some of the characters but there was no real development of them which happens in longer animes. (You can see a common negative theme here)Enjoyment: 7, I watched it, it was okay, could have been much better, but it wasn't particularly bad; the fact the story was quite interesting made it enjoyable.Overall I give it a 7, technically the average is nearer to 6 but still, I'm nice- the main improvement is for there to be more episodes. the art, the characters are quite lanky though.Sound: 4, I watched this a few months ago and the music hasn't really stuck with me; not very memorable.Character: 6, There was bit of a backstory to some of the characters but there was no real development of them which happens in longer animes.

Every one I knew was telling me that this was a pretty good anime, so I sat down and made myself watch all 11 episodes.First off I almost quit halfway into the first episode because I personally HATED the art style. And still do to this day. And I'm normally not super picky about these things (I can usually get into a style like 2 episodes in), so me not liking an art style ALL the way through the anime is pretty weird. But you know-the quality of the art wasn't bad, it was just the style so...I managed to get myself through this.The story line seemed a bit cliché at first, but it gets better. The only thing I didn't really like was how short each arc was, but hey, it's 11 episodes. What do you expect.Overall, other than a couple of things here and there, it's not that bad of a series.

If only they could have actually put in some more effort in to making it live up to it's full potential, this anime could have been really amazing.This anime leaves a lot to be desired, it sorta follows the vague description to the dot, I found myself lacking any kind of emotion while watching this. It made me smile and let out a small chuckle hear and there but nothing at all like I expected. It just makes you wish they would've done 'this' or 'that' to improve....Though...the concept was interesting, they failed to actually deliver it which I found fairly disappointingAs for art, I couldn't say it was bad, It was pretty decent actually. I didn't have much issues looking at it, nothing was particularly 'amazing' about it but in the end I actually liked all the visuals giving the art category a 7.Starting off I'd like to say I actually thoroughly enjoyed the theme to this anime, aside from that though I don't have much to say about the sound.

Thanks to one of seven ferrymen (Bekko) from the World Fate Organization, the boys have been ""brought back to life"" through a contract known as a Zombie-Loan. Bekko runs a business (also known as Zombie-Loan, or Z-Loan for short) based on these contracts. Tachibana and Shito are now indebted to the ferryman and they must hunt zombies to earn the funds to pay off their debt within a year, or...it\'s game over, and there will be no coming back a second time.A great series with lots of action and supernatural references. I love how different mythologies and religious ideas were infused in this anime, allowing a wide audience to be able to enjoy it without to offensive feeling that some animes invoke when they play the religion card. The character development in this series was absolutely great and the overall animation was pretty good, too. I have to rate the sound low, though, for one reason: the opening theme song was utterly horrific. I listened to maybe thirty seconds of it, determined to give it a chance, before quickly skipping ahead to the actual episode. I found this series to be a little too short, but I think the original plan was to have it go for over twenty episodes, so I can\'t complain about it too much. The action sequences and storyline made this anime one of the greatest I\'ve seen in a while, and I most certainly do recommend it to anyone who likes a good taste of action. Character relationships were well balanced in this particular series, including the surly Tachibana and the reckless Akatsuki (our main zombie-hunting boys). The bit characters were also pretty interesting in their own ways, though some of the lesser characters could have been brought out a bit more, such as the Chairperson of the Academy and her ""pet,"" Lyca. This series doesn\'t put too much out there for the shojou crowds, but it came across to me as something rather refreshing; finally there is an anime that includes guys, girls, action, sharp-tongues, a little taste of yuri, but not a whole lot of gushy confessions and lovey-dovey smooching. Actually, there were virtually no confessions or smooching. :DAll in all, an excellent series that left me begging for more. it\'s game over, and there will be no coming back a second time.A great series with lots of action and supernatural references.

I found many similiarities between them.Story: much like Claymore, it started pretty good: a unique, not very cliched story, though the monster theme is not very uncommon; anyway, it was good. And it was excited untill 5 minutes before the ending... The anime did not even end; it just started! It was not even an open end like Jigoku Shoujo (which many people do not like but I do). Since the story did not end, it's only 4/10. And not to mention, we got yuri actions around. No good!Art: The animation was...pretty good. The colour looked a little dull and unlively but it fit the theme of the anime. The motion was fluid. Generally, there is not much to complain about the animation.Sound: decent but not impressive. Both the opening and ending theme were not particularly good it it sounds OK. 7/10 for sound.Characters: my criteria for good characters is: not cliched. And Zombie loan made it. It was not cliched. It was quite unique and good. The only thing that held the character point back was the girl with &quot;yuri&quot; personality.Enjoyment: yet another similiarity to Claymore. The story was enough for you to enjoy until the 5 minutes before the ending. Once it hit the ending, it made you feel disappointed and think &quot;what the hell the show was all about? Did it end, or just started?&quot;. The anime were supposed to be a stand-alone or promotion for the manga. So bad that I had to give it a 5 for enjoyment.Overall: this show is just scarely above average. I burned the whole thing to DVD and locked it up forever, never to watch again.

The premise itself was quite original where Chika and Shito are being loaned life as zombies in exchange for hunting evil ""illegal"" zombies. The show effectively mixes serious and comedic moments as it looks into the various dealings that Shito, Chika and the other members of Zombie Loan deal with, particularly the chemistry between Shito and Chika as they don\'t exactly get along much of the time in the series. The show does do well enough in fleshing out...the backgrounds of the two boys and Michiru and what led them to become clients to Zombie Loan thus it is easy to get some sort of connection with their characters. It also does well enough at covering the exact details surrounding zombies in the world of the series and the conditions surrounding Shito and Chika\'s deal in still being alive.However with the anime being based on ongoing source material, Zombie-Loan definitely leaves the feel of being incomplete. Some characters have their backgrounds hinted upon yet are never explored and there are some lingering plot developments left hanging such as the presence of several groups serving as adversaries to the Zombie Loan group.The presentation to Zombie-Loan does come across as a bit subpar. While scenery and character designs do have a decent amount of detail with subdued colors that fit in well with the supernatural feel the series gives off, the animation noticeably takes shortcuts and the series is nowhere as fluid and vivid as titles like Death Note and Moribito that aired in the same year. While the soundtrack does its part with having insert music tracks that fit in with the mood of specific scenes, none of it really sticks out. Not to mention that the OP and ED musical choices can be quite grating to the ears and are best to skip through.Overall, Zombie-Loan proved to be enjoyable for me thanks to its original premise and chemistry between Shito, Chika and Michiru. However, it was quite clear this series had a bigger story that it didn\'t have the time to tell thus unless another season of Zombie-Loan comes out, the viewer is left to try continuing the series through the manga source material.

There is actually 13 episodes. Proof of this is found on this website if you wish to confirm it for yourselves: http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Zombie-Loan please copy and paste and look at the information on the site (sorry to the writers of the summary of the series but maybe have a look at it too and or check your resource material. I just want to make sure everyone is receiving the correct information is all)Story: 8For a anime with 13 episodes it is quite a...weird anime right from the word go. Girl has the ability to see who is going to die and see rings around their necks, before long she comes across the zombie guys who have a contract with a guy who is the caretaker and someone who guides people to the other realm be it heaven or hell. Overall the story isn't what made me curious or interested in this anime, but rather the characters.Art: 7It is pretty average in most circumstances, why do I say this is well for a anime released in 2007, I would have thought that it would have looked a little better. As art can often set the tone of a anime. Overall they at least did their best and in a way I like the feel the art style gives off to help make us all understand where and when this anime is set in. It also helps us understand that most of the events seem to happen after dark.Sound: 5For a anime released in 2007, the voices a clear and easy to understand what is said. It could however have used a Original Soundtrack of it's own to help give viewers a clear understanding as to how each character feels. Otherwise the opening just seems like a scream band of sorts and the words are hard to understand as to what is being sung.Character: 8As I was watching the anime I noticed that gradually we get to see a different side to each of the characters that we didn't see originally when the anime first started or when we started to watch it. And whilst Kita starts of as a obedient, well behaved average school girl who can see the rings around people's necks which are a sign that they are going to die. She starts off afraid of it but over a period of time she seems to gradually accept that it is apart of her and wo she is. Overall I liked that about her, cause it isn't often that a anime character starts off as somewhat of a weak personality. As of yet I haven't found any characters that I disliked or hated, be it their personality or not.Enjoyment: 6Right now I am up to episode 10 out of 13. Normally once I start a anime I will watch it to the very end cause I want to know if they achieve their goals or what they set out to do. But as I stated in the character section of my review, I honestly can't say I am finding it hard to follow or even anything that I honestly dislike as of yet. But it is defiantly interesting enough to make me want to sit down and watch it from start to finish.Overall: 8Look this anime has it's flaws much the same as a few others and sure there could be things they could fix to make more and more people watch this and become hooked on it but overall really can't pick out what I dislike or like exactly as of yet. But it is a different storyline in comparrasson to a few others to do with the dead or even spirits such as the anime xxXHolicXxx, but it is a anime that is worth seeing. After all you might like it. I think it really will depend on the individual as to if they would like it for sure. But do give it a go for yourself. weird anime right from the word go.

It consists of 11 episodes. The storyline is quite clear, although the ending didn't really end the story for me. Maybe there will be a second season, or the makers just decided to let the viewer decide for themselves how the story would end. The art is very nice and detailed, and the sound and music was very appropriate in each situation. The characters have a clear personality, but they aren't all flat characters because some of them change a little throughout the story.

I loved it! I couldn't stop watching!And if I look back on it with the view of someone trying to give an informed critique, it honestly doesn't make sense.

PLEASE WE NEED A SECOND SEASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ', 'Ok, Zombie Loan isn\'t really a, say, ""popular"" anime. It hasn\'t gotten noticeable reviews and doesn\'t really stand out as a ""special"" anime. It fits in with the common theme of resurrecting the undead and fighting Zombies and demons, which so hasn\'t been done before... *Cough* High School of the Dead *Cough* D. Gray Man *Cough* Blood Lad...Story: 6; This is whyThe plot line for Zombie Loan is pretty creative, seeking resurrection for individual reasons after dying in a sad accident. There are just too many familiar plot elements that are seen everywhere in all undead demonic zombie anime... Also, the plot is all...over the place. Where does it even start?!! The transition from arc-to-arc is so confusing sometimes with a whole bunch of added elements to keep track of! I had to watch that ""Crushed Butterfly Code"" part 4 times to understand it, and I still see it as a whole shitload of unnecessary elements. It\'s like the author thought of this one day and wanted to show off his ""cleverness"" and just added it, cause, ""who gives a fuck anyway right?"" But seriously, elements were added at the last moment and when they weren\'t even needed and that just turned the anime into one big clusterfuck of unrelated SHIT! And the ending was the worst out of every anime I\'ve ever watched, y\'know, I\'m actually gonna switch the plot to a 5, cause I just realized how terrible it is.Art: 8Its kind of like a mixture between a lazy Death Note and a lazy Code Geass. It\'s alright, compared to stuff like Lucky Star and the dark colors really set the mood. No one was wearing bright colors in the whole anime. The brightest color I saw was Michiru\'s hair. And I LOVED IT!Sound: 7There are actually pretty good moments in the transitional soundtrack of this anime. The action scenes seemed to be pretty well recorded and matched with the right music, and the opening sounded a lot like Trigun, which I sort of like b/c I LOVED the Trigun opening! But its really nothing special if you think about it...Character: 5I\'m sorry, there were way too many characters for such a short anime. It was a SIN! Every episode, a new character came in, like that red-haired dick in episode, like, 9. Like, wtf? And those three characters at the end! You didn\'t even need them! They were the reason the ending sucked! omg, this anime did not know it\'s limits when it came to character! It was overwhelming! Michiru once again plays that archetypical girl who can\'t do shit for herself and always gets in the way! That\'s pathetic! And then she follow them around for the rest of the anime! (It doesn\'t make sense, I know, just watch it for yourself and you\'ll see)Enjoyment: 7B/w the clusterfuck rushed plot, and annoying, superfluous characters, I actually might\'ve enjoyed just a little. I mean, I liked some of the action scenes and the antagonists. But that\'s really all I have to say about that... Not enough for redemption though... sorry Zombie Loan.Overall: 6 over the place. Where does it even start?!! The transition from arc-to-arc is so confusing sometimes with a whole bunch of added elements to keep track of! I had to watch that ""Crushed Butterfly Code"" part 4 times to understand it, and I still see it as a whole shitload of unnecessary elements. It\'s like the author thought of this one day and wanted to show off his ""cleverness"" and just added it, cause, ""who gives a fuck anyway right?"" But seriously, elements were added at the last moment and when they weren\'t even needed and that just turned the anime into one big clusterfuck of unrelated SHIT! And the ending was the worst out of every anime I\'ve ever watched, y\'know, I\'m actually gonna switch the plot to a 5, cause I just realized how terrible it is.Art: 8Its kind of like a mixture between a lazy Death Note and a lazy Code Geass. It\'s alright, compared to stuff like Lucky Star and the dark colors really set the mood. No one was wearing bright colors in the whole anime. The brightest color I saw was Michiru\'s hair.

I personally thought all the characters were great and the story managed to get the main characters' back stories told well, but unfortunately they were rushed and therefore not really.... big moments threw the series. The villains in this anime were good, but sadly as soon as they appeared, they were gone and the same for their victims. If they had made this series twice its length or more, I believe it would have be a very good anime. The art jumps about a lot between anime style to cartoony quick style.... don't know...if there's a name for it  but I personally enjoyed it. I thought it made it more humorous and creative. The main character is enjoyable  and seems to get better as the series goes along and I'd say if it got longer she would have become a bad ass character ..... but still goofy  in her ways.

(let's hunt them all)...this series can be considered quite an old series of anime compared to others like K and Blood-C (uhhhh, so disturbing).The series is obviously about Zombies, but non of them are really the kind of Zombies we would think about.These Zombies are obviously dead people, but they don't go around eating peoples brains like we see in modern games and films. These Zombies are the type of Zombies who kill the Zombies that would usually eat peoples brains.

After the first episode we realise that thi girl is not normal and she is one of the only people who has eyes called Shinigami eyes. In this series the Shinigami eyes allow you to see either black or grey rings on peoples necks. If the ring is Black then the shinigami will soon take their life, if its grey it means that their life can be lived a bit more longer.The other two main characters are Chika and Shito. These two even though allies, hate each other and have to pay off their loan in order to get their lifes back. These two are quite mysterious characters, as they both have their own secrets, they hate each other and they can both take off their right hand. when they do this their weapons are shown. There are distinct differences as Shito is only able to guide souls to hell before the Shinigami clams them whilst Chika can only guide souls to Heaven.These three characters, and a freaky other bunch, make up the story line as they are the only ones who actually do the whole zombie hunting thing. But later on their appears to be another mysterious group who are creating Zombie Loans illegally.The animation in the series does seem a little outdated for me, but the story line and characters tick all of the boxes for me.

The art style is a little strange but you do get used to it over time, I like it since it's kind of a break for me from all the big buff men of the shonen genre.

The opening starts off with a bang with a badass opening by The Birthday. It seemed promising…It most suffers from bad and inconsistent writing. In the very start zombies Chika and Shito plan to kill Michiru for discovering their secret of them being zombies, which is illogical as what threat would she pose? Shito may do it but the action does not befit Chika.Soon they realize Michiru has a special ability of spotting zombies with her eyes. They save her after death, and then all three of...them need to work together in order to pay off their debt. Michiru’s usefulness quickly wears off since she has no prowess in combat and 9/10 situations don’t let her use her only redeeming ability — her eyes. In fact it seems that she is the one causing tension between Shito and Chika. They keep mentioning that they’d kill her if she did not do her job, but this never does come close to happening. The show keeps establishing the fact that they are not friends, but at the same time layers gags upon gags and even puts in a vacation episode — a brazen contradiction.The “big bad” or motivator behind Zombie-loan is the grim reaper. He kills those who are supposed to be dead or are actually going to die. When he appears, he is menacing. The later episodes, shrink him down to a chibi and has him working with Zombie-loan for some reason. It turns out he is woefully inefficient at his job, as the zombie he was supposed to have killed survived.Another impetus is the time limit Zombie-loan imposes. If debt is not paid back in a year, the zombie will die. But if they extend it via payment, they will live forever. Such a thing is not taken seriously, except by Chika. We don’t know exactly how much debt the trio is in, nor are we given details into what bounties are worth which (although there is a further emphasis on stronger zombies being worth more). Consequently we cannot track their progress nor place any value on their actions — especially when further trivial debt is constantly added on. Only Chika has a desire to return back to a human. Shito, as it turns out, has always been a zombie and is over 100 years old. Michiru does not see an issue with extending the deal and living for forever. Regardless, they mostly screw around.Much of the show is a bore, and a pain to get through. One character’s existence is largely just for fanservie and to assault the main character. Sentimental moments fall flat, the zombies are not scary nor are they taken seriously and rarely any action happens. There are plot twists and revelations but the poor execution makes them anticlimactic. The story is obviously incomplete, and tons of things are not explained.

The story is really good, it\'s not just your everyday ""We need to kill Zombies to survive"" - series, it\'s way deeper than that (The main characters still kill Zombies in order to survive but it\'s different lol). The idea of how everything works in Zombie Loan with Zombies,...why they exist, etc. is pretty refreshing and I\'ve never came across anything similar so far. That\'s why I was pretty sad when I found out that the anime isn\'t complete.I also wouldn\'t call this anime bad because of how it adapted the manga. I may have not read the manga but I was able to follow through the anime very nicely and the pacing was really really good. Apart from 2 episodes I can\'t remember any filler episodes so I like to think that the adaption was pretty well done even if I haven\'t read the manga myself.Furthermore I also don\'t call this anime bad because of it\'s characters, though they are pretty basic. Nothing special to say here really except for that Michiru can be a bit annoying as she an absolute people pleaser to an extreme extend that she can get on your nerves for apologizing for the 100th time at some point.I call this anime ""bad"" because it\'s clearly had issues with budget. Bland backgrounds, partially too simple / boring animation in an anime that partially focusses on fights with zombies / action and I also feel that the art style is something to get used to. It\'s just not pleasant to look at.But I am still glad I found and watched this anime because I would have never ever started to read the manga just like that. And thats why (to answer my question from the start) I am happy that this anime exists. The manga is probably way better but without this adaption I would\'ve never considered reading the manga.

Akkun to Kanojo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36864/Akkun_to_Kanojo,"[""When it comes to Japan's obsession with trying to make things 'cute', nothing is out of bounds in the realm of possibility.\xa0 In an effort to make even the simple story of an idealized high school romance quirky and comedic, I think it's clear that sometimes things get taken too far even if it's for laughs.Akkun to Kanojo or 'Akkun and his girlfriend' grants us a 2 cours of 3 minute episodes, each episode functioning like a 4-koma series where we're treated to Atsuhiro, or Akkun, playing a male tsundere to his girlfriend whenever she comes to spend time together or suggest something for them...to do.The main draw of this series comes primarily from his reactions where he shoots down his girlfriend Non's suggestions a la verbal abuse (literally calling her trash, ugly, what have you), before going to the other room and acting all deredere and obsessive in secret because in reality, he sees her as an angel that's graced this plagued earth and should be protected at all costs.\xa0 He just can't physically show any affection towards her while she's around because...reasons.\xa0 This persists throughout the entire runtime, and thank god it's only 3 minutes per episode because being subjected to this schtick for longer would be slogging the experience.In fact, I feel like any of the other 'couples' featured in the show: Atsuhiro's sister x his arguably creepy best friend, and the teacher with X face snake girl would be an even better story to tell because even though they stick to the status quo just like any other 4-koma, they actually seem like they could get somewhere, and they do actually make inches of progress.\xa0 Whereas on the other hand, our main couple doesn't do jack and it's actually more unsettling to watch especially considering our main protagonist records the voice and has an entire room filled with pictures of his girlfriend on the walls and ceiling.\xa0 Which is NOT cute in the slightest.Personally I don't think even by anime short standards that this is anything worth watching.\xa0 It feels like Japan is just trying to make whatever kind of quirky relationship they can cute, when it's visually a very unhealthy and somewhat abusive relationship intended to be played for laughs.\xa0 Definitely not an hour and a half well spent. to do.The main draw of this series comes primarily from his reactions where he shoots down his girlfriend Non's suggestions a la verbal abuse (literally calling her trash, ugly, what have you), before going to the other room and acting all deredere and obsessive in secret because in reality, he sees her as an angel that's graced this plagued earth and should be protected at all costs.\xa0 He just can't physically show any affection towards her while she's around because...reasons.\xa0 This persists throughout the entire runtime, and thank god it's only 3 minutes per episode because being subjected to this schtick for longer would be slogging the experience.In fact, I feel like any of the other 'couples' featured in the show: Atsuhiro's sister x his arguably creepy best friend, and the teacher with X face snake girl would be an even better story to tell because even though they stick to the status quo just like any other 4-koma, they actually seem like they could get somewhere, and they do actually make inches of progress.\xa0 Whereas on the other hand, our main couple doesn't do jack and it's actually more unsettling to watch especially considering our main protagonist records the voice and has an entire room filled with pictures of his girlfriend on the walls and ceiling.\xa0 Which is NOT cute in the slightest.Personally I don't think even by anime short standards that this is anything worth watching.\xa0 It feels like Japan is just trying to make whatever kind of quirky relationship they can cute, when it's visually a very unhealthy and somewhat abusive relationship intended to be played for laughs.\xa0 Definitely not an hour and a half well spent."", ""It's not the type of story that you would make in 'shorts'. A tsundere guy needs a further development for it to be appreciated, plus the relationship they have is actually unhealthy and insensitive. It tries hard to be funny and make a comedy out of their skits, but if you think of it, the guy is actually irresponsible with what he has, given that her girlfriend is so, so much understanding on behalf of him.The art is very good though. It follows the art style of good anime shows that I've watched. Too bad, the story didn't match it. "", 'So I don\'t really have an affinity for shorts (I didn\'t really like Love is Like a Cocktail), but I don\'t outright hate them either. I think telling a comprehensive story in such a short frame of time is really difficult. Which is why I was blown away by how well these shorts tied in and developed over the course of the season. While only about 3 minutes long, the story centers around 3 different couples in a similar circle of friends.Since it\'s a short, I don\'t want to go into too much detail about the roles and development, as it honestly would only take...you about an hour to binge them all. The romance was pretty well established, and the comedy was competent enough that I consistently chuckled at each situation. Honestly this small show was the highlight of my Spring and Summer seasons. Characters connections deepen and improve over the course of the story, which highlights that the world is a bit dynamic rather than just a static joke that goes on way too long. Story and character are the two main parts of this short, but the art style isn\'t bad either. The biggest shame is that I could find nowhere that had a translated and uploaded manga online.Akkun to Kanojo is a very short, brisk, and fun show that\'s sure to appease those looking for a good romcom feel without the investment in multiple seasons trying to wade through a harem hoping that ""best girl"" isn\'t ""first girl"". Give this show a go, and I hope it comes around for season 3 so I can see Chiho and Matsuo\'s relationship develop even further. you about an hour to binge them all.

I can't believe that there were only two who made a review of this short anime,welp can't blame the others if they don't feel like making a review of a creepy guy Akkun who pretends to be an asshole towards a sweet dere dere girl like No, no,no,non,no,non Non Katagari who can be considered as wifu material for Akkun if only he's nice, but then again such romance was good though the story was a knock off from Momokuri and Aho Girl so basically the story plot was mediocre. On the art category, well Konagi is what can we call as the...quintessential Zettai Ryoki , with the boobs , while Non was the quintessential panty hose and Kagari Chio well she the quintessential loli around here given that she is in middle school, but seriously, I just don't have much to comment about this anime's illustration, since one won't be seeing any panchira or any lewd fanservices around here. The sound, yes I kinda like the opening theme of this anime and the seiyuu who did Akkun's voice  Suzuki Tatsuhisa whose voice matches perfectly with the character and the one who voices Non , Ayaka Suwa whose voice was just too sweet to be use on the character. Which puts us to the other category, them characters, ok we have  Kagari, Atsuhiro who is one part asshole, one part chauvinist, one part nice guy and one part crazy all put together like a machine with alotta ill-fitted parts , one part of me wants to punch him in his face one part of me like his nice guy attitude, his sister Chiho is also like him except that she isn't crazy and in fact she is the real tsundere here , and I like the way how she treats  Matsuo Masago since he is this nuisance who drops by to hang out and play games, but then again I kinda like him for being able to read Chiho's vibe that he likes her and that she only pretends to hate him.......now on to Irie, Konagi and the  teacher Takumi Kubomura, well I guess we can say that they were the unique, since we have this young girl who is a stalker and the teacher whom somehow likes to be stalk, the again it was nice that the teacher does like Irie, since it isn't always that a cute younger girl approaches an older guy like the teacher. so I guess that characters of this anime did bring something good on the table so overall this anime maybe 4 mins long (which includes the opening), but it was well enjoyable. So, my ratings:Story-Mediocre 5: Since it was a knock off of MomoKuri and Aho Girl, I wanna banana.Art- fair 6: It has the usual quintessentials., nut since there weren't anything lewd here, such score should be enough.Sound-Good 7: That's for the opening theme and for the voices of Akkun and Non.Character- Good 7: I did ended with Akkun finally being man enough to express his feeling for non, but I still wanna punch him in the face for all those verbal assault he did for Non.Enjoyment- Good 7: It was funny, it was romantic, but for the most part I despise Akkun for hiding his feeling towards Non by being an asshole.Overall-Good 7: Not bad for studio Yumeta Company to come up with this short anime, but I still wanna punch Akkun in his face.BOOM!!!!!!!

So, I'd say it was more than a shallow romantic comedy, but a glimpse of a warm and sweet long-term relationship. desires with other people, and that makes them happy and motivates them to evolve and get better. So, I'd say it was more than a shallow romantic comedy, but a glimpse of a warm and sweet long-term relationship."", 'Akkun to Kanojo is quite an uncomfortable show and not in the way you\'d want a comedy to be. This short-length series is intended to be a silly comedy with a simple, high-concept premise (like, for instance, Fudanshi Koukou Seikatsu\'s ""what if a straight guy liked yaoi xD""). However, I’d argue that Akkun to Kanojo’s absolutely goofy premise (""what if a guy treated his girlfriend like shit but actually loves her LOL!"") misfires this time. This premise makes what would otherwise be a bland comedy much worse, though it is certainly also brought down by its other creepy and problematic characters.Essentially, Akkun to Kanojo centres...on three different couples and their clashing personalities, which generates the supposed humor of the show. The first couple consists of the eponymous Akkun and his girlfriend Non. Akkun behaves like a ""tsundere"" in front of Non and shuns her in person, though internally he is completely obsessed with her. This shunning takes the form of verbal abuse, wherein Akkun will tell Non to shut up, call her ugly or trash, or say things like he never wants to see her again. Great guy. Non on the other hand is totally fine with this as she claims to know of his affection deep down. Akkun’s obsession is somehow a bit worse than his shunning as it is often downright creepy; his room, pillow, and sheets are plastered with her photos, he often stalks her after telling her to piss off, and he apparently not only records her but even wiretaps her so he can hear her voice. Big time yikes. Once in a while, Akkun breaks free and is able to show his affection to Non, which I suppose is how their relationship is sustained, but it is always followed by some silly counter effect (he kisses her, then has to distance himself from her for some days). The main gimmick of their relationship is that despite how much he appears to turn Non away, he always has some crazy way to show his true affection in return. Unfortunately, the show seems to think that all of Akkun’s silly antics are funny when they’re really just stale, creepy, and abusive. That and Akkun is just a straight-up unredeeming psychopathic asshole.The second pairing consists of their friend Matsuo and Akkun’s sister Chiho. Matsuo likes to come over to the siblings\' house uninvited, stay for as long as he wants, and play dating sims on their TV. The only person who seems to care (i.e. have some actual sense) is Chiho who always has a retort for him. However, she’s easily flustered and he easily turns whatever she says back on her and continues on. Though Matsuo is also somewhat of a weird creep, this is the more acceptable pair as there is some sort of development between them, adding something more than just stale comedy (this is all relative of course; outside of this series, their shtick is just perfunctory, auto-pilot humour).Lastly is the morally questionable pairing of Irie and Kubomura. Irie is some random friend of the others who is openly thirsty for her laid-back teacher Kubomura. She often proclaims she loves him and schemes to get close to him, such as wilfully flunking her subjects so he can teach her make-up classes (which she doesn’t even listen to). While I would normally be okay with the teacher (as he mostly acts like a normal person), he doesn’t really try hard to reject Irie and treats her with mild apathy, which is also problematic as it just enables her behaviour. Moreover, I’m not really sure what is supposed to be comedic about them. What’s wrong with this pairing is not really the ethics but more that they feel completely tacked on to the show in general. The first two pairs are more close-knit and interact with each other, while these two tend to be more separate from the rest and their scenes tend to occur outside the sphere of the others. They don’t really add anything to the series and don’t have a point for being in the series, aside from adding what the show deems as “humorous”.In general, these pairings are all basically gimmicks: Akkun always does something over-the-top for his infatuation, Chiho is always bickering with Matsuo, and Irie tries to woos Kubomura. These gimmicks aren’t really that funny in the first place however: Akkun is an abusive prick, Matsuo is a weirdo, and Irie is trying to get her teacher arrested. Beyond that, none of the actual jokes have a good comedic foundation, nor are they that varied or distinct, so it feels like the same joke is repeated again and again. The show circulates between these couples, repeating the same “gags” continuously until the end, which miraculously makes this short anime a total drag to watch.I continued watching Akkun to Kanojo to see if there was anything worth taking away. How did Akkun and Non get together? Why do they have a relationship like this? Is there anything redeemable about them? While these questions are partially answered, its rather weak and done in the exaggerated nature of the show. Akkun is a dick and is never given a reason for his behaviour towards Non. He doesn’t seem to feel regret over his words either, which would have made his ridiculous character somewhat more believable and human. The most resistance he receives from others is “Should you really be saying that to her?” but irritatingly enough the show tends to dodge any real answer from him aside from “You don’t understand bro, I actually love her.” His obsession on the other hand is always exaggerated and played on for comedy, which makes it hard to see why he actually likes Non as a person, if at all. Non on the other hand is a total sponge who just takes everything that Akkun says because she knows he actually likes her. Her reason for liking him is the typical anime reason (“He’s a nice guy”). Comically enough, her explanation for how she started liking him is unintentionally laughable as she lists mundane reasons such as ""He waited for someone"" or ""He moved a rock off a wide empty path so people wouldn’t trip"" Seriously? What a freakin’ hero! I still don’t get why she actually likes him and since she doesn’t seem to have a deep connection with him, she could easily find someone that would treat her better (sis!). Honestly, she just reminds me of an abuse victim, which she basically is. None of their behavior is really convincing and I suppose it wouldn’t have to be if the show was actually amusing.Somehow, this aimless series manages to pull off some sort of conflict for its finale but it\'s just really dumb. Of all the bile that comes out of Akkun’s mouth, this time he says ""hate"", and NOW this time Non gets offended because THAT’S THE ONE WORD HE CAN’T SAY. Blahblahblah resolution and all, but seriously how incredibly stupid is that?There was at least one moment in the show where Akkun actually showed some consideration for Non and her feelings, but this one example really highlights what’s wrong with the show: it too often focuses on its unfunny gimmicks, which are made worse by their problematic implications. I would imagine defenders of the show would say that the point is that Akkun and Non are a match for each other, but the show never gives a reason to buy this conceit. Essentially, Akkun to Kanojo just romanticises abusive and toxic relationships.(originally written in 2019) on three different couples and their clashing personalities, which generates the supposed humor of the show. The first couple consists of the eponymous Akkun and his girlfriend Non. Akkun behaves like a ""tsundere"" in front of Non and shuns her in person, though internally he is completely obsessed with her.

A tsundere guy is a common one but this guy here is truly entertaining. It\'s just a 10 episode anime with 3 and a half minutes per episode so it\'s kinda make me feel that this story is a waste, but wait? There really has no plot on this anime. If you want a light story that\'ll make you laugh, this one\'s best for you. It\'s purely comedy. You can just watch it if you want some sort of...stress reliever? The idiocy of the characters are out of the world, it\'s terrifying.CHARACTERS: 8/10All of the characters are idiot, really. They\'re in their own world living and speaking what they want to. And that\'s why this anime turn out to be a really crazy one. There\'s really no character development but the creation of the characters themselves is cute and funny. I can\'t say it is not realistic \'cause I do think there are people like that. But the actions are too foolish it\'s unbelievable if you found someone like these characters.SOUND AND ANIMATION: 9/10The voices of the characters are just fine, except for the line delivery of the main character A-kun. The way he speak ""Non-Tan"" is too hilarious. For a guy like that, it is too cute. The animation of this anime is really great. That\'s one of the reasons why I find it a waste. The character with a blue hair is too cool he can be a protagonist of a decent anime. Hahaha. Other than that, the song is lively and catchy.ENJOYMENT: 10/10I enjoyed it. Big time. There\'s no episode where I don\'t laugh. The jokes and funny scenarios is too hooking for me. I love this type of anime so let me know if you have one. It just felt I\'m watching a commercial since it\'s really short. But yeah, comedy wise, it\'s a big yes for me.ENDING: 6/10I want more of their stupidity. I also want the pair up of other characters. So I really am hoping for a continuation of this anime. It\'s not really a cliff hanging ending, I, myself, just want more of this anime.

With the episodes being three minutes long, including the intro, I breezed through all 25 episodes in no time. I gave this anime an overall score of 7/10, and here's why.Story: 6/10Okay, so main story isn't that interesting, I'll be honest. It's just about the male character verbally abusing his girlfriend because he is apparently shy, and can't function properly when around her, but in secrecy he calls her an angel, etc. What really hooked me on the series is the other characters interactions with each other, specifically that...of the main male characters sister and his best friend. I really loved how they interacted with each other, and how their friendship developed overtime.Art: 7/10The art in this anime was absolutely adorable. It was a mix between the traditional anime style and a few chibis here and there. Overall, I feel this art style worked well with the anime.Sound: 5/10I would rate this higher, but seeing as there are only two songs throughout the whole 25 episode anime, both being openings, I don't feel that I can judge it very high. I did enjoy both of the openings to this though, the second opening being better than the first, in my opinion. Like I said, there wasn't an ending to this anime, all there was at the end was a short few musical notes, or something like that, not too sure how to explain it. I do see myself listening to both of the openings in my spare time though.Character: 6/10Some of the characters in this anime did have some growth throughout the short anime, more towards the end of the show than anything. A couple characters didn't change all that much at all though. I do like the diversity between the different characters, though in some ways, a couple characters acted similar, you were still able to distinguish who was who.Enjoyment: 8/10I surprisingly did enjoy this anime. I didn't expect myself to, seeing how verbally abusive the main male is, I honestly thought I would hate it. I went in expecting to, honestly. I know, if I thought I would hate it, why did I even give it a chance? Well, to be honest, I figured that since the episodes were so short, I would watch a couple episodes and if I truly didn't like it, then I would only have wasted 9-12 minutes of my life rather than the couple hours I would have wasted starting a regular anime that I don't like. I thought that this anime was pretty cute overall, once I got past the main character's issues.Overall: 7As you can tell, I did enjoy this anime overall. I do wish it were longer overall, I wish I could have seen more into the other characters stories than what we got. If that would have happened, I would have rated it higher, probably an 8 or 9.

I really loved how they interacted with each other, and how their friendship developed overtime.Art: 7/10The art in this anime was absolutely adorable. It was a mix between the traditional anime style and a few chibis here and there. Overall, I feel this art style worked well with the anime.Sound: 5/10I would rate this higher, but seeing as there are only two songs throughout the whole 25 episode anime, both being openings, I don't feel that I can judge it very high. I did enjoy both of the openings to this though, the second opening being better than the first, in my opinion. Like I said, there wasn't an ending to this anime, all there was at the end was a short few musical notes, or something like that, not too sure how to explain it. I do see myself listening to both of the openings in my spare time though.Character: 6/10Some of the characters in this anime did have some growth throughout the short anime, more towards the end of the show than anything. A couple characters didn't change all that much at all though. I do like the diversity between the different characters, though in some ways, a couple characters acted similar, you were still able to distinguish who was who.Enjoyment: 8/10I surprisingly did enjoy this anime. I didn't expect myself to, seeing how verbally abusive the main male is, I honestly thought I would hate it. I went in expecting to, honestly. I know, if I thought I would hate it, why did I even give it a chance? Well, to be honest, I figured that since the episodes were so short, I would watch a couple episodes and if I truly didn't like it, then I would only have wasted 9-12 minutes of my life rather than the couple hours I would have wasted starting a regular anime that I don't like. I thought that this anime was pretty cute overall, once I got past the main character's issues.Overall: 7As you can tell, I did enjoy this anime overall. I do wish it were longer overall, I wish I could have seen more into the other characters stories than what we got. If that would have happened, I would have rated it higher, probably an 8 or 9.

While Nontan is a really gentle and attentive girlfriend, Akkun is just an unnecessary sick guy that acts like a freaking stalker when he\'s far away of his girl and when he\'s close to her, he just treat her like shit and this is simply not comic.Matsuo and Chiho are the most ""normal"" couple in this series. It\'s basically the tsundere sister of Akkun (that is more sane than her brother) and an Akkun\'s friend. She acts like a tsundere and he acts like a cool guy, simple.

I don\'t think it\'s a good idea to flirt with your teacher and this is just unhealthy and really wrong. You might think ""yeah, but no one would do that"" and that\'s a point. But, if there are people that stills believe that the Earth is flat, I think nothing more would surprise me.Characters: 3/10Akkun is an unhealthy stalker and an idiot with her gf.

It's one of those anime where you can just lay back and enjoy the romance without being worried about the plot turning into something you're not in the mood for, like in some cases of good anime in the top 50, where they agonize you until you reach the happy ending you're hoping...for and then catapulting you into oblivion because of the depressing ending that's waiting to crush all your hopes.Just my opinion here as this is my first review, If you want a break from agony and just want to fall into some cliche Japanese romance filled anime and enjoy the ride, I recommend Akkun to Kanojo.I just really wish it was longer and i'm looking forward to a new season with a new approach to turn this anime into a 12 or 24 twenty minute episodes.I hope you found this helpful ! for and then catapulting you into oblivion because of the depressing ending that's waiting to crush all your hopes.Just my opinion here as this is my first review, If you want a break from agony and just want to fall into some cliche Japanese romance filled anime and enjoy the ride, I recommend Akkun to Kanojo.I just really wish it was longer and i'm looking forward to a new season with a new approach to turn this anime into a 12 or 24 twenty minute episodes.I hope you found this helpful !"", ""Here's the thing.

And no anime does it better than Akkun to Kanojo.Honestly, I see most of these reviews talking about this show as if it's trying to be something that it's not.

However, once you look at it with cool, level-headed mind and free of fanatic thoughts, it becomes downright simple: that 3 minutes of utmost quality always trumps 24 minutes of been-there-done-that entertainment. Therefore, I recommend not to dismiss Akkun to Kanojo ever-- because it truly is an anime of utmost quality.Ever curious what would it look like if Bakugo Katsuki/Squall Leonhart/Sakuraba Neku/Vegeta had gone head over heels thanks to the crazy, obsessive thing called tween love? Well, meet Kagari ""Akkun"" Atsuhiro-- on the surface he equivocates his girlfriend with a piece of worthless trash...but once the facade is gone, he is just that hopeless romantic who worships his girlfriend more than Starbucks frappe. Obviously, the hilarity ensues as both sides of Akkun keep on clashing with one another only for the amusement of the girlfriend herself, the adorable-yet-clever Katagiri ""Nontan"" Non.The great thing about Akkun to Kanojo is that as a short-form anime, the layers are never shallow. It is a satire mocking the overused tsundere trope, it is a Shoujo anime with a niche perspective, it is a rom-com with a twist, and it is a comedy that both churns our stomach and melts our hearts. The main draw is definitely the offbeat chemistry of our odd couple Akkun and Nontan and while not all supporting characters feel cohesive, at least the narrative never diverges or pulls a belly flop. The bad news, though, is that the overall art is so-so --which is typical for short-forms-- and there is nothing brag-able in terms of music and sound. Moreover, Akkun to Kanojo is admittedly never a groundbreaking fixture to begin with and one couldn\'t help but wonder how it would look if it had been drawn as a long-form anime instead. When an anime is both irresistible AND insatiable, it has transformed into that Medieval-age double-edged sword. One cannot really ga-ga over it but one cannot truly hate-watch it.Ultimately, Akkun to Kanojo is just like that very short break one would give to oneself around 3 PM. It is almost insignificant but my God, it is necessary.

Other than that, I don't have much else to say.Sound: Voice acting is as always, great. The tsun parts of both Akkun and sensei Takumi really work.

Boku no Hero Academia (ONA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/51781/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_ONA,"[""Both some nice just fun episodes to hold us over until the next season in a few months. The baseball episode had a ton of funny moments with players knocking each other out basically every at bat. As a huge baseball fan myself it's fun to see it in anime no matter what the occasion is. The heroes definitely went all out especially each team captain really putting the pressure on their team to win. Even going back to the game after stopping the villain driving that truck. But all the students from both classes that we've come to know each using their quirks for...different advantages while batting and fielding. Overall the first episode definitely lighter and just for fun with plenty of good baseball moments.The second episode a bit more serious but also funnier. With a villain that makes people laugh for hours with his quirk its bound to be a fun time too. Deku got the spotlight appealing to this laughing villains good nature. The villain wasn't really hurting anyone, not really, just vandalism paintings and making people laugh. Nothing overtly harmful or malicious. So its easy for Deku to see why someone like him with a useful quirk would turn to crime. Deku did s good job making the villain see hoe he could help people and spread his paintings without causing any more of a nuisance. It wad funny seeing tough guys like Bakugo and Endeavor cracking up without being able to stop.

It has its share of humor and keeps you engaged. The second one, however, is even better. It combines action and humor with subtlety and makes sure you remember this one for quite some time. At least I am not going to forget it because it touched my heart to some extent and felt as if it spoke to me as someone who loves art (not necessarily drawing). These two episodes just showcase the simple and sweet  side of MHA...which has made both the anime and its source manga relatable.

As an avid fan of MHA, waiting for the sixth season was too hard but this saves me time to optimize and offer a good kind of vibes from the tense fighting scenes in the original story. The overpowered baseball game was wholesome and hilarious. I also like that the animators decided to give the full screentime to the supporting characters during the baseball episode.The Mr. Smiley episode was on another level of taking laughter into power. It’s an amusing glimpse to witness that characters like Bakugo and Endeavor are laughing out loud.

We get to see the characters being silly and team up with other Heros that we haven't had the chance of seeing yet (or seen very little of their abilities).Episode 1: Contains a lot of funny moments that me laugh, the character pick for this episode was a really good choice and makes sense story-wise.  The animation is bright and colourful (as usual), it seems like a lot is happening on screen and sometimes it is a bit overwhelming but then...it'll change suddenly and it's chill.Episode 2: Similar to episode 1, this fits in with what's happening in the show but is filled with less tension.  There is some action and it was nice to watch, the fighting is always engaging since it's so different for each character.  But, again sometimes it feels a bit too much at once on screen.Overall, it's a nice change of pace from what's happening in the show as we get to see the characters being themselves and interacting with one another will always make me laugh! it'll change suddenly and it's chill.Episode 2: Similar to episode 1, this fits in with what's happening in the show but is filled with less tension.

It was a very pleasant break from the general structure of training/test arc to big fight arc then one-two lighter episodes. Personally, I get somewhat fatigued over between and within arcs, especially when the fights and training lasts up to 8+ episodes. So if you're needing a bit of a break from all the tenseness you're in the right spot. Both have enough low stakes action that it feels okay to get invested without committing to months of watching. Just one hour investment.The first episode is the classes playing baseball. Baseball is definitely not a sport...I watch, and so at first I was getting ready to hit the skip button, but I was actually able to sit and watch the episode. It was fun to see how the students would use their quirks and it gave screentime to class b and some of the less seen characters. It did take til after the rules to really be able to settle, though that's only because I personally seem to space in shows when they start explaining rules to a game, but it was short enough of an explanation.The second episode I enjoyed, it felt much more villain of the week type of show versus overarching plot that the regular show goes off of. It wrapped up very neatly. I enjoyed the villain, he wasn't this super complicated guy with all this really tragic backstory, just a guy doin what he loves. The villain kind of reminds me of what if the Joker's quirk was literally just emitting joker gas except not deadly. Either way it was fun to see the different characters laugh, definitely got a chuckle out of me, though I was not expecting Deku's laugh to be that way.... but otherwise no complaints.

In short, I just had high expectations. But the expectations were not fulfilled, and in the end I didn\'t enjoy it at all.

(The short also has a huge spoiler, so watch Code Geass before watching this.)In my personal opinion, Code Geass has some of THE BEST picture dramas out there. They're not just pointless shorts, they either go deeper into the background of things from the main show, or are just fun little things with our favorite characters, which i find very enjoyable. Oh, and can't forget the fan service in some of them! But this one, this one isn't like those. It starts off as...a random school hijacking, and turns into something that hits quite deep in my heart.The Story-The story in this short is simple, but enjoyable. Robotic people have taken over the school, and our favorite characters have to find a way to save everybody. Of course, they succeed, and defeat the Robot People. But at the end, something quite shocking, (and depressing), happens. This takes place after R2 (season 2.) And today is Lelouch's birthday. Shirley and Rolo disappear. Lelouch then starts to fade out into the air. It's quite sad actually, knowing that Lelouch is sadly gone. I give it a 7/10.Art-Not the best art, as expected of a picture drama, but not horrible. Not much more to say, other than these drawings are far better than i could ever haha. 5/10Sound-Just sounds like an average episode of Code Geass, no downgrades, no upgrades. 5/10.Character-I love the characters, I mean, they are the characters from Code Geass, which I love dearly. 7/10 (only because there is no new characters, I love the characters of Code Geass much more than just 7/10.)Enjoyment-I honestly really loved this short!

Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27727/Binan_Koukou_Chikyuu_Bouei-bu_LOVE,"[""I've noticed a trend with myanimelist. Works of anime that act as parodies of genres are often taken way too seriously and get poor overall ratings. Binan, which we will henceforth refer to as Magical Boys, suffered this treatment as well. Up until the final episode aired, this show was stuck with a 6.7 rating. Does it really deserve this little? Nope, it's actually one of the best things that aired this winter.Story: 7/10Magical Boys is very cyclical up until the very end, and I think that's why it turned a lot of people off initially. For the most part, it uses a fight-of-the-week setup,...an obvious homage to the magical girl genre, but just like in those shows, this can lead to a predictable, repetitive show. However, each enemy is unique and the last episode throws a spectacular plot twist, so if you can put up with this style you'll be in for a good time.Art: 8/10Very colorful overall, the art in this show is consistent and bubbly. It's very pleasant, and all of the characters are pretty much color-coded so you'll never get confused.Sound: 7/10I like the opening, it's very peppy and catchy. The same can't be said for the in-show music, which was mostly forgettable, and some tracks just keep getting used over and over, another homage to the magical girl genre that comes out as a pain instead of nostalgia.Character: 9/10When first introduced, the main characters are as one-dimensional as can be. Red magical boy loves snuggling, blue magical boy is lazy, pink magical boy is all about girls, yellow magical boy loves money, and green magical boy has no traits whatsoever that I remember. Some characters are introduced and immediately established as the villains. So why did I give this a 9/10? All of the characters are vividly memorable, and bonds between them develop or are revealed throughout the series. All of the side characters shine as well. My personal favorites are Goura, red magical boy's older brother who runs the hot springs, and Mr. Tawarayama, the magical boy's teacher who is probably dead. All of these characters are designed to have one strong trait, and the show plays to this very well, and there wasn't a single character I didn't like by the end (except for the photography club, those jerks)Enjoyment: 8/10Like its magical girl predecessors, Magical Boys has some predictable fight scenes. Those aren't why I stuck around though. A good portion of each episode is banter between the characters, and it's often pretty funny or just bizarre, and often segues into the villain's motive. Speaking of villains, they're diverse and just as strange as the conversations.Overall: 8/10Magical Boys is a much better experience then many people expected it to be. You may come for the mahou shojo parody, but you'll stick around for the general wittiness, self-aware humor, and overall comfy atmosphere that emerges from watching this show. an obvious homage to the magical girl genre, but just like in those shows, this can lead to a predictable, repetitive show.

Love! (Handsome High Earth Defense Club! Love!)I first saw this anime as a recommendation to another anime that I\'ve recently watched, and I was aghast upon seeing bishounens wearing frilly clothes and magic wands. Then my heart skipped a beat. Could it be? Yes! It is! Finally, a Mahou (Bi)Shounen anime! I quickly went to Youtube and searched for their transformations, and for the next few minutes, I found myself laughing and shaking my head at the ridiculous scene that followed.At first, I was...quite reluctant to watch it since it might feel awkward watching pretty boys undressing and magically transforming into magical warriors, but hey, I gave episode 1 a try, and from there, I knew it was sold.I honestly felt it was too ridiculous and outrageous to be true, but it is! And that\'s the name of the game for this anime, outrageous! Being an affectionate parody of the mahou shojou genre, it doesn\'t take itself seriously, often breaking the fourth wall and (surprisingly) the characters themselves blurt out what the watchers are thinking.And it\'s a comedy anime directed by the same person who directed Nichibros and Gintama too!STORY: 7The premise is really simple. Like the synopsis says, it\'s about the tale of five high school boys who transform into magical warriors known as Battle Lovers to fight off monsters. It takes on an episodic pattern with a different monster per week to defeat. But what pushed me to give it a 7 is the way it slowly presents small details every week (along with the usual monster-of-the-week-routine) that all culminates to the story\'s climax. It\'s like dangling something so obvious in front of you that you disregard it because it\'s too outrageous, and by the time you reach the end, you\'d go ""Wooooaaah!"".ART: 8Nothing much to say here. The colors were lively and refreshing, not too painful to the eyes. It gives you a relaxed yet vibrant feel. The background is simple yet well-drawn. And of course, all the characters are very pretty (it\'s called Handsome High for a reason), even the side characters have unique designs.SOUND: 8Nothing special, but I gave it an 8 because the seiyuus did a good job with their characters, giving them a unique touch. Of course, not to mention the catchy and upbeat OP, the emotional ED, and the epic background music in climax scenes. And then there\'s the bubbly music when our heroes are transforming.CHARACTER: 10The show\'s biggest strength. Each character is unique in their own way. They\'re conveniently color-coded for easy remembering, but what makes them unique are their quirks. Quirks taken up to eleven. Like seriously twisted quirks. Of course, another aspect is that the characters themselves comment on the absurdity of the things happening around them, that they tend to read the viewers\' mind and break the fourth wall, making them lovable and enjoyable to watch. At first, they seemed one dimensional but as the show progresses, they prove to be more than just a one-sided character, they have back stories of their own (specially Atsushi and Kinshiro). And one thing I liked about this is that ALL the characters had something to do with the plot, and that each character is equally important.ENJOYMENT: 10I really enjoyed this ride called Binan Kokou Chikyuu Bouei-bu! Love! From the outrageous and hilarious humor, to the self-conscious characters, to the heartstring-tugging scenes. There\'s no deep plot behind the silly facade, and that\'s what makes it good. It\'s so outrageous and (as I\'ve said before) it doesn\'t take itself seriously, making it a light-hearted and memorable show.I\'ve still got a lot of things to say about this anime, and those feelings can\'t be written in words. I really enjoyed the twelve episodes of pure hilarity, and would jump in joy and shed tears of happiness if they gave this show a season 2. It\'s really one of the underrated Winter Anime of 2015 (of course it\'s overshadowed by the other anime of the season) and I can truly say it\'s one of those hidden gems.Love Forever! Love out!PS: If you don\'t mind watching bishies bathing together and being all close and friendship and stuff, and is looking for a good laugh, then this show is for you. If you think you can\'t handle the show\'s self-conscious shipping (yeah, the characters at one point ship themselves), then stay clear. quite reluctant to watch it since it might feel awkward watching pretty boys undressing and magically transforming into magical warriors, but hey, I gave episode 1 a try, and from there, I knew it was sold.I honestly felt it was too ridiculous and outrageous to be true, but it is! And that\'s the name of the game for this anime, outrageous! Being an affectionate parody of the mahou shojou genre, it doesn\'t take itself seriously, often breaking the fourth wall and (surprisingly) the characters themselves blurt out what the watchers are thinking.And it\'s a comedy anime directed by the same person who directed Nichibros and Gintama too!STORY: 7The premise is really simple.

The elements it mocks are obvious and the characters actually acknowledge it - unlikely heroes flashily transforming into their ridiculous costumes with out-of-this-world powers battling monsters-of-the-week while upholding their valiant virtues of love and friendship. As a quirky deconstruction of the style, the series manages to pull it off with as few hitches as possible.Even the construction of the episodes is a parody. It is all in the episodic nature of the monster-of-the-week ploy, leaving a few hints of the over-all plot until unveiling it, albeit slowly, in last few episodes,...and, of course, the all-too-grand climatic final episode. It\'s not worth enjoying if it is taken too seriously. After all, Boueibu is just a bunch of boys randomly given powers of love to save the Earth from hatred.The design and animation could have been more flashy - as flashy as Sailor Moon and Free! combined. At the very least, it could be described as fitting to Boueibu\'s identity as a parody of a genre. The surprise, however, is the music. I expected something decent at best but I was amazed at the remarkable effort given to the sound.Boueibu is what one would call a ""basic"" anime. While it is ""basic"", it nevertheless captures our attention with the charm of its characters and the wit of the script. The combination of the two elements is refreshing despite being only a cover-up for the series\' identity as a parody with nothing else to work on save for the fact that it has magical boys instead of magical girls. It unexpectedly leaves you rolling on the floor or facepalming while laughing at its ludicrousness.There is an irony in Boueibu in that one would have to take it seriously in order to realize that it\'s not to be taken seriously. It serves as an example to the anime audience to remind them of how one can still enjoy a series without taking it too seriously. It doesn\'t need you to think about ulterior motives or predict courses of action. Boueibu only requires one to pay attention.It doesn\'t stand out too much but at least it does. Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE! is a half lighthearted and half gut-busting comedy and I easily recommend it to anyone who seeks such. and, of course, the all-too-grand climatic final episode.

Spoilers ahead!)Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE!, contrary to its name, showcases a lot of hate, or at the minimum, dislike. Be it those around you or a pair of chopsticks, the show demonstrates that people often have those aspects of life that somehow seem to rub us the wrong way. Personally speaking, I’m not too fond of the Beatles’ music. Their style just doesn’t do anything for me. But where negative emotions are found, there is always positive thinking just around the corner. That is, if nothing else, the show provides us with the message that “all...you need is love.”STORYEarth Defense Club follows five high school guys – Yumoto Hakone, Atsushi Kinugawa, Io Naruko, En Yufuin, and Ryuu Zaou – who are one day visited by an alien life-form known as Wombat. Upon his arrival, the men are forced to become the “Battle Lovers,” using their newfound powers to bring warmth and happiness to their fellow students turned monsters.“Magical girl” anime are a staple of the medium, and are really only possible under its format. Thus, Earth Defense Club capitalizes on this very idea. En, Yumoto, and the rest are themselves “magical girls,” but it becomes pretty apparent that the show isn’t truly about this subset of anime. Instead, it’s the parody that it generates that gives it its distinct edge. The shiny transformations are plenty, the corny one-liners are in full-force, and the enemy happens to be winning until the group (eventually) unleashes their super, “all together now” move to save the day. It knows exactly what it wants to do at all points throughout the series, because it targets so many different facets of what it is poking fun at. Delving into so many areas that make up this genre, though, leads to an inherent problem: distinguishing the intentional parody from what it is legitimately trying to do. Because calling everything that the anime does “as part of the parody” makes it seem like it can do whatever it wants without ever being in the wrong.For example, the show is quite repetitive in its presentation, with a new monster to defeat per episode. The lead up to the victory might be slightly different – a small argument between friends disjoints the group, the enemy is defeated literally seconds after arriving instead of prolonging the fight, etc. – but witnessing the same conclusions day-in and day-out don’t reinforce the message of love it’s trying to get across. Instead, it only hurts it by revealing its inability to explore all sides to the subject it is tackling. On the other hand, the anime’s “plot twist” at the end coincides with its original goals of being not just light-hearted but carefree in terms of coherency. By being so ludicrous in its narrative, it allows the audience to understand that the show still understands where it initially came from. The aforementioned repetition is a bit more rampant than the unique scenarios like the conclusion, so the overall effectiveness at being a parody isn’t as strong as it could have potentially been.Still, not all of the repetition works against itself. More specifically, there are two venues in which it leans in its favor: the casual conversations and the bathhouse. The former is strange due to how normal it comes off as being. The club members often have “Seinfeld” discussions, or talks involving the most basic of concepts. They might make a comment about the food they like to eat, the interests they have, or about what it means to be mature. While the dichotomy between the down-to-earth talks and the silly, “magical girl” moments contrasts nicely, it’s the connection between the two that’s the most important. For the “Battle Lovers” might seem to have random conversations when in fact what they say between each other directly leads into the problems at hand. Meaning their everyday words are not just relatable but contextually relevant, too.The second venue gets a bit more esoteric, but it is alluded to. Looking at the show as a whole, nearly every set of events includes a bathing scene at the bathhouse. Why? Is it just to show the men naked as much as they can? Or is there a deeper meaning? It turns out its both. Of course, it’s supposed to be a bit of fan-service. But there is an important detail about the bathhouse; it’s Yumoto’s and his brother’s. Considering his position as the masthead of the group (and his brother’s former status as the greatest “Battle Lover”), the bathhouse is a metaphor of love. Baths are warm, quite relaxing, and bring about a sense of comfort. Love is the same way; when it’s received, when one bathes in it, it induces heightened elation as a result of these very same feelings. The final move is even entitled “Love Shower,” implying the gentle and water-like substance that love tends to be. Thus, the guys who daily cleansed themselves in the baths they adore so much weren’t just destined to become champions of love; they were surrounded by it for longer than they ever knew.ANIMATIONEarth Defense Club doesn’t boast the best of art styles. It’s rather boring to look at, with the same drab club rooms, the overused school locations, and the bathhouse that has nothing but the previously mentioned love-water. In other words, the repetitiveness does not help the anime whatsoever in this circumstance.The character designs are fine for what they are, and may even be a parody on their own. Each of the main characters is only distinguished by their color of hair and for their signature color – En is blue, Atsushi is green, Ryuu is pink, etc. – while in “Battle Lovers” mode. The same can be said for the student council members; each is refined and effeminate when compared to everyone else. The monsters that appear are quirky but such designs work well with the comedy of the show. For instance, the super-handsome, ballerina man becomes a “Black Swan” whereas the creepy, grade-loving nerd becomes a screw due to the ones he apparently has loose in his head. Like the conversations, each isn’t chosen out of thin air; their designs are based on the issues they are facing before they become these evil creatures, proving that there was a nice amount of attention placed here outside of just a variance in color.Actual animation is somewhere slightly below average. Much of the show has the group of guys talking among one another at length. Meaning, lots of sitting without much movement is had. Even when they are taking part in their fights, the variance in abilities is so minimal that the show chooses to reuse the very same scenes as much as it can, highlighting its inability to animate what needs animating.CHARACTERSMuch of the cast of Earth Defense Club has nothing else about them besides the personality shtick they each hold. Ryuu loves girls, Io loves money, Yumoto loves to cuddle, En loves to do nothing, and Atsushi loves to be friends with others. Even the student council members have their own loves. The word love is being used frequently here on purpose; it’s the whole point of the anime to make it abundantly clear that there is not only someone willing to give love but also something to love as well. As the introduction stated, there exists parts of the world around us that we don’t particularly like all that much, even if it happens to be irrational. And the students who become the monsters throughout the series have their hatred manifested, but it’s always trumped by the love the club (albeit forcefully) brings to these despondent individuals. In other words, love isn’t an emotion that is lost once less-than-happy feelings are acquired. It’s always around us; it just takes a bit of understanding – and perhaps a joint magical effort – to make said love come true.As for individual character exploration, the anime fails to do this properly. And quite often when it is attempting to have the cast be more than their singular trait it comes off as poorly handled. A situation like En and Atsushi feuding lets us witness the “power of friendship “ – which is itself another parody – is fun, but doesn’t do much for the characters outside of having them realize what they knew all along. And it’s this constant return to the status quo that makes it impossible for the characters to see any sort of important growth. Reiterating at this point, but the repetition that is always used once again prevents the show from giving the guys any sort of meaningful focus since it always ends up the exact same way: small talk in the beginning, fight monster to save them, and end up taking a bath together.Arguably, though, there is a character that does see a change in his person that does follow along with the parody elements of the anime. Kinshirou Kusatsu, the student council president, joins the forces of evil to gain the title of “Chevalier White.” His motivations are left clouded for nearly the entire time outside of hating that which is foolish, wanting to eradicate anything that, to him, is a blemish on this planet. While his behavior is quite arrogant, there are hints of something kinder: the ending theme and specific parts of the show reference a previous relationship between him and Atsushi. Everything eventually comes to light; Kinshirou believed to have lost his friendship with Atsushi thanks to some curry, holding a years-long grudge against his previous best friend. It’s absolutely silly that their division was caused by a simple meal. This not only reinforces the notion that we as people have some rather strange dislikes but also fits snuggly within the confines of the anime’s already ridiculous premise and direction. Once this massive misunderstanding is cleared up, the show continues down its parody path: the two groups come together to save the Earth from destruction. In the end, everyone lives “happily ever after,” with no amount of curry being able to change this.SOUNDThe opening theme is actually surprisingly catchy after listening to it quite a few times. The clapping and group-singing work with the orchestral instruments to give a track that is pretty generic but oddly fun to listen to. While it doesn’t cause one to “fall in love” with the piece itself, it’s at least not as lame as much of what the anime normally offers. The ending theme is split; the latter half is pretty interesting due to the increased emotion put behind it but the first half is somewhat slow and boring. But that’s sort of the point: it’s in essence, and as was discussed slightly earlier, a “love song” from Kinshirou to his former friend Atsushi. Sadly for the track, though, nobody is going to be missing it any time soon.The soundtrack is rather forgettable, being used mostly for simple background music as opposed to setting any sort of mood or being worthy of a replay. The tracks themselves are usually calm and dainty during downtime and magical sounding when the guys embark on their escapades. But nothing in particular is significant and the music isn’t lovely to hear, making it a less-than-stellar OST overall.As far as voice-acting is concerned, the performances were average at best. A special shout-out is deserved for Kazutomi Yamamoto as Yumoto for his somewhat feminine voice for the peppy, happy-go-lucky, and always energetic kid.ENJOYMENTWhen first getting into this one, I knew it would be strange. I can’t say I’m a huge fan of the “magical girl” genre, but the show did its best at making it funny and comedic. The novelty though quickly wore off the further along it went, with the “same” enemies being dealt with and having to sit through Yumoto’s grating personality. Many of the jokes rarely brought about laughter because everything else around it was just not good.However, there was one, recurring joke that usually managed to make me smile. And that was Mr. Tawarayama. When the show often forgot or remembered him, combined with his sickly status, it made for some pretty entertaining scenes. Better still were the tongue-in-cheek reminders of his condition when the show would pan over the clubroom with their teacher slumped over in the corner not doing much of anything because he was quite literally dead. The final joke was even based on the teacher, giving the anime as funny of a send-off as it could hope to attain.Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! is a pretty intriguing parody that is unfortunately dragged down by everything else around it. The characters are weak, the art is lackluster, and the music is not worth mentioning. Despite all of the love the Earth Defense Club provides, this one does not get, or deserve, love of its own.SUMMARYStory: Good, nice parody on “magical girls” that utilizes some of its repetition to its advantageAnimation: Bad, boring art style, purposeful monster designs, below average actual animationCharacters: Bad, one-dimensional characters that exemplify love, little growth due to repetition, but Kinshirou at least follows the themes and parody elementsSound: Bad, okay OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, the novelty wears off quickly with only Mr. Tawarayama providing the laughsFinal Score: 3/10 you need is love.”STORYEarth Defense Club follows five high school guys – Yumoto Hakone, Atsushi Kinugawa, Io Naruko, En Yufuin, and Ryuu Zaou – who are one day visited by an alien life-form known as Wombat.

Despite all of the love the Earth Defense Club provides, this one does not get, or deserve, love of its own.SUMMARYStory: Good, nice parody on “magical girls” that utilizes some of its repetition to its advantageAnimation: Bad, boring art style, purposeful monster designs, below average actual animationCharacters: Bad, one-dimensional characters that exemplify love, little growth due to repetition, but Kinshirou at least follows the themes and parody elementsSound: Bad, okay OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, the novelty wears off quickly with only Mr. Tawarayama providing the laughsFinal Score: 3/10', 'Are you sick of the magical girls formula?Have you asked the obvious questions like ""Why doesn\'t anyone recognize them?"" while watching Sailor moon?If you have then THIS is the best possible anime you could watch!(Something went wrong when I posted this and it cut off midway, this is the edited and completed version ^^)Story:5 fairly bored guys go to Binan high school and have club together called the ""Earth defense club ""lol"""" where they do practically nothing. One day when two of the guys are taking a bath at a local bath house they regularly visit, when a pink fluffy animal that looks like...a wombat drops down and ask them to help him protect the earth against monsters!Together with the other guys in the club they become ""Battle lovers"" heirs to the throne of love! With frilly outfits and everything!Yes! Everything you just read is just as silly as it sounds, and that\'s what makes it great! It rips off a typical magical girls scenario and uses it to ask all the questions you\'ve always wanted answers for, while making fun of it to the extremes! Not only that but it makes fun of typical bishounen show fanbases, and since I belong to many I laughed and shipped to my hearts content! As many magical girls shows it\'s mostly fillers with a lot of fan service, but it doesn\'t feel like filler since they focus a lot on the relationships between the boys in multiple forms!The final episode has the most unexpected plot twist since Mirai Nikki or even Death note if I may say so by the way.Characters:The main 5 are Yumoto, En, Atsushi, Io and Ryuu. They are accompanied by their trustworthy(That was sarcasm) side-kick wombat, whom you\'ll get to know incredibly little about. The 5 MCs are all pretty basic and stereotypical, but they are on purpose. What really makes them is the relationships between them and the whole parody thing. They are sorta paired up in Ryuu & Io, Atsushi & En, and Yumoto & Wombat, the first 2 pairs are best friends with each other. Putting the fact that I ship them both very hard they work off each other so very well! They aren\'t your everyday best friends who are perfect, no they bicker, and disagree with trust for the other just like normal best friends. This makes them all the more amusing and comfortable to watch as they learn more about each other.We also have three villains who I won\'t go into any detail on since that might spoil some small details that I think everyone should experience first-hand on their own. I will say this tough: They are voiced by Kamiya, Fukuyama and Terashima, in other words: It\'s pure perfection.Art & Sound:If you are looking for something that is very fresh and unique in it\'s style and animation then look elsewhere. This show doesn\'t have all that good animation, and the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out at all. HOWEVER! Focusing on good animation and a fantastic and memorable soundtrack would have done nothing in this show\'s favor. The simple style and bright colors is just what this show needs for the comedy to shine, and I am so very happy that they went in that direction. It looks fantastic in the transformation sequences, and that\'s all I could ask for. I really can\'t remember anything from the soundtrack. That said you will have the opening theme in your head for at least a week! The op and ed songs get a lot of focus and are perfect for the show. That alone is more than enough for me.Overall:If you are bored, If you love shipping, If you are looking for a plate of brilliance, If you are looking for a good laugh, If you watched Sailor moon and Pretty cure when you were little, If you watched them just recently, THIS is the show for you!This show takes the parody in the world of anime to another level of spot on and funny!The writers of this show have obviously been the ones asking the questions while watching magical girls anime. They wrote this to give us their speculations on how the kingdom of girls fighting in mini skirts is ruled.This has a lot of fan service and hints at ships which makes the fujoshis jump with joy, but anyone can watch this show, shipper or not and find it absolutely hilarious!Judging this show for what it is and is trying to be I give it a strong 9.3/10!I would recommend this for ANYONE.Thanks for reading, and I will now go watch the last Nanatsu and then try to get this assignment done!

However, if you think that you have already watch a lot of this things that you think Binan Koukou will only bore you out, chances are, you are very wrong.Story:The story has the normal plot that every Mahou Shoujo has, except that the ""Magical Girls"" that are acting it are actually boys. Every episode has the \'Typical life of the characters and introduction of enemy (+Fanservice)-Transformation-Battle-Conclusion\' pattern, however this anime succeeds in letting the viewers be hooked until the end by well-thought-out enemies,...series of successfully funny conversations and one-liners, and a bit of drama and lessons about friendship, love and youth here and there. The story pattern is not original but the story is creatively done. I think is one of the parodies that are well-made.Art:The art is very fitting for its genre. The character design is very well-made; the characters, even the enemies before their transformation, are very distinctive of one another and are very easy to remember. The colors are vibrant and catchy. The background is also well-drawn. The costumes are also laudable -- they are cute yet not too frilly for the manly main characters. The ED MV is also a special mention.Sound:One of things I like the most in Binan Koukou is the soundtrack. The OP is very catchy, upbeat, and fitting. The ED is contemplative and very beautiful. Though the OP is not something an average person (especially a man) would add in his playlist, the ED is a different matter. In the context of the anime one may deem the ED as cheesy and even funny as it is about the friendship of one of the protagonist and one of the antagonist who are both males, but if you only listen to it as it is, it is actually a relatable story, for who among of us haven\'t been separated from a precious friend at some point in our lives, right? I suggest everyone to search for the lyrics if they haven\'t yet; it is very well-written.While the songs are by themselves beautiful already, they also attract viewers because the singers are the voice actors of the main characters.The background music, especially of the transformation and fighting scenes, are wonderful too.Character:Being a sharp-tongued and critical individual, I tend to have a person (or persons) I hate in every anime, whether because they are acting illogically, their values are totally fucked up, they are inconsistent, they do unnecessary and shitty things, they are just there for fanservice, or they are merely valued due to their existence (Some Special Mentions: Inori from GC and Menma from AnoHana. Oh, how I hate those women. Really sorry, fans of those girls.). However, in Binan Koukou, I tend not to hate everyone and love everyone. I don\'t even have a favorite character, though it doesn\'t mean that they all look flat to me. It\'s just that, I find them all adorable. Though they have powers, they are still shown to be humans like us. The characters are relatable while being unique, realistic while being surprising. The enemies are a whole lot relatable too, as their transformations as enemies of Battle Lovers are caused by their frustrations in life, which are same frustrations we normal people have, and just as what the message of this anime is, such things can only be cured by love.Enjoyment:This is very enjoyable. Take it from a person who is bored and can\'t focus all the time. You know what, I usually don\'t watch things twice. I find it ridiculous because I think it is a waste of time. Well damn, I can\'t help but pick a random episode and watch it over and over again. It is a shame, but I\'ve actually memorized their lines (and even their positions) when they transform into Battle Lovers.In Japanese and in English.Seriously, what the fuck am I doing.Recommended for: Open-minded people who want to have a good laughNot recommended for: People who are hardcore bashers of fanservice and parodies, and who only patronize anime with ""meaning"" and ""sense "" which they can ""analyze"", such as Code Geass, Shingeki no Kyojin, and the like.

I had seen many magical Girl animes, from Madoka Magica to Tokyo Mew Mew, so I was excited to see what they would bring with a magical boys twist.I was extremely disappointed.The story is a the same as any magical girl anime, they just change it to that they're boys and everyone freaks out saying it's revolutionary, which ticks me off a little as the writing is a side walk from Sailor Moon.The characters were bland and mediocre and sure they would have their odd moment here and...there, they never strayed too far away from their cardboard cut out counterparts.The most I saw from this anime was yaoi innuendoes and that wasn't enough to keep me invested.The art was nice. It was clear and bright, but nothing that no Magical anime had done before. Still, it brought some lacking charm to each episode.Overall, this anime was brought down from the first episode and it made me cringe more than once, or make me want to rip my hair out.Is it nothing more than a magical girl anime with boys, and if that's enough to get your motor going, go for it. But for the rest of you who actually want to watch something good, just watch Madoka Magica. there, they never strayed too far away from their cardboard cut out counterparts.The most I saw from this anime was yaoi innuendoes and that wasn't enough to keep me invested.The art was nice.

There are anime with great twists, anime with contrived plots, and there is Binan. There are anime with well developed characters, boring one dimensional characters, and there is Binan.Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! (Or Binan, if you haven\'t gotten that already) is an amazing anime. I don\'t mean amazing as in \'good\', I mean amazing as in that you will be amazed. However this anime was possibly spawned, whatever stars aligned to get us here today, I am very VERY happy that I watched this. This is certainly a polarizing anime, everyone I\'ve...talked to have either hated it or loved it, but why? What is so special about Binan? Let me break it down:~STORY~So, you\'ve seen magical girl shows right? Sailor moon, Tokyo Mew Mew, that sort of thing? Well, what if the those magical girls were instead boys? And what if those boys were completely self aware? And... hear me out, what if the great threat was a small green hedgehog in the student council president\'s pocket?I honestly don\'t know what to say about the story of Binan, it\'s just like any other normal magical girl show; it\'s episodic with a new minor bad guy each episode that the boys have to stop, using love. Except the bad guys that they stop are so ridiculous! Actually, everything is ridiculous! I don\'t count anything shown in the first episode as spoilers so here: The first enemy is a giant chikawabu. Yup.This is a magical girl parody taken to the extreme - every trope from the transformation scenes that strip the transformer naked, stopping things with the power of love, attack names, catch phrases yelled at the bad guy, etc, etc, etc. They\'re all here, but they\'re all played for laughs. While Sailor moon had a talking space cat, Binan has a talking pink space wombat that gives the characters their powers. Give an inspiring speech to a villain to have them turn back to normal? Binan\'s got you covered... though the speech may not make any sense to anyone with common sense!But somehow, SOMEHOW, it walks the fine line of parody and keeps it funny. That is to say, for me at least. To others, they think that it falls on the wrong side of parody, where it becomes indistinguishable from what it is parodying. It all depends on the mindset you watch Binan with. Every episode I was watching, looking out for the tongue-in-cheek comedy, the sly nods and the double entendres (of which there are many). I mean, the flashing, thrilling, sparkling and roaring prince? Tranformation sequences that are set off with a shout of ""Love Making!""? Love it.But all I\'ve been talking about is the ""writing"", not really the story. Truth be told, there isn\'t really much of one - nothing more than the usual \'stop the great evil, one episode at a time\' that most other magical girl shows have. THAT IS UNTIL THE LAST TWO EPISODES. And oh my goodness yes. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. I won\'t say anything more other than that I LOVE the last two episodes. Watch Binan just for those if nothing else.~ART~The art is kind of average, with wavering quality throughout the show. From what I\'ve seen, I don\'t think the show got much of a budget to work with, so I can excuse the wavering visual quality. That being said, it never is \'bad\', just nothing too special.~SOUND~In a similar vein to the art, the sound is also pretty average. Though I do like the transformation sequence music~~CHARACTERS~For me, Binan did something that doesn\'t often happen: It made pretty basic characters, and made them lovable as all hell! Thinking about how I\'m supposed to describe how they did it is actually quite difficult. I mean, each character clearly has their own \'thing\'. Whether it be money, women, friendship, freedom or... cuddles? But they all just emit their own sincere energy that you can\'t help but like them. Despite being pretty one dimensional, they all have they\'re moments of odd realism - like their reactions to being turned into magical boys - and the effect is quite endearing. The villains are also entertaining in their own right - each clearly having a theme (even if that theme is not having one) that they stick too, and their \'evilness\' seems almost so quaint.On the most basic level, these characters are parody characters, with 12 episodes to shine. They aren\'t supposed to be fleshed out, deep or meaningful. They\'re supposed to be there to make the funnies, and for me they certainly did!~ENJOYMENT~I enjoyed Binan, a whole lot. Every episode had me laughing, and the final two had me choking with laughter. Most of all, I enjoyed watching it WITH people - while I did enjoy watching it by myself, watching it with others and laughing with them made the show all the funnier.It is certainly true that the series hits a lot of things that I specifically find funny, so it catered to a lot of my own distinct comedy wants and needs - so if you don\'t enjoy the first episode, you certainly won\'t enjoy the rest of it. But after now watching the first episode 4 times with different people, and laughing each time, I can certainly say for sure that I enjoyed this series. Cheers to you Binan~~OVERALL~Comedy is subjective. That is the fact that will determine whether you enjoy Binan or not. Despite average sound and visuals, and a pretty basic story, I did find it very funny and so I gave it an 8/10 - its humour overcoming its flaws. If you don\'t like Binan\'s humour, I can certainly see it being scored below 5, since all the things I liked about the story and characters will instantly become worthless.Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! was an ambitious series, coming out of nowhere, and I really hope that it finds some measure of success. It\'s weird and wonderful, and hit all my funny buttons. So yes, good work Binan, and remember to LOVE MAKING!Toodles~ talked to have either hated it or loved it, but why?

So yes, good work Binan, and remember to LOVE MAKING!Toodles~', ""I mostly started watching this show as it looked cute with the nice magical boys and I need something fun amongst some of the more serious shows I was watching that season.The show was mostly great fun and almost 'parodied' the whole magical girl genre throughout due to fourth-wall breaking statements and running gags in the show. While it isn't a show with a great story, it is really good if you need something cute, fun and wackyStory: 5I gave it this as there isn't really much of a story. The story was mostly every week the 'battle lovers' would face a wacky villain which...they would have to defeat, and the battle would usually carry some sort of moral. The last few episodes did a fine job of pulling everything together with a few unexpected twists, but this show isn't really one to watch if you want a deep and powerful storyline.Art: 9The art is really cute and easy on the eyes. The transformations are nice,  the character designs are all appealing and it is just a generally great art-style. The weekly monsters all have hillarious and wacky designs and the animation is mostly nice as well. While it may not be uber detailed or anything, it is attractive and appealing.Sound: 7The sound never really stood out to me, it was good overall though. The soundtrack was nice and fitted the show nicely and the voice acting all mostly fitted the characters and there was nothing notably bad about it while it was not outstanding at the same time.Character: 8The characters in the show were all wacky and unique. While the characters weren't particularly deep in whole, the main cast all had their nice little quirks (Ryuu and girls, Io and money, Yumoto and cuddling the wombat and En and being lazy) and it was a nice touch to the show. The minor characters all had nice little quirks, which was often the reasons they were turned into 'monsters' and all in all it helped add to the enjoyment of the showEnjoyment: 10This is the area where this show REALLY stands out. The show is hillarious from start to finish and will make you smile and laugh. Everything from the breaking of the fourth wall, to the parody nature, to the homoerotic moments to the running gags like the fact the pink wombat companion murdered their teacher all make the show one which is really enjoyable. While it may be light on plot, boueibu will be a show which will have you smiling from start to finish. they would have to defeat, and the battle would usually carry some sort of moral.

The minor characters all had nice little quirks, which was often the reasons they were turned into 'monsters' and all in all it helped add to the enjoyment of the showEnjoyment: 10This is the area where this show REALLY stands out. The show is hillarious from start to finish and will make you smile and laugh. Everything from the breaking of the fourth wall, to the parody nature, to the homoerotic moments to the running gags like the fact the pink wombat companion murdered their teacher all make the show one which is really enjoyable. While it may be light on plot, boueibu will be a show which will have you smiling from start to finish."", '""Why did Gora-san... He was standing there quietly all this time.

Everyone talks about how the male point of view is dominant in media. Earth Defense Club provides plenty of fanservice for females. It’s a gloriously feminine anime, all hearts and hot boys. It also has a wink-wink satirical element, which often goes against it.The attempt at being gloriously feminine is fantastic. It’s not even moe. The character design is useful to note the difference between male power fantasies, and females’ fantasies about guys. Ultra-mascular guys aren’t fanservice for females, but for males. The strength and endurance...they show isn’t automatically sexually attractive, but something males wish for themselves.The design of the guys here isn’t macho. It’s pretty in a distinct females’-fantasy way. There is elegance and softness to their looks. It is not genderbending. The looks simply have sex appeal and confidence to them, but also a naturalness. A developed body like in JoJo clearly shows the person worked on it. An effortless body like of these characters points to superior genes. These looks are also friendly, which is necessary for sex appeal. For a change, the male design is meant to appeal to females.It’s also good when you don’t consider this factor. The purpose of character design is to express the characters’ traits, and they’re all designed according to their personality. Yumoto’s carelessness and love for cuteness is in his wide-eyes and childish hair. Yufuin has the indifferent eyes of a lazy person. Since everyone is meant to be sexually attractive, there’s no variety in body structure. However, even a small difference in the eyes – order-obsessed Kin’s narrow ones, beauty lover Akoya’s feminine ones – tell us enough.Once you go past the visuals, it becomes unstable. Is it a satire of magical girl? Or does it take the female catering of the genre to its extreme? It cannot decide between the two. It cannot decide whether it wants to reveal the absurdities, or have fun with the cliches.Both elements fight, and often negate each other. The enemies are too silly to take seriously, but they’re never wild enough. They’re wild enough to be considered ‘satirical’, but it’s mostly tokenism. The transformation scenes are fantastic and well-done. After they end the characters have to get self-aware about their customes.It’s confusing. Am I supposed to enjoy the hot-boy-and-love world, or to mock it? This balance between satire and tribute is nearly impossible. There is a way to accomplish it, but that means not being satirical. You take the genre’s cliches and push them to the limit in order to see how much Coolness Factor you can gain. This approach must never become self-aware. The appeal of it is that the creators don’t care about how ridiculous they get.Earth Defense Club cares too much about how cool it is. Its detachment also harms the character development. At their core, they’re great. After a few episodes, you notice that half of them don’t offer much beyond their hobbies. Some are well-written, with interests that match their personality. Yumoto, Yufuin and Ryuu don’t just name-drop their obsession. They have their own unique reactions to every situation (Yufuin’s indifference, Ryuu’s aggression). Naruko, for the most part, doesn’t do anything but reminds the viewers he’s into money.The enemies often have an inner conflict, a motivation that makes them evil. This is the basic and brilliant approach to creating antagonists. The show never builds on it though. Besides ranting for a while, they don’t do much. Their monologues aren’t funny or have any insight into why they became monsters. At first, it’s exciting how every villain of the week has clear motivations. It doesn’t manner when they end up functioning in the same manner – rant for a while and then get Love Attacked.The last episode contains a cool twists. The creators use it like a person who just won a million dollars buying 1000 bottls of craft beers. Craft beers are awesome, but if you won a million dollars there are better ways to spend it. The twist is cool, and made the wink-wink satire makes sense. However, they literally do nothing with it. It’s revealed there was something bigger than conquering the earth, power up and defeat the big bad.The mere existence of the show is enough to make it worthwhile. Not everyday you see an anime about hot magical boys. It had a chance to do something new, to show a gloriously feminine show and be as fun as JoJo. Sadly, in the end it’s still insecure about hearts and pink and love and hot boys. The novelty value is enough to carry it for 12 episodes but I can’t imagine this working as a second season.2.5 hot boys out of 5 they show isn’t automatically sexually attractive, but something males wish for themselves.The design of the guys here isn’t macho.

Still Binan turned out to be very different from what I was initially expecting, which is a good thing.Story: In the beginning it uses a ""every week a new enemy/mission"" style. Later there is more story development and it actually does get a little bit deeper. Also it uses parody elements, which you can already see in episode 1 (if you just want to try watching it)Art: The art is...well...normal, I guess? It is nothing special but also not bad. The colours are...simple and nice, while the backgrounds and everything is okay too, so really it is average...Sound: It may just be my personal opinion but I really loved the soundtrack of Binan. Sometimes an OP or and ED is really good but it doesn\'t match the anime, well here you won\'t have that problem. I think the OP is just perfect for the anime and sounds good too!Characters: Maybe it was the parody-style of the whole thing...maybe the comedy style, but the characters are very likable (imo). If you like one of them I\'m pretty sure you will like all of them, maybe some more than others, but overall very nice, although some of them only develop a background later on in the anime.Enjoyment: Well, here they just have to get a full 10 points because if you start watching Binan and you like it, than you will definitely enjoy yourself until the very end!Overall: It is a very nice anime with colourful backgrounds, characters and music and shows you a refreshing and new perspective of the ""magical someone"" genre, which I think was just...delightful :D So I recommend watching the first two episodes and then decide if you like it or not. simple and nice, while the backgrounds and everything is okay too, so really it is average...Sound: It may just be my personal opinion but I really loved the soundtrack of Binan.

To anime fans familiar with all of the common tropes found in the genre, this show really did an excellent job with its outlandish, wonderfully wacky and accurate satire. It proved to be very entertaining in a silly way, and the hilarious comedic delivery was great. If you aren't familiar with the tropes of magical girl shows I would skip this one, as the jokes and over-the-top occurrences may fall flat for some viewers. I think this show very successfully did what it set out to do- and that...is to lovingly (yes, that's a pun there) make fun of magical girl shows… with guys! If you're expecting anything more from this show you'll be disappointed, but taking it for what it is is the best way to enjoy it! While viewing the show it is also quite apparent that it was written to cater to the fangirls who wish to pair friends in the show together as potential romantic couples… so a little fanservicey too as a FYI if you don't care for that (even though that can be fun sometimes lol).

Thought I\'d like to do this anime some justice :)Story: 8/10The story was fairly engaging and kept me hooked through all 12 episodes. Boueibu follows a general ""Monster of the Week"" kind of idea, no different from the \'stereotypical\' type of mahou shoujo anime. Each episode and each monster defeated provides a lesson to be learnt by the audience.(Though it\'s a REAL STRETCH sometimes (the other characters point it out and all too)) However, it also has a running plot which i guess centers around the friendship they have with each other. Especially Kinshiro and Atsushi of course. So yeah, nothing too special...about the story, yet it kept me interested so 8 points!Art: 9/10I REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed the transformation sequences! They were like upgraded and cooler Sailor Moon transformations. The fight scenes weren\'t half bad too :)Sound: 8/10I guess I really liked it since it brought back the magical theme song thing that I fell in love with when I watched Cardcaptor Sakura. Ahhhhh the good memories :D The background music was also okay, nothing outstanding though. However, other than one or two oddly placed bgm that don\'t fit the mood, it was fine.Character: 9/10They characters of boueibu are all unique in their own way. We get to see a great variety of character traits in all of them and how thy contrast with the others. This is really highlighted by the Battle Lovers as all 5 of them are very different and seem to be opposites of one and other. I didn\'t really look at character development since there\'s honestly not much you can do in an anime of this theme and only 12 episodes. However, I dropped 1 point since I felt that other than Kinshiro, they failed to further delve into the characters of the rest of the cast. An example would be Io\'s obsession with money ""because it does not betray"", which cause we never get to find out about.Enjoyment: 10/10Boueibu has brought me great joy as it has brought back many memories of my childhood. It is also hilarious in it\'s attempt to provide the audience with a parody of a genre unlike any we have seen before. THUS 10 out of 10 right here!Overall: 10/10While it has it\'s flaws here and there, boueibu has been a great journey and overall a MAGICAL experience of LOVE about the story, yet it kept me interested so 8 points!Art: 9/10I REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed the transformation sequences!

Meta humor is a lot less known then a lot of other humor. These are either jokes and a joke or jokes within a joke. As it is less known and not as ""mainstream"", I can see why the jokes are under-appreciated. If you don\'t like the meta humor concept, then this shows humor may not appeal to you. As, it does seem to be self-referential and like a typical magical girl series with how color coded and...the continues cycle of enemies. But if you can\'t understand what is meta about it, it may just seem like bland jokes to you. Personally, I am a big lover of meta humor, so this show was right up my alley. the continues cycle of enemies.

This isn't an anime that's supposed to be taken seriously, and to be honest I don't know why so many people reviewed this badly when all the anime does is to make fun of the cliches prevalent in anime, and that they could not see it.It is a satirical parody of the magical girl genre. I get that parodies aren't for everyone, but for me, if well done, they are a hit for me, and I couldn't stop laughing watching this one.

It contains so many tropes that happen so often it has become mandatory in anime, but Binan Koukou uses them to their own advantage, and it works very well.ARTThe style itself isn't anything to write home about. In fact, it is pretty generic as well, but the quality of the art is pretty good and the animation is fluid so no complaints.SOUNDAgain, the soundtrack doesn't really stand out either, but the quality was pretty good as well.CHARACTERSThey are very one-dimensional and every one of them is an accumulation of cliches, which makes them seem pathetic, but in Binan Koukou, this works very well as it adds to the ridiculousness. They are also color-coded, so it's easy to recognize them. However, by being so unoriginal, it also makes them somehow unique as opposed to cookie-cutter characters.You have the pink womanizer who doesn't get the girls, the yellow rich kid who only cares about money, the red shota who loves cuddles more than anything, the blue stoic and smart sloth, and the green nice guy who cooks. Oh, and let's not forget the obligatory cute mascot in any magical girl anime : Pink Wombat !But even though they are in theory some of the most common tropes in anime, the characters are actually surprisingly endearing, and to watch them is pretty entertaining. I did find however that Yumoto (the red one) has a grating personality at times.CONCLUSIONOverall, I'd recommend this anime to anyone who likes a good laugh and who is able to not everything seriously.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as i did.This show isn't advertised as such, but no matter what they tell you it IS an spoof/parody of magical girl and shounen ai genres, and fanservice for ladies. That doesn't make it less enjoyable, it actually make it become really refreshing.The five main characters are a bunch of highschoolers with different stereotypical genre personality traits (the cute...one, the brains, the playboy, the richboy and the lazy one), that are chosen by an alien pink Wombat to save the world and give love to the loveless. The funny thing is that they actually couldn't care less about this job, and even they make fun of their silly outfits and create hilarious names to their attacks.I was pleasantly surprised how it got better episode by episode, and even though i would have love if they have given the plot more substance, i think it fulfills the purpose for what it was created: to make you laugh.The only thing that i really think that sucks a lot are the monsters.

Really, that seems to be all that it takes. Funny jokes aren't really a necessity, good art really isn't a necessity, good character really isn't a necessity, it isn't even really a necessity for your parody to be a good parody of its genre. And that's exactly what Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! is. I'll be honest, this show was SO strikingly unfunny and poorly executed that I actually never finished it, and I don't really plan...to waste my time with any more of it. It was something I never could've expected from this permise: it was actually just boring.The idea of making a 'magical boys' series is one that has...MERIT but the problem is that the show basically intends to coast off that and that alone, without adding anything else of value to the story. The story is that a pink wombat with a heart on it (because subtlety is for plebs) comes to these five guys with no real discernible personalities and gives them this love armor to fight the monsters of the day that pop up randomly and are typically based around concepts that you'd expect to see in an anime for an elementary schooler. There's some big bad in there, I guess. And that's it. That's the story. Nothing different, nothing unique, just generic magical girls...except its boys now so I guess its revolutionary.And as I mentioned, the boys are pretty much the antithesis of quality character writing. They are defined by their 'love' of specific things and...pretty much nothing else. The main character is about as investing as plain oatmeal--you can tell that the whole joke with him is this tongue in cheek joke about how magical girl protagonists are KINDA BLAND and just generally characterized as being generally just nice and good. The problem is, the show doesn't bother to ADD anything to the cliches that it makes these characters. In something like Yokai Watch, we have jokes about how generally normal the protagonist is, as a stab at how the characters of games are often designed to be all encompassing so that the player/viewer can imagine themselves in their place. But Keita/Nate has a personality of his own outside of this joke. None of the boys have the luxury of being anything but their cliche.And what better way to express generic characters in a generic story than by using a generic artstyle? Yeah, like a lot of this show, the artstyle does approximately nothing for me. It's kinda shiny, but other than that, its as by the books an artstyle as it goes. There is one face structure and one face structure alone, with the characters defined by their hair color/theme color more than anything else. I suppose this is a shot at this similar idea being used in magical girl anime, but the problem is that instead of making any sort of clever statement, it falls into the exact pitfall that it intends to mock. Just pointing out that you have done something does not charge that you, well, did it.The sound is okay. Not as bad as the characters or story, but nothing special. The voices are pretty by the books, executed pretty much with standard expectations. The music is, you guessed it, nothing special. I can't really think of anything specific that caught my ear and the opening is pretty much just generic Jpop. It's not bad but again...nothing makes it particularly stand out.This is because as a whole, it seems that Binan Kokou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! does not want to stand out. If it does then it failed monumentally. It is at its core an ATTEMPT at parody, and I do very sincerely mean it is just an ATTEMPT. Right from the getgo it falls into the most basic of traps regarding parody: it believes that if it points out that it DID the thing then it is inherently funny and that it is no longer accountable for doing the same exact thing. But nothing special is said, nothing special is done, and nothing new or unique has been pointed out. All it did was slap some boys in the place of girls and called it a day. And ultimately, that doesn't compensate for a poorly written attempt at comedy colored by only the most generic of characters.I wouldn't watch it again. Overall this is a very abysmal 3/10, possibly the lowest score I've yet to give on this site. to waste my time with any more of it. It was something I never could've expected from this permise: it was actually just boring.The idea of making a 'magical boys' series is one that has...MERIT but the problem is that the show basically intends to coast off that and that alone, without adding anything else of value to the story.

Every episode, the monsters of the week get a dose of therapy from a teenage armchair psychiatrist who firmly believes that everyone is special and worthy of love even if they only play a bit part... all while his friends lampshade exactly what genre they're in. The meta humor truly speaks for itself. While the show was airing, it was the perfect dose of silliness and love to wrap yourself up in every week; and now that the season is bingeable you can overdose...on wholesomeness even faster!Fair warning: The tropes being parodied are staples in magical girl and BL series, and may be hit or miss. For example, Yumoto's cuddle addiction starts out funny but then quickly grows into a weird inversion of the shota trope where the shota is the one being too handsy. Needless to say, if you are squeamish of anime content that alludes to sexual assault even in a parody setting, you may want to tread lightly here.Due to the nature of the series, interesting details about the main cast get sprinkled into the plot, but very few of those details are ever expanded on. The intention behind this was to leave plenty of room for viewers to fill in the blanks with their imaginations, but do be aware of this if you prefer a series that doesn't leave so many questions behind. Fortunately, that does mean the shipping potential in this series is astounding! There are so many different character types to choose from and so many story arcs to imagine or expand upon. If you are an avid multishipper and the concept of the series interests you, you may find yourself at home here.For a show that was written largely on a whim and sprinkled with inside jokes, it works. The episodes that play out like a spot the reference (sometimes from other magical girl series, sometimes from BL series), the many references to Japanese culture, and the punny names may be confusing to a Western audience, but there is a lot of humor that shines through regardless of how much knowledge you may have on the subject. Thankfully, this is a series that can be appreciated by both a casual viewer and someone who prefers to dig a little deeper.If you're looking for a laugh, want to look at some pretty animation for a few hours, and none of the above information has deterred you, then I highly recommend adding Boueibu to your anime lineup! on wholesomeness even faster!Fair warning: The tropes being parodied are staples in magical girl and BL series, and may be hit or miss.

It's corny, of course, but it does it in a way that's not obnoxious. Each episode does have one enemy that the Battle Lovers have to defeat, which exception of the last two episodes, and I can see how that can get annoying, but the anime did shake up each enemy to be more interesting instead...of simplistic. There are some backstories in this anime that will make you feel for the characters. The ending, which I will not spoil for the sake of those who want to watch this, will end up shocking you completely. There is no real real plot, but each episode is enjoyable to watch. I ended up liking it. 10/10Art: You guys know how much I don't like fanservice of any type, even when it's guys stripping while changing into their Battle Lover outfits. I know it's only a few short seconds, and I don't mind the changing scenes because of that. There are the bathhouse scenes, too, and I know it's culture for people of the same sex to walk around naked in a bath house, but I just don't dare look because it's not my place to look at guys' asses, cartoon or not. Also, the character design of the human boys are not as a cutesy as they should be. I think this show tried to create a style that was in between Sailor Moon and Madoka, but it just didn't work. I mean I love Ryuu, Atsushi, and Yumoto's design's, and Io and En's are a tad bit bland. The rival group's designs are a bit bland, too. For this, I rate it an 8/10.Sound: The opening song is good, but it does get annoying if you listen to it at least ten times a day. The ending song is a lot better, and what I like about the ending is that the characters are sitting in a theatre watching a recap of the episode, especially the parts that inflict emotion out of them. Because there are only two songs, I don't want to rate this too harshly. I mean the battle background music is enjoyable to hear, too. You know it's a little more uplifting because it's meant to be a cute, action story. I would rate this a 9/10.Character: I think where you find the parody the most in this anime is in the characters' personalities. They're pretty cliche, too. Yumoto is the cute, sort of gay (It may be confirmed, I don't know) leader. Atsushi is the nerdy looking type with a kind heart. En is the nonchalant person who couldn't really give a shit. Io is the greedy money making student, and Ryuu is the show offy, lady's man type (though I have never seen him with a girl for the entirety of the show). The enemy characters don't even have much personality either, except for their leader, who you will find out why he has his rage towards the end of the anime. The animal leaders are your typical ones. Wombat of Battle Lovers encourages the team to work together to defeat evil, and Zundar bosses his group around to make the world as evil as possible. Nothing special really. I feel as if I want to learn more about the Battle Lovers even after the show was over rather than the enemies' backstories when they should be more interesting. I would rate this 8/10 as well.Enjoyment: I was always laughing during every episode. There was always a new joke to laugh at in every episode, but it also had its serious moments, too. Even though this may be too cutesy for some people, you are always wanting the good guys to win. Yes, it's one of those. Though the characters may be dull, the material is interesting to watch. The aggregated moments are so over the top, that they are funny. I guess that's what all the show is, funny. If you're looking for some deep material, you won't find it quite often. Still, I can't find the reason why I enjoy it so much. Maybe you can. 9/10Overall: To conclude this review, it's a good show to watch. If you don't get too attached to the characters, that's fine. I wouldn't expect you to. Would I watch the sequel show if it were to come to be? Actually, yes. Maybe that show will help me answer some questions that I have right now. I sure hope so. If not, make sure you don't ask questions while watching this season alone. The overall score is a rounded 9/10 of simplistic.

It was funny, clever, emotional, and thrilling. The plot twist at the end kinda fell a bit flat, but I couldn\'t have asked for a better ending scene. All of the characters were so beautifully written I was rooting for them and sympathizing with them, and yes, that includes the ""enemies,"" i.e. the poor students feeling anger and hatred being manipulated. Zundar and Hireashi not included \'cause they were just weird little talking animals. I am so glad this...has a second season (which for some reason, at the time I\'m writing this, is only .12 higher and I\'m sure with how much I absolutely loved this season I\'ll fall even more in love--haha, love--with the second) and I get the feeling if another magical boy anime were to be made, it wouldn\'t quite match up to this one. has a second season (which for some reason, at the time I\'m writing this, is only .12 higher and I\'m sure with how much I absolutely loved this season I\'ll fall even more in love--haha, love--with the second) and I get the feeling if another magical boy anime were to be made, it wouldn\'t quite match up to this one.', 'This show is a good parody of the magical girl genre that keeps you entertained from start to the finish. Art is pretty good and the seiyuu´s do a great job and fit to their roles well, although a small hedgehog with a really deep voice might sound weird at first, but in the end is just another funny thing among lot of others.The characters are likable and don´t really have any character development throughout the series, but that is probably more fault of the genre more than anything.The story is pretty simple monster of the week thing, but again it doesn´t really have...to be more complicated to get the job done which is to make the viewers laugh. to be more complicated to get the job done which is to make the viewers laugh.', 'This season. Diomedea decided to come up with what I think was one of the Winter Season\'s most hilarious anime series that came this year. What I\'ve been seeing for these ""uncommon"" shows is that due to their ""weird"" or ""parody-like"" concept (this is a mahou shounnen derived from the common genre of mahou shoujou) they are usually underrated or just looked down upon! Well, Binan Love isn\'t exactly the best in terms of ratings, but they aren\'t bad!Story: 7/10The story revolves around ""5 unlikely heroes"" who are 5 boys who had met in the Binan High School by chance when a Wombat came...and literally gave them magical powers. Pretty rushed beginning and had me confused for a sec. Then, the plot continued for the next 10 episodes with not much development in respect to the fact that they fight against the opposing force through other people! Well, it\'s not original really. However, the fact that it had these unique factors makes it super hilarious from their talks of food to love! I am hinting at a subtle yaoi factor here. Pacing was pretty slow, but it made this a relaxing anime to watch.Art: 6/10Gahh. Binan Love\'s art is pretty mediocre. Nothing too special about it. The costume designs were pretty normal (in regards as to how frilly you can make a costume for a male) and the explosions and attacks... pretty average if not sub-par. Other than that, it was alright. Nothing that stands out a lot.Sound: 8/10Binan Love\'s sound throughout the episodes was average. They were all in the right places and made the mood much more enjoyable or scary, or really made it pretty realistic! Sound effects and background music are alright. I particularly liked the OP. It was just appropriate for it and super catchy, so that\'s a plus for Binan Love!Character: 6/10It would not be an exaggeration to say that this anime is a mirror of other magical girl animes. For some reason, there is always 5 in the protagonist\'s troupe of fighters and they all have personalities that in a way differ from one another\'s but in the same time syngerize well to make conflicts, only to reconcile over them and be better friends! The villains lack the villainous aspect as well, in the end really just a bunch of students wanting power.Enjoyment: 8/10I cannot lie that I particularly liked how the anime started. It was a new experience for me to see an all-out boys\' magical anime and pretty hilarious at that. After a a few episodes of fights and normalcy, I got bored and considered dropping it. It does seem lacking at times, but I did not and watched it until the end. It was alright. Average. Got a lot of laughs though!Verdict: 7/10It\'s not the worst anime of the season, but it does not stand out too much either. It has the potential to be a better anime should Diomedea had put more plot development and more depth to the characters. I speculate a season 2 might come out. It has the vibe that the Battle Lovers\' Fight is not over! Am I looking forward to it? Not particularly hyped, but definitely welcoming to it!I recommend this anime to those who want an all-boys anime/RComedy/SoL/just watch a genderbent version of Madoka Magica.

Take your standard magical girl show including a monster of the week, nude transformation and colour coded costumes and throw in some mild parody and self-awareness and you've got this show.The plot is contained in three episodes- the very first and the last two. Literally every other episode is a monster of the week basic plot with goofy looking monster designs and equally goofy dialogue. Rest assured though, the heroes who I'm never completely sure are parodying their character type or just ARE their character type will show up and stock footage transform into The Battle Lovers and ultimately...defeat the monsters with more stock footage.I thought the designs interesting at first until realising they're literally just gender-swapped standard magical girl outfits. Even their codenames are rocks and gems to parody Sailor Moon. In fact, half-assed naming conventions are the core humour of this show.The music and art are the saving graces of this otherwise painfully average show that seems to have gotten a high score as it's boys instead of magical girls. That's the premise, that's the joke and it barely ever goes beyond that. defeat the monsters with more stock footage.I thought the designs interesting at first until realising they're literally just gender-swapped standard magical girl outfits.

It all seems very stupid until the plot twist at the end of the series. There's also a great deal of other plot surrounding the main fight plot, so you can always indulge in that. It's laid out very similarly to Miraculous Ladybug,...so if you're in that fandom, I would recommend this.The art is beautiful, with some very nice galaxies and very clean, wholesome looking characters and backgrounds. It's not fancy, but it's simply nice to look at.The sound is okay. The opening and closing songs are catchy enough, but the background music sometimes seems displaced.The characters are a whole other story. They have some development, but sometimes their motivations or actions seem off. They grow on you by the end though, and it's hard to hate any character because they're all so fun.Overall, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Much like most the of the audience, I was 'eh' about the show until the last episode, where the plot twist made the entire thing a lot more hilarious that I expected. At least watch it for that-- trust me, it's worth it, coming from a person who usually doesn't like the magical girl genre.I would recommend this if: you like parodies, you like shows that break the fourth wall, you wanna pass time, you like magical girls, you like Miraculous LadybugI would NOT recommend this if: you are looking for a show on strong friendships/romance, you wanted an ACTUAL magical girl show, you wanted something even slightly seriousHave a great day everyone! so if you're in that fandom, I would recommend this.The art is beautiful, with some very nice galaxies and very clean, wholesome looking characters and backgrounds.

The first 5 minutes in, I was thinking, ""Girls are all gung-ho and/or dramatic, and this is how the guys react.""I almost feel bad for Wombat, seeing as he got stuck with them instead of a group of girls who would help more willingly. :) ', 'I\'ll admit that if I rated this show purely objectively, it would probably score a 6. So why did I give it a 9?Simply because it manages to poke fun at magical girl tropes without talking down to its viewers or resorting to mean spirited jokes. It\'s exactly what a parody should be: a celebration of what it is critiquing. I consider this a must watch for anyone who is a fan of magical girls (and/or BL), HOWEVER that doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t have any weak points.Story 6/10Where the show falters is in its weekly format. Like most magical girl anime, it uses...a monster of the week formula that gets tiring after a while. There are a couple glaring plotholes as the show goes along but they get a pass mostly because the characters themselves make fun of them. Overall the story is lighthearted, but they do mix in some drama and well foreshadowed plot twists to keep you emotionally invested. It also has a very satisfying ending (which is more than I can say for a lot of series).Art & Animation 8/10The character designs are distinct and adorable. Honestly this is some of the best proportioned shoujo I\'ve seen in a while. The battle sequences, while extremely sparkly, are not stunning feats of animation. But with transformations called ""More Better Love-making"" the show isn\'t meant for cinematic battles anyway.Characters 6/10The characters are tricky because they are both good and bad.

There are a couple glaring plotholes as the show goes along but they get a pass mostly because the characters themselves make fun of them. Overall the story is lighthearted, but they do mix in some drama and well foreshadowed plot twists to keep you emotionally invested. It also has a very satisfying ending (which is more than I can say for a lot of series).Art & Animation 8/10The character designs are distinct and adorable. Honestly this is some of the best proportioned shoujo I\'ve seen in a while. The battle sequences, while extremely sparkly, are not stunning feats of animation. But with transformations called ""More Better Love-making"" the show isn\'t meant for cinematic battles anyway.Characters 6/10The characters are tricky because they are both good and bad.

I expected way more from it.It essentially followed the timeline of every magical girl anime. Regular day, bad guy appears, transformation scene, fight, follow up. The only underlying plot wasn\'t revealed until the last 2 episodes and I was shocked at how awful it was. A TV show? Really? Most of the monsters that appeared were just stupid as well.The art overall was not bad, but it wasn\'t stellar either. The music was pretty catchy.There was no character development except for Yumoto\'s brother. The background character that chops up wood every 2 episodes....The group itself has no development. They were all flat and boring characters. Might I add how annoying Yumoto is. Take Nagisa from free and X3 with a pinch of stupidity and bam, Yumoto. Dumb moron wouldn\'t shut up ever and his voice is annoying as hell. Why is the main magical boy? Atsushi was introduced first and he\'s the only dipshit that has half a brain, should\'ve been him instead.This show was boring and was a pain in the ass to watch but I didn\'t want to give up so I finished it.

This review is my attempt to figure out why.The premise: five sexy but careless guys at an all-boys high school meets a pink mascot who turns them into magical girls (-boys), and they are then pinned against personifications of everyday first-world problems who they defeat with spells and debating, while the evil and all-powerful student council flexes their dominance and plans the end of the world.So which genre does this falls under? I don\'t think there\'s a short answer to that, but the long answer would be ""magical girl and anime overall...parody, disguised as shoujo ecchi with lowkey BL, but actually witty comedy"".First of all, the humor is actually really witty and able to deliver. Too many parody works – both in anime and Hollywood – relies solely on absurdity-based jokes which are stretched out across way too many minutes. BKCBLOVE, on the other hand, relies on quick and snappy one-liners to entertain while keeping the story going with the comical base setting. The humor really feels original and gives the impression that the writers comfortably laughed the script along for many hours instead of basing the entire story on a few recurring jokes.Also, there is no romance subplots. As a matter of fact, there is exactly zero females on-screen throughout all seasons, which gives a character dynamic free from pointless love tropes and makes for a much more refined and unchallenged storyline. Of course, there are tons of sexy boys and some hearts flying around, but in practice it is all platonic. A rare blessing to see pubescent boys without story-impairing sexualities.The visuals, audio, and overall production value are also absolutely on point. No expenses were spared in the drawing budget, which makes BKCBLOVE once again stand out from many other anime parodies which are meant as quick laughs. BKCBLOVE takes itself seriously, and it shows.But the best thing is something I can only describe as WHOLESOMENESS. Although the characters are all based on stereotypes, they are by no means less characters for that reason – they each give a sensation of lifelikeness and makes themselves approachable for the viewer. The small inter-character conflicts hit very close to home, and Yumoto\'s finishing debate statements are heartfelt although the monsters are absurd. And add to that the fact that they are fighting for a cause no less noble than ""love"".As a feminist, I never imagined that media would produce any lovable male characters for my tastes. But I am so happy to see that I was wrong. If more young men watched BKCBLOVE, the world would be a better place.unironically cured my depression / 10 parody, disguised as shoujo ecchi with lowkey BL, but actually witty comedy"".First of all, the humor is actually really witty and able to deliver.

Which isn't that surprising since this franchise has never been known for its stellar narratives. Still, I would be remiss if I didn't discuss them. The first issue is that the Crane Hermit is very blatantly up to no good. Like, to the point where Chiaotzu comes across as a complete dumbass for not noticing. He quite literally has Tao Pai Pai murder the loyal General Blue in front of the emperor. I know Chiaotzu couldn't do basic maths in the series proper, but he should still look at that and notice that something isn't quite kosher.There's also the issue with the tournament. Goku and his group decide that one of them needs to win so they can make a specific request, but they don't let Yamcha in on it. Which means they just have to give him a beating. So, why not just tell him? It would give you more allies to work with. I know he's got a fate of becoming progressively more of a punching bag, but this was at the point where he wasn't just there to die or almost die.I will give them credit for combining various elements from the series proper into something that is a bit different. I'll also give the film credit for maintaining that sense of fun that made Dragonball an enjoyable series. The Penguin Village sequence in particular is just great.Characters:Chances are, you already know whether or not you like Dragonball's characters. If you aren't that familiar with the franchise, the cast is pretty simple but they're enjoyable and have some fun interactions. I will say those of you hoping to see Yamcha or Chiaotzu in action will probably be disappointed since they don't do much here. Lunch, however, does get some really good scenes. It's a pity she got banished to the moon to keep Luna company because this does showcase what her character could do back when she was actually in scenarios.Art:The artwork looks about on par with the artwork in the series proper. It's a bit dated by today's standards but it's vibrant, colourful and the action sequences are generally pretty well executed. You also do have to give credit for the character designs. They are iconic for a valid reason.Sound:This is a franchise with a strong reoccurring cast and they give solid performances here. Whether it's Koyama Mami (who voices both Lunch & Arale), Otsuka Chikao, Tanaka Mayumi, Tsuru Hiromi, Nozawa Masako or anyone else. The music is pretty much the same fare we get in the series proper. So, it's well done.Ho-yay:There are some kind of homo-erotic moments betwixt Tenshinhan & Chiaotzu. Which is weird because Chiaotzu looks like a porcelain doll, but they're also both supposed to be adults. So, I won't judge them.Areas of Improvement:Let Yamcha in on the plan. It's not like Yamcha fighting Tao Pai Pai and surviving is going to change much. It'll just mean our protagonists are showing more sense.Have Blue confront the Crane Hermit in private. You could keep everything as is, but have it not be in front of the emperor, thereby making Chiaotzu not appear to be completely inept.Expand on the Penguin Village sequence. Honestly, a film this short could afford to have a little more to it any way. And that was the best part.Final Thoughts:Makafushigi Daibouken\xa0is a pretty decent film.

Chaotzu is an emperor with Master Shen and Tenshinhan being his underlings. Bora, Upa, Tao Pai Pai and Arale appear in this movie but with lesser roles compared to their anime counterpart and some references are made to the main story but without the same impact. In fact, it might be the weakest of all 4 purely Dragon Ball movies simply because the scenes that end up being weak homages could never carry the same impact as most of them...were build up for several episodes or even story arcs. Meaning it is nothing but a 46 minute movie that feels like an extended episode.Even the way Goku surpassed Tao Pai Pai felt like an asspull where he somehow ended up at the top of the Quin Tower and received a minor advice from God of Martial Arts Korin. Compare that to how Goku worked his ass off to get to the top and received training disguised as a power up (instead the other way around like in modern Dragon Ball).But what about elements exclusive to the film? There is an inner conflict in the nation where the story mainly takes place. Tenshinhan is conflicted what side he should take in the conflict: Loyalty to his teacher or his Emperor. Sadly this element like many others aren't taken full advantage off. Like we don't know about Tenshinhan's past events with his teacher. Only a small hint of his relationship with his Emperor.The story has 2 subplots. The gathering of the Dragon Balls and the Tournament that takes place with both starting to merge into one. Every major cast member is involved and contribute in exposing the truth behind the Crane Master's plan. Be it Yamcha, Bulma, Oolong, Puar, Goku, Roshi and even Krillin.However, there are way too many characters that only exist as lesser important characters because they appeared in the main story like Arale who just exist because the main story had a crossover too.Overall, this movie is really mediocre by original Dragon Ball standards. It eats more than it can chew and that is its weakness. However, it still has some really good elements like how it uses its cast and the conflict behind the scenes. Also it has a fantastic ending and the best way Chaotzu has been treated in this franchise. were build up for several episodes or even story arcs.

There is far less reusing of individual frames, which adds to the watchability significantly. The way in which the story is remixed is interesting that it holds a Dragonball fans attention due to being different enough, while sticking closer to something resembling the Dragonball canon.Unlike the previous movies which felt more like extended episodes, or filler arcs, this movie really felt closer to an anime movie experience....The biggest weakness however is the fact that there really are too many characters introduced in to short a time frame, that narratively messes up the ability to really tell much of a story without understanding some of the thematic placements of the characters. That is the main reason I feel this is closer to a 7, than a 8, despite being quite an enjoyable experience.

Unfortunately, there was...no mention of Aya-chan and Sakura in this OVA. (Not even in the first two episodes of Weiß Kreuz Glühen, which I've watched so far as of today, 3rd of March 2024.)

The characters were sympathetic and the storyline was unique.  I also liked the voice actors picked for the OVA, they matched up well with the characters in this anime.  Overall, I enjoyed watching this and would watch it again. ', 'I haven\'t really seen any of the episodes of Weiss Kreuz but I knew of it when I was younger... When I saw that there was an OVA, I immediately grabbed the chance to watch it since it\'s just 2 episodes long... I wanted to have a ""feel"" of the anime first and I can say that it\'s not bad at all...Main Characters: Aya/Ran Fujimiya, Ken Hidaka, Youji Kudou and Omi TsukiyonoScore is 7 everything and 6 for the Sound...I would not actually call this an OVA since it\'s too short... for me, it\'s like a 2-part movie... with assassins as the main characters, story...will just be the typical revenge type... it was surprisingly bloody btw and i kinda liked it... Art/Characters were fairly drawn and I\'d classify the main cast as Bishounen(s)... Aya is like the leader so he\'s the brooding type, Ken is the boy next door and outgoing type, Youji will be the ladies man and Omi will be the idealistic child-like type... very interesting and deadly bunch... oh and i think Archer (F/S Night) made a cameo here... :PAs for the OP/ED songs, i did not like it... i guess i\'m not into those jpop boybands... they sound good, yes but there\'s just something in it that is kinda creepy to me... haha!Enjoyment/Overall: 7 - it was dark and fast-paced... it made me want to watch the Weiss Kreuz series... I wanted to know more about these assassins and their backgrounds... not really a priority but definitely one to spend time on...Recommended to those who want a short action anime with pretty boys in it... Story is not related to the series so watching it beforehand is not required... :) will just be the typical revenge type... it was surprisingly bloody btw and i kinda liked it...
