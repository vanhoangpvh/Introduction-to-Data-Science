Dirty Pair: Bouryaku no 005-bin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1795/Dirty_Pair__Bouryaku_no_005-bin,"[""Kei and Yuri, the intrepid Dirty Pai ... er, I mean, Lovely Angels are back on the job. They have two assignments this time. First, to investigate a space liner explosion in which three hundred people died, but no one`s come forward to claim any insurance money!!? Second, to find a missing scientist and his family. Are the two cases connected?As the title hints, there IS a Conspiracy, so it comes as no big surprise when the 2 cases are linked. The story is predictable and the animation is old school. If they didn't cut corners on the animation so much I would have scored...it higher. This movie did kick up the ecchi factor. It was like Kei and Yuri visited the plastic surgeon after the original TV series was done. I spent half the movie wondering how on earth Kei and Yuri's &quot;bras&quot; could in reality hold their boobs up, wires or no wires, it's just not possible to pack that much mass into clothing designed with a diamond cutout on the middle of the chest, without something(s) falling out (if you know what I mean).But I digress, characterization and comedy are the biggest hallmarks of Dirty Pair, and this movie goes over the top on both. Chief Gooley goes into mega hysterics when the central computer assigns The Dirty Pair to these two cases. I thought it was WAY over the top considering that Chief Gooley has worked with them forever and so should be semi &quot;used to it&quot; by now. Comedic bits are evident in the reaction of various people when the Dirty Pair introduce themselves.The real issue with this movie is besides the ham factor, the voice acting is atrocious. The Japanese version is slightly better than the english voice actors, but even then you can't keep a straight face at some of the things that are said. The english voice acting for Kei was terrible - I didn't believe anything that came out of her mouth. It made half the show seem like a very bad 1950s B grade horror schlock, no Oscars will be won for the voice acting here.Overall, this was not a very good movie and it could and should have been done much better to do justice to the Dirty Pair. it higher.

The 3WA sends “trouble consultants” like Kei and Yuri to solve various problems, and in grand fashion, the two lovely angels cause nothing but destruction and mayhem wherever they...go.In this particular hour-long OVA, Kei and Yuri are picked by the computer to investigate a mysterious plane explosion causing many people to simply go missing, much to the dismay of the Chief. And thus, that is all there is to it. Let the mayhem commence in typically awesome Dirty Pair action.Being an OVA, the characters and dramatics are a little over the top, such as the Chief reacting to the computer picking Kei and Yuri or the clothing options for the two; oh so space 80’s. However, the animation for Dirty Pair never looked better. Sound and music match fairly well for action sequences. Even the story is somewhat darker and has a more serious plot compared to the more over-dramatic humour the show usually brings. Some might deter from this new aspect of Dirty Pair and that is fine if looking for more of the original anime.Kei and Yuri are as lovable as ever, with Kei being the assertive flirt with a short fuse while Yuri is the more soft spoken and romantic type. Basically, Dirty Pair 005 is an OVA that creates a more serious atmosphere with still maintaining what is loved about the franchise, chicks with big sticks. go.In this particular hour-long OVA, Kei and Yuri are picked by the computer to investigate a mysterious plane explosion causing many people to simply go missing, much to the dismay of the Chief.

While it had the action (and property damage) that I've come to expect, it was far too dark and serious to be worth re-watching. Also, the OVA spent far too much time getting Kei and Yuri into place to advance the plot along. Overall, though, the animation was decent (for 1990, anyway.), and the original voice actors came back for this one.Taking everything into consideration, I'd rate this a 6/10. As I mentioned, too dark and serious to merit rewatching. As much as I like Dirty Pair, this was likely the low point for...the franchise. At least, before Dirty Pair Flash. Makes me wonder what to expect from Affair of Nolandia... the franchise. At least, before Dirty Pair Flash. Makes me wonder what to expect from Affair of Nolandia..."", ""Definitely my favorite Dirty Pair movie of the trilogy as its substantial story, serious tone and sorrowful conclusion really left a lasting impression in a way the previous films could only say about the animation quality. While Project Eden's impressive animation and nifty soundtrack  remains superior to this movie, this clever and engaging plot kept my attention far more consistently and left me moved far more than I could have ever expected. Also, its such a  pleasure to watch a feature film where the plot makes sense and the tension is constant and very authentic. Another plus in this movie's favor was both...heroines shine nicely unlike in the previous films where they seemed  uncharacteristically dim and flakey in nature so the seriousness of the story reasserted the wit into our Lovely Angels. The only negative is this film does borrow the script of a memorable two part episode from the original series but I do believe the story has a bit more weight in the detail and a darker edge to the tone which is an improvement. Also, there is no impressive intro and credit sequence like the previous films and the conclusion does leave the original, and true, Lovely Angels on a sad note- but in deep retrospective this series has always been a bit more somber than remembered as the splendid fan service and witty banter of Kei and Yuri can sometimes overshadow the dark tone of the series' stories. heroines shine nicely unlike in the previous films where they seemed  uncharacteristically dim and flakey in nature so the seriousness of the story reasserted the wit into our Lovely Angels.

Dragon Ball Z Movie 10: Kiken na Futari! Super Senshi wa Nemurenai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/903/Dragon_Ball_Z_Movie_10__Kiken_na_Futari_Super_Senshi_wa_Nemurenai,"[""First of all, i would say that am a big DBZ fan. But it is true that DBZ movies lack something that the series had.. this one is not an exception.We get to see more of Trunks and Goten in this one.Broly, the legendary super saiyan who was defeated in one of the previous movies came back to defeat kakarot. He was awakened by goten whose cry resembled to that of Goku's when he was a kid. It was stupid because when goku was infant, so was broly by that time... we never know how he reminisced goku's cry so well.The strength of...this movie lies in its climax where we get to see a 'family kamehameha' of goku, gohan and goten. That was one of the most memorable moments of the series. there are also some good comic scenes in involving goten and trunks which are good to watch. Videl is quite annoying.this is only for those who do not mind the loop holes of the plot (as there are many). So finally i say, do watch it if you are a DBZ fan. this movie lies in its climax where we get to see a 'family kamehameha' of goku, gohan and goten.

So finally i say, do watch it if you are a DBZ fan."", ""Broly: The Second Coming is quite possibly the worst out of the DBZ movies. I mean this movie is absolutely terrible from the beginning to around the last three minutes. Dragonball Z has always been something that was heavily focused on its action. Unfortunately, the action takes a backseat to some horrible and very annoying comedy, and it doesn't even deliver on the action when it finally gets there. Also, like the previous movies, this is not something a newbie can jump into. Someone new to the franchise will be completely lost, but for the fans, this actually feels like it could have taken place...at some point during the Great Saiyaman Saga.The plot follows Goten and Trunks as they search for the Dragon Balls to make a wish. Their journey ends when they meet up with the blood thirsty Broly whom confuses Goten with Goku. This begins a cat and mouse game that sees Goten and Trunks doing whatever possible to stay alive until someone stronger can battle Broly.Do not come into this movie expecting anything you saw in Broly's first appearance. Now the first movie wasn't great by no means, still though, it managed to excel where it counts for the most part. Plus it had a more interesting cast to work with. Here, the pacing is atrocious, and I find this movie very difficult to sit through to the point where I have to hit the fast forward. Trunks and Goten are the main characters here and their ridiculous antics are at their peak. These two characters are barely tolerable in small doses, so giving them their own movie can only be described as cringe-inducing. The plot is incredibly boring, and a person may think that things would pick up when Broly finally makes his appearance. Unfortunately, the writers saw fit to turn Broly into a one dimensional idiot that had a hard time killing two Saiyan children and a human girl. I found him to be very disappointing when comparing him to his first appearance. The action scenes completely lack imagination and are uninspired.The production values aren't half bad though. I didn't have an issue with the animation, and the light show during the final moments is a plus. The action doesn't consist of the reused cel combat, but I was actually missing at least that much, since the rest of the action was so weak and slow. The BGM attempts to add some type of flare to the action, but it simply cannot save these poor segments.So what do you get when you have a movie with very bad comedy, rotten action, and a weak antagonist? Well, you get Broly: The Second Coming, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone other than serious DBZ fans. This flick is that bad.Highs: EndingLows: There are way too many at some point during the Great Saiyaman Saga.The plot follows Goten and Trunks as they search for the Dragon Balls to make a wish.

This flick is that bad.Highs: EndingLows: There are way too many"", 'Time to tackle a DBZ movie for a change, since my previous reviews were on Pokemon movies and 1 Pokemon short. As with my other reviews, I\'m looking at the English dub and not the sub. However, I did manage to watch the full, uncut version of this film, so there can\'t possibly be any deleted scenes that would affect this movie\'s score like there were with previous ones.Story: Due to this being a sequel to, arguably, one of the best DBZ movies that have been made, the story isn\'t as detailed as before. There\'s no backstory to why Broly wants to destroy Earth since...almost everything about him was explained in the previous film, which I\'m fine with. However, what I\'m not fine with is characters randomly popping out of nowhere to save the day without much explanation outside of ""I was in the neighborhood and figured you\'d want help"". There\'s also some incredibly thick plot armor surrounding just about every character since no matter what Broly does to them, the most he does is just knock them out. This series pretty much thrives on characters dying and they\'ve worked around the ""Bringing back the dead only works once"" rule several times, so it\'s not like they couldn\'t have killed at least someone off. There\'s also the matter of some really childish jokes, mostly piss jokes, that I\'d expect from an Adam Sandler movie, not DBZ.Art: The artwork for this movie is the same as the show, which I find a bit upsetting since most anime movies based off the shows can at least put a bit more detail into the movie than the show can. However, it\'s not that bothering since the artwork of the show isn\'t the worst I\'ve ever seen.Sound: I have a mixed bag with this. On one hand, the soundtrack is amazing, pretty much like most other DBZ movies. There\'s some amazing songs that get your blood pumping for the fights, which I love. On the other hand, though, some of the voice acting is either terrible, annoying, or both. I\'ve never liked Goten all that much in the show due to how annoying he can be and how terrible his voice sounds. While some would defend him saying that he\'s just a kid, so of course he\'s going to whine a lot and just be overall annoying, I\'d say look at how Gohan developed. Yeah, he started off annoying as well, but once he got used to being a fighter, he became pretty cool. With Goten, he\'s already a pretty good fighter, but still annoys the crap out of me. There\'s also a lot of supporting actors that do a terrible job at voice acting, but at least they only get a few lines.Character: Like stated above, I don\'t like Goten. At all. However, the other characters aren\'t as bad, but most just serve as distractions until the real fight begins between Gohan and Broly. Videl gets knocked out pretty early on which is followed by a lot of piss jokes along with other childish humor from Goten and Trunks.Enjoyment: I personally find this not only the weakest of the Broly trilogy, but the weakest of all the DBZ movies I\'ve seen. While the action was great, it doesn\'t really get started until the second half. While that\'s the same case with the first Broly movie, at least that one had the excuse of building up Broly as a character whereas this one just uses it to fill time until Gohan arrives. almost everything about him was explained in the previous film, which I\'m fine with.

However, the proportion of the movie that is an endless fight scene is inversely proportional to how much I enjoy these Dragon Ball movies, and this one started well before the halfway point.No Goku, not even Gohan for most of it, is pretty neat. Goten, Trunks, and Videl accidentally stumble on Broly, and none of them are anywhere near able to defeat him without the use of the Dragon Balls, which they have to finish collecting....That\'s a good plot! But... it still turns into a power levels battle by the end of it, copping out on its brief promise of a legitimately interesting resolution.I don\'t think people remember exactly what parts of Dragon Ball Z people actually look back so fondly to-- it\'s not the forty episode fight scenes that drag on for ages because the animators didn\'t want to catch up with the manga, it\'s the buildups to them. In the Frieza Saga, Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma go to Planet Namek to find the Dragon Balls on that planet, but at the same time, Frieza is there for the same reason, and Vegeta is there as a rogue agent trying to collect them for his own ends. There\'s two villains simultaneously fighting each other while trying to collect the Dragon Balls, and the heroes are trapped in the middle, way weaker but with the advantage of not being noticed. It\'s this really tension-filled thriller plot as the heroes zip across the planet trying to save the day without getting murderized, and only when Goku arrives to help does the story turn into the endless fighting it\'s all remembered for.That ramble is to say, boo on Toei for not going all the way with this second Broly movie and having our weak heroes defeat the rampaging villain with their wits (and Shen Long\'s infinite wish granting powers).Continuity Problems: Actually, besides the fact that the previous Broly movie is timeline-impossible, this one fits pretty well into the vague area where everyone\'s training for the Budokai Tenkaichi. It has the minor error of Videl seeing just how strong Goten and Trunks are despite being thoroughly surprised by it at the tournament itself, but that\'s the type of thing that can be handwaved.

The story isn\'t a dumpsterfire and stays extremely simple, it\'s funny, and it\'s just an enjoyable watch. Apart from that, it\'s your normal DBZ movie: predictable plot, Goku saves the day, retcons, plot armor, getting saved at the last second, pure fun.Did I mention that Trunks pees on Broly? He PEES on the guy that absolutely destroyed Gohan, Vegeta, Future Trunks and Goku! HE PISSES ON HIM!!! EMPTIES HIS BLADDER ON HIM!!!! TRINKLES HIS URINE ON THE...PERSON THAT CALLS HIMSELF BROLY, THE ANTAGONIST OF THIS MOVIE, THE LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYAN!!!! PERSON THAT CALLS HIMSELF BROLY, THE ANTAGONIST OF THIS MOVIE, THE LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYAN!!!!', ""It's terrible. The early part is annoying babbling about nothing important, screeching, crying, just annoying shit with Trunks and Goten. Even Videl acts weird and goes on a pointless speech to boring characters. It drags on then eventually Broly shows up. He looks kinda shit in the movie, like there's something off with his design. The fighting is pretty boring, more screaming and pissing from Trunks and Goten, comedy bits where they're looking for the dragon balls. Then other characters just show up to help. There's a plan that never even should've been considered, then they just overpower him.Some people say the third Broly movie...is worse, but this movie is debatably just as bad, other than at least having Broly kind of look like Broly. Somehow this one seems more painful to get through. is worse, but this movie is debatably just as bad, other than at least having Broly kind of look like Broly. Somehow this one seems more painful to get through."", ""Broly has cum back and this this it's full on S&M cumming.Every anime has it's qualities that should be praised. There is not any anime that should deserve 1 or 2/10 or even 3/10, but these movies are breaking me with their absurdness, with their zero logic, yes it is non canon, but I would expect from DBZ franchise, that gave us villains like Frieza and Cell and memorable moments like Super Saiyan 1 and 2 and majin Vegeta and some great plot twists and some really smart moments to hold up some standards, but some of these movies are so much painful.This one in...particular almost broke me. I've watched videos, I've heard that this movie is bad, but even with zero expactations this movie managed to almost break me.Anyway, let's move onto the review. As I mentioned DBZ movie:Broly Second Cumming is a non canon movie and it does not appear in manga.\\\\ spoiler alert just in case//My positives from BSC:1, Art and sound as always is the bright side of the 1st 10 DBZ movies, this one isn't an exception.2, Ultra Instinct Videl. At this point, I am gonna list it as a positive. I just can't, because what is about happen with negatives.Now it's time for what if:This movie started really well, if we cut out Broly, we see Videl with Goten and kid Trunks gathering Dragon Balls as they want to see Shen Long, then they get into the village terrorized by a monster, they found a huge dinosaur, they defeat him, they get Dragon Ball as a reward, they summon Shen Long, make a wish and the end. This would have been way better movie, but no, it just had to go to hell.My negatives from BSC:1, How, why did Broly survived? In the Legendary Super Saiyan movie Broly was defeated and was seen getting torn apart by Goku's hit, how the hell did he regenerate soquickly, that he was able to find Saiyan spacecraft, set the course to the Earth in the short amount of time before complete destruction of the planet they fought on?2, How did Broly managed to survive 7 YEARS under the ice surface? Through the DBZ we got some information on Saiyan abilities, weak point etc. How in the hell did he managed to stay alive? We know, that Saiyans cannot withstand magma/lava (Frieza saga) and they aren't fans of cold either (DB 1986 Red Ribbon saga). From medical perspective, from hunger perspective, this is an absolute bullshit.3, If you have seen Broly as a serious character for some reason, this movie makes him an absolute joke: Really, BSC tried to combine serious fight with comedy, this came absolutely tedious, it ruins any thrill and it is not fitted well.4, Was I suprised that Broly wasn't saying Kakarotto every 10 seconds in his last movie, well... This came back to bite me in the ass. There are only 3 things Broly does: Cause havoc obviously, laughs, which is actually pretty annyoing after a while and the only word that he says at least once per minute is Kakarotto.5, Movie should have ended in 40th minute. Broly fell into the lava/magma and that should have been it, but no, they just have to mess it up, somehow he survives using a barrier and it ends up being very cheap, disgraceful to last stand against Cell, because it takes that iconic last moment and tears it apart, somehow Shen Long appears to summon, guess who it is...6, Once again Goku saves the day: Father-son Kamehameha is one of the best moments in DBZ, this Family Kamehameha is on the other hand not the best moemnt, it is one of the worst moments, no emotional value, it is just lazy time adding to this movie, that should have ended 10 minutes ago...7, What does villains have with that Z warriors bone breaking? I don't mind sadistic violence, but it's been used so often in these movies, it has become just tedious and boring.8, Time for the nails... Where was Vegeta? I tell you where he was: He was in plot convention vault, because we know, that he would defeat Broly or it would be less convenient to have family Kamehameha, wait a sec, we could have seen father son Galick Gun, I would take it, would be something good about this movie at least.9, Piccolo where are you? I didn't mind having Kuririn as the Gohan's Lancelot on the white stead, but where was he? Again, plot convention vault. This is just bad, I hate it and I was actually so close to give 2/10, but it had one redeeming moment, that saved that 3/10.Redeeming moment: When Broly shot his huge energy blast, Gohan has created a ki shield(?) to cover Goten, Trunks and Videl. It was a really beautiful moment filled with emotions and it could have been one of the best moments  in all of DBZ if it wasn't in this shitstorm of the movie.Summary: So many plot holes, so many illogical decisions, but at least it had one good moment and that one good moment at least gave me something to remember in good spirit.As I said earlier Dragon Ball Z Movie: Broly Second Cumming earns 3/10 and it is the worst movie from the 1st 10 of DBZ movies, but unlike Bojack Unbound it has at least one moment, that held something special, but even that something special cannot save this movie from it's rating much. particular almost broke me. I've watched videos, I've heard that this movie is bad, but even with zero expactations this movie managed to almost break me.Anyway, let's move onto the review. As I mentioned DBZ movie:Broly Second Cumming is a non canon movie and it does not appear in manga.\\\\ spoiler alert just in case//My positives from BSC:1, Art and sound as always is the bright side of the 1st 10 DBZ movies, this one isn't an exception.2, Ultra Instinct Videl. At this point, I am gonna list it as a positive. I just can't, because what is about happen with negatives.Now it's time for what if:This movie started really well, if we cut out Broly, we see Videl with Goten and kid Trunks gathering Dragon Balls as they want to see Shen Long, then they get into the village terrorized by a monster, they found a huge dinosaur, they defeat him, they get Dragon Ball as a reward, they summon Shen Long, make a wish and the end. This would have been way better movie, but no, it just had to go to hell.My negatives from BSC:1, How, why did Broly survived? In the Legendary Super Saiyan movie Broly was defeated and was seen getting torn apart by Goku's hit, how the hell did he regenerate soquickly, that he was able to find Saiyan spacecraft, set the course to the Earth in the short amount of time before complete destruction of the planet they fought on?2, How did Broly managed to survive 7 YEARS under the ice surface? Through the DBZ we got some information on Saiyan abilities, weak point etc. How in the hell did he managed to stay alive? We know, that Saiyans cannot withstand magma/lava (Frieza saga) and they aren't fans of cold either (DB 1986 Red Ribbon saga). From medical perspective, from hunger perspective, this is an absolute bullshit.3, If you have seen Broly as a serious character for some reason, this movie makes him an absolute joke: Really, BSC tried to combine serious fight with comedy, this came absolutely tedious, it ruins any thrill and it is not fitted well.4, Was I suprised that Broly wasn't saying Kakarotto every 10 seconds in his last movie, well... This came back to bite me in the ass. There are only 3 things Broly does: Cause havoc obviously, laughs, which is actually pretty annyoing after a while and the only word that he says at least once per minute is Kakarotto.5, Movie should have ended in 40th minute. Broly fell into the lava/magma and that should have been it, but no, they just have to mess it up, somehow he survives using a barrier and it ends up being very cheap, disgraceful to last stand against Cell, because it takes that iconic last moment and tears it apart, somehow Shen Long appears to summon, guess who it is...6, Once again Goku saves the day: Father-son Kamehameha is one of the best moments in DBZ, this Family Kamehameha is on the other hand not the best moemnt, it is one of the worst moments, no emotional value, it is just lazy time adding to this movie, that should have ended 10 minutes ago...7, What does villains have with that Z warriors bone breaking? I don't mind sadistic violence, but it's been used so often in these movies, it has become just tedious and boring.8, Time for the nails... Where was Vegeta? I tell you where he was: He was in plot convention vault, because we know, that he would defeat Broly or it would be less convenient to have family Kamehameha, wait a sec, we could have seen father son Galick Gun, I would take it, would be something good about this movie at least.9, Piccolo where are you?

This is just bad, I hate it and I was actually so close to give 2/10, but it had one redeeming moment, that saved that 3/10.Redeeming moment: When Broly shot his huge energy blast, Gohan has created a ki shield(?) to cover Goten, Trunks and Videl. It was a really beautiful moment filled with emotions and it could have been one of the best moments  in all of DBZ if it wasn't in this shitstorm of the movie.Summary: So many plot holes, so many illogical decisions, but at least it had one good moment and that one good moment at least gave me something to remember in good spirit.As I said earlier Dragon Ball Z Movie: Broly Second Cumming earns 3/10 and it is the worst movie from the 1st 10 of DBZ movies, but unlike Bojack Unbound it has at least one moment, that held something special, but even that something special cannot save this

with videl she was not anoying or bad she just dindt fit in this movie becouse she cannot do anything against brolly and she was more of a person that gohan needs to savenow gotten and trunks ok here we go.they are the worst part about this movie they where cringe annoying stupid and where telling jokes talhat where not funny and seemed to be very forced.Ok now i will talk about...a segment of a battel against brolly when he woke up so goten an trunks fight him for a bit then they see a final dragon ball and they come up with the plan to ask a dragon to defeat brolly so trunks distracts him so goten can grab the ball so how did trunks distracts him ki blast moving fast punching him that would be good right but he starts name caling him and shows him his ass well that moment left me empty i know db is comedic to but when battle starts it gets serious.now goten part when he collects all dragon balls but do to his clumsiness he losses it  so you tell me that goten can take a puch from brolly but when a ball idk if its a perl or a rock who looks like a ball hit him in a head hes hurt i mean i understand its for comedic purpose it happend in dbz to like goku afraid of needless but its was of battel and good timed joke when it happed but this one was meh so the next part while trunks distracts him this time by fighting thank god gotten desides to take a piss sigh really was that needed in a battel where trunks might die becouse hes fighting against the enemy how hes beyond he\'s level he desides to take a piss ok so gotten finds a ball next part so trunks hides from brolly and fells ashamed for him self becouse hes a  saiyan you know this part i fought trunks will be motived to fight like a warrior like he\'s father but no he keeps hiding and you know what he wants to take a piss sight again  lets just move on so goten comes to trunks to say hes found them all so what do they do summon shenron right away no they come out to mock broly and say they defend him because they have shenron on they\'re side so goten goes to summon him in a cave very bright idea in a first place so he understands finally that shenron is a big dragon and needs to be summoned outside so goten goes outside on foot for some reason so brolly picks up trunks and starts breaking he\'s back so guess what happens next trunks pisses on brollys face ""face palm"" so brolly trow him down goten grabs him and they are trying to get away but brollys ki blast stops them so when brolly is about to hit critical blast gohan saves them well its best part of the movie when gohan shows up battel was good not the best but it holds up well animations where good and gohan uses the lava to defeat brolly at least he fought so so hes exhausted and he falls on the rock and falls asleep but krilin comes and picks him up so as expected brolly arise from lava then he knocks out krilin with one blast ""not really an achievement""the gohan continued fighting him until the bag that holds up the dragon balls rips and goten summoned shenron and wished goku back for a limited time then gohan blasted kamehame ha  goten joined him and then goku appears and joins them to and that kamehame ha was awesome one of the best parts to so they out power brolly and killed him and thats it then characters intaracted fo a while and movie ended so in conclusion. movie was mediocre its not the worst for 4 things animations gohan vs brolly soundtrack and the kamehame ha that ended the battle. so i would only recommend this for hardcore fans the fan base not really  if you read all of this thanks

made, but here we areBroly - Second Coming is about Jesus Christ. It\'s about the faith one needs to have in order to fight for the future, in order to protect those they love, and in order to achieve their highest strength. Goku is in this movie, more than anywhere else up until this point, a Christ-like figure. He manifests in spirit through the Dragon Balls, but also literally as ""our father who art in heaven"" in the climax. Much like...Broly, who returns from the dead, Goku returns as the messager of hope, only to leave again to the spirit realm but not before rekindling in his offspring the sense of hope he inspired in lifeBroly, who in here is analogous to Satan (not Mr. Satan, just Satan), is defeated when the Father, the Son(s), and the Holy Spirit (Shen Long) unite and form the triple Kamehameha, the Holy Energy Wave Trinity.I really wasn\'t expecting this type of stuff from the Broly sequel movie, but aside from this spiritual subtext I also appreciate the complete detachment from the recap formula, and how it doesn\'t feel the need to even exist within the main set of characters and places so common to the Z sagas.Hot take this movie rules.

Dragon Ball Movie 1: Shen Long no Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/502/Dragon_Ball_Movie_1__Shen_Long_no_Densetsu,"['Having seen this movie, I now understand why the Dragon Ball movie ""The Path to Power"" (which I watched before this one) is labelled as an ""alternative version"" to the beginning of Dragon Ball - it essentially does the same thing as this movie, but went about it in a different way. Both of them bring some of the core characters of the franchise: Goku, Bulma, the turtle guy and the pig etc (these guys don\'t even need names to be honest). The production seems to be higher for this movie, as the animation looks clearer, but this could be because I watched a lower...quality version of the other movie. The cast isn\'t too bad overall, I\'ve definitely seen a lot worse. On the positive side of the fence, Goku is a likeable character with all his innocence. On the negative side there\'s Bulma, who is quite annoying with her stereotypical ""annoying highschool girl"" voice and attitude.My comments for ""Curse of the Blood Rubies"" is mostly the same as the ones for ""The Path to Power"". They share the same dodgy voice acting (along with the rest of the Dragon Ball franchise), and the same mediocre animation and character designs (again, along with the rest of the franchise). What\'s more, just like ""The Path to Power"", this movie is also a cut above the average Dragon Ball movie because it puts commendable effort into the story so is not completely centered around the fighting. The result is a vaguely interesting adventure story with battles that doesn\'t drag on and on and on. Compared to ""The Path of Power"", the story is actually not quite as good. However, overall, I rate this movie slightly higher because the other one gets dragged down by the inappropriate fan service, whilst this movie is more friendly to the targeted audience due to lack of fan service, so just about manage to keep its head above the 6/10 threshold (which is equivalent to like a 9 or 10 relative to other Dragon Ball movies). quality version of the other movie.

I've also looked at two films associated with it: Fusion Reborn & Battle of Gods. This time, we're going to kick off film festival week with a look at one of the Dragonball era films, Legend of Shenron. It originally aired in late 1986. Yes, the same year that Dragonball itself started airing. So, let's see how it compares to the others we've looked at.Story:We open with soldiers destroying buildings and fields while terrorising the citizens in order to mine rich stones. Clearly, the most creative name for valuable stones ever. We then cut...to a pair of the soldiers meeting with the king. He stays in the shadows, but still manages to look grotesque. He orders them to find the rest of the dragon balls. We then cut to the beginning of Dragonball. Yeah, the whole scene where Goku goes out to catch a fish and then bumps into Bulma, mistaking her vehicle for a monster. There is, however, a difference. In this one, his dragon ball is stolen by the king's stooges, forcing him to go with Bulma and give chase.Therein lies the biggest issue with this film. About half the running time is devoted to reiterating different scenes from the series proper with only minor differences. Except that the series proper took its time with them and gave you time to acclimate to the major characters they had before introducing you to more whereas this film throws one encounter after another at you. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the idea was to bring in new viewers to the anime. The problem is they don't give you enough about these characters to make them worth your time. If, on the other hand, this is for fans of the series then it shouldn't be repeating all this information. Sure, there are differences but it's also a lot of wasted time that could be better devoted to fleshing out the film's narrative. Which gets pretty rushed when you factor out the repetitive scenes. The humour in this is also pretty mediocre. You get some funny scenes, but you also get comedic moments that represent the worst of Dragonball's jokes. IE: Muten Roshi and Oolong are perverts and a urine joke.Characters:Honestly, the characters are recognisable. You aren't going to look at Goku, Roshi, Yamch, Bulma or Oolong and think that they're out of character. That being said, the film doesn't do a good job of conveying the charm that the cast had, overall, in the series proper. Most of these characters get a quick introduction and hen don't do all that much. There's almost no reason for Yamcha & Pu'ar to be in this at all. It's very much focused on Goku & Bulma. The main antagonists are pretty dull. They're basically equivalent, in terms of characterisation, to the villains who show up for one episode of the show and get beaten with ease.Art:The artwork is pretty much on par with the artwork in the series proper. The backgrounds can be sparse but the character designs are nicely done and distinctive. The action scenes are well done. Actually, the best action sequence in the film might be an aerial dogfight with actual planes. Which is odd for something Dragonball related. The climactic sequence, in contrast, is kind of weak.Sound:The vocal cast is just as strong as they were in the series proper. Tsuru Hiromi, Nozawa Masako and Furuya Toru all deliver fine performances. Koyama Mami is also in this, although she's playing the villainous pasta rather than Lunch. Suzuki Tomoko takes a break from voicing random young girls in supporting roles to voice Pansy, a young girl who needs help. The music is also the same type you get in the main series. It's pretty good.Ho-yay:There really isn't any.Final Thoughts:So, that's Legend of Shenron, the first film in the Dragonball franchise. It's not very good. It suffers a lot from its need to reintroduce characters, presumably for new audiences, at the expense of the film's narrative. If you're a big Dragonball fan, you might enjoy it regardless but, for myself, I give it a 4/10. It's weak, but not bad.

You understand they cannot logically happen, but still enjoy them. This movie is a retelling of the first arc of Dragon Ball. It's not just a shortened down version of the television series. It takes tons of liberties with characters and progression points.With non-canonical movies you can enjoy them because they are their own thing. This isn't it's own thing though. It's just a worse version of the television series. The story moves to fast and no one really develops. The villain barely gets enough air time. The finale...is mediocre.

This is classic DragonBall with the addition of a look at the political and economic concerns of the time this piece was created. Observing the various references to fear of Industrialisation we see the Japanese rural perspective on the changes going through their country post-WW2. To see it in anime form is both surreal and fascinating to an educated person. Don't misunderstand me, it is in no way like Princess Mononoke, but it serves to be a very entertaining way to reintroduce the characters of...Dragonball.Also, I highly encourage you to listen to this with headphones, the sound of this anime is surprisingly spot-on, even by DBZ standards.Another praise I have for this piece is that because of its time restraint it doesn't drag on (no pun intended) like the main series does in many aspects. It gets right to the point and it makes it extremely enjoyable to experience.

Shen Long no Densetsu. or Curse of the Blood Rubies is the first one, and it is fast and furious. The movie is only 51 minutes, and the next two are shorter.First, the characters are normal, unchanging rocks. Goku shows almost no emotions other than happiness and confusion. The other characters are pale and stiff.The story is that there\'s an evil king that rules over a land searching for Blood Gems or whatever they are. Their...military steals Goku\'s Dragon Ball, and from there, the story begins to converge from the official Dragon Ball timeline.  According to the DB encyclopedia, it is an alternate timeline. The ending is nice, but the rest of the story is simply brushed over. The pacing is incredibly fast, and it was over before I expected it.The art\'s great; Especially Kame-sennin\'s Kamehameha, which causes all the ships to blow up. A younger me would say, ""Whoah!"" and I would definitely agree.If you are trying to watch every second of DB, then watch after finishing the anime, as it is interesting to see another version of the story.

However, I wouldn\'t recommend this for anyone else.', 'The animation while more fluid than the TV anime isn\'t anything to write home about, none of the movie original characters really matter nor do they do much except for the start and the end. It is the first movie of the franchise so I suppose the overall sort of ""clumsy"" feeling that it gives you makes sense, as it is very clearly not a movie meant to be watched in the current year or ever again.The story is a loose ""what if?"" recap of the very first arc. Instead of the Pilaf gang we are introduced to this weird demon guy and his very...boring goons, which are more competent that Shu and Mai, this is a negative.The Pilaf gang was never meant to be seen as actual obstacles and instead existed for what the series was at the start, gags. Their failures and overall pathetic nature was funny and charming, if you take away their fuck ups the goons just become boring tough guys with equally boring scenes. It doesn\'t help that we don\'t learn anything about these characters, making it difficult to get invested in the antagonists of the film. It tries to make up for it by giving the audience more action, but just like the animation it looks nice but isn\'t all that impressive or different from what you would see in the TV anime.Same goes for the new movie original character who was (sorta) part of the main crew, none of the scenes with her were funny and instead she just existed to drive the plot along, something which Bulma does in the original series but in a more entertaining way. I couldn\'t even remember her name because she was so forgettable and I can\'t be bothered to google it right now.Goku has little to no focus. We get good moments with Bulma and Yamcha, but Goku gets little to no time to shine. The same goes for Puar, Roshi and Oolong, but at the time of the story they were minor characters anyhow.Goku is the MAIN character, why the fuck does Yamcha get better scenes and more focus in the first movie than the actual main lead? No hate to Yamcha fans, but this decision just does not make sense to me. With Bulma it\'s fine as she\'s the main heroine and the second lead, but even in the OG series Yamcha\'s role becomes incredibly minor. Having him get a bigger role than Goku just...baffles me.Finally my biggest issue with this movie, the pacing. Everything feels way too fast as they rush from story beat to story beat with little to no time to relax and they redo scenes from the original but in a way more loose and less impactful way. It makes sense as this movie isn\'t even an hour long so they have to rush it but oh my goodness SLOW DOWN.Yeah it\'s just not very good. boring goons, which are more competent that Shu and Mai, this is a negative.The Pilaf gang was never meant to be seen as actual obstacles and instead existed for what the series was at the start, gags.

It tries to make up for it by giving the audience more action, but just like the animation it looks nice but isn\'t all that impressive or different from what you would see in the TV anime.Same goes for the new movie original character who was (sorta) part of the main crew, none of the scenes with her were funny and instead she just existed to drive the plot along, something which Bulma does in the original series but in a more entertaining way. I couldn\'t even remember her name because she was so forgettable and I can\'t be bothered to google it right now.Goku has little to no focus. We get good moments with Bulma and Yamcha, but Goku gets little to no time to shine. The same goes for Puar, Roshi and Oolong, but at the time of the story they were minor characters anyhow.Goku is the MAIN character, why the fuck does Yamcha get better scenes and more focus in the first movie than the actual main lead? No hate to Yamcha fans, but this decision just does not make sense to me. With Bulma it\'s fine as she\'s the main heroine and the second lead, but even in the OG series Yamcha\'s role becomes incredibly minor. Having him get a bigger role than Goku just...baffles me.Finally my biggest issue with this movie, the pacing. Everything feels way too fast as they rush from story beat to story beat with little to no time to relax and they redo scenes from the original but in a way more loose and less impactful way. It makes sense as this movie isn\'t even an hour long so they have to rush it but oh my goodness SLOW DOWN.Yeah it\'s just not very good.', 'Dragon Ball: The Curse of the Blood Rubies, also known as The Legend of Shenlong, is a non-canonical retelling of the first arc in the Dragon Ball anime/manga, and that happens to be its main flaw.Due to starting from the same point where the anime and manga began, the movie has to introduce the main cast. The problem is, while this process took approximately seven episodes in the source material, this movie is only an hour long.The result is that the first half of this movie feels incredibly rushed; things happen at a lightning quick pace, and some events feel like they were put...in solely to make people go ""ooh, it\'s that moment from the show!"", with little to no regards for the pacing of the movie itself.Once the introductions are done and over with, however, the movie becomes much more enjoyable. With worries about the runtime out of the way, the writers can focus on just writing our lovable cast interacting with each other and the setting, and it really is a blast.The animation in the movie is stellar. Aside from a few select scenes, everything is very fluid and alive, and matches the mood of the source material.The soundtrack is nothing special if you\'ve seen the anime; it\'s the same soundtrack ported over. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, considering the anime\'s soundtrack was very good!Much like the soundtrack, the main cast is simply ported over from the source, which is still not a bad thing; they may not be complex, but they\'re a fun bunch, and they\'re really what makes the final act of this movie so enjoyable. Although, certain characters feel wholly unnecessary to the story, and could have been cut out entirely, which would have helped the pacing issues.For what it\'s worth, the antagonists manage to have a lot more personality than you\'d expect. They\'re still not all that memorable, especially Bongo, resident ""big muscly guy"", but Pasta and the main villain himself, Gurumes are decent enough.If you\'re a fan of Dragonball and you have about an hour of free time, this movie is not a bad choice to watch. The first half may be terribly paced, and many scenes will feel like they\'re only there because the writers thought ""well, we can\'t leave this scene out"", but it\'s still very well animated, and the second half is just a fun romp with the characters you know and love. That said, you probably won\'t be raring to see this movie a second or third time anytime soon. in solely to make people go ""ooh, it\'s that moment from the show!"", with little to no regards for the pacing of the movie itself.Once the introductions are done and over with, however, the movie becomes much more enjoyable.

Isso também pode ser interpretado como uma maneira de atrair o público para consumir a obra original, e acaba sendo um filme bem prático nesse quesito.Fora o filme ter um roteiro copiado, o vilão final é bem decepcionante para um primeiro filme de Dragon Ball, todas as outras lutas são interessantes e talvez sejam tão boas por serem copiadas, porque, quase tudo de original nesse filme não é tão bom quanto os conceitos originais da obra já aplicados no filme.As consequências...são praticamente inexistentes para os vilões do filme, eu consigo até pensar que a trama principal possua uma mensagem bonita, mas sinto que é uma mensagem efetuada de maneira rasa por não ser mais aprofundada.Dragon Ball é uma das coisas mais nostálgicas que eu conheço e reviver esses personagens é algo bem aconchegante de certa forma. A comédia é realmente boa e disso eu não tenho do que reclamar. são praticamente inexistentes para os vilões do filme, eu consigo até pensar que a trama principal possua uma mensagem bonita, mas sinto que é uma mensagem efetuada de maneira rasa por não ser mais aprofundada.Dragon Ball é uma das coisas mais nostálgicas que eu conheço e reviver esses personagens é algo bem aconchegante de certa forma.

There is nothing going on, and the ending is just anticlimactic. The first 30 minutes is just introducing characters & a very boring plot. The story is just half adaptation, and half originality, and is never unique to its kind. The only things that were interesting were the art style, and some of the new voice actors. Characters are just flat the entire story, and while some comedy appears, it lasts for a whole five minutes. Dragon Ball has action, gags, and suspense.

Deatte 5-byou de Battle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43814/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle,"[""The survival game genre feels like a disease that just doesn't seem to go away these days. Sure, they're not as popular in the anime medium compared to the video game industry. Yet, some of them still lands a spot on television. One of them is called Battle Game in 5 Seconds.Now I could argue that the anime industry has been dominated by the isekai trope in recent years. But once in awhile, there's an anime about survival games. Battle Game in 5 Seconds was chosen to be adapted into a 12-episode anime series despite the manga having over 17 volumes and ongoing. Yes, it...would for whatever reason, they wanted to showcase an anime about superpowers that draws the line between fiction and reality. And it all begins with protagonist Akira Shiroyanagi.Akira isn't your typical protagonist as he is protrayed as a prodigy. He's quick to learn on his feet and has a calm composure despite being thrown into a death game along with others. From the first episode, it became clear that Akira isn't a pushover or someone that can easily be intimidated. To add on to his character attributes, he's also got a clever mind and takes full advantage of his ability, the Sophist. With strategic thinking, it became obvious that Akira possesses intelligence beyond his age. When you have a character thrown into a survival game with all these traits, it makes Akira a key figure to watch out for, both for his allies and enemies.The rest of the character roster consists a wide range of backgrounds. Among the most prominent is Yuri Amagake, a 17 year old girl with a history of bad luck. And by adding her to show, it really brings in the question how much value she can contribute. To be honest, she's one of the most normal characters in the show with a rather abnormal ability (Wrath of God). It would appear the anime wants to show how a misfortunate girl can fight against bad luck and be who she is. However, the anime does a poor job at developing her character beyond the surface level. She's just too normal, with really nothing unique to describe about her.With those two out of the way, the rest of the character roster starts to stray from normalcy. For instance, the seductive Rin Kashii is introduced in one of the team battles that shows her manipulative nature. Shin, the quiet giant, is protrayed as an enemy of injustice. We also meet the delinquent Madoka who never lets anyone or anything gets in his way. But perhaps the most unusual among the cast is the catgirl, Mion. She plays the role of the administrator for the survival games. And believe me, she's about as cruel as a character can get in the show. Unfortunately, the anime doesn't adequately develop or reveal her true purpose. It's up to the viewers to decide on why she exists and what she truly wants to put all these characters into survival games with their lives on the line. Yes, that is the main drawback of the show. It seems the anime just drops everything to suddenly and expect us to be invested into the story.Meanwhile, the anime also appears to forgot or never really wanted to develop its character cast this season. Besides Aki and Yuri, most of the characters in the show are overshadowed by them. The overemphasis on Aki's goal as well as the survival theme itself tarnishes the legacy of this show. Given the survival game context, they should at least try to make one other character in the anime more memorable besides our two leading protagonists. Even for the two main leads, their character development is limited and for what's worth, very underwhelming. That it say, this show can easily be described by one word....underwhelming.Looking back, I never felt the show was visually appealing from the very start. There's obviously some violence and action given the themes of the series. However, nothing else really stood out whether it's the character designs, settings, or even the backgrounds. Somehow, they made a talking cat-like girl the most distinctive character in the series. While you could say the anime isn't about the art, it certainly deosn't enhance the overall viewing experience. Studios SynergySP and Vega Entertainment need to step it up.Battle Game in 5 Seconds took a hit for the team and I don't mean that as a compliment. It means it took a hit for itself by creating an underwhelming story with an equally underwhelming cast. With a manga running over 17 volumes, this served little more than an advertisement. It practically wants you to throw money at the franchise. Do yourself a favor and save your money.

I haven't read the manga and I came in with absolutely no expectations just hoping for a show that would pass the time. Man it didn't disappoint.Keep in mind I extremely enjoyed Darwins Game and this season is practically identical to it and it has kept me intrigued this whole time. So from the very start of this series I immediately enjoyed the series. The story is very similar to that of darwins game with people gaining random powers in order to survive the events that are taking place. It's a pretty cliché story but it's one that I tend...to enjoy quite a lot no matter how much it has been repeated.Story 7Mc is cold but kind at the same time so I like him.

Most shows in this genre usually turns out to be god awful from the start, or has a decent beginning but crashes and burns in the end. So when I saw a new death game anime in this season, my immediate reaction was “Not another one” a saying DJ Khaled would be really offended by. But I’m honestly surprised to see this show hold up pretty well, enough to get me to watch the whole thing, start to finish…or it did at first. Does that mean it’s great? No, not really.The...premise is pretty straight forward like most death games. Kill or be killed situations, surviving a platoon of super powered people and be the last man standing. It starts off with a giant, 8 foot crocodile ass looking man attacking our mc. Our mc manages to escape his assault and trap him in an abandoned building and manages to kill him. A bit unrealistic, as the more typical reaction would be to shit your pants when you’re attacked by a large menacing figure than to go full Tom Cruise mission impossible on the guy. He then proceeds to get transported by an overtly annoying cat girl with a top hat, and brought into the death game, where he’s given the full explanation of things. Sort off at least.The remainder of the story we see our mc in various fights and precarious situations. The premise is straightforward and not gunna lie kinda boring. The death battle genre is one that I rarely like, but even without personal dislike, it doesn’t have any uniqueness to it, or any factor that sets itself apart or grabs your attention. The powers and in this show feels unrealistic in the sense that there’s so much flexibility in them. There’s no borderline for how overtly unusual powers could be, and since we as viewers are in the dark about several rules of the game, it gets frustrating to see one dumb power coming out of nowhere. There’s no balance in that sense which leaves you confused and kinda annoyed.You feel a slight repetitiveness in the shows storytelling. It revolves around a problem being created, mc using his intelligence to solve the problem, everyone else losing their shit tryna figure out how he did it. There’s no opposing force, there’s no “L” to our mcs “Light”. This sets up a rly plain sailing plot with no added tension or suspense. You see a situation occur but you already know it’s going to get resolved with no added consequences. Although, I was dumb to expect proper storytelling in a death game so it’s honestly bad on my endThe best part of the show is the mc. Most death games either have a mc who’s a complete whiny annoying character who’s scared shitless all the time, or someone who’s over confident, unusually strong and has will smith I am legend levels of smartness and survival tactics. The mc here is minimally intelligent and knows how to use his intelligence properly. He dosent have the whole “I can beat you, cause my friends are relying on me” bullshit. He knows a serious fight, plans ahead, and uses his brain to win rather than the friendship rocket launcher. His power compliments his intelligence a lot, which is one of my fav aspects of the show. Since it’s so vague what his power actually is, it gives him the liberty of experimenting and slowly figuring out the limits of his abilities, which is quite entertaining to watch.Other characters such as Ruri is a recurring presence in the show. She’s a girl with a troubled past, due to lack of parental affection, and she finds solace in caring for her little brother. She has a decent backstory but we don’t see that implemented into her character that much. She’s always cheery, active and loud. We rarely see her past effecting her personality. It would have been refreshing to see her all quiet and anti-social initially, but Akira helps her come out of her shell and makes her bright and cheery.We also have Walmart Bakugo, blue haired Joe Exotic, nerdy gamer girl, manipulating red head milf and a lot more. There’s an abundance of characters but all of them are super generic and extremely forgettable. They have their own parts to play but feel more like an NPC out of Skyrim than an actual character. The villain has the classic “Im the bad guy, I’ll kill everyone” look and leads the gang green gang of annoying misfits. The only character that’s remotely decent is the glasses guy that looks like he’s paid the subscription for every Onlyfans model in existence. His cunningness is somewhat amusing to watch in the last arc of the show. Besides that, forgettable, generic, annoying side characters.But we all know the best character is the banana head manThe art in this show is not consistent. It starts off with a fairly vibrant art style, which was one of the things that made me curious about the show. But as more time passes, you notice CGI being used in most places. And if you’re wondering yes the CGI is horrible, almost comical. Im really wishy washy about CG in anime. When it’s well done, it’s actually pleasant to watch, like Beastars. When it’s awful, or combined with animation, it feels disgusting, like an unholy amalgamation of good and evil. It’s like oil and water, it just doesn’t mix. That’s the long term problem in this show, as even main characters start getting CG’d more often than animated. The fight scenes also has more CG than animation in the later parts, and most parts are covered with flashy lights, big explosions or smokescreens to avoid putting effort into their show. Like bruhhh, if a show that has “Battle” in the title dosent have its fight scenes properly animated, it begs the question “what is your budget going towards?” Characters also have their rough times, with disproportional facial animations that makes them look like something outta Resident Evil, and not even the good Resi games, like some shit outta Resi 6.Not going into details about the sound. OSTs are fine, OP & ED was fine, and voice acting was generic yet well done. Although the cat girl was super annoying, like enough to make my ear drums bleed levels of annoying.Even with its amplitude of flaws, I honestly think it’s one of the better death games out there. It’s not a good show, but it out runs its predecessors in most factors which is something I can appreciate. It was more like a rocky ride than a constant downhill that I felt watching Darwins Game. The mc is the highlight of the show, and outshines most characters and was the only reason I came back to the show weekly. Fun show overall. premise is pretty straight forward like most death games.

Fun show overall.', ""So, to keep it short, the dynamic of the show was: bad premise, quite good continuation, and gradually getting worse second half. Despite having one of the most stereotypical and bad premises out of there (and also character introductions), the following episodes got way better and actually interesting, only for the growth to be completely thrown out of a window later, with the story becoming stagnant, typical, and boring. The characters don't really help either, not even the interesting back stories being able to save the show. The fact that it loses its realistic factor, that made the characters feel human, only makes it completely...ruined.The story starts with an arrogant loner gamer boy that's extremely intelligent and thinks other people are not worth his time (that's definitely the first time we hear of this, right?) getting attacked on the street by a buff mummy that gets out of a car right in front of him and starts chasing him. Luckily, because he's smart and an ace at playing games (including startegy games), he manages to defeat him, and a quircky evil catgirl with a high picthed voice abducts him. Where does she take him? In a room full of people where she explains that they are part of a game now and were granted super powers. A set of games, to be precise, with more stages, that put their lives on the line. Pretty basic and used so many times before, isn't it? But here comes the good part: our (male) MC's super power. That's where it starts to get better.Unfortunately, the good part ends when we have to watch a single stage of the game go on for half of the episodes and it becomes all just a mind game that should have been impossible, actually. It has a little supsense, but not enough and it loses part of its meaning anyway, but I'll stop here for the sake of not giving that many spoilers. Point is, in my opinion the focus in the second half wasn't on what it should have been to make it a good show.Oh, and the characters. Aside the annoying male MC that I already described, (that gets a little more tolerable after a bit but still could have been a little more original), that has the typical appearance of a brown haired boy with brown eyes as well, we have the female MC that looks exactly like Rei (Highschool of the Dead) and has pretty much the same personality. Her backstory was pretty interesting and her character is tolerable, but her design kinda pisses me off tbh. There are also some interesting characters, and their backstories are pretty interesting most of the time (even for the more boring ones).To top it off, at the end the animation gets pretty bad on some parts (around episodes 11-12), especially when it comes to fighting scenes and one particular character, where the CCG is pretty obvious and doesn't fit well with the rest of the animation.The sound is okay, the sound track not exactly what I would listen to. However, I'd say the ED went especially good with the anime.Well, that's pretty much all I had to say. Too bad it had to go like this, the anime had potential at some point. ruined.The story starts with an arrogant loner gamer boy that's extremely intelligent and thinks other people are not worth his time (that's definitely the first time we hear of this, right?) getting attacked on the street by a buff mummy that gets out of a car right in front of him and starts chasing him.

Point is, in my opinion the focus in the second half wasn't on what it should have been to make it a good show.Oh, and the characters. Aside the annoying male MC that I already described, (that gets a little more tolerable after a bit but still could have been a little more original), that has the typical appearance of a brown haired boy with brown eyes as well, we have the female MC that looks exactly like Rei (Highschool of the Dead) and has pretty much the same personality. Her backstory was pretty interesting and her character is tolerable, but her design kinda pisses me off tbh. There are also some interesting characters, and their backstories are pretty interesting most of the time (even for the more boring ones).To top it off, at the end the animation gets pretty bad on some parts (around episodes 11-12), especially when it comes to fighting scenes and one particular character, where the CCG is pretty obvious and doesn't fit well with the rest of the animation.The sound is okay, the sound track not exactly what I would listen to. However, I'd say the ED went especially good with the anime.Well, that's pretty much all I had to say. Too bad it had to go like this, the anime had potential at some point."", 'This will be one of my first reviews so I\'ll be blunt and the reviews may contain spoilers. The anime tells how our protagonist Shiroyanagi Akira and other individuals find themselves in this classroom with a mysterious character who explains what happened after losing outside the room (this is a guess that he takes as ""proof"" what happened to the MC) and after killing a person and explaining the situation each player is taken to their respective rooms to reflect on what to do and to understand how their superpower works and also to test it. It all comes in a mysterious way and in...that place killing is an option, the thing that intrigues me is the upcoming challenges and how the MC and other people will deal with them. I like the drawings and later MAYBE we could see the MC backstory. The anime does not stand out for its originality because a similar anime is released in 2019 entitled The Ones Within with almost the same mechanics but with cryptic characters. I recommend it for those who like anime in which the intellect is the winning factor and for those who like characters with superpowers. that place killing is an option, the thing that intrigues me is the upcoming challenges and how the MC and other people will deal with them.

One day when he was out and about he got attacked by a mysterious humanoid. Keeping his cool and using his intellect and love of games, he manages to kill it. As a reward he gets killed.He wakes up, fully healed, in a mysterious place, surrounded by other people, where a sociopathic catgirl declares that everyone there was chosen to...be a part of a game. They are given powers and force to take part in fights. Now… no one tells explicitly that people have to kill each other but let’s be honest, it wouldn't be a survival show if everyone played nice. And so our not likely hero finds himself in a death game and it turns out he takes pleasure in being there. Even if he doesn’t admit it out right.To be honest there are only two characters in this show I actually gave a damn about. They are:Akira Shiroyanagi - our MC. A 16 year old high schooler who is bored to death. When we meet him he contemplates finding a new game to play and immerse himself in. Well… be careful what You wish for. He ends up in a death game and has to fight to survive.His intelligent, knowledgeable about sociotechnics (although the show never calls them that for some reason) and able to keep a cool head. Unlike most anime protagonists he has something that could be considered a seed of personality. He’s not a Goody Two Shoes and doesn’t let others push him around. But that’s about it. His main drawback is that he talks a lot. Specifically about what he has done to conquer his opponent. Instead of keeping quiet he just has to brag, and his bragging is cringe af. The fact that most of his plans work is thanks to the fact that he has plot armour thicker than a bowl of oatmeal makes him annoying at times.He has one of the most interesting powers I’ve seen in a survival game genre. His power is… anything that the other person believes him to have. Pretty cool idea. Shame it’s not utilised more creatively.Mion - a sadistic, violence loving, cheerful and weirdly sexy cat girl. She appears to be the host of the death games. Having a weird obsession with Akira, she watches him diligently and even sometimes intervenes to help the kid out. Something totally out of character for someone who gets off on violence and death. Yes, she’s a side character but she’s far more interesting than the “love” (and I use this term loosely) interest of the MC.Seriously, Yuuri Amagake is pretty boring as a character. It appears she develops a crush on Akira after just one joint venture. She has one of the most OP powers in the show, only eclipsed by the MCs power. She can multiply her physical abilities by a factor of five.Let’s be honest the survival game genre doesn’t exactly have much room for innovation. You take some people, give them some kind of power or gear to make things interesting and just let them go to town. The main way that these kind of shows keep You invested are the way it handles fights between the competitors and the characters themselves.One of those is handled… adequate. The second one… yeah… mediocre at best.When it comes to fight choreography… yeah… 90% of the time it’s bad. Not horrendous but bad. Despite having some awesome powers to play and make them fight each other, most of the fights are really generic. Either the fight is over in seconds because someone has a skill that can kill or incapacitate his enemy in an instant, or we get the same boring shit that we’ve seen a million times - screaming, running and waving weapons without a real plan. Even when we get to see a fight between two swordsmen who have the same skill we still don’t get a proper fight. It’s… disappointing. The fact that some powers are more common than others doesn’t help.The writers got lazy pretty fast. I think episode 3. Instead of finding creative ways for Akira to make use of his powers he just uses the fact that most people know that he has one power and uses that. It makes his fights predictable and boring pretty fast. I get that he fights trash mobs mostly but that’s still not a reason to get complacent with the plot. As long as there is someone who knows that he can use a canon power he can just “tap” into that person (even if it’s an ally) and just shoot the place up. It gets old pretty fast.The characters aren’t much to write home about but their interactions are pretty fun to watch. The inner monologues in Akiras head give a sense of secrecy, suspense and importance and watching people trying to guess each other's powers and how to get an upper hand in a fight isn’t as tragic as I was afraid of. The problem is that those kind of mind games are reserved for… 2 fights in the whole show.Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that, despite being in a death game, a lot of people just trust him and tell him things they really should keep to themselves. Even when the leader of a faction he joins is wary of him he is still trusted enough to fight alongside their members. Pretty irresponsible.At the end of the day this show isn’t a tragic one. The interactions between the characters can be fun to watch and moments when Akira manipulates others are pretty entertaining. Even if a lot of those “manipulations” are pure ass pull and some are done retroactively.It can be enjoyable if You don’t have high standards for writing. be a part of a game.

The strength of each character is quite unique. The battle scenes in this anime rely on strategy so I don't get bored while watching them. The opening song in this anime is a banger. For the ending song, I think it's normal and nothing special. What makes this anime less good is the animation that looks stiff and lacks detail so that the battle scenes that should be epic and exciting are now ordinary. Perhaps this is due to rushed...production and short deadlines. What a pity production and short deadlines. What a pity"", 'What makes a good battle royale show? Is it the story of where and how it all started? Is it the crew of characters that each and everyone of them have their wishes fulfilled? Or is it...a death game where if you die, you\'re dead forever both in-game and IRL (like in SAO)? For Deatte 5-byou de Battle a.k.a Battle Game in 5 seconds, truly in 5 seconds, you\'ll come to see that this show is just purely ""All according to Keikaku."" the Animation in all of its average drabness across the entire anime\'s run.Death-perception game shows are nothing new in this day and age,...the most recent example being of last year\'s Darwin\'s Game, and that by itself is a fast and frenetic death game that doesn\'t take its sweet ass time to develop the settings and such. It just infodumps you right in without any explanation, and does it only after the fact. Think of Hunter X Hunter in the early stages, but there are notable differences across the board once you can start putting two and two together. Deatte 5-byou does just that, but for some reason, executes it a whole lot worse with mangaka Saizou Harawata\'s writing that does start decently, until it goes straight into ""Battle Royale"" mode which is a blatant copy-and-paste tactic that fails to measure up to Darwin\'s Game in both the predictable story and the forced plot (I\'ll leave the animation part later on).The ""Light Yagami"" of this story is the MC Akira Shiroyanagi, the self-proclaimed smart gamer with an ailing health, and that\'s all he does: play games each and everyday without a care in the world. Just suddenly, a bandaged buff-lord man etches out of a vehicle, catching this 16-year-olf boy by total surprise and having to evade death in 5 seconds. Being someone who\'s totally out of league in this death battle in both power and physique, Akira just manages to escape at the slightest shave, but yet could not evade death by getting killed from this catgirl loli Mion. In comes this gaming experiment of a death game, and this protagonist (just like Darwin\'s Game\'s MC Kaname Suou) more than being forced and hauled into this, vows to destroy this organization for taking his (and others) lives hostage for their fun.You want to know how bad Deatte 5-byou de Battle can be? Here are the facts:Aside from coming in with the notion that I (and some of you) have watched Darwin\'s Game before, I just can\'t shake the fact that the characters are written TOO simple, more than just having 2 essential things: a goal/objective to get out of this death game, and a personality that lets us be sympathetic to their backstories, no matter how depressing they can be. For one, taking the protag Akira by example, he\'s just a stone cold-faced boy who tries to act and sound mature, but at times feel disconnected by his actions and words that are meant to be a play on his character. Being the big brain-er of a strategist, you would at least expect him to have some humanity, but nope, he\'s just a human with a robotized brain. At least the other main character who\'s standing toe-to-toe with him (Yuuri Amakage) exhibits the human trait, but I just can\'t help if the author decides to have a fetish that a boy-girl pairing is a must not only in close calls of trusted camaraderie, instead inciting the hints of romance as well (which there\'re some). The other characters are a complete joke.The superpowers (or abilities rather) given...are a complete Darwin\'s Game rip-off. Each and everyone has unique abilities that are only secret to their own unless they decide to tag team and share it across with allies, but even to the point of Akira\'s ability, none of them have the coolness factor of said series that are just subservience to service the plot. I mean, just to give you an idea, Akira\'s ability is the Sophist: ""Whatever your opponent thinks your power is."" which definitely means that there\'re lots of possibilities to experiment with it. Sadly, it\'s as best as what you\'d think: for example if Akira can <insert your guesses here>, then he will exhibit that according to your POV. It only is a one-trick pony to play Survivor through a death game that requires battle wit, brawls and even brains just to keep your allies alive for your ultimate use. In the end, it\'s everyone for themselves.There\'s the abominable animation, which is the biggest sin of this show. Why in the world would you want to produce a modern-day show when it looks like it came from more than a decade ago? For context, putting this in comparison with the classic Initial D, the first season aged very badly, but subsequent seasons did have better production values that gave the series justice. Compare that to Deatte 5-byou, and I\'d reckon that it came out in the mid-2000s with old studios SynergySP (which did Initial D 5th and Final Stages that looked even worse than Studio Gallop\'s 1st Stage) and Vega Entertainment (which their last work was the IMO abominable 2005 OVA Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru). Studio A-CAT handles the CGI portion because these 2 studios didn\'t have the capacity to do that for a modern touch, and it\'s the same thus far I\'ve seen of badly produced works done. Putting all of that together, and ""OK boomer"" fans that had this show as their first taste of a battle royale...I\'d be like Steve Carrell playing The Office\'s Michael Scott to shout ""No God, Please No!"".I have no sympathy for the music either, because while it fits the themes of this show, it quickly become white noise to me. For one, the OP which was VA Akari Kitou\'s like what, 2nd or 3rd solo, Tonikaku Kawaii\'s OP is a certified banger, but Deatte 5-byou\'s OP just instantly made me think that she CAN act, but she CANNOT sing solo. Thank god for other shows she has done before with others that mask her nice voice though. And also, I\'m not the biggest fan of Seiko Oomori, and this ear-blasting ED is a sentiment that only cuts deep to give my ears a good bleeding. Just so bad.Bring all of these facts with a production team that clearly does not have the experience or talent to back it up (and honestly, having series composer Touko Machida is a foresight that shows will fail under her supervision). With the pacing of the anime faster than the hare can outrun the tortoise, and Deatte 5-byou de Battle is a show that for the Average Joe who, in the words of a good friend: like battle-shounen that pretends to be deep, this might be what you are looking for. Other than that, there is hardly anything unique about this manga. Perhaps, I have been hoping to see something much better than that. So my advice to you is to start reading it, hoping to watch just an average anime. That way, you might enjoy it.As for me, the prelim reviews are a complete troll of a joke to say that y\'all clearly helped people to give Deatte 5-byou a try, but have only your opinions to back it up without years of experience, so why make reviews that are clickbait, algorithm-worthy when clearly the final product shown proves otherwise? (Alright, alright, I\'m kidding, but this show is NOT worth higher than a 7.) This show is just average overall, and now I have to go re-watch Darwin\'s Game again just to refresh my brains of this wack material. It\'s not pathetic to the point where some will like it, and you do you, but it just is a pain to watch this from start to finish. the most recent example being of last year\'s Darwin\'s Game, and that by itself is a fast and frenetic death game that doesn\'t take its sweet ass time to develop the settings and such.

In this anime, each person is given a unique power and they have to undergo a series of challenges for an unspecified reason. I'm very interested in seeing what the main character can do considering his interesting power, so I will be looking forward to each of the new episodes.Not sure how many episodes this can be, but from the looks of it, this is the type of show where either a lot will go wrong and...the plot will have too many holes in it, or the ending will be pretty interesting.

In any case, I will be watching the full series and for now I have enjoyed it, so I will rate this show as 7 - Good for now.On a side note, this show seems to not be very popular, maybe due to the two animation studios working on it not being very popular or maybe the manga itself isn't very popular.

I find myself in these types of situations often, and I'm glad they made a show to reflect that part of my experience. I think the story flowed naturally and had an interesting, unique chronological structure. If Quentin Tarantino directed an anime, this would have to be it. The story does have its shortcomings, especially with ability limitations. For example, how come Akira doesn't ask Yuri to summon a nuke for him? Or make him immortal, like Vegeta from DBZ?...Some things don't make sense, but you have to give Tarantino the suspension of disbelief.Art: 2The art sucks ass. I liked the part in the second half of the anime where the main villain (the big guy) was completely animated in CG. Even in scenes where everything else is 2D-animated, he's in CG. What's the lore behind that? How does that work? I found that it broke my immersion often. The 2D animation is also not very good, but Yuri looks cute and has nice boobs. So that's why it's a 2/10.Sound: 8The sound was actually not too good in the show, but it's passable. The voice actors delivered their lines exceptionally poorly, without any sense of realistic human emotion. It just didn't work. The soundtrack is also bizarre and will leave you disoriented. However, the ED is very good, and I must recommend you listen to it.Character: 4My favorite character was the pedophile guy who could smell the status of any girl's virginity (that was his special ability). But the writers killed him off in episode 2, leaving us with boring characters. Another excellent character that was wasted was a man with an incredible ability—to turn buttons into strings. He was also a big pervert. Unfortunately, he was brutally murdered for no real reason in episode 3. I think the writers are killing off all the interesting characters just to emotionally drain the audience, which works sometimes. But they didn't have to kill those two—they did nothing wrong and were lovable, innocent, pure-of-heart characters.Enjoyment: 1I did not enjoy this show.Overall: 4Don't watch this show.

But they didn't have to kill those two—they did nothing wrong and were lovable, innocent, pure-of-heart characters.Enjoyment: 1I did not enjoy this show.Overall: 4Don't watch this show."", 'this was a

this. i like how their where parts of the scene that looked like the game. and i also felt bad for...most of the players because of their background story. but at least now they can be at rest. it truly was a beautiful anime with a true story about how we are all trying to survive life and find out place in the world. and how sometimes we lose ourselves to where we no longer see value in this

the low probably because of his visuals and his overall aspect in my opinion visually didn’t look so bad even tho it looked a bit oldish.But I’ll start by saying I think he deserve a mid 7Even IF:Sure the story is a déjà vu and the main character act as if he was the kid from kirito on SAO and light yagami in DEATH NOTE.I feel like the anime is getting a lot of low notes from people who doesn’t see all the work behind an anime and can’t get another look from their first impressionBecause sure the Art doesn’t...help especially in combat where it sometimes look like you’re having 10 fpsBut their is still a good enough effort to make it over the average anime now when you see notes like a 3 or 4 people are just out of their mind,the overall ambiance was putting you in without getting you bored.The musicals choice and the voice acting was GOOD!Sure I can understand some people putting a lower notation because there is already a lot of anime of the same genre and it’s nothing new you can clearly see the inspiration in some characters.and the flow of anime is a very HUNTER X HUNTER like especially in the fights scene where they love to pause and explain you all the bullshit but you can’t penalize the anime for his genre it’s whether you like it or not.When I’m comparing him to anime of his genre the visuals and easy path in the story can’t make him above a 8 cause it is to low in my opinion but I can respect A 8 cause the anime I’m sure can be very enjoyable especially for newcomersThat is for the high note and I couldn’t like a note lower than 6 cause the music voice acting the effort in the rythm the consistency in the script and story can’t put him near the trash levels 4 and under but I could agree that he is average or aboveSo low note 6high 8Easy pick i just go with 7 I think it is fair for the work put on the anime, what made it rise above averageness to me was the fact that I could watch the 12 episode while still being captivated not bored and could

adjusted/corrected', 'Here I am again, reviewing another anime of the season.Anime: Deatte 5-byou de Battle/Battle Game in 5 SecondsAn anime with a not so good story, I believe it is for the mediocre, for the lowly. The way the premise is approached, I found it very uninteresting and the way it is done, makes me want to go to sleep and say ""I watched it, but I didn\'t understand it, lol"", but also, depending on the point of view, the story is very superficial and makes you join a disinterest and watch it just for or for the protagonist having a relatively high middle ground and...knowing how to do such a thing within the anime (I confess that I\'m only watching it because of mc, lmao).Ok, the animation in the beginning was ok. Nothing too ""wow"", but the guys put me in a horrible CGI and poorly planned. I was very disappointed about this.The sounds are good, the voices don\'t make me want to scratch a blackboard and think this is better than listening to a character\'s voice (except for Mion\'s voice, which makes me want to scratch my throat or listen to a fax machine for an hour). The opening, in a way, is good, a strong point so far, and finally, the ost\'s didn\'t hold my attention, I found it very weak and sloppy.The characters are good, I confess I love the mc for being minimally intelligent and knowing how to use his intelligence, not a sloppy mc who is intelligent and doesn\'t act like it. The other characters are interesting, not so charming and not so mediocre. Each with their own life stories and goals. The characters are well introduced and from the beginning you already know a little about their personalities and goals (apparently, however, I may have made a mistake).Overall the anime is interesting and a great pastime (this is when the anime is finished being released), it\'s not bad and it\'s not very good, if it wasn\'t for the story and animation, I would give it an 8/10, but I stuck with 5/10. That\'s it, I hope you found this review useful. knowing how to do such a thing within the anime (I confess that I\'m only watching it because of mc, lmao).Ok, the animation in the beginning was ok.

I feel like the story is interesting and some of the fight scenes are quite enjoying to watch. The plot twists in Battle Game 5 Seconds is nice too. Even though the pacing might be a bit fast, they explained the plot well enough for me to give it an 8/10.Art: 4/105 episodes in the anime the art was pretty decent. The art style is definitely unique from other anime you can find out there. However, the CGI is trash. I feel like...the CGI usage in this anime is trash. From episode 6-11 there is this arc where 3 teams would come to battle in order to advance to the next round. One of the leaders in the other team, THAT GUY, the animation on my boy is awful. Some of the fight scenes looks lazy and I feel like the animators could have did more work on him.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack of this anime is actually not bad. The sound effects in the fight scenes are decent but overall the sound usage in this anime is not bad. The credit song (ED) slaps though, not gonna lie.Character: 9/10I love the main character of this anime. Akira is a pretty intelligent character and I feel like he is very suitable for this show. I feel like Akira could have been a little more cunning and evil but I think his character now is good. The side characters are not bad too. Yuuri has a great synergy with Akira. I feel like the character depth for some of the other side characters can go deeper but I wouldn't complain about the characters right now. 9/10Enjoyment: 7/10This anime is decently enjoyable to watch. The CGI and the pacing ruined the enjoyment for me. Despite that, I actually love looking at some of the parts of the anime. I feel like anyone would enjoy it if they do not bother about the trash animation, sadly.Overall: 7/10As of now this anime is pretty much well rated.

Mostly a backstory which  has gore, sex, child abuse and other things. It's not that I don't like the backstory because of those things, but I'm not amazed by the creativity or happy when those are the only things that were told so far, -1 point for me.The other thing that I still find lacking though I'm only at episode 5 is the game element in the show. There's been quite a few very powers that aren't exactly new and the game where the characters wasn't explained at all, so when...I'm thinking about how some parts of the anime feel like they weren't followed through, I'm skeptical about what the future holds.Positives -So far it's been a lot of negative but there's also a lot of positive. Even if it's a game genre it's still interesting. I can feel how the story is building up little by little and there's also a lot of unique powers which keep it interesting and the game I assume they are playing is also progressing and there's always something happening. The games played in the game are also starting to get much more interesting at ep 5 where I'm at right now.There's also some funny jokes that are sometimes missing in these game animes. Characters don't feel very out of the ordinary yet but they aren't bad or annoying and there are some that are actually quite unique and fun to see.Conclusion:That being said opening and ending are way above average and I like them both. It definitely feels like an upgrade of BTOOM!!! so far, so If you enjoyed that I would recommend this as well. Or anyone who's into game animes.

I feel like it has a great premise and story, but that it wasn\'t executed as well as it could have been. Having not read the light novel / manga, I won\'t know if this is just an adaptation issue.The battle royal and how it\'s executed are pretty great. You have straightforward villians and a protagonist who isn\'t afraid of getting his hands dirtty and both of those combined keep you engaged.The problem is just that sometimes the plot trips over itself trying to be clever and throw in twists. I feel like it\'s a bit too ""clever"" for...it\'s own good. Where this gets the most frustrating is around the character\'s abilities. They seem extremely poorly designed and the author gives a lot of latitude to make the abiilites all seem to do whatever they want sometimes. It can be frustrating because as a viewer you don\'t know the rules so it just seems like stuff is just happening.Other than that though, it keeps me coming back for more if only because the MC is interesting and engaging.

I wouldn't venture as far as saying that this is a must see however. My one main issue with the anime is that as the episodes progress the production quality drops. There was literally a scene where they animated the wrong person talking... But other than that it isn't bad.

If you\'re into these types of shows, then you\'ll find it acceptable, and if you don\'t, then you\'ll think it\'s trash.I don\'t think Darwin\'s game is anything innovative or anything, but Deatte 5-byou de Battle doesn\'t even try with it\'s pilot episode. It\'s pretty clear that the author wanted to get the beginning out of the way so the death battles can begin. An extremely intelligent and convenient MC is shown in the very beginning, is which he\'s trying to ""immerse himself in a game to escape reality"" is coincidentally, given an...opportunity to immerse himself in a game to escape his current reality. Wow! Usually, you\'re also given a sort of mystery as to why people got abducted and placed to fight each other in weird games, but this show just flat out tells you: ""we\'re testing new abilities, fight to the death!"" Again, it\'s a very vanilla beginning, and the most dull one I\'ve seen so far.I think that other than the beginning, the story arcs are alright. The fact that the MC has a pretty OP but interesting ability is cool, and you\'re driven to want to see how he gets past his obstacles in every stage. Of course, things just go too well for Akira for me to really root for him and care about the story, but it\'s good enough to pass the time. Again, the charm point of this story is how everyone has a unique ability, including Akira. Pair these with different battle settings and scenarios, and you got a fun little death battle survival story.What really gets me, though, is not even the boring beginning. I love the genre, and I was not expecting much anyway from the transition from regular life to death game. It\'s the animation. This show is on a hella small budget. Everything is so poorly animated. There are little to no backgrounds, the studio uses every trick to animate fights with as little budget as possible. In the very few frames where there are fights, they use crappy CGI instead of actual animation. It\'s a very low budget show clearly, and there\'s nothing good about it. I\'m not even too picky, but to have a show about fighting and using CGI or just poorly animated fights is just too much. Backgrounds are just solid colors half the time, closeups are constantly shown to avoid as much animation as possible, no details are shown, characters have unnatural limbs and bad proportions, etc. Pair this with the fun flashback montages that were already shown in order to save animating anything, you a really low quality show in the art department. Zoro\'s voice actor playing Kirisaki was a good surprise, but not nearly enough to salvage this show.Story wise, it\'s actually not bad, but the bad animation is just too much. I prefer anime over to manga, but I really suggest reading it instead...there\'s no salvation for this animation. I\'ll be doing the same opportunity to immerse himself in a game to escape his current reality. Wow!

I thought the survival game / battle royale genre has been left far behind in the early 2010s, since we are deep into the isekai era right now (for better or, probably, for worse). So while the key visual and PVs for this anime did not inspire much excitement, I was cautiously expecting an at least somewhat average palate cleanser with a hint of nostalgia. Well, that\'s pretty much what I got.I have not read the manga, so I will judge this purely based on the anime. This is pretty much the bog-standard death game anime...you would see bouncing around the seasonal charts a decade ago (with art and animation quality to match). What makes this somewhat more intriguing is the mystery element - whereby the participants in the death game appear to be recruited as part of a broader conspiracy, instead of having straightforward goals and defined rules from the get-go. This mystery is used to a decent effect to drive tension in the early episodes but unfortunately fades over the course of the show\'s runtime in favor of more bombastic action setpieces and hastily written and poorly executed character backstories.Speaking of, I would highlight Akira, the MC, as the standout character in the series. Sure, he isn\'t anything too unique as far as death game MCs go (and at the very least he isn\'t a sigh-inducing weakling or idiot as these MCs tend to be). His aptitude for tactical and strategic thinking makes the ""big brain"" moments in the show\'s climaxes entertaining to watch. The way he uses his unique ability to gain an edge over the various enemies he encounters is a consistent highlight of the show. Unfortunately, the more mysterious elements of his own backstory receive no attention during this anime\'s runtime, but I am satisfied with what we got. The other characters are rather bland and uninteresting, and the villains are comically evil with uninspiring backstories. There are slivers of romance in this anime, especially in relation to the female lead, Yuuri, but it never takes away from the core narrative of the show (which I appreciate). Yuuri is plays a more important role as a critical part of Akira\'s plans, and her spunky personality forms a good complement to Akira\'s otherwise stoic persona. The focus is directed towards the action and Akira\'s thought process, from which where most of the show\'s core entertainment value is derived.There isn\'t too much to comment on from a technical standpoint. The art and animation aren\'t anything to write home about, with terrible CG used during demanding portions of certain action sequences. The music was mostly forgettable, though the OPs and EDs were catchy and fit the theme of the anime well (though I would probably forget them by the time next season rolls around).All in all, Deatte 5-byou de Battle was a bit of nostalgic fun, a throwback to the heyday of death games in the early 2010s, and a fresh change of pace from the isekai drab that muddies every season these days. You would get some enjoyment out of it if you prefer more ""brain"" than ""brawn"" in your survival games. If you are getting bored of the style of anime we are getting these days, this could be worth a casual watch if you can make room for it on a crowded seasonal watchlist. But if you really wanted a good survival game/battle royale anime to scratch that particular itch of yours, I would recommend checking out classic examples of the genre which have stood the test of time, and potentially some more interesting ones in upcoming seasons. you would see bouncing around the seasonal charts a decade ago (with art and animation quality to match).

And welcome to “Garbage of the Season [3]!” The series where I discuss the current season's trashy pile of unwatchable monstrosities so that mom can’t say I’m doing nothing with my life. But before I start, I’d suggest you smash that helpful button and click on notifications so that you won’t miss out on any of my upcoming reviews. So without further ado, roll the intro…*The Shaggs - Philosophy of the World starts playing*…*End of intro*Today’s garbage is the ever popular Deatte 5-byou de Battle. A show that doesn’t even have a grasp over its own title. Battles do in fact not happen...five seconds after meeting on the vast majority of occasions. So there goes the only thing that would make the show stand out, as everything else is just copied homework from others like it.Dea5 is presented as death game-esque, but is more in tone of a shounen tournament arc. For the focus is directed at fighting but not killing. Yes a few disposable side characters die here and there, but there’s no worry about the main ones. Because making the main characters overpowered in a death game scenario is the right way to build up suspense. And don’t get me started on how unbalanced the power system is. The main characters and villains obviously get the most useful superpowers since the plot armor wasn’t sturdy enough as is.The characters themselves are cardboard cutouts and you can pretty much understand them from one scene alone. The most you’ll get out of them is some tragic backstory that the writers seem to think equals a good character. There wasn’t a single person worthy of investment and I would’ve rather seen them die. That would’ve been interesting at least.I’ll just go on and write it: There are no redeeming qualities to be found in Dea5. The visuals are god awful, with the animation being especially abhorrent to look at. The music is poorly handled and the voice acting stiff and lifeless. Everything about this show and the hours wasted on it makes me depressed. So much in fact that I am going to put something sad in my outro.To summarize, I would describe this show the same way as my sex life. Something to cry at when you’ve run out of K-dramas. But you know something that hasn't run out? Me...GotS! And this has been Garbage of the Season! Leave your thoughts about Deatte 5-byou de Battle in the comments below and I’ll see you in the next review. Roll the outro...*A video showing us that Michael Bay is making a new movie starts playing*The End... five seconds after meeting on the vast majority of occasions. So there goes the only thing that would make the show stand out, as everything else is just copied homework from others like it.Dea5 is presented as death game-esque, but is more in tone of a shounen tournament arc. For the focus is directed at fighting but not killing. Yes a few disposable side characters die here and there, but there’s no worry about the main ones. Because making the main characters overpowered in a death game scenario is the right way to build up suspense. And don’t get me started on how unbalanced the power system is. The main characters and villains obviously get the most useful superpowers since the plot armor wasn’t sturdy enough as is.The characters themselves are cardboard cutouts and you can pretty much understand them from one scene alone. The most you’ll get out of them is some tragic backstory that the writers seem to think equals a good character. There wasn’t a single person worthy of investment and I would’ve rather seen them die. That would’ve been interesting at least.I’ll just go on and write it: There are no redeeming qualities to be found in Dea5. The visuals are god awful, with the animation being especially abhorrent to look at. The music is poorly handled and the voice acting stiff and lifeless. Everything about this show and the hours wasted on it makes me depressed. So much in fact that I am going to put something sad in my outro.To summarize, I would describe this show the same way as my sex life. Something to cry at when you’ve run out of K-dramas. But you know something that hasn't run out? Me...GotS! And this has been Garbage of the Season!

Nothing is really new, but, it\'s not bad. The powers and the phases are a good way of linking the arcs. The last arc is the ""least bad"", and you may have some anxiety while you watch it.Art & Sound:If you like art and sound, just don\'t watch. It\'s horrible. I may say that sound is fair, but art is a complete mess. There\'s a moment in the series that they start mixing 3d and 2d characters and effects, but none of them are good. The early episodes have...just a regular animation, but it gets really worst.Character:I\'ve really enjoyed the two main characters - Akira and Yuuri. You may imagine that they develop some kind of romance during the series, and that seems like true. But, this anime is not a romance, at least not in these 12 eps. Akira makes me remember of Kira (from Death Note), mainly because of his intelligence and strategies.Enjoyment:Here, I may say that you\'ll love or hate it, there are not much people in the between. It\'s a Isekai story with a psicopath protagonist that recieves a good superpower. There\'s some girls that like him, and etc. Yes, it looks like SAO. But, they\'re quite different.Overall:It\'s not good, and it\'s not bad. I liked the personality of Akira, and enjoyed his strategies. This and the existence of Mion, made this anime some interesting to me. How ever, I don\'t really think most people would like it. So, if the first episode took your attention, give it a try.

I went with little hope of being good, even though I was the type I liked, and luckily, I was surprised and really liked what I saw.Points that I found positive: I found the scheme of powers that was used and the way they are interpreted very interesting as well. The protagonist is really good for the anime, I didn\'t see a negative point in him. The stages that players go through are also pretty cool and shows how the power that each player has can be used in many...different ways, in addition to making people act in different ways too.Points I found negative: The anime should have done the ""villains"" in a better way, as most of them are pretty boring and don\'t bring any impact to the person watching. Another negative point, is the stories behind each character that are very bad, which also end up not bringing any impact to the person who is watching.Finally, the last negative point is the 3D animation, which is horrible. different ways, in addition to making people act in different ways too.Points I found negative: The anime should have done the ""villains"" in a better way, as most of them are pretty boring and don\'t bring any impact to the person watching.

But to my suprise, this is where Battle Game 5 seconds picked me up in the first place. The ability of Akira, the main character, is ""whatever the other person thinks it is"". From the point where I got to know about his ability, I was looking forward how he would psychologically trick the other characters to use the full potential...of it. My perception was, that he really needed to make the others ""believe"", that his ability is XY... Unfortunately, when the anime goes more into how his ability works, it is revealed, that this is not the case.Later down in the series, Akira befriends with another participant of the death game in the name of Yuuri and ends up telling her about his real ability. She now knows the truth of his ability, so his ability won\'t work on or with her anymore, right? right? Wrong.From this point on, Akira is basically a god, because unlike I thought, he doesn\'t need to make others truly believe that his ability is this or that. Nope, he only needs someone to literally think or imagine a specific ability, thinking it is his; and BOOM, that\'s the ability he will have. That means, as long as Yuuri is on his side he can practically use any ability he... well to be correct... Yuuri can imagine. For me this is what killed this anime. From that point on, why didn\'t he just use some OP ability to get the hell out of this place or just insta-kill his enemies? A lot of questions to be asked...So, the story is very poorly written, not only because of how the abilites are handled but also because in some fights, somehow, the characters are predicting the predictions of other characters. As an example: ""Haha, I predicted you would make that move, I was prepared for that"" - other character: ""Haha, I predicted that you would predict my move, it was a trap all along!"", and that went on for like 3 more times IN ONE FIGHT.On the other hand the animation isn\'t too great (but it\'s also not bad either).The characters are all right and you can sympathize with some of them. However there are also characters whose motivation I can literally not understand and that don\'t make a lot of sense to me.Overall, as I said in the beginning, this anime had some aspects that could\'ve made it interesting, especially the ability of the MC. Unfortunately, they handled it very badly and the rest is just mediocre at best. I wouldn\'t really recommend you to watch this show. of it.

It's one of those shows that sets up a premise and hopes you don't think about it. The moment you start thinking what main character could do with his power whole thing falls apart and starts feeling completely pointless. However he is mysterious to a right degree and entertaining enough to carry this flawed story to the end without being tiresome. Other characters are also well designed if a bit simple in nature.Animation is very competent with one exception, one of main villains of the story, who for some reason directors of this show...decided to do with CGI. Stiff movements but at least well shaded. Everything else looked hand drawn to me with this one very obvious and jarring exception.All things considered it's a very solid 6/10. Story could have been deeper and a bit more unique, world building should have been better and use of poor CGI didn't help the score either.

It started off pretty strong and from there got progressively worse until it was an absolute train wreck. Don't even know why I finished the entire anime. It's main problem is the horrendous CG in the later episodes. Its a decent anime around a 7ish i'd say until the latter half where you start to notice Beserk quality CG pop up here and there until the main characters and main antagonist are fighting entirely in awful CG.This anime would be fine if it continued the art and animation quality from the earlier episodes but...because it didn't I would not recommend watching.

Nothing really makes sense, it seems to have been written by a retarded but edgy middle schooler with aphantasia.Note that the main character -who is an alleged genius- explains everything he does and makes everyone very uncomfortable. Indeed, you will discover people jumping into water become wet.Tips: watch it as a comedy. ', 'Battle Game in 5 Seconds is a typical good generic anime that involves a lot of fighting, action and plot twist, honestly the only reason that I just started watching this in the first place is because of boredom So I just said you know what I am gonna watching this to pass time and if it does suck then might as well just drop it, but when I started watching a couple of eps, Well I was really damn surprise that it didn\'t disappointed me even a single bit and began to enjoy every second of the eps shown.Story 8/10 : Honestly the whole...plot, game and scheme kind of reminds of Hunter X Hunter a lot of the Hunter Exam arc and a bit of the Greed Island arc with there given abilities, the monsters, the enemies. So with that I am giving it an 8.Art:7/10: I really love the art style especially when the effects when Akira activates his ""cannon"" like seriously I love it and also the background designs they were great too. The details were well drawn and animated, but that problem is that there is too much the fight scenes that were CGI especially the ones in ep 6. Overall it\'s not half-bad So I will give it a 7Sound 9/10: The OP and ED were really well made and I honestly love singing it like it\'s all mysterious, glitchy and pretty darn exciting, kind of gets me the right mindset and the mood to enjoy the rest of the eps.Character 8/10: The characters are really well made and I love how the main character kind of reminds a mix of both Light Yagami and Lelouch with his neutral a bit cold hearted personality and thinks the people around him is like a chess piece, instead of being a scaredy cat main character who is just too nice like but ends up too OP like I was expecting lmao. Also I honestly love Yuuri\'s character too because she has a very strong mindset and a determined girl to help her step-sis with a tsundere personality trait (it\'s also my type of girl) then the rest of the side characters are also good too. So props to that.Enjoyment 8/10: I really enjoyed the series overall, very entertaining with good action and good plot. It shifts between the funny and serious depending the situation and the atmosphere, like even Akari sometimes gets funny when he needs to and serious when the games started where he analyzes his surroundings, enemies and his strategies. Overall I rate it out of 8 because I managed to binge it all and it is good if your looking for some action anime.Overall 8/10: Pretty dope anime, if you are in a mood for some action, fighting, good character development combined with a smart mischievous main character, then I suggest you watch it, but If you don\'t like those genres then don\'t watch it, It really is up to you after all. plot, game and scheme kind of reminds of Hunter X Hunter a lot of the Hunter Exam arc and a bit of the Greed Island arc with there given abilities, the monsters, the enemies.

But, I also wanted to rate it ""4"" for all the the bad things I found. So I guess ""5"" is pretty fair enough.The final episode kind of summed-up how the entirety of the series has played out in a nutshell... One-hit KO after a forced emotional moment, and a long as brag about how they very super duper mega intelligently did things.To summarize my review (cause I\'m bad at doing this :P):- The Pros: Great concept, Generic but diverse enough characters, character designs, direction- The Cons:...Poorly executed, wasted characters that only lasted minutes, inconsistent and poor animation, childish level of battle-of-witsIt was mostly interesting when there was mystery, i.e.: During the beginning when their abilities were yet to be revealed, and protag trying to come up with a way to trigger his ability. But as soon as all those mystery went away, there\'s not much to see anymore.Would\'ve helped if the ""Battle of wits"" were well executed but, unfortunately, it was mostly just a childish game of ""You thought..."".One part even felt like an ""Old Spice"" meme:""Look at where you put the baby, now look at me, now back to the baby, now BACK to me. What do I have?...... The baby.""There were some potential good characters, mostly villains, that could\'ve been a game changer. They were introduced like some psychopathic set of monsters, even got a lot of Off-Screen multi-NPC-kills that made them feel like great threat...... And then they got OHKOed after playing riddle games with the main characters for a few minutes... if not seconds XPThe Protags were fairly interesting to me but, other than the 2 main protags, the rest didn\'t really get enough action to show much.While it didn\'t do so well with the animation, I still appreciated the character designs and the very minimal amount of action. Unfortunately, due to CGI animation being randomly mixed here and there, it really got so awkward watching the fight scenes. And you would expect that the battle scenes would atleast be intense since they even bothered to use a different tech for it. But no, the CGI parts looked so much lamer compared to the occasional action we get on normal animation. I have a feeling they only used it on ""Ichi"" scenes so they don\'t have to re-draw his badass tattoos.VAs were fine, if not good. I\'ve never been bothered by a single character\'s VA while watching this.I didn\'t really noticed the BGMs, but the OP and ED themes were pretty good, fitting of an intense action anime... but the Anime failed to be that kind of a treat.I don\'t know what things the production team had to face: Budget? Workforce? Due date?This material felt like it had so much to offer even with just a decent animation quality, less animated action scenes, and only a few characters being involved in an episode. But even with more they did so less.But I believe there\'s still hope in turning this anime into something worth watching. It\'s not like they ruined the material, they just delivered it poorly. But the ending kind of showed some promise that they can take advantage of.And with most characters\' abilities now revealed, I feel it\'s gonna be so interesting to see them face enemies with unknown abilities and figure out ways to beat them... that is to say, if they can write much more interesting ways for protags to deal with those things instead of just magically giving them a ""Main-character advantage"".

The characters with the more interesting abilities are side characters and it all devolves down to the main character using his somewhat interesting ability. However, since his ability requires him to manipulate what others think to use it, the whole anime just devolves into a nonsensical mind game where it\'s like:""haha! I knew you were going to think that therefore I planned ahead and made...preparations""""oh I knew you were going to make those preparations so I prepared to counter your preparations""""I knew you were going to prepare to counter my preparations so I prepared to counter your counter to my preparations""until the viewer is just there like ""yup, he\'s the main character, he can\'t lose"".Like what many others think, the beginning and end were lackluster at best. The ending was particularly unfulfilling, with a setup for a next season, though I doubt I\'d want to watch the next season. A lot of the available powers we see are strong but boring, which is good if you\'re a player, but as a viewer I\'d want something more interesting than useful. I can\'t interact with any of the powers myself what do I care about their efficacy in battle? There are 2 main abilities we\'re shown: arm cannon and quintuple physical abilities. One turns your arm into a big gun and one makes you stronger by a factor of 5. Both are useful but bland and they\'re so often shoved in our face. With the only limit being the creator\'s imagination, I find it hard to think of a reason why so many powers are so bland and why so many of them are reused. If you want a comparison of what a creator can do with custom powers, look to the nen system in Hunter x Hunter. The creator took time and created a lot of unique abilities and even though the Enhancer category of nen users boiled down to just ""I make myself or something I have stronger"" that was made up for by their applications and personalities.Speaking of characters, we barely get any character development for the main character and almost nothing for our side characters. One of my favorite side character\'s back story was fully explained with a 15 second flashback. I\'m torn because I usually hate when the story focuses too much on side characters, but with almost no representation, it barely feels like any of the side characters exist outside of MC\'s story. Some of the characters have a lot of potential, but the main group doesn\'t have a lot of potential, they felt like they were made to be self-inserts.This anime also suffers from the 3D animation struggle. It\'s much easier to animate a fight scene using 3D animation rather than 2D, but it feels jarring and ugly a lot of the time, and this anime is no exception.All-in-all it\'s just bland. Not really anything that makes it bad other than a lack of things that make it good. There are plenty of good anime out there so why not watch something with a lot of charm or character over an anime that\'s just here. It took me so long to finish this anime because it\'s hard to come back and finish something when there were other anime I preferred to watch in my dwindling free time. preparations""""oh I knew you were going to make those preparations so I prepared to counter your preparations""""I knew you were going to prepare to counter my preparations so I prepared to counter your counter to my preparations""until the viewer is just there like ""yup, he\'s the main character, he can\'t lose"".Like what many others think, the beginning and end were lackluster at best. The ending was particularly unfulfilling, with a setup for a next season, though I doubt I\'d want to watch the next season. A lot of the available powers we see are strong but boring, which is good if you\'re a player, but as a viewer I\'d want something more interesting than useful. I can\'t interact with any of the powers myself what do I care about their efficacy in battle? There are 2 main abilities we\'re shown: arm cannon and quintuple physical abilities. One turns your arm into a big gun and one makes you stronger by a factor of 5. Both are useful but bland and they\'re so often shoved in our face. With the only limit being the creator\'s imagination, I find it hard to think of a reason why so many powers are so bland and why so many of them are reused. If you want a comparison of what a creator can do with custom powers, look to the nen system in Hunter x Hunter. The creator took time and created a lot of unique abilities and even though the Enhancer category of nen users boiled down to just ""I make myself or something I have stronger"" that was made up for by their applications and personalities.Speaking of characters, we barely get any character development for the main character and almost nothing for our side characters.

Sadly when we reached the middle of the series things started to slip with changes in animation styles amd some lackluster fight scenes.The story had some really good parts where i was hooked and couldnt wait until the next episode but near the end i was just like oh the new episode came out....The story itself is interesting its just the way its presented that was turning...me away especially with the fight scenes. In some fight scenes they use CG animation now dont get me wrong there is good CG out there but to switch so abruptly and to do it multiple time within the same fight scene switching back and forth between normal and CG looks weird and off putting. The story itself was enough to keep me coming back every week because i always wanted to see what would happen next. And if a season 2 does come out I'll watch it because im interested in what is going to happen next. I just hope they do better with the fight scenes and animation. I feel like the entire experience of this story is better in the manga maybe one day I'll pick that up.The charecter designes are average charecters look nice but thers nothing too crazy going on. When they go into CG they look kind of weird. But the main antagonist in particular is a BADDIE😍The music for battle game in 5 seconds specifically the opening and ending themes were great the OP is good i didnt listen to it everytime bit it was still good for what it was but the ED was Great i bopped my head to that at the end of every episode.Battle game in 5 seconds was an ok show the story was very interesting and constantly kept me wanting to watch more but the lackluster fight scenes and abrupt switches in animation style made the experience a little off putting. I honestly feel like the manga probably does all of these things so much better but i haven't read the manga maybe one day i will but for now heres hoping for a better season2.Rating 6/10 me away especially with the fight scenes.

I did really like our main two characters but that's about it, they definitely carried. The art and animation were pretty terrible, people would turn CGI mid fight and it was just like???? ok??? Anyways I...don't have much more to say so, in conclusion I wouldn't recommend this show there were few redeeming qualities but I will admit it was quite entertaining so if you wanna watch a bad show I think this is a good bad one to watch! don't have much more to say so, in conclusion I wouldn't recommend this show there were few redeeming qualities but I will admit it was quite entertaining so if you wanna watch a bad show I think this is a good bad one to watch!"", ""Deatte 5-byou de Battle is a 'survival game' anime, a lot like Darwin game.

OR save yourself some time and go smash your head into a wall, that wouldn\'t be a very different experience than watching this anime)).Mayoiga, Ousama Game, Satsuriku no Tenshi, Mahou Shoujo Site, Darwin\'s Game, Talentless Nana, and recently High-rise Invasion. What do these have in common?They\'re cheaply made attempts at the survival sub-genre, and they can be summed up as a bunch of random ideas slapped together with amateurish writing. They also tend to be badly directed and animated...as if the staff didn\'t care, and rightfully so, because I would\'ve wanted to get things over with and go home too if I was working on creating a dumpster fire.There\'s one secret factor though, that if one of these shows managed to pull off it\'d be actually decent. Can you guess what it is?Embracing its own stupidity is what it is!You see, the reason movies like The Room are very popular despite being an abomination, is because they know they\'re bad but they don\'t care, you get this genuine sense of entertainment from them as if they just wanted you to have a good time, they don\'t reflect any ego from the writer, they don\'t pretend to be smart.Now I have enjoyed most of these shows I mentioned above, but it\'s all for the wrong reasons, I am willing to give them bad ratings regardless of the enjoyment factor because they take themselves too seriously, they are not self aware about their own lack of good writing, characterization, or even directing.The only exception from this list is High-rise Invasion, that show knew it\'s stupid and doubled down on its stupidity on purpose, which made it pure entertainment, I\'d elaborate but this review is not about that, this review is about Darwin\'s Ga- umm sorry, which one was it again?""Battle Game in 5 Seconds"", honestly I did not expect to get a new addition to the list this early on but here we have it, an anime that\'s no different than the aforementioned dumpster fires, it just stinks as badly as each one of them.One thing ""Battle Game in 5 Seconds"" has in common with some of these shows is how they attempt to setup some sort of a survival game, but the writer doesn\'t understand that games need rules, so you get these conditions where characters have to fight, collect points, form teams, etc. But we don\'t get to see any rules or mechanics in play aside from some vague smart app bullshit that never gets explained, because that\'d require the writer to actually think for once, instead they prefer to keep things vague so they can do whatever they want, they have the characters duke it out with little to no logic and then have the audacity to have the protagonist over-explain the simplest events on hind sight as if it was some sort of a brilliant strategy, and he almost always hilariously sounds so confident and cool that he ends up reeking of rotten cheese.Now I really want to stop bringing up this group of bad anime and talk about the one I\'m supposed to be reviewing, but I can\'t help it since ""Battle Game in 5 Seconds"" is the most generic one of the bunch, I can\'t talk about it without feeling like I\'m referring to other shows, everything in this anime feels like I\'ve seen it somewhere before, the setting, the character designs, the overall feeling of the show, it feels like it was created by an AI that looked up the browsing history of Darwin\'s Game\'s author, it\'s bizarrely artificial and devoid of any form of originality!Alright, let me do what I\'m supposed to do and attempt to give you a summary about ""Battle Game in 5 Seconds"".The show starts by telling us that our protagonist Akira is a school boy (because of course he is) and he plays videogames. That\'s all you need to know before the first fight scene abruptly begins (you can completely remove the intro and nothing would be lost), Akira is attacked by some monster and dragged into the survival game, and what was his reaction to it? ""All I need to do is treat this as a game and I won\'t lose"" and BAM he takes down the monster! Playing mobile games makes you stronger, you know? You should do that more often if you want to be awesome like our protagonist here.So after that Akira gets killed anyway and then wakes up to find himself in another world, and we get into the typical survival game intro:-Protagonist wakes up in a large hall. Check.-The hall is filled with characters with flashy designs. Check.-Every character is silently waiting for the plot, instead of trying to get to know each and assess the situation. Check-A silly character with a silly voice appears and introduces themselves as the main antagonist and the representative of the organization that killed and isekai-ed these people. Check.-Said antagonist randomly kills one of the characters to show how serious they are. Check.-One character asks ""Who are you? Why are you doing this?"" but gets no answer, because mystery. Check.-The antagonist attempts to explain that these characters are supposed to play some sort of a game, except instead of explaining anything they just go on about how much they enjoy being evil. Check.You know, basically if you played/watched Danganronpa or Zero Escape you have it all figured out already.So here\'s what should\'ve been the interesting part, the game! What kind of game is it? Well, the characters have super powers and they use them to fight. No really, that\'s it. I know, compared to other shows of this genre this feels like it\'s the most basic thing it could\'ve been!What\'s supposed to be the cool twist however, is the protagonist\'s super power, which is described as ""whatever your opponent thinks is your power, becomes your power"", what this convoluted mess means is that if the protagonist can convince his opponent that he has the power to turn his arm into a cannon megaman-style, then he can turn his arm into a cannon. If he can convince them he can use telepathy, then he can use telepathy. If he can convince them that he can make this show not suck, well, some viewers think the show is good so I guess it worked out somehow. Anyway, think of it as a spell that only works against you if you believe in it.Now on paper this has the potential to be a cool device for psychological warfare, maybe someone on the level of Light Yagami would find all kinds of creative ways to do wonders with this power. Unfortunately not even that could happen because it all turned into a confusing mess not too far into the series.In one episode Akira realizes that if one of his previous opponents believes that he can turn his arm into a cannon, then as long as that person is present in the room, Akira can activate his power and use the cannon to shoot a different opponent, even if this new opponent is not convinced that Akira has that power.In a later episode Akira can\'t turn his arm into a cannon because one guy didn\'t believe he could, even though there were at least two people in the same room who believed he had that power, so he should\'ve been able to activate it anyway.So a more accurate description of this power would be ""whatever suits the writer becomes your power"", I hope you\'re not confused yet because it gets worse...In another episode Akira flat out tells one character about how his real power works, now using common sense you\'d think that a power that depends entirely on lying would be rendered completely useless if its true nature is revealed, right? Because now the person knows for a fact what your power really is, so you can\'t ""convince"" them that you can ""turn your arm into a cannon"" or ""use telepathy"", since they already know these are not your superpowers, Makes sense, right?Except the show does the exact opposite, that character knows how Akira\'s power works, so now anything he tells her becomes his power, he only needs to say ""trust me""! If he wants to use teleportation he only needs to tell her that he intends to use teleportation and he\'ll magically be able to use it. How does that work? Don\'t ask me, ask the genius who wrote this anime!I wish I was making this up, actually no, nothing good comes from making this garbage up, only sheer insanity! This show completely defies common sense and acts as if it did something smart!With that out of the way, let\'s talk about the characters, are you curious to know about characters other than Akira the awesome protagonist? Rejoice! You will get your dose of modern flashbacks that every shitty manga writer from this era thinks are the way to go.The characters are basically like those toys that have a button which if pressed would yell out one recorded phrase, if you\'re lucky they would switch up between two phrases.There\'s one girl who always says ""I hate the word coincidence!"" because apparently she was a coincidence according to her mother lol (sorry, I just can\'t!). One guy goes on about how they shouldn\'t use the super powers given to them by the evil admins of this game, and then he uses his power anyway just because he was in a pinch, he doesn\'t go through development or anything life-changing, he quickly changes his mind because he was losing a fight. Another guy goes on about wanting to fight the protagonist, but he fights on his side under the usual stereotypical dumb excuse ""no one gets to kill him before I do!"" but then he just kinda forgets about it and continues fighting with him for no reason.If you\'re looking for character development it\'s impossible to have it in any functional way, and there\'s a reason for that.Everything that happened in the series felt like it happened in a matter of one day, that\'s how rushed everything felt, the characters should barely know each other by the end of the series, they practically just met, we\'ve seen next to no interaction between them that\'s not directly related to the fights.However, as long as the series manages to check-mark one arc it acts as if these characters now bonded and have history together, it\'s funny because some of the side characters talk about having fought together as a team (alongside Akira), but it was just a series of one-on-one fights with no team work whatsoever.The directing and editing, oh man, in modern days it\'s not often you find an anime that has actually bad editing, in this show there are times when the transaction to the next scene happens so suddenly it feels like something was cut out! Like as soon as a character from one scene finishes talking a character from the next scene start talking immediately as if we\'re still on the same scene.It\'s not one of those problems an expert would point out from experience while a casual viewer would think it\'s just a nitpick, it\'s something you can\'t miss and will be confused by, also it happened more than once!This show almost literally feels like a series of short clips randomly put together, there is so much cutting corners and awkward presentation that it feels amateurish!The art/animation quality is nothing to write home about either, later on they even fully animated one character in CG. You might be thinking ""So what? CG is not uncommon in modern anime anyway"", but that\'s not the issue, it\'s the fact they animated one character that way! Not one scene, not one fight, one character! He wasn\'t even a monster or something like that, he\'s human like the rest of them. Why him?! Why did he, out of everyone and everything, turn into a CG model?!The music, to sum it up it\'s too forgettable, like I could listen to the whole OSTs and not realize they\'re from a show I actually watched!The only memorable part was the ending, because it\'s so annoying I sometimes closed the episode before it ended just to avoid listening to that ear-raping tune at the beginning.Overall, the only way I can see someone enjoying this anime is in a room packed with wolves who are ready to rip it apart at every scene, watch it with friends who enjoy laughing at garbage getting burned as it should be, other wise don\'t bother, the world is vast and full of things that don\'t suck as badly as ""Battle Game in 5 Seconds"".Thanks for reading, have a good day. as if the staff didn\'t care, and rightfully so, because I would\'ve wanted to get things over with and go home too if I was working on creating a dumpster fire.There\'s one secret factor though, that if one of these shows managed to pull off it\'d be actually decent.

I don\'t really want to get into the nitty gritty of it, because most of the other reviews do a better job of it, so I\'ll just jot down some of the really irritating issues the show has.From the get-go every character is a boring cliched stereotype, for example, Akira, the MC, is cold and calculating, he\'s your ideal loner, edgy ""it\'s me against the world"" character (like we\'ve never seen that before). While he does have somewhat of a change of...heart in the last episode, there really is no depth to the characters, especially side characters. The side characters are really just there to move the plot forward. I\'ll get to the plot in a second, but I just want to point out the cheap emotional tactics the show tries to pull on you towards Ichi and Kuroiwa, the two main antagonists towards the end. All of a sudden there are flashbacks and exposition on their ""tragic"" past that\'s meant to make us feel sad for these two scumbags, what a joke lol.Plot wise, the introduction has everything thrown in your face but other than that initial exposure, it doesn\'t develop any further. The main plot point of who Mion and her organisation are doesn\'t really go anywhere and instead, it ignores the initial plot for subplots, i.e., the introduction of the third stage and numerous other subplots. By introducing all these other subplots and characters you get further and further away from the actual storyline.One other issue I have with the show are the characters designs. The visuals are already mediocre, but even the characters\' appearances are stereotypes, you have the bad guys looking like well, your typical bad guys, and so on and so forth. There really wasn\'t much thought into adding any sort of artistic flair to the character designs, as a result, everyone looks plain and uninspired.CGI, especially towards the last episodes became downright hilarious. The CGI went all janky and stiff during fight scenes that I had to pause for a second just to calm myself down from laughing too much.Honestly, the premise of the show is interesting, especially Akira\'s power, but the way the show went about it ruined the whole experience. Really though, it\'s not a show to take seriously or waste any sort of brainpower on, instead, just watch it with your mind turned off and I\'m sure you\'ll have a blast.Also, Mion\'s voice is incredibly annoying, she sounds like a dying cat. heart in the last episode, there really is no depth to the characters, especially side characters. The side characters are really just there to move the plot forward. I\'ll get to the plot in a second, but I just want to point out the cheap emotional tactics the show tries to pull on you towards Ichi and Kuroiwa, the two main antagonists towards the end. All of a sudden there are flashbacks and exposition on their ""tragic"" past that\'s meant to make us feel sad for these two scumbags, what a joke lol.Plot wise, the introduction has everything thrown in your face but other than that initial exposure, it doesn\'t develop any further. The main plot point of who Mion and her organisation are doesn\'t really go anywhere and instead, it ignores the initial plot for subplots, i.e., the introduction of the third stage and numerous other subplots. By introducing all these other subplots and characters you get further and further away from the actual storyline.One other issue I have with the show are the characters designs. The visuals are already mediocre, but even the characters\' appearances are stereotypes, you have the bad guys looking like well, your typical bad guys, and so on and so forth.

The tone switches between edgy power fantasy and comedy(?) so much that the pacing moves at a snail\'s pace.Our main protagonist Akira is a Mary Sue and so hilariously edgy...that he actively sucks the tension out of any scene he\'s in and ruins most of the show. It\'s hard to route for an actual sociopath who walks around saying ""*SIGH* I wish the world was more like a game. This world is so boring *SIGH*"" at the best of times, but he somehow manages to make the archetype even more boring with his ability. See he can ""have the ability your enemy thinks you have"" which I think is the most convoluted ability I\'ve ever seen. I was enjoying watching him work out the limitations and conditions to his ability, but after 7 episodes of him using nothing but an arm cannon it got old pretty quick.Yuuri is the typical battle royale girl archetype who had suffered childhood abuse. There\'s nothing all that interesting about her or any of the other characters. I don\'t remember most of them.Mion is by far the most annoying character out of the cast. Her being a cat person (for some reason) and her irritating voice made me loathe scenes she was a part of.The animation reminded me of a better-looking Hand Shakers which... isn\'t exactly good. It\'s not exactly bad looking, but it doesn\'t move all that smoothly and when CG models are used they\'re awful to look at.Overall 5 seconds is probably all you need to watch to know if you\'re going to enjoy this or not. For me, it was a disappointment. The edge is strong, but nothing else is.Watch Darwin\'s Game or Gleipnir instead.4/10 disappointment that he actively sucks the tension out of any scene he\'s in and ruins most of the show.

Gundam Build Fighters Try: Island Wars,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30533/Gundam_Build_Fighters_Try__Island_Wars,"['There comes a time where you watch a Gundam show. It can be a good one or a bad one but at the end, you will feel satisfied watching that show because it had some good elements in it.Gundam Wing as much I disliked the show itself it has some good things in it such as Duo, Zechs, and Treize being decent chararters as well the design of Tallgeese being great. I can say the first thing about season 1 of Gundam Seed while despite being a mediocre re-telling of First Gundam it was overall a decent Gundam show with great moments every now and...then. I can’t say the same thing about Shin Destiny because that show, in my opinion, is utter garbage filled with stock footage, bad/unoriginal characters, rips off Zeta Gundam heavily and too many plot holes/ inconsistent story direction.Then we have Gundam Build Fighters season 1. I never expected that show to be good. That show ended up way too good for its own good to the point where I can say its one of my favourite Gundam shows. It’s had a good simple plot with good worldbuilding, great characters are well written, well developed along with great visuals and soundtrack.Then we have its squeal Gundam Build Fighters Try which was a terrible squeal that not only removes all the charm of the series but it added things that have no business being in a Gundam show such as harem elements.Now we have Gundam Build Fighters Island Wars a lazily and poorly made train wreck of an OVA that not wastes the viewers time but it insults the viewer’s intelligence with its bad pacing and horrible harem elements that clearly have no place being in a Gundam show. Now with said and done let’s dive in into this shit show shall we.Story.Taking place one year after team Try Fighters Gunpla Battle National Championships Sekai and Fumila are invited to an island resort by Yajima Trading to test their new combat system. When Sekai and Fumina arrive on the island, they’re greeted by Gyanko, Shia and Minato as well as an embarrassed Yuuma, who had initially passed up the offer to assist Mirai on a photoshoot. Whilst training on the beach, Sekai also meets a mysterious girl who takes an interest in his Gunpla. Meanwhile, in the Nielsen labs, an anomaly with their new particle causes the crystal to expand and mutate, taking over the lab whilst simultaneously bringing the Gunpla in the vicinity to life. Just as Sei Iori did eight years ago, Team Try Fighters and their friends must battle their way through the lab to stop the crystal from getting any further out of control.For starters this ova, for the most part, it just a shitter version of episode 7 of the original series where not only it had no charm whatsoever but it was this OVA excuse of showing it’s crappy harem elements once more to the viewer. The ova least the first half is badly paced as the shipping and harem elements seemed to drag on forever.The second half is not much better. Yes, the harem bullshit was none existent in the second half however the second half only gave us unanswered questions which are never explained to the viewer whatsoever. Don’t get me started with the ending for this tripe because it’s basically a giant screw you to the fans of the original series,Now the one thing I forgot to mention in my of Gundam Build Fighters Try review is that power scaling in that show is screwed beyond belief where there were certain gunpla that can full heavy blast without getting heavily damaged. Well now the main characters in Island Wars can take can tank hits from the 80cm GN Laser, Gryps Colony Laser all at once. What the hell Build Fighters Try Island Wars!!!Overall the story is at hot garbage and at worst it’s a complete abomination that should have seen the light of day.1/10Chararters.Oh god, the chararters. Now if you thought the chararters in the original series were already bad enough guess what. This OVA somehow made the chararters even worse.While I didn’t like Sekai in the series for being an asspuller on screen as well having no real passion of Gunpla as a hobby least he had a few redeeming qualities like where at the end he kinda admitted that he didn’t have a real passion for Gunpla. Unfortunately now he’s just a creator’s asspulling husk where he just continues being a Gary sue idiot preaching about friendship and what’s right. It is that point where I hated Sekai more than Kira Yamato. Screw this chararters and everything that he stands for.It’s honestly hard to call Fumina a chararter at this point as now she devolved into generic harem girl 1 where her dialogue is mostly reduced to sucking Sekai dick while fighter generic harem girl 2 aka Kaoruko.Yumma is still horrendously annoying as ever as now he just a freaking stalker for Sekai Sister Mirai. HorribleThe rest of the chararters minus once again Minato who is decent are complete garbage and not worth mentioning at all.Overall like with the story the chararters are shit.2/10Visuals.Visually Gundam Build Fighters Try Island Wars pretty alright. While it’s not as good as season 1 visually it’s still a decent improved over the TV series for Try where it looked pretty choppy and ugly at times. The mecha designs are alright and they are nothing to write home about whatsoever and the animation is thankfully much better this time around as hardly any use of stock footage. Thank god!!!7/10Sound.The soundtrack once again is the best part of the series. While it’s not as memorable as Season 1 soundtrack it’s still a pretty decent soundtrack overall.The voice acting is pretty solid overall as you expect.Like with Gundam Build Fighters GM Counterattack there is no English Dub for it and for this case am glad it hasn’t been dub yet because the dub for Build Fighters Try was already bad enough and it was honestly a blessing that this will never be dubbed. I honestly can’t imagine this shit feast being dubbed and to be honest the less I think about it the better.7/10Final Thoughts.So that was Gundam Build Fighters Try Island Wars a poorly made, disjointed and harem pandering mess of an OVA that not only wastes the viewers time but it took everything that I hated about Try and made it worse to a point where the Try series as a whole is a more insufferable experience. The story was awful, the pacing was dreadful, all of the chararters were terrible and the ending was horrendous. The only decent things about this show are the visuals and music everything else is a dumpster fire of shit.I don’t recommend this ova to anyone as it will only insult your intelligence.Stay away from this OVA and the Try series as a whole.Final Score 3/10 then.

GBF (especially the ending) makes my heart cried a lot, while GBF Try (as a whole) makes me cringed a lot.The reason why you want to watch this is most likely you want to see more of Mirai and Fumina's (or Gyanko too if you like her) tits, that's it.---I personally watched Try because i watch GBF and i watch this OVA because i watch Try, and i regret it.

Instead of an OVA worth to be hyped about we get the cast who get to be testers for...a new Gunpla Battle Simulator and when things go wrong, the cast team together and pulls off the same shtick the final episode of Gundam Build Fighters did.To me, this OVA fells like just like a normal episode of Gundam Build Fighters: Try without bringing anything unique. What really got under my skin about this OVA is that it was mainly used to pamper to people who watched Gundam Build Fighters completely for a bit of fanservice.The ending left me speechless, not in a way that wants me to re-watch again and again, but in the form of cringing because the ending was so rushed and was not very compelling. Not even a single particle of awe.5/10 a new Gunpla Battle Simulator and when things go wrong, the cast team together and pulls off the same shtick the final episode of Gundam Build Fighters did.To me, this OVA fells like just like a normal episode of Gundam Build Fighters: Try without bringing anything unique.

Not even a single particle of awe.5/10', 'After the winning the tournament, we return to the buildfighters to see them in their glory by continuing to explode my senses of \'What happened?\'I will give them credit for allowing us to see the characters and side characters in action to warm up within the lime light, but I believe Build Fighters Try along with this special are completely missing the point when comparing it to the first Build Fighters. There are two main problems with Build Fighters Try.The first being the fights themselves. Don\'t get me wrong, we get some over the top action in Build Fighters Try and its special, but it\'s...how they present those action scenes that miss the bar by a long shot. That meaning that the direction of how the fights are done in general. In the beginning of try, the first few episodes that introduce the characters and side characters used fluid like animation to have their little plastic mechs move around and trade decent blows. But as the series went on, it all came down to \'Who has the best magical powers.\' That being said, the jist of it all comes down to hyper beam spamming and throwing. Despite Sekai being a fist fighter, he fires more lasers then moving his mech around to actually use those fists for the sake of...you know...FIGHTING. Most of the action we see in the special is exactly that but on a grander scale. Almost all...no, ALL of the mechs use High Mega Cannons and that blow everything in sight. Don\'t get me wrong, giant death beams are awesome, but you can\'t spam them because standing still and firing death lasers gets VERY boring after awhile. It\'s another reason why people dislike SEED and SEED Destiny\'s choreography due to the reliance of beam spamming. You need to have a good balance of close quarters combat and long range combat to really get the most out of shounen. When all the characters are basically using the same moves and aren\'t doing much in close combat, the uniqueness of characters and their mechs diminish when the only difference are just visuals. The original Try had the same problem with a few great exceptions. I see this due to animating close combat takes time and more money than just standing there and firing death lasers.The second has to be with the characters. Though Try did a bad job in characterizing their rivals and side characters due to having too many characters in the span of over 20 episodes, the special highlights on the other problem. The women in Try are terribly one noted. When I mean one noted, I mean the problems of most crappy harems have. The women are ONLY focused on one thing, the main character\'s attention. This results in the women fighting over who gets to ride the 13 year old dick who clearly doesn\'t show any signs of female interest and would rather train to get stronger. What the hell do women see in a guy who is too focused on one thing and clearly shows no interest in them? These dense harem leaders, if written well, can be hilarious. But dense main characters have become such a cliche in harems that it\'s starting to get really annoying. Just because your main character is dense doesn\'t mean the women within the show could just STRAIGHT UP TELL THE MAIN LEAD THEY HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM...but  no. That would only end the harem once the main character picks a female. If the guy is dense, THROW EVERYTHING AT HIM. TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.Fumina in the beginning of Try didn\'t show so much interest in Sekai. In fact, when Gyanko lost, Fumina did a really cute move. She got Sekai to take Gyanko on a date because she is well aware that Gyanko has feelings for Sekai...and then all of the sudden she starts forming her own interests out of blue for no reason at all. Then she starts fighting over Sekai? This characterization and change of Fumina made her quite unlikable once you remember the idea she did something nice and completely undermines it by trying to take Gyanko\'s man. Then Fumina devolves into the annoying type 2 tsundere. The kind that constantly switches from tsun to dere because she won\'t admit to Sekai how she feels. Though her characterization for the winning road was a decent idea so she can fight with her own power, it\'s a shame that the special continues to push Fumina into this awful and old as steam stereotype.Update on the above: I got my facts wrong. Fumina didn\'t suggest Gyanko and Sekai to date. Guess I remembered it wrong, but regardless, Fumina is still a flat character. The show and even this special continues to suggest that Fumina only exists for Sekai\'s oblivious harem instead of being the team leader and glue of the Try Fighters.Gyanko has a similar problem, but you gotta give her credit for being a bit forward to Sekai. The same thing goes for miss mary sue herself, Shia, to ride in on the success. Gyanko and Shia\'s existence in this OVA has only one purpose, to have the entire female cast besides Sekai\'s sister(Thank god) to fight and berate the dense fighter when he does nothing wrong. Even when all three see Sekai hang out with a small girl, they QUICKLY give him death glares and don\'t even think logically that ""Nah, Sekai is too dense for that shit anyways."" This characterization just makes the females in Build Fighter shallow and only exist to be unlikable bitches who only exist to fight over Sekai. Though they might form friendships, it\'s completely undermined.Kousaka and Sakai are undermined here too. Instead of fleshing out their rivalry a bit more, all they do is exchange some dialogue and completely left them to just skip to it and starting blowing stuff up...*Sigh*...what happened to their rivalry? Maybe if the focus wasn\'t on the harem aspect of the show that we all know for sure won\'t go anywhere, their characters just seem like a one note.And we saw it coming, everyone. We know the girl in the end was obviously Aina and Raiji\'s daughter...I mean look at her. She feels so shoe horned and basically almost murdered EVERYONE just so she can have a PLASTIC MODEL... So apparently she can make the crystals hostile...wait. If she can control them all, why didn\'t she just control that orange gunpla to fly out of there instead of just standing there and wa- Nope. Thinking too logically. Gotta have our heroes destroy endless canon fodder by endless boring death lasers... She feels so shoe horned and the way she gets away with almost killing everyone in the way because she wanted a plastic toy feels so disappointing. If she wanted a gunpla on her own, why didn\'t she just ask? Don\'t say she is Shy, because she is CLEARLY capable to walking over to Sekai and greet him.The plot itself is a mess. You know? The power goes out but CONVENIENTLY the only gunpla controller station that has power is conveniently next to the building. Didn\'t they say they ran out of power? Why that one spot? Does it have a back up generator? Well??? It was so obvious that it actually felt like the show was insulting my own intelligence. Nils isn\'t gonna report because no one got hurt? YOUR ENTIRE FACILITY IS DESTROYED. That is gonna cost A LOT of money! So how are you gonna explain that to your funders? ""Uuuuh the entire thing blew up. Lol nothing suspicious here."" I never thought that they would brush it under the rug like that.And then the ultimate nail that gets hammered into your skull comes at the bitter end. Aina and Reiji\'s daughter gets the cool orange gunpla...and Fumina says that she can\'t have it because the girl needs to make her own gunpla...Did...did they actually shoe horned in this message? And they put another BEAR GUY together, because females in gundam MUST have cute gunpla and SDs, not actually legit gundams that aren\'t feminine at all((At least Shia and Fumina can pull off actual gundams and still make them feminine))...and all done...just...This entire special is just awful. I\'m giving it a six because at least it\'s short and has some flashy lights and all...but...I\'m giving it way too much credit because the story really is bad. But I\'m giving it a bit more because the potential for Build Fighters using technology to use Gunpla outside of the base gives off SO many ideas. Especially for Try to take their story into a serious direction. But going dark and edgy and messing it all up is a recipe for disaster.-------Update: Decided to change the score to a 5. I honestly feel like giving it a six is too generous. I should be more honest with how I score shows, especially shows like this. how they present those action scenes that miss the bar by a long shot. That meaning that the direction of how the fights are done in general. In the beginning of try, the first few episodes that introduce the characters and side characters used fluid like animation to have their little plastic mechs move around and trade decent blows.

Maybe if the focus wasn\'t on the harem aspect of the show that we all know for sure won\'t go anywhere, their characters just seem like a one note.And we saw it coming, everyone. We know the girl in the end was obviously Aina and Raiji\'s daughter...I mean look at her. She feels so shoe horned and basically almost murdered EVERYONE just so she can have a PLASTIC MODEL... So apparently she can make the crystals hostile...wait. If she can control them all, why didn\'t she just control that orange gunpla to fly out of there instead of just standing there and wa- Nope. Thinking too logically. Gotta have our heroes destroy endless canon fodder by endless boring death lasers... She feels so shoe horned and the way she gets away with almost killing everyone in the way because she wanted a plastic toy feels so disappointing. If she wanted a gunpla on her own, why didn\'t she just ask? Don\'t say she is Shy, because she is CLEARLY capable to walking over to Sekai and greet him.The plot itself is a mess. You know? The power goes out but CONVENIENTLY the only gunpla controller station that has power is conveniently next to the building. Didn\'t they say they ran out of power? Why that one spot? Does it have a back up generator? Well??? It was so obvious that it actually felt like the show was insulting my own intelligence. Nils isn\'t gonna report because no one got hurt? YOUR ENTIRE FACILITY IS DESTROYED. That is gonna cost A LOT of money! So how are you gonna explain that to your funders? ""Uuuuh the entire thing blew up. Lol nothing suspicious here."" I never thought that they would brush it under the rug like that.And then the ultimate nail that gets hammered into your skull comes at the bitter end. Aina and Reiji\'s daughter gets the cool orange gunpla...and Fumina says that she can\'t have it because the girl needs to make her own gunpla...Did...did they actually shoe horned in this message? And they put another BEAR GUY together, because females in gundam MUST have cute gunpla and SDs, not actually legit gundams that aren\'t feminine at all((At least Shia and Fumina can pull off actual gundams and still make them feminine))...and all done...just...This entire special is just awful. I\'m giving it a six because at least it\'s short and has some flashy lights and all...but...I\'m giving it way too much credit because the story really is bad. But I\'m giving it a bit more because the potential for Build Fighters using technology to use Gunpla outside of the base gives off SO many ideas. Especially for Try to take their story into a serious direction. But going dark and edgy and messing it all up is a recipe for disaster.-------Update: Decided to change the score to a 5. I honestly feel like giving it a six is too generous. I should be more honest with how I score shows, especially shows like this.']"
Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35567/Gundam_Build_Fighters__Battlogue,"[""Gundam Build Fighters was a resounding success back in 2013, showing us how incredible it is to be a Gundam fan, and especially a Gunpla fan, with all sorts of references to Mobile Suits and events of the shows. It was the perfect setting for a series about giant robots that is simply about giant robots doing kickass shit without the need for collateral damage or war-related drama, instead making this effectively sports series about Gunpla fans. So, when we started getting continuations and spinoffs such as Build Fighters Try, and GM no Gyakushuu, we were certainly spoiled for choice in terms of seeing cool...new iterations of mobile suits and cool battles involving past suits, but there was always this itch, this craving that we wish would be addressed...Cue Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue. It advertised itself as this haven for Gundam dream matches akin to the immensely popular Death Battle youtube series. However, as the months went by, that itch started popping up again and we started feeling at least somewhat disappointed by this ONA and what it initially promised us. That is unfortunately this show's biggest failure, even if the action in general is still its biggest success.For example: episode 1 is mainly comprised of a simulation where Char Aznable from the Universal Century Timeline, and Ribbons Almark from the Anno Domini Timeline. Both of them operate new machines based on their canonical mobile suits, and this is what we had been wanting all along. Unfortunately, the next 4 episodes all starred Build Fighters characters either battling one another or alongside each other, battling a Perfect Grade Exia (which incidentally marks the first Perfect Grade kit to be featured in the franchise), or weirdly enough, two characters becoming SD Gunpla Bear Magical Girls. The worst part is that these episodes were released monthly, and we only had 5 of them. Just imagine how incredible it would have been do dedicate an episode to a battle between Hiro Yui from Gundam WIng vs Setsuna F. Seiei from Gundam 00, or Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam vs Shinn Asuka from SEED Destiny. The possibilities were endless! We could have had episodes like these on occasion (particularly episode 4) to sort of break that up and offer something different on occasion, but understandably, we do feel at least a little cheated, given that the rest of the ONA felt like a bait and switch for he sake of solidifying that this is still a Build Fighters show when it could've easily been Build Fighters characters introducing or even tinkering with these match-ups like in episode 1. Not to mention it also serves as a reminder to many just how annoying and childish the Try characters are (especially given how the actual child characters from the original were more mature), even if we do still get to spend more time with some of the infinitely ore likable Build Fighters characters such as Sei, Kawaguchi, and especially Rinko. Even the Renato brothers are fun, especially with how episode 4 ended.However, the fights we got were still pretty fun to watch, like the Char vs Ribbons fight in episode 1, and the Renato brothers vs Exia and other 00 Units in episode 4. However, the fights certainly aren't as well-animated or as flashy and pulse-pounding as in the original seres, where the sheer impact of the attacks and the emotions and situations of the characters made every battle feel as climactic as a major battle in some of the better Gundam series. A few bad moments aside, these are still fun battles with a few cool new designs, mainly the two Gunpla that battle in episode 5. As a side-note before wrapping things up, the music doesn't have any new additions barring the decent ED and the small track that plays at the beginning and at the teaser post-credits.So while we were robbed of the itch-scratching we craved involving these dream matches this show advertised to us, we still got to see some enjoyable battles unfold, for better or worse. It was a bit of a disappointment though, and having some of the old characters back doesn't really fix the issue. It was, if nothing else, an interesting and unique entity in the franchise. Unfortunately, GM no Gyakushuu is without a doubt, the superior of the two main Build Fighters projects that came out this year, if partially because it stuck with what it promised us all the way through. new iterations of mobile suits and cool battles involving past suits, but there was always this itch, this craving that we wish would be addressed...Cue Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue.

Gundam Build series help us that, by freeing our imagination far and wide inside gundam universe. This concept is very spectacular, especially for gundam freaks, it\'s kind of heavenly. But concept doesn\'t always executed properly. Gundam build series anime fall exactly at this point. Except this one title : Battlogue.GBF Battlogue is all about gundam battle in a particular setting. So there\'s only thin story, except the story of battle itself - if we can call that a story. Despite its thin story, the quality of that story speaks quite well. Each...episode has their own story, most are little expansions of stories from GBF anime season 1 and 2. That is a good thing, even more so because it\'s written with consistency.Another aspect of story that Battlogue has a very high point is the references for Gundam universe. In such a short episode, there are some (if not many) references shown to please gundam freaks. Dig it deep, swim in the gundam universe, and we\'ll know how to appreciate those references.Gundam Build series always falls in the aspect of animation, except for a few, early episodes in season 1-3. Battlogue, however, gave us one of the best animation in Gundam Build series in each episode. The animation is fluid, quite clear, nice colored, with many movements, etc. Such a pleasant thing to watch. It is important to note that Battlogue animation has more ""realistic"" feels than ""shounen-ic"" feels like season 1-2 (meaning, Battlogue isn\'t that flashy)Another pleasant thing in Gundam Build series is the strong feel of ""shounen"" vibe. Im not talking about flashiness here, but a feel that make our heart trembles in excitement. It makes our heart unrest with such a joyful flame inside. The battle animation surely gives us this vibe, but the musics amplify this vibe by leaps and bounds. The musics have such a strong nuance of shounen and very fit to the battles shown. One can\'t help but feel ""something is very lacking"" when watching gunpla battle without a proper music. But nothing to worry, Battlogue gave us the best for this aspect.To conclude this review, GBF Battlogue is the best Gundam Build series ever, because it could execute the concept very well. Im well aware that we can\'t fully see this title as a separate thing from GBF season 1 and 2, but nevertheless it has different title and the quality differs greatly from the previous seasons. For Gundam Build fans, it\'s recommended to watch Battlogue as a pretty nice, closing, after-taste from season 1 and 2. episode has their own story, most are little expansions of stories from GBF anime season 1 and 2.

Hanaukyou Maid-tai: La Verite,https://myanimelist.net/anime/649/Hanaukyou_Maid-tai__La_Verite,"['I\'ll try to keep this short and to the point!La Verite is apparently a remake of the original, i skipped the first one and went straight for this remake. One guy, surrounded by hundreds of maids. How can you go wrong?I liked this anime for many reasons, its a ""feel-good"" anime that doesn\'t force you to think constantly. I love these animes when they do it right, i feel La Verite did it great!It has enough of a story and character development to make it interesting throughout the whole show. Probably Verite\'s strongest point is its characters, i found it interesting learning all the maids...(that are closest to Taro) backrounds and quirks. My favorite maid is probably Yashima. (Shes just really funny day-dreaming about Konae, reminds me vaguely of Hosaka from Minami-ke)They don\'t get deep into the story until the last 3-4 episodes, but they do hint at it throughout the series. Didn\'t find myself bored on a single episode, which is quite rare for me.This is my first review, your criticism (in the form of helpful/not helpful is appreciated, Thanks!)

"", ""~Review~Anime InformationAnime Production : m.o.eDirector: Takuya NonakaEpisodes: 12 episodesGenres: Action, Comedy, Drama, Ecchi, Harem, Maids, Romance, Slice of LifeDuration: 23 min. per episodeOriginal Run: 4 April 2004 – 20 June 2004...SynopsisAfter losing his mother, 12-year-old Taro journeys to Tokyo to live with his grandfather. But he gets the biggest surprise when he discovers that his grandfather’s home is a huge mansion with hundreds of beautiful maids ready to serve him. Making matters worse (at least for Taro, but not for our viewing) is that not only does he inherit the Hanaukyo mansion, he gets the services of all of the maids 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A sudden change in his life, can he manage it?Storyline: [8/10]Well, first of all we need to know is this is an anime was a remake of the anime ‘Hanaukyo Maid-tai’ that release in 2001. With 4 years gap, this anime have many significant improvement in many aspects. This anime storyline is still the same as original, that’s for sure, but of course with some change and improvement. Frankly to say, from storyline perspective, this anime greatly exceeds from the original ones.I can tell this anime undergo such a heavy improvement. What lack from the original ones, this anime completes it. This anime storyline is not flat course and also not a slow pace nime anymore. There is a ‘real’ conflict now in this anime. You can now feel the tension and the conflict built up from first episode through the end. Some of the episode from original anime appears again with a few adjustment. In terms of drama, this anime now have a deep drama story and also wrap in much more attractive way.All aspect from action, comedy, drama, ecchi, harem, maids, romance, slice of life now balance in this anime. Life lesson storyline still there. Although, for me, there is some ‘twist event’ part from the storyline who become a bit of a question and strange to connect but I have to say, WTH! Just go fo it!Art: [8/10]This anime is also undergo so much improvemant in terms of art. The whole character now seems has a unique attribute beside their hair, their clothes and the color of their clothes. Mariel in the original have a purple hair, now she have a blue one and somehow remind me of KOS-MOS from Xenosaga series. Somehow the whole character have all this mature face but of course, they still not lose their cute and funny facial expressions.Back in the original anime, the art was so-so for me but in this remake, the art was great. Many detail in this anime greatly focus and what more great is that some specific art that come from original anime is carried on in this anime without any change. For me, that’s what make this remake special.Mariel still have that soothing eyes. Konoe still have that serious eyes. Ikuyo with her big round glasses and Chynthia still have that innocent look back in the original anime. It’s a great thing to see.Sound: [7/10]I like the OP very much. It have the same feeling from original OP so it is a very nostalgic, for me. The ED is so-so for me. Back in original ED and now, they still using the 'three stooges' maids as a concept for ED.Character: [7/10]There is no big change in character from main character to supporting character, which is good for me and also because this a remake so they shouldn’t mess up too much in this part. The great thing is now Tarou doesn’t have a woman-touch allergy back in the original anime. Mariel became much more mature with more showing his motherly nature sense and much more appealing in term of the ‘perfect’ maid now rather then back in original anime. It is a bit shock for me that she is actually 16 years old.Konoe who in original anime only show that she is strict person with little sense of womanhood, in this remake, Konoe show that she actually have a feminine side and a soft spot for dogs but rarely show to the other.Ikuyo still have her smiley invention thing with now more and more witty and prankish than Ikuyo from her original anime was. There is no big change in Chynthia and Grace personality. Back in original anime their name was Ichigo, Ringo and Sango aka Strawberry, Apple and Maple but now their name is Lemon, Marron and Melon with no big change either, at least they still lust for Tarou as ever.And there are also Yashima Sanae, a new character who make her first appearance in this anime with her jump-on-to-conclusion type. She highly adore (close to love, I think!) Konoe and sometimes this often lead her to daydreaming up various lesbian fantasies with Konoe. This is a good thing for me because back in the original anime, they already have this ‘unique’ and in this remake, they strongly make this ‘unique’ more appealing. Which is wonderful!Enjoyment: [8/10]It is really fun to see this anime and much more exciting if you watch from the original anime. There still life lesson in there, some words of wisdom and wise remarks also. I personally rather difficult to choose which word should I quote because in this anime, there are lots of it.This anime is really giving a new different aura from the original. You can still see that this is all still about the journey of Tarou Hanaukyo life. Back in my earlier post about the original anime review, I said there are this question who become a base of this anime such as how does a boy become a man? How can a boy who for all his life just became the master for himself, must now  become the head of the huge, wealthy and respectful family? What kind of leader he become? And what kind of master he become for all his maids? Back in the original one, this question seemed to be unnotice to regular eyes but in this remake, this question is actually ask to be notice by us and somehow that gives me much more pleasure and enjoyment to watch this anime.Overall: [8/10]Fan service is better than before. All aspect of this anime and genres is in the right portions. This anime tempo is steady not slow like the original and although each episode still have a different set of story but now this anime have a purpose, have a conflict that which makes this anime interesting. Although only in small portion but the action itself is great and fun to watch.Interesting point is beside from all this change and improvement, this anime doesn’t lose touch of the original anime. The struggle, the sacrifice, the joy and the happiness of the journey of Tarou Hanaukyo life seem more appealing than before. We can see much better change from a boy of Tarou Hanaukyo into a man of Tarao Hanaukyo, a family head of his family. For a remake, it's a success for them because they have managed to remake this anime so well.Personal message and opinion:This anime basically excel from his predecessor. Although you can see this anime without seeing the original first but there is much satisfaction, pleasure and enjoyment watch from the original. We can see the history of it, the different of it, the same of it, the unique of it and many more. It is really so much enjoyment for me.Back in my earlier post about the original anime review, I said there is something is missing? Now I know what missing. Although the original anime have those kind of feelings but something seems empty, hollow. It turns out though the original anime has feelings but those feeling is empty, it lost his heart. In this anime, they seems to correct that in a great way. SynopsisAfter losing his mother, 12-year-old Taro journeys to Tokyo to live with his grandfather.

Little kid is benefactor to billions, has an army of maids that will do anything for him, etc. We know the storyline. And that\'s fine. The genre exists because shows that do it right can be fun. (See Hayate no Gotoku, Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de, even Ah! My Goddess) A fantasy escape of sorts.But this is none of those things. In fact, this show is worse, because it had potential and bombed. First, it starts off as a complete...ecchi comedy. Episode 1 is 95% ecchi with one-liner jokes and the main character running around his big castle trying to get away from a thousand naked girls trying to smother him (which by the way is getting real old. What boy aged 12 to 90 would do that?) Now guess how much that happens the rest of the remaining 11 episodes? Maybe twice. The show then completely flips into some kind of sob story about his main maid and how her ""secret"" might tear them apart.So fail part 1: absolutely no tone or theme is set up, leading the watcher down a road of certain disappointment.Second, what little hint we get of a protagonist is actually some busty chick who is god-moded the few times we see her to where there\'s little hope of anyone beating her until all that\'s left for the artist to do in order to back himself out of his own corner is to come up with a rediculous deus ex machina that borders on razziedom. Seriously terrible. I almost am tempted to reveal what happens just to save you all from it.Third, there\'s no conclusion. No one grows from this. It\'s like it\'s back at day one when the final episode concludes. Apparantly, the end is supposed to set up a ""2nd season"" but there\'s no reason for anyone to want more. That\'s like asking for more food-poisoning after throwing up all over the bathroom. You throw the bad food out is what you do.Avoid this show like you avoid viruses. Please. ecchi comedy. Episode 1 is 95% ecchi with one-liner jokes and the main character running around his big castle trying to get away from a thousand naked girls trying to smother him (which by the way is getting real old. What boy aged 12 to 90 would do that?) Now guess how much that happens the rest of the remaining 11 episodes? Maybe twice. The show then completely flips into some kind of sob story about his main maid and how her ""secret"" might tear them apart.So fail part 1: absolutely no tone or theme is set up, leading the watcher down a road of certain disappointment.Second, what little hint we get of a protagonist is actually some busty chick who is god-moded the few times we see her to where there\'s little hope of anyone beating her until all that\'s left for the artist to do in order to back himself out of his own corner is to come up with a rediculous deus ex machina that borders on razziedom. Seriously terrible. I almost am tempted to reveal what happens just to save you all from it.Third, there\'s no conclusion. No one grows from this. It\'s like it\'s back at day one when the final episode concludes. Apparantly, the end is supposed to set up a ""2nd season"" but there\'s no reason for anyone to want more. That\'s like asking for more food-poisoning after throwing up all over the bathroom. You throw the bad food out is what you do.Avoid this show like you avoid viruses. Please.', ""Hanaukyo Maid-tai: La Verite: Overall Rating 6/10I personally thought the beginning of this anime was very boring, but I had to give it a shot. After watching the whole anime I can say it was alright for an anime. I was going to give it a 5, but it was alright for an anime so I changed my mind and gave it a 6.This anime is whacky in way, it starts off with a young boy named Taro Hanaukyo a 14 year old who is going to be staying with his grandfather because his mother has passed away. All of that change's though when his...grandfarther leaves the mansion, for some unknown reason. He is now the new master of his grandfathers mansion, and inheritance of the Hanaukyo family. The maid that tells him this is Mariel, a beautiful young woman that is kind and is completely dedicated to pleaseing her master at any cost, remember this it's important.Taro Hanaukyo is then greeted by all the maids at his grandfathers mansion as soon as he gets there. Every single maid greets the young Taro. At first he seems to be having a bit of trouble living like this, but eventually he gets the hang of it. There is a love interest for the young Taro. Taro has a special relationship with one of his maids although she doesn't seem to notice it, some of the other maids already knew.Story wise the anime focuses on Taro Hanaukyo and his maid's. Some of the maids think he's some bratty child and they assume he can't live up to his grandfathers name. Until they get to know Taro personally, one by one they slowly but surely accept him not as there master but as a person and a friend. Most of them find out that he's actually really mature when he need's to be. The beginning of the series is really random and happens for no reason most of the time. Until it get's half way through, then you'll start to care and it begins to get serious.There are a few heart warming moments in this anime but they don't last very long. The character development is really slow paced. They could of done better job of introducing them. So this anime was alright, but you probably won't really fall head over heels for it. grandfarther leaves the mansion, for some unknown reason.

Home!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48577/Home,"[""Home! is one of many short one-shot anime created as part of Japan's animator training projects. In the year 2124, a man named Christopher (whose name isn't mentioned in-universe) is on a research expedition in Mars, but comes across a crashed spaceship. Unfortunately, he discovers there are no survivors, only the skeletal remains of those who perished. He decides to take it upon himself to gather the remains of the dead and send them to Earth so their families can have some degree of closure. But when the ghost of a little girl tries to communicate with him, he is understandably freaked out, though the...girl continues to try and reach out to him. This anime is only seven minutes long, so you can complete this without much trouble.But if you're coming here looking for a fun time, this isn't it. Home! is very dark in its atmosphere and imagery. Skeletal remains, including those belonging to children, are shown without censorship, often with hair and clothes still stuck on them. The ghost girl is shown with several body parts missing, another reason why Christopher is so scared of her at first. Granted, it still has a fairly warm and hopeful outlook, as Home! ends on a bittersweet yet optimistic note. I liked the story okay, though I wish it had been explored more, since we don't know anything about what's going on, and the characters aren't even given names, with Christopher's being mentioned in plot summaries and never in-universe. I did find the ghost girl to be a bit annoying, and I don't really get why she never actually spoke. All she did was laugh and pull pranks on Christopher.The animation was done by Studio Orange, which is responsible for primarily 3DCG anime such as Land of the Lustrous and Beastars. CGI doesn't always work in anime, especially when trying to make an entire anime in that style, but Orange has proven to be one of the few studios that actually cares about trying to make its CGI animation look good and not like weird jerky plastic robots, unlike, say, Polygon Pictures or the animators that worked on the abomination that is Ex-Arm. The human designs here are...okay, but they're kind of generic and don't really stand out in any way. It does help that this anime only has two characters shown on screen, so the mininalist cast does help them stand out to an extent. I don't have much to say on the soundtrack, as I found it kind of bland.Unfortunately, the characters are where the short suffers. Because Home! is only seven minutes long, it doesn't have much time to develop them, and often times, Christopher seems to change his personality without much rhyme or reason. He starts off calm and rational, but the second he sees the ghost girl, he turns into a spineless screaming wimp, and then goes right back to his original personality when he's out of there. Granted, the reason he does this is understandable, but I feel like had the anime been longer and took more time to develop him, he'd feel more like an organic character. The ghost girl doesn't have this problem, but her only personality traits are being cheerful and mischievous, that's it. Most anime can develop characters and show their personalities through animation, without the need for dialogue, and most of them pull this off well. But Orange's character animation is still rather stiff, and I never really felt like they did much to bring the characters to life.Eh, Home! isn't really anything special.

Anne no Nikki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3829/Anne_no_Nikki,"['On June 12th, 1929, about ten-years before the start of World War II, Annelies Marie Frank was born to parents Otto and Edith Frank in Frankfurt, Germany. Rendered stateless by the Nazis in 1941, and without any means to flee the country, Anne and her family were forced into confinement for two-years in a cramped attic to avoid persecution. While staying there, Anne documented her life in a now famous diary, which has since been adapted into movies, plays, and even an anime.It was surprising to learn that an anime of Anne Frank’s diary had been made—by Madhouse, no less, one of my favorite studios....I’d known about Anne’s story for a while, but I avoided it because I feared that it might be too depressing for me to handle. Regardless, my curiosity for this especially unique adaptation eventually got the best of me, and I relented.As expected, this story was difficult to watch. Even seemingly peaceful moments are underpinned by anxiety and melancholy that keeps you from ever feeling at ease. The presence of the Nazis encroaching the lives of Anne and her family are always felt even when they’re not seen. And Anne and her family weren’t the only victims of this time. There were countless other families and individuals across central-Europe who were made to endure similar struggles. It all ultimately begs the questions: Why did this have to happen? How could such paranoid hatred develop?A lot of care was put into the production of Anne no Nikki. The character designs matched their real-life counterparts, and the animation was often inbetweened on twos, resulting in a lifelike fluidity atypical of anime animation. The soundtrack was minimalist, lightly enhancing the atmosphere of particular moments without being a distraction.Furthermore, I appreciated the subtlety of the directing. People are portrayed as historical figures rather than as characters. A naturalistic approach is taken that resists the temptation to exaggerate for the sake of dramatic effect. The sedate pacing might be trying for less patient viewers, but a more energetic portrayal wouldn’t have rung true to the actual events that this adaptation drew from.If I had to dig deep for a flaw, I’d say that there was an occasional tinge of sentimentality, which, considering the strong emotions that were already present, didn’t feel necessary. Despite this, the heart and salient moral lesson that Anne no Nikki paints more than compensates for any apparent flaws.

However, when I was Anne's age and bullied for being Jewish I related to her a lot and tried to learn everything I could about her. So with that, I will start this review.Okay, first off the story! Wow! So much is wrong! And a lot of things are downplayed way too much. Like Anne's and Petter's romance, Anne's friends, Anne's problems with her mother, the friction between the van Daan's and the Franks, also that they all knew each other before coming! The helpers are...also really downplayed, that really bothered me. They only showed Meip doing things for them, even when Meip comes over she came with Bep. I feel like I'm really disliking this for how much I know, but it's a problem, there's just so much that's wrong and it's really hard to get into to boot! I'm going to give the story a soiled three.The art... it was better with the pictures on the wall than on the characters. The best was with the Franks, but even with them, I kept getting confused who was who when they weren't talking. The van Daan's could've been better, Mr. van Daan was a bit too fat, and Mrs. van Daan was too skinny, she's a bit of a plump woman. Petter is alright though, I guess. Mr. Dussel, okay side track moment! Fun fact, Dussel in German means Nincompoop! Okay, back to the review! He was way too fat and looked nothing like his real-life counterpart. With Meip, she looked a bit too much like the Franks, only thing different is basically the hair color. The art was very underwhelming, considering I've seen movies that are older than this one with better art. I'm giving this a 2.Sound, there isn't much to say I guess. I felt like the voice actors were really lacking though. Also, the ost isn't anything I would listen too, it's really meh and forgettable. Although it wasn't horrible so I'll give this a 4.Character... I wasn't impressed, especially with the Anne Frank. She was a normal girl! She loved movies, she loved to travel, she loved ice skating, and she loved the outdoors. She was very hot-headed and very sweet, she loved romance! And she came out as a very bland character, which is really disappointing to me. Margot, they didn't do much about her, even going to hiding was really downplayed with how much in danger she was in. Everyone else is basically just there. At least they did attempt to show how close Anne and Otto were. I'm giving this a 1.My enjoyment... well it took me two days to finish this movie, that's pretty bad. It was really hard for me to get into, and I wish I could like this, but I just can't. I'm giving it a 3 and an overall 3.With all this said, I am happy this was made, as it shows that they tried to do something. It's very rare to see Jews in anime at all, which kinda makes me sad. Cause I like to be included, I'm not religious I am Jewish by blood. So I hope that Japan tries to bring in more things like this I guess.

Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5755/Aoki_Ryuusei_SPT_Layzner_OVA,"[""Highly recommended for anyone who has watched the original Layzner series. Unfortunately it was cancelled before it could be properly concluded but the third episode of the OVA addresses this by including a more complete ending. I believed the themes of the show resonated more strongly in the new additions the OVA included compared to the series.While at times, the pacifism of both Eiji and his sister Julia came across as preachy and inappropriate considering the circumstances they faced, here that stance is finally justified and Julia takes on a much more active role compared to just being someone for Eiji to save throughout the...second half of the original show.I would rate the OVA higher but it carries many of the flaws the original series had. Most of the villains, with the exception of Gail, are very one dimensional and pure evil with no redeeming characteristics. And also, this is more of a super robot show than a real robot series one would expect considering Ryosuke Takahashi's other works. There's not much tension when all Eiji has to do is enter his V-Max mode to win.The opening animation and song is exceptional as well as the closing song, which is used aptly to conclude the series. Aside from that though the music throughout the show is somewhat repetitive. Also, I found the lasers the mecha would shoot to be not as appealing compared to the ballistics and beam weapons from other series. The lasers were for the most part just jagged lines and there wasn't much of a sense of impact with them.There were also confusing time skips, even before the official cancellation point that detracted from the viewing experience.

It can be a little rushed given that it’s only around 25 mutinies long and it doesn’t really add anything to actually series itself so fans of the series won’t miss anything big if they do skip this.A noticeable difference between this and the series is that there is...more blood and gore scenes then before, and the plot is very dark at points. Unlike the original series which sometimes failed at adding darker themes to the show, they actually succeed in this and the plot benefits from it a lot.Jo and Meg are the stars of the OVA and they are as brilliant as they were in the main series, the only problem is that there is very little in terms of character development and it just feels like a little filler episode in character terms.The animation is a big step up from the series; it seems more polished and clearer then before and this is especially true with the smooth character animations and the brilliant CGI.The incidental music is the same as the series, which isn’t a bad thing at as it adds menace to the darker side of this story.

If you\'re not into this type of anime, you might not enjoy it.This is another Netflix reboot of an older, popular anime with new graphics that manages to buck the trend by being (OMG Gasp) GOOD instead of disappointing like some others I won\'t mention. A large part of this is because it is 100% completely on brand with the original and in the spirit of the manga from way back in the late 1980s when things weren\'t as politically correct as they are today. The anime...is tagged Ecchi for good reason, and it\'s not even tasteful Ecchi, but rather, no apologies no f---s given Ecchi.

He\'s handsome, spends a lot of time semi nude showing off his 12 pack abs and toned physique. Believing he is God\'s gift to women he shamelessly chases, gropes and attempts to charm into bed any attractive female within reach while loudly proclaiming how great he is. He also happens to be overpowered and dressed in plot armor like you wouldn\'t believe, so things go his way a lot of the time. In today\'s updated parlance he would have graduated from Bastard!! to F--- that F---ing MF\'er, if the censors only allowed it.The plot is largely predictable, the characters well drawn stereotypes, nice animation and a decent OST that fits the vibe of the anime. Female characters are barely dressed with gravity defying boobs while the males are GAR type muscleheads that seem brainless. The dialogue is cheesy and cringe in parts.The fights are over the top with more explosions than a Michael Bay movie.

Any metal head will enjoy the metal references but comes up short in the actual music department. Heavy Metal is something you would expect from this show but you'll only get like 3 light metal songs and a bunch of metal references. They only reference 3/4 of the big four for some reason.

With an annual ritual that has 15 years, old kids gather in order to be given their personal Grimoire, a mage book that only them can use. Asta and Yuno, two orphan childhood friends make their way to the event, while Yuno gets his legendary Grimoire that resembles the first emperor's, Asta was let down and never got his own Grimoire, making him ridiculed in front of everybody, but not until he accidentally somehow awaken his true powers, and gets an even more high-class legendary Grimoire of his own in the most cliché way possible. I bet you've got to at least have heard of a similar synopsis. A lot of people accuse the writer to have plagiarised the Naruto and Fairy Tail, but it is faintly noticed that it tries to remain as original as it can. The humor wasn't the best aside from some unexpected weird expressions. The pacing was good at most, showing you a glimpse of different things, and the backstory was simple and harmless at work.- Art (7.8/10):Not what I'd call a superb one. The CGI parts were just horrible, and the art style was being conflicted sometimes like a hybrid of many other art styles. The character's eyes looked uneven and weird, especially Asta's, and generic background crown couldn't look more generic. The color palette reminds me a little bit of Skyrim for how gloomy and medieval it sounds, it makes perfect for the probable era the setting is set up at.- Sound (5/10):I had a light headache before watching this one, and Asta's voice only made it worse. The guy doesn't know how to catch a break. Some other voice actors sound very forced, boring or over-dramatic. The soundtracks weren't as noticeable or anything, I just can't think of something good to praise here.- Character (6.5/10):I was eager to reach this stage, Asta, how do I put it. The emperor of magic? more like the emperor of quibbling, constant screaming and nagging, dude, take it easy. And then there is Yuno, the classic hot, claim semi-emo boy that give you the expectations of him turning a villain at some point. I couldn't give more attention to other characters are the special went deep with the relationship of Yuno and Asta backing their feelings up.- Enjoyment (8.0/10):As much flaws as it had, it really picked interest for me to check out the main series, it's been a long time since I last saw Naruto, so even if it was a straight up copy-pasta I would still like to keep up with this longer and see where it's headed. I like the lore that can be milked from mage stories, and the medieval setting overall just feels nice to see other than the Isekai stuff.- Overall (6.8/10):I believe that for newcomers that are interested in watching Black Clover, this can serve as a better replacement for the 3 episodes rule most of the people tend to rely on in determining whether to finish a show or not. It introduces a lot of aspects of the series very briefly and effectively and was overall a mediocre sneak peak on the world of Black Clover. that personally was fascinating.- Story (6.5/10):In a world where magic is everything, a world ruled by the magic emperor who under him serves all of humanity.

Asta and Yuno, two orphan childhood friends make their way to the event, while Yuno gets his legendary Grimoire that resembles the first emperor's, Asta was let down and never got his own Grimoire, making him ridiculed in front of everybody, but not until he accidentally somehow awaken his true powers, and gets an even more high-class legendary Grimoire of his own in the most cliché way possible. I bet you've got to at least have heard of a similar synopsis. A lot of people accuse the writer to have plagiarised the Naruto and Fairy Tail, but it is faintly noticed that it tries to remain as original as it can. The humor wasn't the best aside from some unexpected weird expressions. The pacing was good at most, showing you a glimpse of different things, and the backstory was simple and harmless at work.- Art (7.8/10):Not what I'd call a superb one. The CGI parts were just horrible, and the art style was being conflicted sometimes like a hybrid of many other art styles. The character's eyes looked uneven and weird, especially Asta's, and generic background crown couldn't look more generic. The color palette reminds me a little bit of Skyrim for how gloomy and medieval it sounds, it makes perfect for the probable era the setting is set up at.- Sound (5/10):I had a light headache before watching this one, and Asta's voice only made it worse. The guy doesn't know how to catch a break. Some other voice actors sound very forced, boring or over-dramatic. The soundtracks weren't as noticeable or anything, I just can't think of something good to praise here.- Character (6.5/10):I was eager to reach this stage, Asta, how do I put it. The emperor of magic? more like the emperor of quibbling, constant screaming and nagging, dude, take it easy. And then there is Yuno, the classic hot, claim semi-emo boy that give you the expectations of him turning a villain at some point. I couldn't give more attention to other characters are the special went deep with the relationship of Yuno and Asta backing their feelings up.- Enjoyment (8.0/10):As much flaws as it had, it really picked interest for me to check out the main series, it's been a long time since I last saw Naruto, so even if it was a straight up copy-pasta I would still like to keep up with this longer and see where it's headed. I like the lore that can be milked from mage stories, and the medieval setting overall just feels nice to see other than the Isekai stuff.- Overall (6.8/10):I believe that for newcomers that are interested in watching Black Clover, this can serve as a better replacement for the 3 episodes rule most of the people tend to rely on in determining whether to finish a show or not. It introduces a lot of aspects of the series very briefly and effectively and was overall a mediocre sneak peak on the world of Black Clover.""]"

It looks almost as if it was a picture. The plot is very good too, although it's better developed in the 7-episodes sequel, Candy☆Boy. It doesn't really have songs included, just some instrumental and sounds of nature and the surroundings; it's very good anyhow.It's a very short serie that can be watched in less than 10 mins, literally :P. It is very enjoyable for how brief it is. I recommend everyone to watch this and it's sequel. "", ""We already had a prequel episode but here's an even more prequel one. It's a look at how the girls first got their dorm and decided sleeping in the same bed. The apartment they got for while they're at school is this real run down place that doesn't even look like a proper dorm and has a convenience store under it. The blonde sister cheers the other up and they go get ice cream. I liked the interaction between them for the most part. It was a cute little episode about making the best of what looked like a bad situation.It's soured a bit by...the weird incest and love triangle plot this story leads into, if this was just a short special in isolation I think it'd be great. So... 6/10 I guess the weird incest and love triangle plot this story leads into, if this was just a short special in isolation I think it'd be great. So... 6/10 I guess"", ""Informative Review.This is Candy Boy at the *very beginning* of the entire series. It features both MCs Kanade and Yukino in their time exploring the area they reside in Tokyo and going over a little about the new life they will soon take on. For the most part, it functions as an average s.o.l should so I would use that as a means of determining whether or not you want to watch this. I personally found it good at that.The art is high quality for its time, looks very good. OST isn't particularly memorable here.I watched this in release order, and it didn't particularly hinder...my experience as I watched episode 0 (the chronological sequel) before this. But I'd say watch it in chronological order as it paves a nice path for the series, but really you choose which way you want to go with this. my experience as I watched episode 0 (the chronological sequel) before this.

People were starved for content. If you thought Citrus was questionable, this is 100x worse. The animation and styling of the characters is great. However, that is all it really has going for it. Candy Boy is about a love affair between a pair of biological twins. Throughout the episodes there is tension and pining. I watched this in middle school so like any other yuri fan at the time, I watched it and liked that lesbian romance was shown in anime. If you somehow ignore the fact that they are...twins, the romance and dynamic are really good. However as an adult this is not it. twins, the romance and dynamic are really good.

Bubuki Buranki: Hoshi no Kyojin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33041/Bubuki_Buranki__Hoshi_no_Kyojin,"[""Bubuki Buranki: Hoshi no Kyojin, the show nobody really asked for, but we got it anyway.Before I being I’d like to thank Richard Eisenbeis from Anime-Now for his wonderful interview (What BBK/BRNK is Really About) with the director, Komatsuda. I believe that reading his interview will also help those who plan to watch season two grasp a deeper and better understanding of Bubuki Buranki's narrative.Perhaps the most noticeable change is that production value seemed to have increased.While not particularity special, considering most studios try to improve quality of their work, this was actually a nice change of pace.  With season one...the characters walking animations, body reaction and facial reactions appeared very robotic. This time I noticed that they improved it to the point where there are more “human-like” characteristics. There were times where I could see “robotic” like movements because CGI and all, but so far it seems that the animators have a better understanding of how to give their characters realistic movements.A majority of the cities and other populated areas felt complete, despite lacking life and background activities. At most you'd see a handful of people that aren't main and supporting characters walking around however, they have a limited amount of interaction. Once you see it, it's actually kind of funny. This lack of activity coupled with not so interesting dialogue from the characters ruin a majority of the beautiful scenes that the show has to offers. Honestly, it comes off as a waste of money.Finally, as far as the art and animation goes, CGI is still a work in progress. There are too many scenes that look sloppy and incomplete. Of course these minor problems can be fix via Blu-Ray however, a first impression is always important... not to mention that the sales for CGI based anime aren't that great.Moving on to the story, in season two character developments & growth appeared to be the main focus. Backstories and new developments in the plot were gradually revealed however, they didn’t seem prominent enough or featured as much throughout the story. One of the things I had been looking forward to in season 2 was an in-depth look and better explanation about who these characters are via backstories. I was just a little disappointed with the information given. (I’m trying to keep information minimal because spoilers.)The story tends to lack engagement, action, and intensity. Not to mention that the dialogue between characters feels dull. No matter what's happening in the story, the action doesn't seem to capture my attention. A huge battle could occur, and the lack of intensity or poor choice in adding comedic moments ruin particular scenes. Comic relief wasn't even a strong-point for the title. Overall the story is painfully weak and unimpressive.The Sound department wasn’t impressive either. The music composed for the series didn't leave much of an impact during the duration of the show. No particular songs stand out during battles or scenes of emotions. The sound effects for settings are lackluster. Often times it appeared as if the staff didn't even put sound effects or background noise in certain scenes. This poor choice in direction makes scenes feel bland and boring. The voice actors were pretty good. Never really had any complaints.Characters feel the same as last season; albeit with minor changes to personality due to development. Of course these aren't permanent changes that effect a characters behavior & action because they go right back to acting the same way they used to.My enjoyment for this season.. I was highly disappointed. I want to say that this series felt rushed. In fact, I'm going to assume that! With the lack of interactive environments, interesting narrative, and personality in the characters. This season just seemed to be a waste of time.Overall you can skip Bubuki Buranki: Hoshi no Kyojin. The only major difference in the series is quality, everything else just falls flat. I gave this show a rating of 5 because it could've been much better in the story department. The characters could've been less one dimensional, and finally there is just too much wasted potential of the series.

If you're a newcomer whose checking the series out, then here are some basics.Plot(7)- The plot starts off a bit slow, the first 6 episodes of season 1 were OK(same with the first episode of season 2). Once you get past that is when it gets really good. The plot revolves around a group of people, four of them have special weapons called Bubuki and the fifth person has a bubuki that fuses...them all together into a giant robot(the weapons, not the people). The plot and writing need a bit of work, but we have is fine.Art(10)-The animation was my initial draw to the series, as its some of the BEST CG animation I've ever seen(when it wants to be). There are times where the animation isn't as expressive or colorful, but we still have the character designs, which are also amazing. Each design feels very unique, even if in an ordinary anime some characters(Azuma) would look like characters you've seen before. The designs and animation are part of the reason I kept watching through those first 6 episodes.Sound(10)-Another reason is the soundtrack, its amazing. The openings ad endings are really top notch. I also wouldn't have started the series if the first ED wasn't by Myth&Roid(Re:zero and Overlord). The sound design is also really cool during action scenes, which are also pretty cool.Character(6)- The characters seem to initially focus on being quirky rather than introducing us to the characters, but even the most annoying characters(kaoruko) will grow on you, most likely. At the end of it all, I'm glad I got to spend 24 episodes with these characters. The series also has pretty good antagonists as well. Some of them aren't as interesting in the second season, but the main antagonist was good, even if his motivations kind of went up and down. He had a clear reason, but he lost me at a few points.Enjoyment(7)- I enjoyed this series very much and would recommend it to anyone getting into anime, it's a shame that it hasn't been licensed yet.Overall-8 them all together into a giant robot(the weapons, not the people).

Did the series end on a satisfying note? Well, we're about to find out. Spoiler alert!Story: The story picks up half a month after the end of season 1, with our heroes travelling across the world and meeting new Buranki teams. Unfortunately, the mysterious Demokratia organization impedes their efforts by capturing Reoko and using her to awaken a mysterious weapon that could potentially destroy the world. Hoshi...no Kyojin has the daunting task of smoothing over its predecessor's narrative flaws, and it does a fairly good job at it. The new villain is much smarter and has more resources than Reoko, offering new challenges to our heroes. At the same time, the origins and history of the Buranki are introduced, with Migiwa playing a role in it. Even if it has to shed the more negative aspects of the first season's story, this season does a better job in establishing its narrative structure. (7/10)Characters: A major complaint I had against season 1 is that it dedicated too much development to the supporting characters and villains, leaving the heroes as little more than cardboard cut outs. This season fixes it by keeping the focus on the heroes and their evolution, and the supporting characters had development that didn't conflict with the heroes' own. The main beneficiaries of this improved character writing are Azuma, who goes from generic goody two-shoes to a confident hero with strong ideals and convictions, and Kogane, who truly demonstrates bravery and determination behind her cuteness. I'm not afraid to say those two are my favorite characters in the series. The character writing is not perfect, that's for sure, especially in regards to Reoko, her cohorts and the international Buranki teams, but at least it does a better job than season 1 by default. (7/10).Art: The animation and visuals are just as good as they were in season 1, so there is not much improvement I can notice there. The characters and backgrounds are amazing but obviously the most detailed CGI models are the robots, which ultimately benefits the action setpieces. Good visual effects are supposed to enhance the anime experience, not make it, so it's a good thing the story and character aspects were impoved, otherwise I would have remembered the series as just pretty to look at. (10/10).Sound: One of the strongest feelings I have in listening to intro and ending songs is that I think the very first ones featured in a TV shows are the best because they offer listeners a good way to introduce the series they are watching. The second intro and ending songs are good, it's just that they not as good as the first, and that feeling is echoed here. That doesn't mean the songs are bad, they are still good and enjoyable. The voice performances are just as good as ever, and special mention goes to Ari Ozawa, who delivers an emotional and heartfelt performance in episode 3 (or 15) that perfectly combines anger and sadness. That moment single-handedly redeemed the series for me and made me realize this season would be much better than season 1. (10/10).Overall: Hoshi no Kyojin has the difficult task of fixing season 1's flaws and does it not in a perfectly, but definitely in a satisfactory way. If you want my advice, you should watch both seasons consecutively as to properly understand what happens. I moderately enjoyed season 1 on a theoretical perspective, despite the problems it had; but season 2 was really the moment the series took off. While this season and the first one do not reinvent the wheel in regards to the mecha genre, it doesn't have to in order to be enjoyable.

Anyways, let me just get right to the meat of this review.Story: I have to give this series a solid 8 for its story, it was satisfactory. Originally I thought that it would be hard to make a good story/setting primarily focusing on a platonic relationship between a brother and sister, but I was certainly proven wrong. The bonding between Choco and Kawagoe will take you on an emotional ride that will make you laugh, smile and quite possibly jerk a tear(it...did for me). Only thing I can really criticize about the story is there isn\'t enough back-story on the main characters.Art: For how much I loved the story, I certainly can\'t vouch for the animation. Now I\'m not saying the animation is terrible in Chokotto Sister, but it definitely could use some improvements. Though usually the fanservice shots tend to have better quality lol.Sound: To be honest, most people could care less about the sound effects in a drama/comedy. In this genre, as long as the sound effects don\'t sound totally out of place, then I\'m happy, and the sound effects in Chokotto Sister sounded just fine to me. As for the music, I\'m pretty sure you will get tired of hearing a certain dancing song after a while but its nothing I would hold against the anime lol. The ambient music sounds just about right and I really liked the OP and ED.Character:Though some of the characters in Chokotto Sister may come off as generic(tsundere, cute/dumb, etc.), the way they portrait the characters is decent enough. I never found myself asking ""well why is that character even in this anime?"" which I have definitely asked of other animes.Enjoyment: I enjoyed Chokotto sister very much even though it does tend to have a little excessive fanservice(it\'s a partial oppai anime though so what do you expect?).

France rpzt !)So, Depth of Field...I was... surprisingly... surprised. One thing very important is that I saw each episode with at least a week between each of them (it\'s the way I oblige myself to look animes I\'m waiting from, haha). And at the beginning I was very suspicious about the story... ""What da heck is happening ?!""This was mostly because it seemed to be very different from the main first season.But... At the end, we soon get back on tracks ! And come back to the Slice of Life style...we (well, at least I) love. This is a thing I really appreciated: starting with a mecha and yet being a SoL and School Life.Another things... the art.I\'m not a huge fan of mecha, so I wasn\'t suppose to enjoy this that much. But... KyoAni... Gosh, how great it was ! I didn\'t see such beautiful engines since Macross Zéro ! The movements are fluent, the details are great... Nothing to say, ""kampeki"" !The sound was nice too. I especially loved the music of the 6th episode.For the characters... Well, no need to precise anything.At the end, I put 8/10 which is ""Very Good"", and a great mark for me. I\'d say that it\'s a must for anyone who watched Chuunibyou and enjoyed it.People who didn\'t see Chuunibyou can give a look too, but they wouldn\'t enjoy it as much as those who saw it... I guess.To conclude: give a look ! we (well, at least I) love.

And yes, the first season was something I thoroughly enjoyed, so I didnt expect much, and for good reason.basically it starts in a world that has been destroyed ""everyone has died for whatever reason"" and its a battle between Rikka and Deko, but they now...have like Mecha fighters, and its too the death. Man, these girls\' imaginations are something else. have like Mecha fighters, and its too the death. Man, these girls\' imaginations are something else.', ""This anime is a spin-off? I can't say it like that tho because at the end they reveal its all just imagination, same like in the anime. One thing for sure is that this anime is a fan service for Mecha genre fans out there. And I'm not one of them. So when i watch all the short 7 episodes, its feel like a chore. Every episode is 3 minutes long on average, so you can finish this anime in one sitting. What is really love is the ending. I'm not embarrassed to say that i am almost crying at the end there. Not only...because the Mecha story, but also because Rikka relationship with Yuuta.Art is obviously very very great. The fighting animation and the robot all looks well made. They use the same artstyle as the main anime. I can't compare the animation to other Mecha anime because i never watch one. But i think i can safely say that this is beautiful. The apocalyptic city in the background really fit the whole vibe this fight bring. At first I'm not really enjoying it because its just filled with action. But near the end is one of the most beautiful story i ever watch. because the Mecha story, but also because Rikka relationship with Yuuta.Art is obviously very very great.

For some reason they split it up into seven 3-minute long segments - each one with the same 23-second long intro and 30-second long outro.I think the story itself was fine, but nothing special.  I would've given it a 5/10 if it had all been one 15-minute long video, but I took a point off for the unnecessary padding the extra intros and outros added.  They really were quite annoying.The art and animation in the fantasy was the best part; it wasn't movie quality, but it was still nice to...look at. look at.""]"
Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49523/Digimon_Adventure_02__The_Beginning,"[""I wanted to love this movie. I was well aware of people’s complaints going into this, but I still expected the best. I was wrong. I went in expecting an enjoyable experience at least, but instead this film was all filler, no killer.This movie is sadly a waste of the 02 cast. While marketed as their revival film, their presence was little more then window dressing to another chosen child’s story. Not a single 02 cast member made a contribution to the plot that could only be made by them. Not a single 02 cast member received a character arc in the film. The most...focus and effort put into showing their lives as adults was the opening montages of the film. While a beautiful opening it was, it was not enough to make this film worth watching for any digimon adventure fans.Not only did this film not focus on any of the 02 digidestined, it did not address or mention the plot of last adventure kizuna and its major reveal (unless a certain single line of dialogue in the closing narration was meant to imply kizuna’s reveal is now meaningless, despite never even being mentioned in the film prior). Instead we were treated to another story about a new oc crammed into the franchise, cough male Meiko cough. For every complaint people had about Meiko’s focus in tri, this movie did it worse. She had 6 movies, so at least the focus on her was spread out and the 8 characters the audience is invested in had character arcs, that is not the case here. Instead , we were treated to a story about another digidestined. Another claiming to be the first, which we were previously lead to believe we saw in tri, which was a weird retcon to begin with, then we met the first child to lose her partner in kizuna, and now we meet a new special snowflake, with his new special digimon that apparently is responsible for the partnership between all digidestined and digimon, and maybe even the death of his parents (lol). Not only is this insulting to adventure cast, but fans as well. When will they realize, we don’t need shocking reveals that contradict previously established lore, but meaningful character arcs for our chosen children and to see their partner digimon reach new digivolution heights.The director of this film possibly thought he could recapture the magic of the first 02 film, but what makes that film more enjoyable is the fact that it came out during 02’s original release and not decades later. And while Willis was a primary character, the main cast still had plenty of chances to shine. Like gatomon and palmon suddenly reaching mega with no build up whatsoever lol.This film contributed nothing new for our 02 cast. No new mega forms, or even their ultimates, new new levels for DNA digivolved Silphymon and Shakkoumon, not even the chance to see the digiegg of kindness in the anime for the first time. Hell, armor digivolution never even got mentioned, but at least we revisited the computer lab.Not to mention that after all these years, there are still plotlines left unresolved. The dark ocean still hasn’t been explained, despite being brought up in tri and claiming Maki Himekawa, nor has its ruler Dragomon, or what happened to Daemon once he was stranded there and the fact his presence alluded to a plotline with the 7 demon lords. These dangling plotlines would have been perfect to address in a 02 movie or series, instead we got something less meaningful then a shounen filler movie (like the original 02 movie). At least those typically allow for their cast to shine despite focusing on original characters.The 02 cast deserve their tri movie series, or even their version of kizuna. They needed to regain the future they achieved at the end of 02 that got retconned away, despite the epilogue still apparently being canon. They deserved character arcs, and some damn confirmation on takari after all these years. I wanted to see them overcome obstacles, to achieve their dreams. Instead I endured a meandering story for a new more chosen then all the rest of the “chosen children”. Can the people behind the digimon movies please stop trying to one up each other now?I encourage all digimon fans to still watch the movie. If we want to see the adventure and 02 cast again, we need to support the series, but we also have to let our complaints be known, in order to encourage a better outcome in the future. While this film is a waste of the 02 cast, it is still nice to see them again, even if their presence felt more significant in their brief subplot in kizuna. At least we have confirmation that they’re still making progress towards their dreams, still hanging out and still hoping for a brighter future with their digimon. What little we got of them interacting was still nice, funny and even heartwarming at times. And if you’re a dub fan, at least we got Brian Donovan back as Davis one more time. Weird they let him reclaim the role but not Lara Jill miller for Kari, even though Tara Sands is still great.Until next time digimon fam, stay Prodigious. And to Lui, I'll be playing you the world's smallest violin if you ever show up again focus and effort put into showing their lives as adults was the opening montages of the film.

And to Lui, I'll be playing you the world's smallest violin if you ever show up again"", ""Just finished watching the limited run in US theaters (Nov 9th) in Japanese with English subtitles. I went into the movie without any expectations and really enjoyed it! The movie is VERY story driven which may not be everyone's thing - but as an adult that grew up with the franchise I really enjoyed it. The new character has a very dark backstory, and while it initially comes off as 'dark'/'edgy,' I really enjoyed it as the movie continued/they fleshed out his character more and more. The animation style is modern and high quality - it was great to see the 02 gang older and...in their different stages of life.If you enjoy story rich anime and Digimon- I think you will enjoy! in their different stages of life.If you enjoy story rich anime and Digimon- I think you will enjoy!"", ""I went to the movie with some kinda hope after watching the trailerPretty soon after the movie started I got disillusioned pretty fast because the movie mostly consisted of building up the backstory for a totally boring new character (poor boy got abused in his childhood, had a rough family background) and waaaaay too much talking for a Digimon movie...Overall the fight scenes and evolution scenes where animated in a fresh, modern style - yet this is by far not enough when you lack the overall feeling for a Digimon movie because of missing real, extended fights...Gotta say that this movie lacks nearly everything for...justifying giving it a positive review - was a real disappointment to me and have to say: Guys,don't waste your time watching this utter disgrace to the Digimon franchise justifying giving it a positive review - was a real disappointment to me and have to say: Guys,don't waste your time watching this utter disgrace to the Digimon franchise"", 'As the latest addition to the Digimon franchise, the 02 movie does a solid job of raising new questions and complications about the ideas of the original two series while staying true to the core themes that made Adventure and 02 so special. However, it must be said that this movie fundamentally has Lui as its emotional core, with the original 02 cast functioning as prominent yet ultimately supporting characters. This is not necessarily to the detriment of the show\'s quality. The emotional punch and themes of the story still remain powerful and are deeply intertwined with the core ideas of Digimon partners and what...it means to be Digidestined. On the other hand, advertising the movie as a 02 continuation or feature film has created a detrimental expectation that this would centre on the original cast. No doubt this has much to do with the less than positive reception, yet it is somewhat unfair to the movie since that has to do with the context surrounding it instead of its contents. Even then, a significant part of the negative reception ultimately stems from the limitations of attempting to continue the already complete character arcs of the 02 cast. And perhaps, it also speaks to tensions between the audience\'s memory and expectations of Digimon from their childhood and the more mature and complex ideas it wants to cover now.The most obvious issue is that while being advertised and titled as a 02 movie, the emotional core of the plot and themes is formed around Lui\'s story and struggles. Despite being understandably disappointing, there is also little room to manoeuvre in terms of constructing a story primarily around the 02 cast. This is not to say that the completion of their character arcs in the original show precludes them from growing or changing further. However, developing them more as young adults tends to lead to stories more in the vein of the Kizuna movie. These stories end up exploring the consequence of their change instead of being a more traditional narrative of characters facing challenges that prompt their growth. While it does make for a compelling character story, it will naturally revolve less around Digimon fights and external villains and more on introspection and exploring relationships between characters. That likely was not the story the writers wanted or were tasked with telling, and frankly, probably not what the audience desires in Digimon as a franchise.What we are left with is requiring an external force to drive the plot, which in this case is Lui and his fraught relationship with Digimon. The alternatives to this range from lacklustre to measurably worse than what we have now, which is the 02 cast acting as paragon characters that guide Lui on his own journey with Digimon. A common pitfall that many shows run into is to have their characters regress, only for them to repeat their original arc again. These are often frustrating to see, bordering on character assassination at times, and thankfully is not an issue with this movie. Arguably worse is to have a show with no substance at all, where the plot simply occurs as a vehicle for fluffy character interactions and mindless action. For a franchise as old and nostalgic as Digimon, some amount of this fan service is desirable and even necessary, given that the target audience is primarily existing fans. However, having a movie solely revolving around that would end up lacking most substance and ultimately be a disservice since Digimon is so much more than just juvenile monster fights.Despite it being understandable why they chose the approach of having Lui be the emotional centre of the story, it could certainly have been handled better. The focus on Lui becomes overwhelming with how little is done to tie back the questions and worries of his situation with Digimon to the original cast. The themes and questions around what it means to have a partner Digimon, the origin of that connection, and the implications of Digidestined growing in number are all interesting expansions and complications of the original ideas in the show. Yet so little time is devoted to having the 02 cast grapple or discuss this when they should have the most to say. The overwhelming presence of Lui continues into how the show\'s run time is used, featuring not just his relevance to the plot and current emotional conflict but a hefty chunk of his back story. While this is also not necessarily an issue, given the short run time of 80 minutes, it leaves precious few moments for any interaction solely within the 02 cast or time to unpack the many implied questions and themes. It is even more glaring when this is contrasted with the amount of time spent on Digivolution sequences. While nostalgic and appropriately employed, it also highlights how much time is spent on sequences that neither advance the plot nor add any depth in characterisation or themes. Given that these sequences are something of a necessity, there seems to be little way to improve things short of increasing the run time.Lui\'s backstory itself is incredibly bleak and dramatic but nonetheless effectively conveyed in the amount of time there is to work with. Perhaps the negative reaction has to do with its degree of predictability, but those arguments often appear rather weak. Lui\'s story is interesting because it considers the potential implications of having a Digimon partner, questions their origin and roles, and the darker complications of such a relationship. These are logical extensions of a now twenty-year-old premise, and it\'s only natural that a sequel would take a magnifying glass to its original ideas. Perhaps, then, the primary issue is with Lui\'s backstory ""retconning"" other established Digimon media running in the same continuity. However, this is disastrously missing the forest for the trees, given Digimon has hardly been a congruent franchise in terms of plot.What has united Digimon has primarily been its themes, ideas and focus on characters instead of any profound ""lore"" about the Digital World. While it is understandable and a bit disappointing that it does not all neatly join into some larger mythos, this seems to be a misunderstanding of the franchise\'s spirit. The setting has always been malleable and serves the plot and development of the characters. This demand for every franchise to have persistence and intricate worlds seems like a detrimental development in fandom spaces over recent years. One that crushes the importance of thematic connection beneath its heels. It is also ironic that this is a significant point of criticism when recent entries like Tri demonstrate the folly of focusing heavily on worldbuilding since it created a convoluted plot that bears little emotional or thematic meaning.Ultimately, nothing about Lui\'s story fundamentally ""breaks"" the Digimon world. It does bend ideas or reimagine them, but they were in service of a compelling story and interesting themes. Frankly, it is also astounding that those who are upset over the supposed ""retcon"" have failed to reason that Lui might simply be speaking from his perspective given what he knows instead of it being a ""lore"" fact. Again, this seems like missing not only the forest for the trees but also the point of a series that has always been about character. The fights, Digivolution, and Digimon partners were all ultimately a metaphor, a tangible extension of a character and their growth. It is a simply but effective means of tying character growth directly to power and progress of the story. While the monster designs and action are still a big draw of the franchise and good entertainment, to desire to accord it primacy is frankly disappointing.While Digimon has been known for its surprising character depth and tackling of heavy issues, at least by the expectations of a children\'s show, the predominant memory of Digimon in the minds of fans seems to be its more action-oriented elements. While nothing is wrong with this, it is now in conflict with the fact that the 02 cast has grown up as well and requires stories to age up with them. Unfortunately, it seems that the show\'s writers were fully aware of this, with how often Daisuke\'s character is used to circumvent any heavy discussion by just blustering through it. This is appropriate and in character, but the number of times it happens seems to signal that they have little faith that the audience will be patient or interested in exploring the ideas raised or the more profound character responses. All this is ironic given how old 02 is. The primary audience is likely young adults, but the show feels like it does not play strongly to this demographic. This tension is understandably challenging to resolve without resorting to a plot in the vein of the Kizuna movie, where it\'s one final farewell. But what we get is the 02 movie not quite committing to being a character piece, still focusing heavily on the drama but not quite the substance of it, yet not quite sacrificing this in order to pander to its audience and be a feel-good nostalgia action film.Personally, I find that Digimon is enduring because of its themes. This movie is intriguing but lacks the full commitment to its ideas to really dig into them. The fights were compelling enough, but in a way that excited the child-like side of me at seeing my favourite characters from the past back in action. Once that wears off, it does not stick with you like it once did, watching it back in the early 2000s on a Saturday morning. In that sense, the lack of focus on the 02 cast was disappointing, not because they failed to be the heroes of the day or control the plot, but because they spent so little time grappling with the tough questions and responding in ways that highlighted their characters. It could have been a chance to show how they have grown up but potentially also grown apart on issues like this. Especially since some of them, like Daisuke and Ken, have taken different life paths. It was also a missed opportunity to have given them access to Jogress Digivolution so early. Unlocking it again could have been the perfect milestone in showing that they accept the changes in their friends they perhaps are only now noticing because of the events of the movie. It might even have been a chance to add more depth to them compared to the original show.However, with all that being said, the movie is still a compelling watch with coherent and compelling ideas, even if they are not explored to their fullest extent. Even for 02 fans who might be disappointed with the movie not focusing solely on them, there is still plenty to love and a great serving of nostalgia. Those who hold Digimon Tamers as their favourite series might also be pleasantly surprised with the darker themes and aesthetic the movie chooses. But most of all, those like me who are interested in the themes of Digimon, connection, bonds, understanding, etc, will find a lot of emotional punch in Lui\'s story. Overall, given its negatives are more limitations or missed potential than anything fundamentally wrong with the story, it seems appropriate to give Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning a 7 out of 10. it means to be Digidestined. On the other hand, advertising the movie as a 02 continuation or feature film has created a detrimental expectation that this would centre on the original cast. No doubt this has much to do with the less than positive reception, yet it is somewhat unfair to the movie since that has to do with the context surrounding it instead of its contents.

Once that wears off, it does not stick with you like it once did, watching it back in the early 2000s on a Saturday morning. In that sense, the lack of focus on the 02 cast was disappointing, not because they failed to be the heroes of the day or control the plot, but because they spent so little time grappling with the tough questions and responding in ways that highlighted their characters. It could have been a chance to show how they have grown up but potentially also grown apart on issues like this. Especially since some of them, like Daisuke and Ken, have taken different life paths. It was also a missed opportunity to have given them access to Jogress Digivolution so early. Unlocking it again could have been the perfect milestone in showing that they accept the changes in their friends they perhaps are only now noticing because of the events of the movie. It might even have been a chance to add more depth to them compared to the original show.However, with all that being said, the movie is still a compelling watch with coherent and compelling ideas, even if they are not explored to their fullest extent. Even for 02 fans who might be disappointed with the movie not focusing solely on them, there is still plenty to love and a great serving of nostalgia. Those who hold Digimon Tamers as their favourite series might also be pleasantly surprised with the darker themes and aesthetic the movie chooses. But most of all, those like me who are interested in the themes of Digimon, connection, bonds, understanding, etc, will find a lot of emotional punch in Lui\'s story. Overall, given its negatives are more limitations or missed potential than anything fundamentally wrong with the story, it seems appropriate to give Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning a 7 out of 10.', ""Spoiler Warning. Elements of surprise.This review's goal is to give a moment of realization about how this movie is actually good.This movie had 3 refreshing and unexpected story and execution elements. I respect them for pulling these off making it a good bonus story.1. The Movie is way darker than expected from Digimon. At some time we though we wil see some Higurashi level moments xD. It was build up around that pretty well and interesting that the movie was not boring despite having less action.2. The fights were not extended and the villain SPOILER (has not achieved his goal as it normally...happens in most anime making it refreshing and unexpected. Maybe they make up for the lack of action in future movies. It is hard to make a big enemy versus all fight look good shown in recent anime series and movies for example (One Piece and Dragon Ball), so they just did the basic thing carried with animation quality.3. They respect the anime being complete and do not develop their characters or power more than reflecting the true meanings and being more open minded. As they are completed characters they shift the focus to a struggling tragic character who seeks redemption and that is a good way not to ruin the main story with a bonus movie.Furthermore, I still got my at least one time movie theatre given goosebumps and did not feel boringness. Some moments were weird as when the main character and his Digimon looked into the camera trying to show something and looking fake, but that is fine as they want to show something instead of acting normal on purpose. However, I think this movie has lower rewatch value as it is based on being refreshing and shocking. So, it is hard to enjoy it after realizing it had some creative aspects and have a more appreciative take on this anime. I hope those who see the fine score and watch it afterwards not expecting much have a better enjoyment.Besides, I liked it being shown simultanousely in all countries not making me prejudiced by its score and maybe not going there as I did not watch the previous movies from Tri to Evolution and rewatched the old animes yet.Post-credit scene was so mind-blowingly good too wooooow xDI hope for future movies of my beloved Digimon Data Squad and Tamers too. :=) happens in most anime making it refreshing and unexpected.

Very dark stuff, I was honestly a little surprised.The art was passable. I liked the song.I still enjoyed all of the moments with the OG cast interacting with each other and their Digimon, and I liked it more then Kazuna, so that's something. There's not a ton of action, but that didn't bother me as I really care more about the characters.If you really like the 02 cast, it's worth watching but be prepared for a kind...of intense story from the newcomer. of intense story from the newcomer."", ""When the fans of Digimon Adventure watched the return of the series eight years ago in the Tri movie series and later in Last Evolution Kizuna, they felt something not minor was largely missing: the members of the second generation of chosen children and protagonists of the second season of the series 02. Where were they? How could they be ignored just like that? Not only by the writers, but also by the 01 members themselves? If they had already been introduced, were part of the universe and had already achieved enough relevance after having enjoyed an entire series dedicated to them? Was the class...of questions everyone was asking themselves. Having ignored them as if they had never existed or had never been important characters was never something well-received, and this regardless of how much each fan may have ever liked them. Even though the 02 children were never as popular as those of the original series came to be and always remained rather in their shadows, just for plot-decency reasons they still existed and deserved to be remembered and participate significantly in the return. The announcement and arrival of this film, “Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning”, was thus understood as a way to correct this mistake with a story this time around dedicated completely only to them and created excitement among fans since finally they were going to be able to see their beloved characters return rightfully so and have their moment to shine, even if that was for a limited time.However, it didn’t turn out to be exactly what was expected. To have been promoted as a new story about the members of 02, this new installment is in reality essentially a story whose focus is a whole new character: the mysterious Lui and his complicated relationship with his special digimon Ukkomon. The cast of 02 here only acts as satellite characters orbiting around this newly introduced character and the conflict caused by his digimon, limiting their participation as mere witnesses and circumstantial assistants to the new event related to the Digitalworld. Beyond revealing “where are they now and what are they doing now in their young adult lives” at the beginning of the film, it doesn’t do much else with them that is both meaningful and interesting about them. They were the ones who happened to be there to help save the day and that’s all. Introducing new characters doesn’t need to be something wrong of course, but if doing so will be to the detriment of the characters that are actually the main ones making everything focus on the new and barely anything on the main from whom we expect to see more or if their introduction and their conflicts do not really have strong narrative ties to them that make their participation indispensable (this is: they and no other than they could have participated and allowed this new story), then we are certainly before a disappointment, especially considering that this was supposedly going to be an opportunity to develop a meaningful story about them after having been previously put aside. This becomes even more problematic when remembering that already in their own mother series Digimon Adventure 02 and its related movies that followed it not much meaningful was done with them with the exception of Ken. This was the chance to fill those development holes and treat the rest of the members with greater attention, something that unfortunately wasn’t achieved once again.On the other hand, it’s not good news as well that this new addition to the Adventure universe introduces plot elements that necessarily enter in conflict with previously established elements. The new character Lui presents himself as yet another character claiming to be the first chosen child or the first human being with a digimon partner as if the contenders for that position weren’t already enough, whose extraordinarily powerful and mysterious digimon called Ukkomon with a wish-granting divine-like ability apparently is the real reason behind the existence of the digivices and the metaphysical relationships/connections between humans and digimons after having unintentionally misunderstood one of the wishes of his partner. Although this theory is initially presented as mere speculation on the part of Lui and that it is possible that nothing he claims is effective, the truth is that what happens towards the end of this short story seems to confirm it, which if understood as true necessarily and in an immensely unfortunate way would contradict or invalidate much, if not all, of the entire Adventure universe shown before and would come off as very disappointing because this seeks to make us digest the idea that all the story we knew until now was, in reality, the result of mere chance and not something with more meaning as we always believed and understood. Even in the best of the cases where we try to reconcile in a far-fetched way what is brought up here with all the previous knowledge, the truth at the end of the day is that this only contributes to unnecessarily convolute the universe and create unnecessary confusion. And even having ideas or story concepts previously introduced and left unfinished in the original series, such as the Black Sea and its nature for example, it seems even more absurd to have developed this instead of having used the opportunity to take up and explore what for a long time has been pending. They also didn’t even use this opportunity to introduce new digievolution levels for both Sylphimon and Shakkoumon, as is usual with each new installment.It would appear that the movie is then useless and a waste of time, but, counterintuitively, it’s not the case either. Strictly from an internal perspective, things do not look as bad, and in fact it becomes something that ranges from acceptable to satisfying, working even much better than the standard “cash-grab” shounen typical movie. For one thing, regardless of whether or not he is the first chosen child as he claims to be, the truth is that Lui, his difficult past marked by child abuse, his complex relationship with Ukkomon and the consequences derived from it turn out to be quite interesting, and certainly much more than what previous new-character cases like the ones of Meiko or Menoa ever were. Thanks to a good characterization, presentation and a very human and surprisingly dark and disturbing execution even for the usual standards of the franchise, the movie makes him someone with whom we can connect and empathize, making him memorable. For another thing, that it hadn’t focused on them, doesn’t take away the fact that anyway it was more than a pleasure to see the 02 members on screen again interacting altogether this time as grown-ups. Led by the contagious and explosive personality of Daisuke that remains intact, the 02 team always stood out for how close to each other they were compared to the 01 one, and the movie knew very well how to reflect that through scenes, notable dialogues, inside jokes and references to the past which was quite wholesome to see. The animation is also stunning and likely one of the best the franchise has ever seen, the usage of the classic 02 themes like Target, Break Up! and Beat Hit! is exciting, the story flows very well considering the short runtime, and it is welcome that the conflict this time didn’t have as its basis a standard fight between good guys and bad guys but rather a complex situation to solve, which helped the attention to be put on the human aspects and the messages to communicate instead of the action sequences that here are rather few and short, just like it was in Last Evolution Kizuna before.For all these factors, forgetting for a while where the expectations were placed and how detrimental it is for the continuity of the universe, the film still works quite well and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, as much as the aforementioned qualities are certainly appreciated, it’s clear we cannot just ignore and overlook the issues explained earlier, being them structural problems that weigh much more for reviewing purposes, so it is hard to give it a pass without qualms. To have been ignored so much in previous returns, that they have now missed the opportunity to offer the meaningful story about the main characters the fans were expecting and make up for snubbing them before can only be seen as a disappointment, especially if this movie was understood as their turn to shine. Having everything revolved around Lui, the 02 chosen children ended up virtually in the backseat of their own comeback movie, and this film ultimately ends up feeling more like a sort of mere consolation prize to them for not having actively participated in the previous returns, which doesn’t make them justice. This, in addition to how unfortunate it is that the movie messes around with the whole Adventure universe in such an unnecessary way with new information related to the origin of the relationships between humans and digimons that contradicts or invalidates the previous knowledge and that it is hard to try to make it compatible or make it fit with it without the use of mental gymnastics, giving the impression that those who wrote this seemed not to remember or not even ever having watched all of Adventure’s previous installments. Instead of being something like the Last Evolution Kizuna's equivalent to the 02 team, or perhaps having performed as a bridge that convincingly and consistently reconciled what was shown in that movie with the epilogue of the main series (which no one has said yet is no longer valid), the movie thought of itself as something that had to come to provide an answer to a question that never existed in the first place or something that sought to shock everyone with a twist that instead of providing sense only ended up confusing more rather than clarifying anything at all. It’s only natural to see that it’s hard to see this movie as something satisfying and recommendable taking all this context into account.In the end, all in all, how much it may be will depend on how much weight each fan places on each side. It will depend on which factors are given the most importance by them, whether the external ones in terms of expectations or the internal ones in terms of functionality independent of them. If you belong to the type of fan who cares a lot for the story, the universe and its logic, it would be better to forget that this movie even exists. But if at this point all you are interested in is watching the 02 gang and their digimon partners back in action again and chill out for a while seeing them participate, interact with each other and save the day, you should give it a try, even more when remembering the humiliating treatment they received before. Personally, this was the attitude I watched it with and for the same reason I felt satisfied overall even though what it proposed didn’t convince me, but I can understand those who expected something more or better. Either way, the potential is still there, the possibilities of having a new (and I hope, really final) film that integrates and involves all of our chosen children in a meaningful story about them that also hopefully ties convincingly the story so far with 02’s epilogue clearing out all traces of confusion, are still there, and as long as they do, there is no reason to get pessimistic yet. 5.5/10 of questions everyone was asking themselves.

With sweeping retcons which contradict the previous materials and yet characters and a plot which assumes that you have watched up to the most recent content in the Adventure timeline, 02 the Beginning is just a confusing mess when you lay it out. Last Evolution was very clearly for adult superfans and handled it with grace, this very much feels like a solid stand-alone Digimon film which had the 02 cast thrown in slapdash. There's deep cut references yet a total ignorance to major plot points throughout the rest of the...series. I just don't get why they couldn't have made this a Saviors (Data Squad), Xros Wars, or Ghost Game movie, it would've made infinitely more sense. Even ignoring everything besides 02, Hurricane Touchdown, and Diablomon's Revenge (the 3 materials directly referenced), you're still missing out on screentime for some of the core 02 cast. Iori (Cody) in particular has very little to say throughout the movie and pretty much everyone besides Daisuke (Davis) and Ken are not much better off outside of some fun banter. Last Evolution suffered from this a as well with characters like Jo and Mimi, but it's particularly more noticeable since this film A) advertised itself as the big film for the 02 cast instead of the former which was always advertised as a Taichi focused film and B) the 02 cast in particular is much smaller than the Adventure cast, following 6 characters instead of 8.As it is it's like a 6/10 and exclusively saved by the excellent psychological horror vibes and 02 cast bantering.

I have mix feelings to review this. Of course, Spoiler ahead.For me the overall story is 6.5/10. This is due to there is actually no villain/antagonist in this story. This movie is a Shounen anime, to make the story fun, it should have at least villain. A new character called Rui Owada is not an antagonist but more like confused character. He also claim that he is the first Digi-Destined (The Chosen Children). His partner Ukkomon...is the wish granting Digimon. Because of his wish that he want friends, people get Digimon partners and Digivice. Hence, due to the lack of antagonist the story is pretty boring.In terms of animation, of course is good and I gave 8/10. We can see the reanimated of evolution scene. The fight scene is quite abundant but there is no that worth to mention. For evolution scenes, I just not satisfied because there is no armor evolution scenes. Maybe the screen time is not enough to cram all the armor evolutions in the movie. For those who watch the Digimon Adventure Last Evolution Kizuna, they maybe expected to have new evolutions but sadly there is none.Music is 9/10. It is just superb. No need to comment further.Comedy is peak in this movie (8/10). There is several pun and jokes that make me laugh such Ukkomon first appearance, Rui mistakenly said Unkomon (Unko means shit in Japanese). There is also romance scene (not so subtle for there is). As we know in the end of 02 anime, Miyako and Ken are married. Hence, there is a scene that Miyako give a hint to Ken that she liked him and Ken just like another MC in romance anime, just feel weird and ask for explanation.However, if you are a hardcore Digimon fans, I really recommended this movie. Full of nostalgic moments especially when watching the evolution scenes with new version arranged song of Beat Hit, Brave Heart and Target.I personally give 8/10 because it is just fun watching and you know just to relish the childhood memories. When I went to the cinema, I saw that most of the people are adult. This means that this movie is for us adults who grew up with Digimon. I just hope you are enjoying the movie if you are Digimon fans.For Hardcore Digimon fans who expected so much because from the last Digimon movie. Just lower your expectations and try to focus on relishing the childhood memories.For Non-Digimon fans, I just don't recommended because you will just confused in the cinema watching this movie.I hope my review helps. is the wish granting Digimon.

For those who watch the Digimon Adventure Last Evolution Kizuna, they maybe expected to have new evolutions but sadly there is none.Music is 9/10. It is just superb. No need to comment further.Comedy is peak in this movie (8/10). There is several pun and jokes that make me laugh such Ukkomon first appearance, Rui mistakenly said Unkomon (Unko means shit in Japanese). There is also romance scene (not so subtle for there is). As we know in the end of 02 anime, Miyako and Ken are married. Hence, there is a scene that Miyako give a hint to Ken that she liked him and Ken just like another MC in romance anime, just feel weird and ask for explanation.However, if you are a hardcore Digimon fans, I really recommended this movie. Full of nostalgic moments especially when watching the evolution scenes with new version arranged song of Beat Hit, Brave Heart and Target.I personally give 8/10 because it is just fun watching and you know just to relish the childhood memories. When I went to the cinema, I saw that most of the people are adult. This means that this movie is for us adults who grew up with Digimon. I just hope you are enjoying the movie if you are Digimon fans.For Hardcore Digimon fans who expected so much because from the last Digimon movie. Just lower your expectations and try to focus on relishing the childhood memories.For Non-Digimon fans, I just don't recommended because you will just confused in the cinema watching this movie.I hope my review helps."", ""I'll give you the short answer: watch it if you are being nostalgic of the old show, don't otherwise.Let me get this straight. They put quite a bit of effort into bringing all the nostalgic feelings from that show. Many references, many cameo appearances, even the music, the inside jokes, all of that just bringing up memories of me watching 02 over and over again during my childhood. But unlike Digimon tri. before it, the characters did not get the chance to shine. It feels like they tried to create tension but couldn't because they can't really end it in this one? Digimon Adventure has...what, 7 movies made? They would want to try and match that with 02, maybe? So instead we get this. A mixture of multiple interesting points that goes nowhere.So if you want to watch it, go ahead, judge it yourself. I went in knowing major spoilers and still enjoyed it somewhat. It wasn't bad, but it is not flawless either. what, 7 movies made? They would want to try and match that with 02, maybe? So instead we get this.

On the one hand the 2 from Tri and Menoa from Kizuna. In Adventure 01, DigiDestined were already mentioned who had previously fought against the dark masters. Furthermore, the Homeostasis, which was already seen in Adventure 01 and Tri, wanted to ensure harmony and equality and that is why DigiDestined were created. So the wish doesn't make sense either. What also really bothered me is that the Digivices were simply deleted because one doesn't need them for friendship? I don't want to be heartless but that...sounds more like cheating after what was explained in Kizuna and besides they also had another function like stopping Apocalymon's explosion.I've been a Digimon fan since the beginning and liked the stories and watching the children grow up, since I was a child myself back then. I also saw every movie and Ova and played the games but in my eyes it was never just about growing up. It always had something to do with villains and fights. I have nothing against a good drama but the story of the film was way too predictable and after an hour of story development, I got really impatient, it got boring at a certain point. The fight at the end really wasn't good either and I think it's a shame that the Adventure 02 Digimon weren't given enough credit. There was nothing new, no new mega level for the other DNAs and nothing new for Imperialdramon either. The Adventure 01 team was much more recognized. They had better films, the first one with Diaboromon, the tri films and also Kizuna. The films had a good structure and climaxes. After a bomb like Kizuna, I was hoping to be able to experience something equivalent for the Adventure 02 team, but instead it was something boring and inconsistent. I don't accept this as canon. Felt like a bad side story filler episode.

Doujin Work,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2166/Doujin_Work,"[""Doujin Work is a story about what the title says: A show working on a doujin. With subject matter of that magnitude, some would expect nothing but nudity, perversion, and loads of sex. I can SAFELY tell you that there is no nudity or no sex, BUT there is a lot of perversion going on in this anime. And perversion is all you need for a slice of life comedy about a rookie doujin artist.If you have viewed any anime about manga artists, namely Comic Party, then the characters will most likely not appear as fresh and different. The cast of characters may not...be as deep as Comic Party or Genshiken but of course they keep  the key character elements in. The chemistry and banter between all of the characters works out very well, but then again having characters execute hilarious sex jokes is about as easy as making a list on MyAnimeList.net. ^_^ If you find comedy in simple things like that you'll be more than in for just a few laughs. Even though it's so painfully shortThats one of the many drawbacks this show has. This show DOES have 12 episodes, but its only ten minutes. Well, technically its 15 minutes but the OP and ED lasts 5 minutes which makes no sense at all. So yeah the credits last longer than half the show, take that however you may. What surprised the hell out of me was how high quality the songs were compared to the rest of the show.Once you watch a handful of episodes, you'll realize how poor the animation quality is. You'll see that most of the time their lips and eyes only move. If they do move their body, it usually consists of less than 5 frames OR cheap animation shortcuts like sliding, resizing, and even flipping characters like paper.  Even the background characters are just in one color (pink, green, or blue). Now it could be their art style but i just couldn't get past the thought that the animation is so simplistic and poor looking especially when the show is so short. Thankfully comedy shows usually don't have to rely heavily on art just as long as the jokes and seiyus stay strong. The seiyu feel like they fit their character quite well and never gets old. Even Tsuyuri's monotone voice is refreshingly funny and quick witted whenever she speaks. My personal favorite is Sora. Her voice and how they present her in the show is just pure win.The overall comedy is very hit or miss, mainly drawing most of its jokes from sexual innuendo and cliche' gags. With all the less than stellar things going for this show, it still brings out a lot of good quick laughs for me in every episode. I personally loved the show and wished it was a full 30 minutes. But what do you expect from a 4panel comic.But if u want a quick pick me up of a comedy that u can watch all of it in one sitting or if you enjoy a little ecchi in your comedy anime, feel free to pick it up. be as deep as Comic Party or Genshiken but of course they keep  the key character elements in.

But if you want a few hours of mindless light-hearted entertainment then Doujin Work might be right up your alley.The story is simple and fairly formulaic.  Najimi goes along with her college friend Tsuyuri to a comic market where she is selling her work.  She becomes entranced with how much money can be made by a successful artist and dreams of becoming rich herself and after the market is over decides she will draw her own doujin manga....As the story unfolds she meets new friends and rivals and tries to improve her ability and become successful.  While the humor and some of the content is perverted at times it is never obscene.  If you are coming into this series expecting a lot of echiiness and fan service you’re going to be disappointed because there is none of it.Najimi carries the show well and is a very likable leading character.  She’s not the most original character ever drawn but you can’t help rooting for her.  It’s not realistic that someone who is drawing ero-manga would be so embarrassed to do the ""research"" needed to get ideas for her stories but it’s funny anyway.  The rest of the cast is stereotypical as well but like the lead they are all fun in their own way.  The character who really steals the show is Tsuyuri, who with her dry and perverted sense of humor drives the majority of the comedy.  They all have the depth of tissue paper but they still manage to enjoyable.The artwork and animation is not amazing but I don’t think it’s supposed to be.  I may be wrong but I think the kind of crude and amateurish art was intentional to fit the overall theme of the show.  Even if that is not really the case I think it works perfectly.  There are lots of references to other anime, manga and H-games, I got a few of them but I’m sure others might notice a lot more.  The seiyuu talent had several underused performers amongst the leading characters.  Whether intentional or not I felt this was a perfect fit for the theme of the series.  They were also quite good and it’s good to hear some new voices too.  I felt Momoko Saitou\'s performance as Tsuyuri was strong and am a bit surprised she’s been in so few shows.  The OP/EN theme songs were also cute and very catchy.Overall I got an enormous amount of entertainment value from Doujin Work.  If you’re in the mood for something light and a bit silly then you should check this series out.  The episodes are short and its well worth the 2-3 hours it took to watch it.

It's about a girl who wants to go into the doujin business, because of all the profit that can be made there.  *snicker*Ahem, anyways, it's really funny.  The episodes (the anime parts I mean, not that extra crap they tagged on) are about 12 minutes each or something so it's a decent way to get your daily dose of giggles during a break.The characters are reasonably original, ranging from the naive doujin artist...wannabe and her stalker childhood friend to the faux-innocent rape manga enthusiast (my favorite of the bunch) to a jealous loli and more.  It's superficial entertainment, but amusing enough and well executed.  The series shines at its best during the first 6 episodes, and kind of goes downhill from there, getting a bit more serious and also reusing some of the gags from earlier.The art and sound aren't great but they're functional and won't bother you.One note about the jokes-- they are mostly about doujins and otaku subculture.  If you're not really interested in that stuff or don't find similar stuff (eg Genshiken) amusing, you won't like Doujin Work either.  There's also, obviously, some perverted jokes (what, the tidbit about the rape manga enthusiast didn't tip you off?).  If that's not your cup of tea, don't bother with this series, since half the jokes revolve around sexual innuendo.Overall I recommend it heartily to the bored comedy connoisseur who just needs to blow an hour away. wannabe and her stalker childhood friend to the faux-innocent rape manga enthusiast (my favorite of the bunch) to a jealous loli and more.

an hour away."", ""i recently rented the first volume (episodes 1-4) of an anime called Dojin Work and i wanted to share my 2 cents on it.The Story:First scene:  We start out on a train with the main character (as seen in the picture above, i don't remember her name, but it's not important anyways lol).  there is a misunderstanding and a lesbian joke breaks out (between 2 girls who are obviously underaged).  this joke drags on for 5 minutes. this is foreshadowing that you will hear sexual pedophile jokes A LOT in every episode, in fact, most of the jokes are for pedophiles. the...man in a suit you see in the background carrying an even littler girl on his shoulders is named Justice (ironicly). his little girl companion is always wearing a new cosplay outfit for each scene, from a maid outfit to a policewoman, flight attendant, etc. he acts like a gentleman but he hits on little girls a lot.Anyways, back to the story. the main character who is obviously underdeveloped finds out her friend makes perverted doujinshi (japanese fan comics). she makes comics about sexual assault. what? yeah, the cover of her book is very explicit (a teen girl tied up in an awkward position). the main character finds out money can be earned by selling doujinshi at doujinshi events, so she decides she wants to make her own fan comic and sell it.most of the comic releif comes from the main character getting embarrased as she discovers the world of (erotic) fan comics, then her friends give her a hard time about it, and then she gets pissed off. this cycle repeats for almost every joke and almost always involves pedophile puns and sexual puns. i only found a few funny, and by ''a few'', i mean i can count the number of times i laughed on my 2 hands... this pattern gets old after a few episodes.the little girl with the green beret has some kind of companion the size of coin. it's a pair of short-shorts or underwear of some kind, and it has legs, arms and eyes. it dances around shaking it's booty and walking on people. nobody notices it or acknowleges it. kinda creepy they made it a pair of underwear, adding to the disturbia of the pedophile theme.the intro doesn't make any sense. parts of it show the main character's boobs grow, and another part shows Justice grows into a giant and shoot a laser out of his eyeball at a forest. waahhh????the main character is only concerned with money, all the more reason why kids should not be fooled by the underaged characters or cutesy bishoujo (pretty girl) style, it teaches bad morales all 'round.every episode has a sexual title and usualy shows the main character stark naked with emprovised censorship (i.e. trees, furniture, etc.).the story crawls at a snail's pace and grounds to a halt in some episodes, all in favor of a truck-load of pedophile jokes and puns in every conversation.The Animation:The animation for the most-part is non-existant because 90% of the show is talking. but when characters start to move it is very smooth and well executed, especialy to comic effect. characters will slide across the screen. when they turn around it looks like they are a 2-dimensional paper cut-out and they dissapear for a second, as if made of a flat peice of paper. i thought this was very cool and innovative. it seems these 2 effects use computer animation so it's very smooth. that's about all i can say for the animation.The Art Style:most of the characters are little girls. extra characters such as pedestrains and citizens in the background are a single flat mellow color like light green and light orange, which i thought was interesting. lots of bright mellow colors will ease your mind (and then the pedophile jokes will make you uncomfortable again). there are almost no ripples in the characters' clothes unlike most anime, which i found intruiging. a cutesy bishoujo style.The Sound Design:the intro and ending credits theme songs were a little annoying. this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves j-pop, beleive me when i say that. i didn't watch them more than once. the voice acting is definitely great and i give kudos for that. sound effects for the jokes are perfectly implimented for full comic effect and really enhances the comedy.The Final Score:in case you didn't catch on yet, this show is for pedophiles. nothing but pedophile jokes every few minutes, with less than 10 exceptions after 4 episodes! animation though sparce, was great, and the voice acting helped me endure the pedophile jokes until episode 4 was finished. i'm a big fan of the anime Comic Party, which teaches all about doijinshi and teaches great morals, even though it is targeted towards a younger audience. i was looking forward to Doujin Work as a modern take on Comic Party and its educational look into the world of doujinshi, but instead got a pedo-fest. only pedophiles should watch this.i hated 99% of the jokes and the pedophile theme was overkill, but for the good (if not absent for the most-part) animation, nice mellow art style, satisfying sound design and great voice acting, i give this anime a score of 2.5/10.this anime gets Pedo Bear's seal of approval, but not mineyou will learn nothing about doujinshi watching doujin work.  this show completely ignores all genres of fan comics except for erotic ones, as if that makes up the entirety of doujinshi.  and putting little girls in as characters who make these comics is just sick.if you're looking for an anime dedicated to the world of doujinshi i reccomend Comic Party, even though it is really corny and cheesy.fyi Comic Party Revolution (not to be confused with Comic Party) is pure fan service and has absolutely nothing to do with the world of doujinshi.i also reccomend the much more mature anime called Genshiken.  it's a very accurate, funny, mature, smart, and well written series.It's shows like Doujin Work that give anime a bad name. man in a suit you see in the background carrying an even littler girl on his shoulders is named Justice (ironicly). his little girl companion is always wearing a new cosplay outfit for each scene, from a maid outfit to a policewoman, flight attendant, etc. he acts

conversation.The Animation:The animation for the most-part is non-existant because 90% of the show is talking. but when characters start to move it is very smooth and well executed, especialy to comic effect. characters will slide across the screen. when they turn around it looks like they are a 2-dimensional paper cut-out and they dissapear for a second, as if made of a flat peice of paper. i thought this was very cool and innovative. it seems these 2 effects use computer animation so it's very smooth. that's about all i can say for the animation.The Art Style:most of the characters are little girls. extra characters such as pedestrains and citizens in the background are a single flat mellow color like light green and light orange, which i thought was interesting. lots of bright mellow colors will ease your mind (and then the pedophile jokes will make you uncomfortable again). there are almost no ripples in the characters' clothes unlike most anime, which i found intruiging. a cutesy bishoujo style.The Sound Design:the intro and ending credits theme songs were a little annoying. this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves j-pop, beleive me when i say that. i didn't watch them more than once. the voice acting is definitely great and i give kudos for that. sound effects for the jokes are perfectly implimented for full comic effect and really enhances the comedy.The Final Score:in case you didn't catch on yet, this show is for pedophiles. nothing but pedophile jokes every few minutes, with less than 10 exceptions after 4 episodes! animation though sparce, was great, and the voice acting helped me endure the pedophile jokes until episode 4 was finished. i'm a big fan of the anime Comic Party, which teaches all about doijinshi and teaches great morals, even though it is targeted towards a younger audience. i was looking forward to Doujin Work as a modern take on Comic Party and its educational look into the world of doujinshi, but instead got a pedo-fest. only pedophiles should watch this.i hated 99% of the jokes and the pedophile theme was overkill, but for the good (if not absent for the most-part) animation, nice mellow art style, satisfying sound design and great voice acting, i give this anime a score of 2.5/10.this anime gets Pedo Bear's seal of approval, but not mineyou will learn nothing about doujinshi watching doujin work.  this show completely ignores all genres of fan comics except for erotic ones, as if that makes up the entirety of doujinshi.  and putting little girls in as characters who make these comics is just sick.if you're looking for an anime dedicated to the world of doujinshi i reccomend Comic Party, even though it is really corny and cheesy.fyi Comic Party Revolution (not to be confused with Comic Party) is pure fan service and has absolutely nothing to do with the world of doujinshi.i also reccomend the much more mature anime called Genshiken.  it's a very accurate, funny, mature, smart, and well written series.It's shows like Doujin Work that give anime a bad name."", 'My favorite anime, as of this writing, is called Comic Party. It\'s a great comedy with a wee bit of drama about a group of friends overcoming biases, working on doujinshi, and growing stronger together.Based on the fact that Doujin Work was the top recommended anime in relation to it on MAL, I had some high hopes. And, well...I was a bit let down.It\'s not that this anime is bad. It\'s just that it\'s nothing special, either.STORY (6/10):Unlike the forementioned Comic Party, Doujin Work has nowhere near as much emphasis on the protagonist\'s desire to improve their manga. Najimi does improve in her work as...the show goes along, but the main focus of Doujin Work is gag comedy.I was happy to see the story advance a bit towards the end...however, without giving spoilers, that doesn\'t work out like it could\'ve, which was disappointing.ART (6/10):The artwork is decent, if not a bit lazy. Background characters are drawn as grey/green blobs at times. (I guess the artist ran out of generic faces.)There\'s one great visual gag in which Najimi enters an eroge shop, around episode 3 or so. Inside, you see lots of covers of real visual novels. I was able to recognize Saya no Uta (!!!), though there were plenty of others. That was certainly a nice touch.SOUND (6/10):The voice-acting is good; none of the voices felt out of place. (I watched this subbed, as there is no English dub of Doujin Work as of this writing.) The OP and ED are skippable, just generic J-pop.CHARACTER (6/10):The characterization isn\'t bad overall, but some characters lack motives for their actions. For example, ""Justice"", Najimi\'s childhood friend, constantly tries to protect her from a male fan of hers who is very kind-hearted and has a crush on her.Is Justice attracted to her? The show never even so much as jokes about it. Then why is he so worried about this boy coming close to her?Also, Sora, a little girl who pops up in about every episode, really serves no purpose to the story other then to make Justice to seem a bit creepy (I\'ll get into that more below).ENJOYMENT (6/10):Before watching Doujin Work, you should know the show has some, er...lolicon undertones. I wasn\'t expecting these, and they got a little unnerving at times. Despite the fact that Najimi is supposed to be in college, she\'s drawn like she\'s 13, and her friend Tsuyuri is drawn even younger. The title screens often depict them nude or in suggestive situations.The character of Sora, an elementary school girl who frequently accompanies Justice, pushes my suspicions even further. She is WAY too close to these adults drawing hardcore hentai, and her relationship with Justice is never really explained in a way that could make not creepy. The occasional fanservice on her, even if it only lasted a couple seconds, made me gag.Some of the gags in the show fell flat for me, were overused, or were simply way too cringy (while the show gets over that last one after the first couple of episodes, they are uncomfortable - and this is coming from someone who enjoys Watamote). However, there are enough funny and enjoyable moments throughout the series that I did enjoy watching it.OVERALL (6/10):In conclusion, if you can get past the show\'s skeevy undertones, Doujin Work might be worth a watch on a rainy day (that is, if you\'ve already seen Comic Party). It\'s a goofy little slice-of-life that\'ll only take about two hours of your life. the show goes along, but the main focus of Doujin Work is gag comedy.I was happy to see the story advance a bit towards the end...however, without giving spoilers, that doesn\'t work out like it could\'ve, which was disappointing.ART (6/10):The artwork is decent, if not a bit lazy.

I adore the aesthetic, the humor, even the often formulaic plot lines, I'm a big fan of it all. So, when I average out my personal enjoyment of Doujin Work with the show's objective quality as a kind of bog-standard example of this kind of show, we come to a 7. From the inside it's a simple love letter to the doujin scene, and a flawless time capsule of mid-2000s Otaku culture, but from the outside it is an unremarkable piece of media that shows its age in terms of animation and...humor, embodying the stereotypical idea of what outsiders think anime is; Flashy colors and pervy jokes. The important thing to remember here is that both of these are true.  Even if that second perspective doesn't phase me, it still must be acknowledged as a facet of this show's overall identity. Getting into details first with the story, the viewer is presented with a simple little tale of a girl trying to make it big in the doujin scene, and follows the story of her and her friends as what begins as a quest for riches becomes a labor of love. The dialogue is clever, with regular puns throughout, and the story as a whole is classically episodic. It can also be said that it does nothing new, which is true, but I don't think that everything has to, especially when classic approaches are done well. The art is characteristically 2007, with a visual language and design philosophy that's ubiquitous of the time period and is now especially nostalgic. For those who enjoy the style, it holds up beautifully. I will admit that it is pretty limited at times, but there's nothing especially egregious considering the genre and time period. I personally love the character designs, as everybody's perfectly distinct and they fit their personalities like a glove. The sound design isn't necessarily anything special, meeting the basic standards of quality across the board with a fun little soundtrack and engaging voice work. The characters are the strongest part of this show, interacting and contrasting with each other in ways which imbue the story with a sense of fun that is the lifeblood of the genre. My favorite characters have to be Tsuyrui, Kaneru, and Justice. Overall, while it's no masterpiece, everything about Doujin Work still brings a warmth and youthful joviality to the table which makes me nostalgic for the times when Otaku culture was more genuine, weird, and firmly distinct from the mainstream.

And for 30+ episodes, they are his teachers, and his &quot;mama\\'s&quot;.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.  There\'s the super strong Satsuki, the sword wielding nurse Yayoi, the super cute art teacher Uzuki, the introverted scientist Kisaragi, and the literary teacher Mitsuki. Of course they would, it\'s a Harem style anime.  What I enjoyed about the characters is how much they all are genuinely concerned over how they can better Chitose\'s life as acting like his mother.There is nothing incredible about the main character, but his circumstances make for an incredible story.Enjoyment: 10I enjoyed this series so much.  After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.  It doesn\'t matter ""how"" it ends as long as it is happy.  This ending made the series that much more enjoyable and would make me want to watch the series more and more.Overall: 10I gave the overall a 10 because I feel the most important part of watching something or doing something is enjoying it.  Since I enjoyed the series so much, I have to consider it for a 10.  Though the ending definitely helped.I really recommend the series to anyone.  It really makes you think about family, love, and what is happiness.  Being what it is, you can\'t help but be drawn in by the events that take place and what the characters feel.', '\'Happy Lesson the Final\'. Good lord where do I even begin. Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.  It doesn\'t matter ""how"" it ends as long as it is happy.  This ending made the series that much more enjoyable and would make me want to watch the series more and more.Overall: 10I gave the overall a 10 because I feel the most important part of watching something or doing something is enjoying it.  Since I enjoyed the series so much, I have to consider it for a 10.  Though the ending definitely helped.I really recommend the series to anyone.  It really makes you think about family, love, and what is happiness.  Being what it is, you can\'t help but be drawn in by the events that take place and what the characters feel.', '\'Happy Lesson the Final\'. Good lord where do I even begin. Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

Being what it is, you can\'t help but be drawn in by the events that take place and what the characters feel.', '\'Happy Lesson the Final\'. Good lord where do I even begin. Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters.

The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything.

It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment?

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.

However, the story takes a strong turn towards the deeper feelings of the main character Chitose.Story: 9To me, the story begins with the first episodes of the Happy Lesson series.  It\'s a very fun-loving story revolving around a young man, Chitose, and 5 women, who are also his teachers, acting as his effective mothers.  While many events happen, ""The Final"" wraps the entire story up.  Concerned about his ""mother"" Mutsuki, Chitose takes it into his and his other 4 ""mothers"" hands to help...her out.  Throughout the later episodes of Happy Lesson Advanced, there are hints about the events that transpire in ""The Final.""

To be completely honest, the Women in Chitose\'s life would be the same as those found in one of those ""Dating sim"" type of games.  There\'s the super strong Satsuki, the sword wielding nurse Yayoi, the super cute art teacher Uzuki, the introverted scientist Kisaragi, and the literary teacher Mitsuki. Of course they would, it\'s a Harem style anime.

After watching the ending, I can officially say it is one of my favorites.  I love endings that are happy and not filled with question or regret, which is why this ending i s so perfect.

This ending made the series that much more enjoyable and would make me want to watch the series more and more.Overall: 10I gave the overall a 10 because I feel the most important part of watching something or doing something is enjoying it.

Well, for an anime that starts out by showing us what family values are this OVA basically takes the core idea of the entire Happy Lesson series and throws it into the trash bin.The first two seasons continuously feed us with family themes. FAMILY. So it\'s the male lead and the 5 female teachers who decided to be his mothers doing family orientated stuff. Family goes here, goes there - encounters some problems and we have some drama but in the end all is good. And if you\'ve watched the first two...seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end. The great platonic love of a family. Oh boy was I wrong. I wasn\'t even remotely prepared for the complete farce that is the 3rd episode. Out of all animes that I\'ve watched this one has the absolute worst ending ever.At the very end you feel cheated because you spend a considerable amount of time watching this series and this OVA tells you that it didn\'t mean anything. The whole family theme is gone and instead they replace it with a dreadful, yes, dreadful harem-ish ending. So what was all that platonic love about? Wasn\'t so platonic after all eh. The worse thing is there\'s no build up to it, you have no idea what\'s about to happen - it\'s as if the script writer suddenly thought ""Well, I\'ll just make them fall in love instead. Why the hell not. I\'m the writer.""And so the ending feels out of place, like it doesn\'t belong in this series. Moreover, the respectable characters in here that show some dignity are the ones that get slaughtered by the ending. I was really rooting for Nanakorobi but the series\' writer shows no mercy and slaughters her development (or what was left of it at this point) like a merciless troll.It was all surprising. I mean, \'Happy Lesson\' was already mediocre to begin with so I imagined things could only get better but the final proved me wrong. What you have here is a classical example of an average series driven to disaster by a confused writer who has no sense of direction as far as story-telling goes.That\'s that for the story and the characters. As for art and sound - they stay exactly the same. Good art and a very good OST. The opening is again very captivating and involves all the main characters but I\'m afraid all the artists working on this project have wasted their talents because frankly, the story sucks and drags the whole anime down with it.Enjoyment? Virtually none - other than a sporadic grin here and there. Personally I will pretend that this OVA never happened and the true ending lies with season 2. I\'d advise anyone planning to watch this anime to avoid the final. It should be called ""No Lesson at all final - and hey did you know our writer is neurotic?"".\'Happy Lesson the Final\' gets 3 measly points from me. seasons that basically means over 10 hours in total of this idea being rooted into your head.In the first two episodes of this final you get the idea that this is how the series is going to end.
