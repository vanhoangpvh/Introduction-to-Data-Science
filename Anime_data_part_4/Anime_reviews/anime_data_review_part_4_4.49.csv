Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33142/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Break_Time,"[""This is my first review and I've decided to review Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time because I'm lazy and don't want to tackle an anime that requires thinking or a lot of typing to review. These are essentially just 2 minute shorts based on the currently airing show Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu so the target audience of Break Time is people who are watching and enjoying Re:Zero and can't wait a whole week to get their next Subaru fix. The shorts are humorous in nature and occasionally add a little bit to plot points that were tackled in Re:Zero but are generally unnecessary and...are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary. are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary."", 'Yes, character and voice actor deserves a break, in other words, just for fun, but also feels like trying to add something beneath the middle of the episodes.For example, how Subaru confuse as Apple in real world (Ringo) and Fantasy World, Appas (Ringa), Beatrice hate Subaru calling her Loli, and just small random stuff in the whole episodes.Other than that, is just for your pleasure 3 minute break time after done doing voice acting the main series.Indeed its funny but not from what we expected from short video.6/10...==========================================(Subaru is a car)Pros+ Break time+ Still the same voice actor+ Trying to blend main episodes for extra info.Cons+ Just for fun anime, nothing more.==========================================( Sorry but how to review a short one with a short video? :( ) ==========================================(Subaru is a car)Pros+ Break time+ Still the same voice actor+ Trying to blend main episodes for extra info.Cons+ Just for fun anime, nothing more.==========================================( Sorry but how to review a short one with a short video? :( )', 'I’ll keep my review brief. Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time Is a series of 2 minute shorts taking place in between episodes from season 1. While they aren’t canon, it is filled with little interactions between characters that aren’t meant to just fill the plot. That is either a positive or a negative, depending on how you look at it. However, the 2 minute episodes are perfect for these. Each one is a different interaction between 2-4 different characters.Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and I recommend it to Re:zero fans who want more character development, or just want to see Ram insult Subaru half...a dozen times. a dozen times.', ""I was praying this show was not gonna have these half-baked picture dramas to fill in content, I mean, I was gonna burn through them anyway bur come on. Turned out, for the first time, I had fun.Very easy to run through, episodes are a minute long, the jokes aren't half bad, not hilarious, but passable. The art is cheap, but compared to the norm, it feels alive.The dialogue seems to cover the first 11 or 12 episodes from the show, so no spoilers for the ending in sight, that's good, make sure you've at least already seen up until half of the show.

Rewrite,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31716/Rewrite,"['Since Rewrite is a visual novel by Key, a lot of people will compare it to the likes of Clannad, Angel Beats, Air Cannons, etc. But, I propose some new comparisons.1. Shitcom, because both are pretty shit comedies.2. The sensation of hitting your head against a brick wall for six hours.If you enjoy either of these, then Rewrite might be the perfect show for you. Otherwise, I consider it one of the worst anime of 2016: a fucky jambalaya of overdesigned characters, dumb memes, and a plot that was probably written by someone putting a bunch of sticky notes on a dartboard and writing in...whatever they threw at.Before I go on, let me just say that I don’t give a flying fuck about how good the visual novel is or isn’t. I don’t care what purpose this anime serves to it, whether to be some sort of adaptation, if you can even call it that, or just a teaser meant to advertise it, whatever. I’m just reviewing the anime the same way I review any other anime: like a little dickbag who isn’t good at anything els--I mean, independent of any other source material. I did not at all write a Shokugeki review comparing it to the manga to contradict myself and then delete it out of embarrassment.So if you’re not very familiar with Key’s works, here’s how they generally go: The MC is an everyday normal guy with just enough wit to keep him from being 100% beta, but not enough substance to put him above the level of a general self-insert. He goes to a weird school filled with even weirder people (mostly overly-designed cutesy girls) with some maddeningly strange characteristics. Various shenanigans occur for a few episodes until the plot finally comes in, or maybe there’s one to begin with but doesn’t have much of a focus yet.If you can’t tell, I’m not a fan of these Key guys who think it’s funny to put their logo on every coffee can in every episode of every show. The way they tell their stories is very jarring because of their spontaneous, bombastic sense of humor. Half the time, I can’t tell if they’re trying to make a teenage melodrama, or if they’re trying to make a dinnertime cartoon sitcom for dummies. It\'s an uncomfortable mixture of both, like ketchup and mac and cheese. Since they like to dick around with their storytelling, things can get rushed and/or confusing in the end.These things are increased thousandfold in Rewrite.There is no plot in Rewrite. None. It pretends to have one in the second half, but the “twist” being that something is actually happening comes out so half-heartedly that the writers seem disappointed in themselves that they can’t write in as many dank maymays into their show. Instead… eh. There are monsters, eh. People are fighting, eh. The world is gonna die, eh. FEECOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoops, there goes Rewrite being funny again xDDDD!Don’t believe me? Here’s part of MAL’s synopsis, albeit fanmade by MAL Rewrite (that joke is funnier than anything else in this show):""Equipped with the superhuman ability to permanently rewrite any part of his body to multiply his strength or speed, Kotarou is naturally drawn to the supernatural.""You know when this Rewrite ability is shown for the first time? Episode fucking four. Not one. Four. And, as usual, the story just reveals it as if it’s the most normal thing in the world. No prior hints for him having this power, no explanation as to how or why he has it, nothing. And that synopsis isn’t even accurate, because it\'s not just about increasing strength. At one point, he “rewrites” his body to resist poison. What else can he do? Resist age? Resist death? Become invisible? Triple the size of his dick? You know, that would be a good power to have in a massive waifu war such as Rewrite. I think there was a hugely missed opportunity here.Other people have powers too. Just because. And there are shitty CG monsters sometimes. Just because. Eh. It’s all part of the hilariously goofy fun that is the Whatever Club at Whatever High School!The real plot towards the end turns out to be some environmental awareness campaign. People are assholes and don’t take care of the planet, so other people need to out-asshole them and activate a thing that will kill everyone so that the planet can live. I don’t know how this is supposed to tie into the main character having the ability to theoretically give himself the neck of Alolan Exeggutor. Maybe there’s a reason somewhere that I missed, but it’s a little hard to follow along when the show tries to adapt every possible waifu route in the game while playing catch-up with the plot because that took forever to come in and now it needs to do 3,000 things at once if it wants to wrap up in time. Except the plot took so long to come in that I lost interest before it even happened. Maybe this show should’ve had a rewrite, eh? Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh???And at the end of the day, what did this amount to? A dead end. Literally. The ending is not satisfying, as it’s apparently just one route of many, leading me to wonder what the point of all of this even was. Was it to introduce the characters? Anything could’ve done that within a couple episodes; to say an entire thirteen-episode season can be dedicated to that would be an outright lie. Is it to introduce the setting? Kazamatsuri has basically no focus at all. I know that it’s a big place and kinda environmental-friendly. My fucking bedroom could\'ve been a more interesting setting, because at least I have Big Order posters. Is it to explain the conflict of the show? Well, it only took them until at least six episodes for them to reveal that there was any conflict in the first place, so… no. It’s all a bunch of mush, and I’m not quoting whatever that pink sheep dog thing was. It tries to please both visual novel readers and newcomers by adapting the visual novel with an anime-original route that tells a complete story while also introducing a story. I don\'t even know what the fuck that means, but it failed at all of it.Key should just make their own Nichijou. A show where nothing happens, everything is stupid, and it’s funny as hell. Make something like that to satisfy their own sense of humor, so that maybe they can tell a compelling story and find a way for someone to get attached to its characters beyond humorous interactions. Ha ha, Kagari likes coffee and calls it ""feecof""!! What a deep character!!!As everyone will write in every review for every comedy anime in the world: comedy is subjective. Not everyone is going to love it or get it, so making the characters more like a bunch of running jokes in the midst of a deep melodrama might not be the best idea. When they fed me a character\'s sob story, my reaction wasn\'t ""Oh no, how sad! I\'m emotionally invested now!"", it was ""Wait, I was supposed to take this seriously?"" The usual nonsense that follows a sad moment leads me to believe that I had the right idea.I can admit that the show was a little funny at times. It was. There was about… one gag per episode that got a laugh out of me. For about four episodes. Because within those first few episodes, I was still somewhat invested in the show. I thought everything would make sense in the end, that something was gonna happen at any moment that would tie everything together and make me believe the show was actually a work of genius. But then it never happened, and even still I was trapped, because I was at a point where I was in too far to pull out and cut my losses. I needed to see it to the end, so I could at least splash more salt than Arataka Reigen. Perhaps that was the point, just to lure everyone in and keep them thinking that, someday, it’ll all come together and make sense, only for them to post a note at the end saying “lol fuk u idiot”. If so, congrats Rewrite, Key, Studio 8bit, you totally PRANK’D me bro!! XDDDDDdddeDdDdrefzdfxffAh, it’s like someone probably once said, a good piece of entertainment is one that leaves the viewer thinking. Rewrite leaves me thinking that I should’ve died in that car wreck I had last year.I don’t know who the fuck this 8bit studio is, and given the art of this show and that their most popular work is Infinite Stratos, it seems I haven’t missed out on anything. Rewrite looks terrible. Not even because of the mediocre studio, but even designs imported from the visual novel. Who in the name of Lady Gaga designed the school uniforms in this show? What kind of cruel monster would subjugate these poor girls to this kind of torture? They all have to wear these extremely overdesigned, uncomfortable-looking dresses with skirts and sleeves that you could drive a truck into despite the torso clinging to their tits like a wet washcloth. Isn’t that nice? No, they don’t look cute in the slightest, they look like they take a half-hour to actually put on. And I’m sorry to disappoint everyone, but I’m not really into fucking the wrappers of strawberry-and-creme hard candies. But, whatever fetish you relish.The animation is mediocre, which for the most part isn’t a problem, but for some reason the anime becomes an action series with a bunch of fights, and then it’s a problem. Even worse is that there are a bunch of weird supernatural beasts in the second half of the show, and while they have an interestingly jaded color scheme, they’re done in really poor CG. At other times, it’s inconsistent, such as the way they animate Kagari. Do her ribbons move around with a mind of their own, or don’t they? I dunno, I guess whatever key animator 8bit hired for that episode gets to decide that. No particular positives about the art can make up for the big negatives; the only things possibly worth mentioning are that the OP’s and ED’s look surprisingly good, and that maybe the character designs are okay, but as you can expect from a visual novel full of girls, some of them are gonna look strange, like Shizuru and Kotori.I guess I should also mention some of the voice acting, because Hana Kanasamanawamallama voiced the main loli girl. Apparently that means it’s good. Not really, because her role didn’t have anything impressive about it, but at least her voice is nice to hear. Otherwise, the soundtrack was decent; it never felt spectacular and most of the time it was pretty average, but there were some good, emotional or light-hearted tracks here and there, especially when (and this is weird to say) Kotaro was about to grope Akane, they played the VN\'s OP. Nice. The OP’s and ED’s were all pretty decent as well, though not impressive either.Do I need to say anything else? Don\'t watch this anime, no matter what sort of relationship you have with the source material. This anime sucks. The story sucks. The idea of it sucks. The way it’s told sucks. The people who are in it suck. Hell, the people that made it probably suck too. Maybe I’ll join Gaia. Not because I care about the planet, but because, sometimes, I just feel that a lot of people dying would fix things. Kefka did nothing wrong.

This almost feels surreal, right? I’ll get straight to the point. While the idea of Rewrite finally getting an anime has been a dream for Key fans for many years, it may also be somewhat a tarnished reality as we realize what we’re really getting. After finishing the show, it’s more than just tarnished. Much more.On paper, Rewrite follows a lot of standard Key formulas you’ll recognize easily if you’re already familiar with their work. The slow paced story from the beginning, generic character personalities, and supernatural phenomenon are just a few to...name. However, one thing this adaptation didn’t fully embrace is its ability to move the audience. What that literally means is its inability to make the viewers feel tearful unlike some other series. (ex. Clannad After Story) Some may question that it would be unfair to compare Rewrite to other Key’s works but in reality, the adaptation really has more humor than it should.From the first few episodes, we meet Kotarou Tennouji, the male protagonist. He gets involved with his school’s Occult Club where we meet the other female characters. They range with different personalities and all more or less oddball characters at first. The real catch though is that they are also involved in some kind of darker plot that unfolds as the series progresses. But on paper, the first few episodes doesn’t reveal much of itself as it tries to get viewers to familiarize with the franchise. In essence, the main female characters will likely be a hit or miss to get attached to. Most of them are stereotypes like the school council representative type or the redheaded tsundere. Meanwhile, the series does also introduce a mysterious character from Tennouji’s dream, a young girl with ribbons that seemingly kills him. Perhaps this is where viewers will get intrigued by the show.From a standard viewpoint, the storytelling of the series bounces between acceptable and awful. There are some episodes that nails the coffin when it comes to creativity while others makes you feel like it’s a forced chore to finish. As an anime original viewer, I confess that the show itself is underwhelming particular with characters such as Lucia. The way their own story is set up not only feels rushed but lacks concrete feelings. It’s hard to feel what they are going through with the pacing especially from the buildup and ultimately doesn’t really satisfy what its intentions were. On the other hand, some other background storytelling such as with Shizuru (the eye patch girl) feels it’s done right because of the more tragic mood. Still, with the show being just 1-cour, you really shouldn’t expect a full adaptation of each girl’s story. In fact, this particular anime actually develops into a more mysterious plot that unfolds with connecting events. Unfortunately, the insert episodes of the girls’ routes doesn’t do much justice and weighs down the show overall.As Rewrite retains a lot of comedy, there’s also the mysteries that carries over the course of the show. I already mentioned about the strange ribbon girl from Tennouji’s dreams. However, we also get the main setting that itself is a mystery. The series takes place Kazamatsuri and has quite a lot of hidden secrets, some that ventures into the supernatural realm. Being the curious guy that he is, Tennouji is drawn to these mysteries as he has a supernatural ability of his own. A major turning point revolves about the utopia-like environment and where all sorts of strange occurrences takes place. When one of the students at Tennouji’s school goes missing, that’s where we realize Rewrite can be darker than it seems. We are also introduced to factions that have conflicts with each other and some of the girls from the Occult Club are involved. Tennouji himself also begins to display inhuman talent with his own Rewrite ability. And finally, we also learn a lot more about the mysterious ribbon girl that appears in Tennouji’s dream. It’ll take patience for viewers to eventually get to the main meat of the plot and if you’re the type that sees Key as an insufferable product, then this will be a hard show to follow.Perhaps storytelling isn’t just what Rewrite emphasizes on though. There’s also relationships, connections that tries to be meaningful. Tennouji develops several important relationships with others including Lucia, Kotori, Kagari (the ribbon girl), among others. However, the show itself seems to focus on that mostly on the surface level. Because of time restraints, they aren’t concretely developed as you’ll anticipate. Oh and it’s easy to forget about characters like Haruhiko when his role in the show seems to be mainly comic relief. And romance? That part is mostly teased at and hard to really appreciate if it’s even there. At best, character relationships are subtly memorable but because of the mediocre buildup, they aren’t very memorable.Adapted by studio 8-bit, the show itself is underwhelming when it comes to visual quality. The characters look blend while it does retain Key style features such as the moe-eyes, feminine parts, and surreal-like atmosphere. However, the action is more of a disappointment. Well to be honest, the action was never a main attraction in the show anyway and the brief segments where we see that isn’t so appealing either. There’s not much fan service in the show except with the blushing and that one episode where Lucia puts on a maid outfit. Oh yes, a maid outfit.On the other hand, soundtrack for Rewrite is impressive. Well, not in the impressive that it’s a masterpiece but definitely hits the key points. The theme songs offers choreography that fits the show quite right while the OST is mysterious as it should be. Even during comedic moments, the music seems to fall in place naturally. Furthermore, character voice expressions are well delivered if you compare to their characters from the VN.So in the end, what should you really take for granted from Rewrite? It’s pretty much a popcorn entertainment that’s perhaps only easy to watch if you come with an open mind. For those with high expectations, it’s probably a good idea to drop the show as it seems to appeal to a broader audience, beyond the visual novel fans. I think Rewrite tried to take a risk and although it partially succeeds, there’s more failure. In the end, it’s a nice show to pass time with for fun but not something to talk about for years to come. Oh and season 2 has been announced for the love of God, let’s pray for a better sequel. name.

In essence, the main female characters will likely be a hit or miss to get attached to. Most of them are stereotypes like the school council representative type or the redheaded tsundere. Meanwhile, the series does also introduce a mysterious character from Tennouji’s dream, a young girl with ribbons that seemingly kills him. Perhaps this is where viewers will get intrigued by the show.From a standard viewpoint, the storytelling of the series bounces between acceptable and awful. There are some episodes that nails the coffin when it comes to creativity while others makes you feel like it’s a forced chore to finish. As an anime original viewer, I confess that the show itself is underwhelming particular with characters such as Lucia. The way their own story is set up not only feels rushed but lacks concrete feelings. It’s hard to feel what they are going through with the pacing especially from the buildup and ultimately doesn’t really satisfy what its intentions were. On the other hand, some other background storytelling such as with Shizuru (the eye patch girl) feels it’s done right because of the more tragic mood. Still, with the show being just 1-cour, you really shouldn’t expect a full adaptation of each girl’s story. In fact, this particular anime actually develops into a more mysterious plot that unfolds with connecting events. Unfortunately, the insert episodes of the girls’ routes doesn’t do much justice and weighs down the show overall.As Rewrite retains a lot of comedy, there’s also the mysteries that carries over the course of the show. I already mentioned about the strange ribbon girl from Tennouji’s dreams. However, we also get the main setting that itself is a mystery. The series takes place Kazamatsuri and has quite a lot of hidden secrets, some that ventures into the supernatural realm. Being the curious guy that he is, Tennouji is drawn to these mysteries as he has a supernatural ability of his own. A major turning point revolves about the utopia-like environment and where all sorts of strange occurrences takes place. When one of the students at Tennouji’s school goes missing, that’s where we realize Rewrite can be darker than it seems. We are also introduced to factions that have conflicts with each other and some of the girls from the Occult Club are involved. Tennouji himself also begins to display inhuman talent with his own Rewrite ability. And finally, we also learn a lot more about the mysterious ribbon girl that appears in Tennouji’s dream. It’ll take patience for viewers to eventually get to the main meat of the plot and if you’re the type that sees Key as an insufferable product, then this will be a hard show to follow.Perhaps storytelling isn’t just what Rewrite emphasizes on though. There’s also relationships, connections that tries to be meaningful. Tennouji develops several important relationships with others including Lucia, Kotori, Kagari (the ribbon girl), among others. However, the show itself seems to focus on that mostly on the surface level. Because of time restraints, they aren’t concretely developed as you’ll anticipate. Oh and it’s easy to forget about characters like Haruhiko when his role in the show seems to be mainly comic relief. And romance? That part is mostly teased at and hard to really appreciate if it’s even there. At best, character relationships are subtly memorable but because of the mediocre buildup, they aren’t very memorable.Adapted by studio 8-bit, the show itself is underwhelming when it comes to visual quality. The characters look blend while it does retain Key style features such as the moe-eyes, feminine parts, and surreal-like atmosphere. However, the action is more of a disappointment. Well to be honest, the action was never a main attraction in the show anyway and the brief segments where we see that isn’t so appealing either. There’s not much fan service in the show except with the blushing and that one episode where Lucia puts on a maid outfit. Oh yes, a maid outfit.On the other hand, soundtrack for Rewrite is impressive. Well, not in the impressive that it’s a masterpiece but definitely hits the key points. The theme songs offers choreography that fits the show quite right while the OST is mysterious as it should be. Even during comedic moments, the music seems to fall in place naturally. Furthermore, character voice expressions are well delivered if you compare to their characters from the VN.So in the end, what should you really take for granted from Rewrite? It’s pretty much a popcorn entertainment that’s perhaps only easy to watch if you come with an open mind. For those with high expectations, it’s probably a good idea to drop the show as it seems to appeal to a broader audience, beyond the visual novel fans. I think Rewrite tried to take a risk and although it partially succeeds, there’s more failure. In the end, it’s a nice show to pass time with for fun but not something to talk about for years to come. Oh and season 2 has been announced for the love of God, let’s pray for a better sequel.', 'Have a great story and long stories like Key usually get them done, are priceless to see in animation, this one, even with its own factors, it\'s one of them...The characters are the basis in all stories, and in this one the characters have a great color because each one tell its own story and with that, the story change itself to its true colors.The sound and art are nostalgic to the novel, even the 3D sprites, and the usual BGM, so you gonna have a great environment with the luxury of a visual novel material in animation.The story, good this animated route, it explain...characters, environments, plot, etc... but for the popular opinion, this is only at the start, when the real problem enter in the play, the anime take a speed of explanation and change of scenes that can make you say: ""What I am seeing?! How?

Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He\'s a high...school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body. He can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.That\'s the story very simplified, it doesn\'t really catch many attention by simply reading the synopsis, despite being much more complex than it seems.This anime is an action, comedy, romance and school genre, but why is harem not included here? Refering to the ANIME it really should be a harem genre, a guy staying with five girls in a club, getting along better with each one at each episode. As regards to the action genre I really think they tried to have many action scenes since the very beginning of the anime, which I think was not necessary, because if it followed a slower pace I\'m pretty sure it would be way better than that, there\'s too many action and too many things happening, I mean, things happen too fast and sometimes you don\'t even know anymore what you are watching, I think the word that fits it better is: messy, I also saw many people saying that weren\'t understanding anything about the anime. About the Comedy in the anime, it\'s funny, not a anime that you will laugh every minute, not even every episode, just because it is not meant to be this way, so I really think it doesn\'t lack comedy at all, in other words, in my opinion the comedy was almost used in the right way, there are some scenes where comedy wasn\'t necessary, actually, it shouldn\'t be there. About the Romance, until now the romance was not very present, it just seems like a generic harem anime, not romantic, even the characters personalities seems like harem.The Art of the anime tried to be the most moe as possible, all the girls were supposed to be cute, I don\'t think it fits the anime at all, it could be a lot better, but I didn\'t found it bad or ugly. It has some CG\'s, some of them were well made, but most of them weren\'t, I don\'t consider it unpleasant, maybe for the majority it can be, also some scenes I feel like the art is a bit bad, but it also has some scenes I found the art pretty, specifically at the beginning of the first episode only, to be honest, as the episodes went by I had the feeling the art worsened.About the sound, I think it\'s almost perfect, it fits with the scenes and they are very pleasant to hear, OP and ED are beautiful, also 2nd OP and ED are great, Koibumi from Yanagi Nagi and Sunbright by Ayaka Kitazawa are wonderful, I just think the musics were used in the wrong way or timing sometimes, that\'s why I wouldn\'t give it a 10 score.About the characters all of them are pretty funny in their own way, all of them have unique characteristics and personalities, although they seem like the same generic harem type of characters in the beggining, they are pretty well made and show their real selfs at some point.I can say I did enjoy it a lot, and also that I didn\'t, probably because I read the novel it disappointed me in some points, but it was so enjoyable to see some good scenes being animated, many action scenes, drama, some funny scenes and some romance aspects, although it really feels like just another harem action anime in the beginning. The anime has a fast pace and that\'s the bad point here, this ""original route"" was not bad, the way they adapted it to be a 13 episodes isn\'t bad, but the way the story was presented and how rushed it is, this is what makes it bad, also the original route is pretty much a mix of every route in Rewrite in a lighter version, when what\'s happening is ""too heavy"" it seems that they tried to break the ice making a comedy scene right after it, that\'s another bad point.A new season has already been announced, which I think is great, this entirely season seemed to be rushed and it really was. Anime-only viewers probably disliked it, also some people who read the novel too, they left so many things unexplained, but there\'s still hope for this, next season Moon and Terra routes will be adapted, so it will probably be more understandable for everyone and it\'s expected to be better adapted too. I\'m looking forward for it and I hope everyone feels the same, I mean, this entire season feels like an introduction for the vast and complex story of rewrite, and probably everything will be much more clear after season two, and also depending on how good next season will be, people may change the opinion about this, unfortunately(or not) some people probably just won\'t watch next season. school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body.

On one hand I was happy that one of my all-time favorite visual novels was finally getting an anime against my expectations, but on the other hand I also knew that making a good adaptation out of it would be incredibly difficult. This is partially because the visual novel is extraordinarily long and partially because all of its routes directly contradict each other and therefore wouldn\'t make much...sense in a linear medium like anime. So it\'s fair to say that I came into this with a fair amount of skepticism, especially considering that 8bit were the ones pulling the reigns: the same studio which had already completely destroyed another top rated visual novel two years earlier in Grisaia no Kajitsu.And as it turns out, I was right to be skeptical, albeit not quite for the reasons I initially expected. See, the main reason Kajitsu was butchered so hard was because it was unbelievably rushed: they tried to squeeze in a full 80-ish hour visual novel into 13 episodes, and unsurprisingly failed miserably at it, so I was expecting Rewrite to get roughly the same treatment. But as it turns out that wasn\'t quite the case, because this time around they decided that instead of trying to adapt an enormous amount of content in an impossibly small time frame, they made an anime original story instead. They tried to circumvent the problem by doing an original arc instead of adapting any of the routes of the game itself, which felt like a bit of a cop-out move to me, but given the circumstances it was probably the best thing they could have done. On paper that is.The main problem is, however, that this series doesn\'t actually function properly as an original anime. Why? Because if you\'re an anime-only viewer, the story makes absolutely no sense. For anyone that hasn\'t played the visual novel, you\'re most likely going to come out of this anime thinking ""wtf just happened"" more so than anything else. Basically what they\'ve primarily done is taken certain snippets from Rewrite\'s various visual novel routes and put them all together into something new, but it just doesn\'t work out very well at all. It\'s like blindly taking out all the contents of your refrigerator and throwing them into a blender, and hoping that the resulting slurry turns out to be tasty (protip: it probably won\'t). There are so many characters that are just thrown into the show with barely any explanation whatsoever, so many plot twists that come across as pulled totally out of nowhere, so many underlying themes and deeper messages that will fly completely over anime-only viewers heads due to lacking proper exposition, and so many supposedly emotional scenes which wholly miss their mark partially because they feel spontaneous and unnatural, and partially because the show does almost nothing to make you empathize with its characters due to how little development they get. Also how they insist on using some of the amazingly beautiful soundtracks from the visual novel for a few such scenes feels almost insulting due to how low the actual emotional impact of the scene itself is compared to where those tracks were originally used in the game... it\'s like watching a death scene from Another set to the music of Continued Story: you just don\'t.Anyway, despite supposedly being an anime original version, it\'s still part of the same complex universe that the visual novel routes play out in, and if you\'re an anime-only watcher it\'ll all be very confusing to watch not only because of how lightning fast the pacing is, but also because of how many scenes are omitted and how much information about the bigger picture of the world itself that you don\'t have. As I mentioned earlier, Rewrite is built upon having blatantly contradictory character routes which together create the overarching story as a whole. Everything is connected and part of a much greater picture. So when you\'re doing an anime original route instead, you can\'t really avoid having to leave a ton of loose ends open. As a result this is barely even watchable as an anime-only viewer, and even if you have played the visual novel it\'s still rather inexcusable. Yes, I might understand what is going on a lot more so than most viewers as a result, but it doesn\'t change the fact that the entire anime is a huge clusterfuck that doesn\'t even come remotely close to the level of the visual novel at any point. It just doesn\'t feel satisfying to watch at all, and constantly leaves you hanging with this feeling of ""what could have been"".There are also certain plot points which are so obviously catered towards people familiar with the source material that they don\'t really function properly for those who aren\'t. For example, in the beginning of episode 8 there is a minute-long scene of a tiny rock floating through space at high velocity, eventually crashing through Earth\'s atmosphere and hitting Kagari right in the head. Evidentially it hit her head pretty badly because from that moment on, her personality makes a full 180, which has a rather drastic impact on the following turns of events. Now if you\'ve played the visual novel you should be able to figure out how and why this happened as it\'s certainly not anything random, but for an anime-only viewer this plot point is completely absurd. A random tiny asteroid ending up hitting a girl\'s head as it crashes onto the planet, forever altering her personality? I mean it\'ll look like the most forced plot twist ever made if you don\'t know any better. Sure, after the upcoming second season (and yes that was announced at the end of episode 13) they should be able to piece it together as well, but the entire joke of the scene won\'t really work retroactively and it\'ll still come across as somewhat forced that way. I just can\'t help but feel like this is the wrong kind of execution to do when you make an anime original route, because again it pretty much assumes that the viewer has knowledge of latter events which at the current point in time only people who\'ve read the visual novel will have. If this Kagari route had been part of the game, it\'d probably have been pretty far down on the recommended route order chart; certainly not at the very top at least.Now I\'ve seen some people argue that 8bit have still done a decent job under the circumstances considering that they had a basically impossible task to begin with, and while I do see what they\'re getting at (because let\'s face it, making a proper adaptation of Rewrite with this few episodes is a laughable idea regardless of who\'s pulling the strings), I can\'t really agree on it. While it is true that this anime was more or less doomed before it even started, there were definitely things they could have done a lot better. For example, episodes 4 & 5 were in my opinion a complete waste of time. What I was promised was an anime original story focusing on one of the girls that didn\'t have a normal route in the visual novel, Kagari, and nothing more. I wasn\'t exactly satisfied with that prospect but I could live with it given the lack of realistic options. But despite that they still insist on spending entire episodes solely on going into the backstories of some of the other heroines in an incredibly rushed manner of fashion that not only felt extremely unsatisfying on their own due to the terrible pacing, but also it has almost nothing to do with the anime original route itself. So why even adapt it? Like you either adapt a route properly or not at all, don\'t just throw in abridged versions of them out of nowhere just because you can, geez. In the first place, what\'s the point of teasing so much about the other girls when you\'re not ever going to follow up on it and properly show the full picture of what the truth behind them is? To tease people into buying the game I guess? Perhaps even more importantly though, by doing this you\'re taking away precious screen time that could have actually been spent on developing this original arc you\'re so insistent on doing. Like if there\'s one thing which you should never end up having pacing issues with, it\'s an original anime. I mean the entire scenario script is supposed to be written from scratch specifically to fit the episode count damn it.Another thing I found really disappointing is how incredibly casual the anime is about revealing the supernatural. In the visual novel you don\'t even find undeniable evidence that there even is anything supernatural until the end of the common route (adapted in episode 7 in a different version), which is almost 20 hours into it. Yes, you know Kotarou can rewrite himself, and yes, you encounter ominous-looking black dogs in the forest and the city at night as well as numerous suspicious people, but that\'s about it. Then when the actual reveal comes, it hits you like a hammer with how dramatic the tone shift is. The early part of Rewrite is supposed to be school/comedy/mystery, and then in the actual character routes it transforms into action/drama/supernatural. But in the anime, they\'ve kind of just... jumbled everything together. Kotarou is like yeah I have a super power, Shizuru casually reveals hers without much explanation provided, and when Kotarou is given his ""claws"" then you\'re just going to have to accept what you\'re watching because the anime sure isn\'t planning on explaining where they came from anytime soon, etcetera. It all feels very mish-mashed without any clear direction, almost as if they did everything in the wrong order. I don\'t know, making a good anime out of Rewrite with such a tight schedule is probably impossible no matter what you do; even an original route like this doesn\'t really work because the world itself is far too complex for you to be able to make a satisfying standalone arc without it becoming entangled in the ""real"" story of Rewrite in some way, causing a ton of loose ends that will never be able to followed up upon. It only forces 8bit to include a bunch of scenes they seriously shouldn\'t, wasting even more of what little precious screen time they have at their disposal. It\'s no wonder the pacing is so all over the place. On top of that the anime also has some incredibly awkward usage of CGI for all the various types of familiars it contains, so the action scenes aren\'t exactly a pleasure to look at either. Hell, even the regular 2D art really dips in quality every so often, especially in the last few episodes of the show. It felt like they were having some serious budget issues here, and as a result there were a lot more derp faces than I would have liked.As far as the characters goes, I\'m also pretty disappointed. I actually consider the visual novel\'s character cast to be in my top 5 even to this day, due to its diversity, great character development on many different fronts, and for just being plain entertaining in general. But the anime does... basically nothing to showcase either of these things. First and foremost, there are simply way too many characters in Rewrite for such a short anime to support. It\'s a very complex universe including multiple factions, people with drastically different ideals and goals, driven by their own respective backstories, etcetera. There just isn\'t anywhere near enough time to explain who they all are and what their purposes in the story really are. Especially considering that (you guessed it) for many of them, said explanations are provided deeper into the various heroine routes of the game, and they\'re not just something you can throw out at a moment\'s notice. In other words they really never had a chance to be anything more than random supporting characters in the anime because the script doesn\'t permit their characters to ever be properly explained or developed. Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go full anime original? And this is just talking about the supporting cast; if we talk about the actual main characters here then it\'s obviously even worse because all the original main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) just come across as random harem members in the anime as none of them get any proper characterization to speak of at all. Why? Well... because their routes aren\'t adapted. It all keeps coming back to that, doesn\'t it? Even Kotarou suffers from this because he\'s supposed to grow in those arcs as well.Sooo I don\'t know, I don\'t straight-up hate the show but I just can\'t help but feel that it\'s so pointless. If you\'ve played the visual novel, the anime feels like a massive downgrade in comparison, and if you haven\'t played it then you\'ll be missing out on so much that it\'ll barely be comprehensible due to how confusing the story will be, how much content is cut out and how rushed it is. So what is the target demographic supposed to be? No one can say they\'re truly 100% happy with this anime. At least on that front it\'s certainly no different from Kajitsu.I think the obvious yet unfortunate truth here is that the whole point of this anime is nothing more than to be an advertisement for the Rewrite+ release of the visual novel, which is a new version released on July 29th in Japan this year, I.E: shortly after the anime started airing. It contains new CGs, more voice acting, slight scenario revisions, etcetera. For a long time I was also under the impression that this release was going to contain the new Kagari route as well in visual novel format, but as it turns out that\'s actually not the case. It doesn\'t really seem to contain any noteworthy new story content at all. So my hypothesis is that the release of Rewrite+ in combination with this original anime is nothing more than a marketing ploy, where people who have no prior experience with the franchise will get a first-time introduction to it through the anime and get interested enough to at least be willing to purchase the game. Then of course since Rewrite+ has just been released recently, which sounds like a much cooler version than the original for people not knowing any better, those new fans will throw their money at the much more expensive ""new"" game instead of the cheaper ""old"" Rewrite from 2011. Again, this is just my theory but honestly it\'s the only idea I can come up with that can financially justify re-releasing a game 5 years later with hardly any noteworthy changes made, as well as simultaneously making an awful anime adaptation of the same game that is neither satisfying for old fans of the games nor anime-only watchers.So with that said, in the end... I can\'t help but feel like this anime is meaningless, or at least it\'ll only function as a sales booster for the new game release, which is nice for the creators I guess but that doesn\'t actually make the anime itself any better for me personally, nor should it for any other viewers of it.It has to be said though that if we ignore this show\'s origins for a second and just look at it as any other anime among the thousands of others out there, then it\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, far from it, but it\'d probably be something most people would forget about almost completely within a day or two of finishing it. However, we can\'t avert our eyes from the truth that much, and the fact of the matter is that this is supposed to be a representation of one of Key\'s three biggest visual novels, alongside Clannad and Little Busters. Personally I\'d even say Rewrite is the best of them all; I played all three of them back-to-back way back in the beginning of 2013, and at least for a short time afterwards I actually considered Rewrite to be my favorite visual novel. It might not have maintained that spot for too long but either way the point is that... it just deserves better than this. Yes, I\'ve known ever since the day I finished the game that making a proper adaptation of Rewrite was probably impossible no matter what, but I was still hoping for a lot better than what this anime gave us. At the very least it should have gotten more episodes than this; Clannad got 4-cours and Little Busters got 3, why is Rewrite stuck with merely 2? If anything this is the one which needed the most episodes out of the trio since it has a lot less content that can be omitted. Realistically speaking 4 cours would probably have been the optimal pacing-wise given the length of the game. But I guess that\'s just the world we live in nowadays: anime are mostly produced in order to promote their source materials and boost the sales of those, and as a result we very rarely see shows with more than 2 cours anymore. For a lot of series that\'s totally fine and all, but for ones with very long source materials like this, it\'s basically a killing blow, unfortunately.Last but not least though, as mentioned previously we are at least getting a second season for Winter 2017 (so it\'s a split cour), and this is giving me a certain feeling of déjà vu. See, as badly as 8bit destroyed Grisaia no Kajitsu two years ago, they actually did a very respectable job with its sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, and the main reason for that was simply that the sequels are way shorter to begin with and thus much easier to adapt since they didn\'t have to rush them so badly, unlike with Kajitsu. And I feel like the same thing could very well happen with Rewrite. In case you don\'t know, the visual novel has one route for each of the main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) and then a two-part True route at the end, with the first part being called Moon and the second part being called Terra. Now in the anime they\'ve basically replaced the five girls\' routes with this original Kagari route, and the upcoming second season will adapt Moon and Terra. In other words the second season should actually not be anime original, unlike this one. There will probably be minor changes in order to accommodate for everything they\'ve done in the first season, but for the most part I reckon it should be pretty much the same as in the game. And above all, just Moon and Terra on their own should actually be doable in 1 cour, so we might actually have acceptable pacing next time around as well. With all that being taken into account, it could actually turn out to be a pretty good anime. The downside is of course that we seriously lack proper buildup for it since none of the heroine routes were adapted first, so I\'m not sure how everything will turn out in the end regardless. But I think it at least has decent potential to come out alright for those who are already familiar with those routes, I.E: those who have played the visual novel first. And for those who haven\'t... maybe, I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see.If nothing else, given how unsatisfying this first season has been on its own it can only go upwards from here. Let\'s hope the second time\'s the charm in this case. Then again I know better than to expect much from 8bit no matter what by now, so I won\'t get my hopes up too high just yet. sense in a linear medium like anime. So it\'s fair to say that I came into this with a fair amount of skepticism, especially considering that 8bit were the ones pulling the reigns: the same studio which had already completely destroyed another top rated visual novel two years earlier in Grisaia no Kajitsu.And as it turns out, I was right to be skeptical, albeit not quite for the reasons I initially expected. See, the main reason Kajitsu was butchered so hard was because it was unbelievably rushed: they tried to squeeze in a full 80-ish hour visual novel into 13 episodes, and unsurprisingly failed miserably at it, so I was expecting Rewrite to get roughly the same treatment. But as it turns out that wasn\'t quite the case, because this time around they decided that instead of trying to adapt an enormous amount of content in an impossibly small time frame, they made an anime original story instead. They tried to circumvent the problem by doing an original arc instead of adapting any of the routes of the game itself, which felt like a bit of a cop-out move to me, but given the circumstances it was probably the best thing they could have done. On paper that is.The main problem is, however, that this series doesn\'t actually function properly as an original anime. Why? Because if you\'re an anime-only viewer, the story makes absolutely no sense. For anyone that hasn\'t played the visual novel, you\'re most likely going to come out of this anime thinking ""wtf just happened"" more so than anything else. Basically what they\'ve primarily done is taken certain snippets from Rewrite\'s various visual novel routes and put them all together into something new, but it just doesn\'t work out very well at all. It\'s like blindly taking out all the contents of your refrigerator and throwing them into a blender, and hoping that the resulting slurry turns out to be tasty (protip: it probably won\'t). There are so many characters that are just thrown into the show with barely any explanation whatsoever, so many plot twists that come across as pulled totally out of nowhere, so many underlying themes and deeper messages that will fly completely over anime-only viewers heads due to lacking proper exposition, and so many supposedly emotional scenes which wholly miss their mark partially because they feel spontaneous and unnatural, and partially because the show does almost nothing to make you empathize with its characters due to how little development they get. Also how they insist on using some of the amazingly beautiful soundtracks from the visual novel for a few such scenes feels almost insulting due to how low the actual emotional impact of the scene itself is compared to where those tracks were originally used in the game... it\'s like watching a death scene from Another set to the music of Continued Story: you just don\'t.Anyway, despite supposedly being an anime original version, it\'s still part of the same complex universe that the visual novel routes play out in, and if you\'re an anime-only watcher it\'ll all be very confusing to watch not only because of how lightning fast the pacing is, but also because of how many scenes are omitted and how much information about the bigger picture of the world itself that you don\'t have. As I mentioned earlier, Rewrite is built upon having blatantly contradictory character routes which together create the overarching story as a whole. Everything is connected and part of a much greater picture. So when you\'re doing an anime original route instead, you can\'t really avoid having to leave a ton of loose ends open. As a result this is barely even watchable as an anime-only viewer, and even if you have played the visual novel it\'s still rather inexcusable. Yes, I might understand what is going on a lot more so than most viewers as a result, but it doesn\'t change the fact that the entire anime is a huge clusterfuck that doesn\'t even come remotely close to the level of the visual novel at any point. It just doesn\'t feel satisfying to watch at all, and constantly leaves you hanging with this feeling of ""what could have been"".There are also certain plot points which are so obviously catered towards people familiar with the source material that they don\'t really function properly for those who aren\'t. For example, in the beginning of episode 8 there is a minute-long scene of a tiny rock floating through space at high velocity, eventually crashing through Earth\'s atmosphere and hitting Kagari right in the head. Evidentially it hit her head pretty badly because from that moment on, her personality makes a full 180, which has a rather drastic impact on the following turns of events. Now if you\'ve played the visual novel you should be able to figure out how and why this happened as it\'s certainly not anything random, but for an anime-only viewer this plot point is completely absurd. A random tiny asteroid ending up hitting a girl\'s head as it crashes onto the planet, forever altering her personality? I mean it\'ll look like the most forced plot twist ever made if you don\'t know any better. Sure, after the upcoming second season (and yes that was announced at the end of episode 13) they should be able to piece it together as well, but the entire joke of the scene won\'t really work retroactively and it\'ll still come across as somewhat forced that way. I just can\'t help but feel like this is the wrong kind of execution to do when you make an anime original route, because again it pretty much assumes that the viewer has knowledge of latter events which at the current point in time only people who\'ve read the visual novel will have. If this Kagari route had been part of the game, it\'d probably have been pretty far down on the recommended route order chart; certainly not at the very top at least.Now I\'ve seen some people argue that 8bit have still done a decent job under the circumstances considering that they had a basically impossible task to begin with, and while I do see what they\'re getting at (because let\'s face it, making a proper adaptation of Rewrite with this few episodes is a laughable idea regardless of who\'s pulling the strings), I can\'t really agree on it. While it is true that this anime was more or less doomed before it even started, there were definitely things they could have done a lot better. For example, episodes 4 & 5 were in my opinion a complete waste of time. What I was promised was an anime original story focusing on one of the girls that didn\'t have a normal route in the visual novel, Kagari, and nothing more. I wasn\'t exactly satisfied with that prospect but I could live with it given the lack of realistic options. But despite that they still insist on spending entire episodes solely on going into the backstories of some of the other heroines in an incredibly rushed manner of fashion that not only felt extremely unsatisfying on their own due to the terrible pacing, but also it has almost nothing to do with the anime original route itself. So why even adapt it? Like you either adapt a route properly or not at all, don\'t just throw in abridged versions of them out of nowhere just because you can, geez. In the first place, what\'s the point of teasing so much about the other girls when you\'re not ever going to follow up on it and properly show the full picture of what the truth behind them is? To tease people into buying the game I guess? Perhaps even more importantly though, by doing this you\'re taking away precious screen time that could have actually been spent on developing this original arc you\'re so insistent on doing. Like if there\'s one thing which you should never end up having pacing issues with, it\'s an original anime. I mean the entire scenario script is supposed to be written from scratch specifically to fit the episode count damn it.Another thing I found really disappointing is how incredibly casual the anime is about revealing the supernatural. In the visual novel you don\'t even find undeniable evidence that there even is anything supernatural until the end of the common route (adapted in episode 7 in a different version), which is almost 20 hours into it. Yes, you know Kotarou can rewrite himself, and yes, you encounter ominous-looking black dogs in the forest and the city at night as well as numerous suspicious people, but that\'s about it. Then when the actual reveal comes, it hits you like a hammer with how dramatic the tone shift is. The early part of Rewrite is supposed to be school/comedy/mystery, and then in the actual character routes it transforms into action/drama/supernatural. But in the anime, they\'ve kind of just... jumbled everything together. Kotarou is like yeah I have a super power, Shizuru casually reveals hers without much explanation provided, and when Kotarou is given his ""claws"" then you\'re just going to have to accept what you\'re watching because the anime sure isn\'t planning on explaining where they came from anytime soon, etcetera. It all feels very mish-mashed without any clear direction, almost as if they did everything in the wrong order. I don\'t know, making a good anime out of Rewrite with such a tight schedule is probably impossible no matter what you do; even an original route like this doesn\'t really work because the world itself is far too complex for you to be able to make a satisfying standalone arc without it becoming entangled in the ""real"" story of Rewrite in some way, causing a ton of loose ends that will never be able to followed up upon. It only forces 8bit to include a bunch of scenes they seriously shouldn\'t, wasting even more of what little precious screen time they have at their disposal. It\'s no wonder the pacing is so all over the place. On top of that the anime also has some incredibly awkward usage of CGI for all the various types of familiars it contains, so the action scenes aren\'t exactly a pleasure to look at either. Hell, even the regular 2D art really dips in quality every so often, especially in the last few episodes of the show. It felt like they were having some serious budget issues here, and as a result there were a lot more derp faces than I would have liked.As far as the characters goes, I\'m also pretty disappointed. I actually consider the visual novel\'s character cast to be in my top 5 even to this day, due to its diversity, great character development on many different fronts, and for just being plain entertaining in general. But the anime does... basically nothing to showcase either of these things. First and foremost, there are simply way too many characters in Rewrite for such a short anime to support. It\'s a very complex universe including multiple factions, people with drastically different ideals and goals, driven by their own respective backstories, etcetera. There just isn\'t anywhere near enough time to explain who they all are and what their purposes in the story really are. Especially considering that (you guessed it) for many of them, said explanations are provided deeper into the various heroine routes of the game, and they\'re not just something you can throw out at a moment\'s notice. In other words they really never had a chance to be anything more than random supporting characters in the anime because the script doesn\'t permit their characters to ever be properly explained or developed. Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to go full anime original? And this is just talking about the supporting cast; if we talk about the actual main characters here then it\'s obviously even worse because all the original main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) just come across as random harem members in the anime as none of them get any proper characterization to speak of at all. Why? Well... because their routes aren\'t adapted. It all keeps coming back to that, doesn\'t it? Even Kotarou suffers from this because he\'s supposed to grow in those arcs as well.Sooo I don\'t know, I don\'t straight-up hate the show but I just can\'t help but feel that it\'s so pointless. If you\'ve played the visual novel, the anime feels like a massive downgrade in comparison, and if you haven\'t played it then you\'ll be missing out on so much that it\'ll barely be comprehensible due to how confusing the story will be, how much content is cut out and how rushed it is. So what is the target demographic supposed to be? No one can say they\'re truly 100% happy with this anime. At least on that front it\'s certainly no different from Kajitsu.I think the obvious yet unfortunate truth here is that the whole point of this anime is nothing more than to be an advertisement for the Rewrite+ release of the visual novel, which is a new version released on July 29th in Japan this year, I.E: shortly after the anime started airing. It contains new CGs, more voice acting, slight scenario revisions, etcetera. For a long time I was also under the impression that this release was going to contain the new Kagari route as well in visual novel format, but as it turns out that\'s actually not the case. It doesn\'t really seem to contain any noteworthy new story content at all. So my hypothesis is that the release of Rewrite+ in combination with this original anime is nothing more than a marketing ploy, where people who have no prior experience with the franchise will get a first-time introduction to it through the anime and get interested enough to at least be willing to purchase the game. Then of course since Rewrite+ has just been released recently, which sounds like a much cooler version than the original for people not knowing any better, those new fans will throw their money at the much more expensive ""new"" game instead of the cheaper ""old"" Rewrite from 2011. Again, this is just my theory but honestly it\'s the only idea I can come up with that can financially justify re-releasing a game 5 years later with hardly any noteworthy changes made, as well as simultaneously making an awful anime adaptation of the same game that is neither satisfying for old fans of the games nor anime-only watchers.So with that said, in the end... I can\'t help but feel like this anime is meaningless, or at least it\'ll only function as a sales booster for the new game release, which is nice for the creators I guess but that doesn\'t actually make the anime itself any better for me personally, nor should it for any other viewers of it.It has to be said though that if we ignore this show\'s origins for a second and just look at it as any other anime among the thousands of others out there, then it\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, far from it, but it\'d probably be something most people would forget about almost completely within a day or two of finishing it. However, we can\'t avert our eyes from the truth that much, and the fact of the matter is that this is supposed to be a representation of one of Key\'s three biggest visual novels, alongside Clannad and Little Busters. Personally I\'d even say Rewrite is the best of them all; I played all three of them back-to-back way back in the beginning of 2013, and at least for a short time afterwards I actually considered Rewrite to be my favorite visual novel. It might not have maintained that spot for too long but either way the point is that... it just deserves better than this. Yes, I\'ve known ever since the day I finished the game that making a proper adaptation of Rewrite was probably impossible no matter what, but I was still hoping for a lot better than what this anime gave us. At the very least it should have gotten more episodes than this; Clannad got 4-cours and Little Busters got 3, why is Rewrite stuck with merely 2? If anything this is the one which needed the most episodes out of the trio since it has a lot less content that can be omitted. Realistically speaking 4 cours would probably have been the optimal pacing-wise given the length of the game. But I guess that\'s just the world we live in nowadays: anime are mostly produced in order to promote their source materials and boost the sales of those, and as a result we very rarely see shows with more than 2 cours anymore. For a lot of series that\'s totally fine and all, but for ones with very long source materials like this, it\'s basically a killing blow, unfortunately.Last but not least though, as mentioned previously we are at least getting a second season for Winter 2017 (so it\'s a split cour), and this is giving me a certain feeling of déjà vu. See, as badly as 8bit destroyed Grisaia no Kajitsu two years ago, they actually did a very respectable job with its sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, and the main reason for that was simply that the sequels are way shorter to begin with and thus much easier to adapt since they didn\'t have to rush them so badly, unlike with Kajitsu. And I feel like the same thing could very well happen with Rewrite. In case you don\'t know, the visual novel has one route for each of the main heroines (Kotori/Chihaya/Lucia/Shizuru/Akane) and then a two-part True route at the end, with the first part being called Moon and the second part being called Terra. Now in the anime they\'ve basically replaced the five girls\' routes with this original Kagari route, and the upcoming second season will adapt Moon and Terra. In other words the second season should actually not be anime original, unlike this one. There will probably be minor changes in order to accommodate for everything they\'ve done in the first season, but for the most part I reckon it should be pretty much the same as in the game. And above all, just Moon and Terra on their own should actually be doable in 1 cour, so we might actually have acceptable pacing next time around as well. With all that being taken into account, it could actually turn out to be a pretty good anime. The downside is of course that we seriously lack proper buildup for it since none of the heroine routes were adapted first, so I\'m not sure how everything will turn out in the end regardless. But I think it at least has decent potential to come out alright for those who are already familiar with those routes, I.E: those who have played the visual novel first. And for those who haven\'t... maybe, I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see.If nothing else, given how unsatisfying this first season has been on its own it can only go upwards from here. Let\'s hope the second time\'s the charm in this case. Then again I know better than to expect much from 8bit no matter what by now, so I won\'t get my hopes up too high just yet.', 'A lot of anime each season tends to adapt material from a different medium. Manga, light novels, videogames, and sometimes even visual novels. Of all of them, a visual novel is arguably the hardest to adapt. Why, you ask? Since visual visuals novels tend to have branching narratives with multiple possible storylines and alternate endings, it’s difficult to simply “choose” one to adapt or adapt the “right” one and pull out a good anime from.Decisions made by the player during the game compound on top of one another and can eventually change which storypath the VN goes down and lead to an alternate ending....It’s not uncommon for VNs to have well over 5 alternate endings, so when it comes to adapting it to anime, how does it actually work out? How do you adapt multiple story lines into one 13 or 26 episode anime?In the case of Steins;Gate, studio White Fox decided to adapt a “true ending” route, which is the route that tied up the most loose ends and had the most satisfying ending. In the case of Fate/stay night, studio ufotable and studio DEEN both adapted two out of the three distinct routes from the original VN, and next year studio ufotable will adapt the final route in a trilogy of films titled “Heaven’s Feel”. So when it comes to Rewrite, a commercially successful and critically acclaimed visual novel with around 5 distinctive routes, what does studio 8bit decide to do? Well of course, fuse half of them into one monumental mess!Adapting a VN is hard enough, so why does 8bit try and make it harder for themselves by blending multiple stories into one? The original alternate story lines are alternate for a reason; they are purposefully set as different playable routes for the player because of their distinctive nature. The main character, Kotarou, forms different and unique relationships with each of the supporting characters in their respective routes, so what happens when you blend half of them into one? Disharmony is what happens. Unevenness. Asymmetry. A narrative that isn’t well-rounded nor that has a clear and defined goal is what is produced. I can say with sufficient surety that nobody watching Rewrite as it was airing (without prior knowledge from the visual novel) was able to understand what the main conflict or goal was that was present in the story. Studio 8bit’s unreasonably resolute determination to adapt a careless fusion of routes spawns a monstrosity of an anime that forces its viewers into a submission of perplexity.Rewrite’s disjointed narrative overflows with a smorgasbord of elements that just don’t click with one another. Slice of life moments, pseudo-harem elements, convoluted supernatural magic powers and giant CGI monsters that will more often that not leave you bewildered and lost rather than intrigued. The stakes are raised to unfathomably unreachable heights, but it is difficult to grasp them tightly enough to take seriously, what with all the convoluted magic stuff and the irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments.The problems arisen from the show that materialize from its poor adaptation are mostly contained and limited to the first half, in which Kotarou forms and develops his relationships with the all-female supporting cast he’s constantly surrounded by (hence, “pseudo-harem elements”). Originally, Kotarou is supposed to develop separate and unique relationships with all the girls individually, but since 8bit decided that “just didn’t cut it”, Kotarou insteads fleshes out relationships with only half of the cast. This results in back-to-back episodes expanding on Lucia and Shizuru’s backstories (“sob stories” would technically be the more accurate term) that collectively feel episodic in nature and superficial in execution. It’s very obvious, almost as if explicitly implied, that the show just had to find a way to squeeze in these two character’s backstories because those were part of the routes 8bit decided to fuse together. No real respect is offered towards the rest of the cast, they all feel like plot devices used to escalate the narrative towards the back stories of the two. This lack of authenticity makes the show and characters mechanical and robotic, the only characters that you can empathize with are the two the show force their backstories into.Now of course, the poor adaptation isn’t to blame alone. The original narrative of the Rewrite visual novel has its fair share of innate problems that deserve a respectable portion of the blame as well. The narrative of Rewrite shifts its focus from cute girls, high school club goals, supposedly heart wrenching sob stories and then finally sets it sights on world destruction and human extinction. How can it all connect? Where is the delicacy in execution? Earlier I said the show had an irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments. This isn’t an escalation of say, running up a set of staircases dangerously fast like a frantic 10-year-old who’s been suppressing his bladder all day; it’s more like a clinically insane and frenetic individual rocket jumping from the CN tower to the moon, only because the moon “looked cool”. Shifting from cute girls doing cute things to a commentary on the nature of humanity and world destruction is already a pretty implausible change in tone, but actually not entirely impossible.What Rewrite lacks is a sense of scale. It starts small, with a comfortable high school setting and fictional city within its reach, which disallows room for expansion of tackling immensely bigger topics and more impactful themes and premises; it started with a small scale, when it should have started with a large one and focused on a small part of it; It outlined and gave away little information, when it should have outlined a lot and gave only a small part of it. If it did those things it would transform its irrepressible escalation of “what the fuck” moments into an irrepressible escalation of “oh, that’s how it connects. Awesome!” moments.So how could they have adapted it properly? While we’re asking that question, let’s go a little broader. How can an anime adapt its source material properly? Well, the answer is simple: with care. Just care. A little attention to detail here, a little improvisation there, and maybe, just maybe, they’ll be able to translate a possibly great work into an equally great medium.Overall: 3/10 || Enjoyment 4/10Amongst many avid visual novel players unlike myself, Rewrite is beloved. Talked and praised about endlessly, news of its anime adaption left its near-obsessive fans with a bloated sense of ecstasy; just think, the joy of having something you truly love with all your heart being reshaped into the medium that you love just as much… It’s an unfathomable state of euphoria, albeit if funnily enough trivial, that just can’t be achieved by other things in life. Nothing else raises people’s moods quite like that. There is a “but” though, and it exists because of a studio’s lack of care; not to say studio 8bit didn’t necessarily care for the work, but more so the evident absence of care in execution that can be seen by anyone who’s experienced both the visual novel and the anime adaptation. This execution that lacks finesse and charm unfortunately forces Rewrite to join its brothers and sisters in the collection of anime grouped as “the source material was much, much better.”I hope this review was informative and helpful.

Don\'t you realize by now that you work in a video game industry, and thus are inherently incompatible with an entertainment medium that the viewer can\'t physically interact with? Don\'t you realize that for ever Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica that ends up making it big, there are fifty World Conquest Zvezda Plots, Robotics;Notes, and Classroom Crises. And assuming you do know this, don\'t you know that teaming up with fucking 8-bit is considered a mistake in every sense of the word? I mean who even remember what anime they made? Oh right, these are the guys who made Grisaia. And yet somehow, even when you\'re working with them, they end up creating a product several times worse to the point that I could have done better.You\'d think I\'d have spent all my outrage regarding Rewrite after the last post I wrote about it and you\'d be mostly right, but the thing about this show is that it\'s my favorite kind of bad to review on the grounds that it fucks up so royally that you could write more essays about what it does wrong than you can about the many interpretations of Utena. It\'s not bad in that ""incredibly lackluster to the point that I can\'t even remember what it is I\'m supposed to be complaining about"" that characterized the last few shows I reviewed. This is straight up ""I see how this could have been better if it was handled by people with actual talent, or at least a chimpanzee"" bad. And even when I\'m being calm about it, there\'s so many words dripping with unsubtle bile I can write about the product that I can actually cause some impact on the industry by making the producers lose even less money than they already have. Hell, I\'ve already written quite a bit and I haven\'t even actually started describing Rewrite as of yet. Girls Beyond the Wasteland wishes it could have fucked up as much as this.Rewrite is an anime about a young boy named Kotarou Tennouji, living all by himself (of course) in the incredibly environmental-friendly town of Kazamatsuri. A town which houses a bunch of mysterious secrets such as dodgy CG crabs and annoying fairy creatures that our git of a main lead just has to discover the truth about, so he ends up joining an occult club and recruits members to help him out that all happen to be female and only two of them at best exist for the sake of more than just fetish fuel. Of course, in this show\'s defense, there is some semblance of a reason for his decision to only invite girls to hang out with him on one of his nature walks whilst ignoring the one male dude who he antagonizes more than Bugs Bunny did to any of the other Looney Toons. It\'s because he\'s a grade-A pervert who thinks sexually harassing his friends and touching their boobs is a charm point. Hey, I didn\'t say the reason wasn\'t ""pants-on-head""levels of retarded.But as is usual for visual novel anime, this is all just a smoke-screen for some upcoming serious plot that the writers seem to think would be a good idea to wait until halfway through the show to introduce for some reason, and in Rewrite\'s case, it turns out that Kotarou\'s friends actually belong to secret government organizations that are in conflict with each other because one side wants to destroy the world in order for it to be birthed anew and the other side wants to protect humanity even though said world is a morbid state of affairs where humans can kill trees without any repercussions. Yes, the plot is basically X/1999 if you replaced all the pretentiously cool CLAMP characters with little girls who would rather drink tea and bathe in hot springs than actually do something interesting. And yes those are your eyes that just rolled on the floor right now, because your mind can\'t comprehend how fucking retardedly mismatched the two plotlines are. I mean what\'s next? Harem school club anime that suddenly turns into Breaking Bad?Admittedly though, Rewrite does lean heavily on one of its mismatched sides to the point that the other one doesn\'t cause much interference. It\'s just too bad that said side is the banal school life side where nothing interesting ever happens and there\'s no drive to events other than curious retardation. Yeah, remember how I said before that I hate most visual novel anime (and most anime in general for that matter) because for some reason people can\'t get it into their heads that ""comedic episodes and light conflicts that solely exist to build up the world and the characters so that when the true dramatic story hits, it\'s all the more effective"" is an absolutely awful concept that no one with a brain would possibly enjoy, let alone prefer to just ""starting the dramatic story at the very start""? Well generally, these sorts of shows stop with their inane prologues by the halfway point, but Romeo Tanaka adaptations just can\'t seem to grasp the definition of the word ""stop"". It takes more than three quarters of the runtime for both Girls Beyond the Wasteland and Rewrite to get something even approaching an ongoing plot, and even then the latter seems to think that it can take a break and let girls relax in hot springs as a sort of reward for all the action that occurred previously, even though said action is only a minor skirmish against a twat that looked awful and no lasting impact because apparently stab wounds are easier to recover from than paper cuts.The show is just littered with every bad adaptation choice you could possibly make when adapting an interactive non-linear product to a non-interactive linear world to the point that it feels like we\'re living in that shitty visual novel adaptation phase of anime again. Do you remember how one of my big complaints about Charlotte was that it had a severe lack of drama when it was desperately needed? Well it seems Rewrite misinterpreted the complaints people have made about Key products being overly manipulative even harder and decided to only give service to the company\'s token melodrama in the worst way possible. There\'s only two episodes that try to tug at the viewer\'s heartstrings and of course, it\'d be directed towards the two girls with no plot-importance whatsoever, as well as being fucking botched to boot.Just as an example, one of the episodes in the first half of the show is centered on the purple-haired girl, Lucia, and plays out like a bad horror story with its poorly directed attempts to be creepy that end with Kotarou discovering it was her who was causing all the strange things to happen because she has the ability to poison anything she touches thank to experiments done on her. Said episode ends with her throwing a hissy fit, accidentally poisoning Kotarou, him fixing himself up, revealing that she works for a secret organization, and then happy school life continues again in the very next episode. Excuse me Rewrite for not having the tear ducts required to appreciate sadness caused by ""magic"" that has never been foreshadowed until now, has no impact on the story beyond a few plot points that you could have conveyed better by shooting someone, doesn\'t further anyone\'s characterization, and indeed is never brought up again after it\'s told!I could go on listing all the bad adaptation decisions...so let\'s continue, shall we? The animation is uglier than Andrew Lloyd Webber, looking like one of those crappy flash animated shows from the early 2000s with the shining buffed up a bit. And that\'s not even getting into the 3D animation for the monsters in this show, which looks so retarded and clashes so badly with the backgrounds that Polygon Pictures themselves would have fired the people working on it. And even by visual novel standards, the characters are just completely unlikable. Kotarou basically bullies and sexually harasses his friends for no reason, constantly begging to touch their breasts even during serious moments to the point that you sympathize with Lucia in regards to wanting to murder the bastard. But for some reason, the girls still hang out with him like the moe tsundere sycophants they are. Even dressing into cat-eared maid costumes at his request because apparently we\'re living in an age where people still think it was funny when Higurashi did this. It\'s like someone took a bunch of dating sim stereotypes, tacked on an arbitrary twist to each of them, and then beat them over the head with a crowbar that was made out of concentrated STUPID.Finally there\'s the ending, which is both the best part of the show in how laughably terrible it was in a ""I can\'t believe you did that"" kind of way, as well as the worst part of the show because you couldn\'t believe they actually did that. To those who played the visual novel, remember how every single girl\'s route would end with the world getting fucked? Well instead of using one of those endings to cap things off, the producers decided to go a bit more original...by ripping off Evangelion like every other anime under the sun. One of the girls performs a ritual that kills off every human being on the planet and turns them into glowing orbs so that our plant life sovereign can reign supreme in a manner that would make Poison Ivy blush. No, I am not kidding. That is actually what happens, and before you guys start thinking ""hey, that actually sounds pretty awesome"", note that a sequel adapting the true route that will no doubt retcon the ending harder than Aldnoah Zero did after its three-month break is coming out next season because the creators were so confident that die-hard fans would want it after sitting through this misery. Starting right at the end of this sentence, you have one second to name a single anime where keeping the prologue and the actual meat of the story divided into two distinct series was a good idea. Time\'s up. That\'s what I thought.I am not exaggerating when I say there is literally no audience for this show at all. If you\'re a fan of the visual novel, you\'ll be turned off by the insipid adaptation choices that basically scream ""fuck it, if they paid full price for that Little Busters anime, they\'ll pay full price for this"". And if you\'re not a fan, you\'d be clawing your eyes out at the complete lack of fun on screen assuming you can work up the interest necessary to acknowledge Rewrite\'s existence in the first place. I don\'t know how well the blu-rays sold, but the number can\'t be high. I mean we\'re living in an age where the fujoshi market makes up the numbers now and Rewrite definitely doesn\'t have much in the way of manservice for fangirls to slobber over. The only people I can possibly see enjoying this show are those with a lead pipe shoved in your brain\'s front lobe, and if that\'s the case, it\'d be cheaper and more exciting to just shove poo down the pipe\'s hole. fucked up place that holds back actual talent.

This Rewrite adaptation is in the similar vein as M Night Shyamalans ""The Last Airbender"" adaptation where you have characters with the same names and some of the story elements, but presented without soul and crushed down until it possesses none of its quality.  The original source material wasn\'t perfect.  In fact I would deem it inconsistent and flawed, but it was refreshingly different from other works from...Key and was a very interesting read.  However, to see it degraded to this ugly mess was utterly depressing.Story: 1/10 (atrocious)Seriously!?  Who is this adaptation for?  Studio 8-shit thought it was a great idea to horribly rush events directly from the VN for the first half, and then go anime original into a rushed incomprehensible second half.  Like... if you don\'t have the time to adapt it and were going to make most of it original, you might as well have made it completely anime original.  If you wanted to adapt the whole thing then trying to do it in merely 13 episodes was a terrible idea in the first place.  The first half will immediately turn off people who haven\'t read the novel since it appears to be something generic with rapid tonal swings and horrible pacing.  The second half only goes out of its way to give fans of the novel the finger by creating a train-wreck of several side routes combined into a weird anime original clusterfuck with only one frigging thing original outside of the source material.  Finally if your a Key fan, you will be so emotionally distant from the generic underdeveloped characters that if you were hoping for the famous ""feels"" you won\'t even get that.  There are many elements of the story that will probably seem incomprehensible to new viewers, and when you need the source material to understand what is going on, then it has failed utterly as an adaptation.Characters: 2/10 (terrible)Incredibly thin and underdeveloped.  Like the other flawed Key anime Charlotte, most of them only have time to be defined by some single trait that is repeated for punchlines.  ""Pervert and lets be BFF generic"" Kotarou, the ribbon girl loves coffee, Chihiya is a dumb jock, you have tsundere ""don\'t touch me pervert"" Lucia, you have ""cute loli that defends protagonist no matter what"" Shizuru.  I don\'t even remember what they gave Kotori as a character in the anime.  Two of the characters are given backstories with some scenes that feel like they were on fast forward... I am not even kidding, all of it is so rushed that even as someone who read the novel, I was BARELY able to follow, and felt disconnected pretty quickly.  When you speed up events with no flow or breathing time, it ends up moving too fast for you to digest and process what is going on and what you should be feeling.  The result is a rapid slideshow summarizing whats going on without giving you time or space to feel or care about the events on the screen.There are only two characters in the show that could be somewhat entertaining.  One of them is in it for like 10 minutes (Yoshino), and the other was the ribbon girl who ironically has the least personality in the original source material.  The ribbon girl has an anime original circumstance that occurs, and there is a charm to her that sort of works for a single episode that I thought was passable.However, it was when I saw the final episode that I realized how terrible the cast was treated in this horrid adaptation.  You see characters being injured, dying, yelling and screaming in a chaotic battle with supposed high stakes in the air.  Yet, despite having read about them for 50+ hours in the novel, I simply watched bored and emotionally disconnected from everything happening onscreen.  I didn\'t care about any of these characters that I remembered liking so much from the visual novel.  None of the charm, fun, or heart of these characters were there.  They were became nothing but hallow shells carrying their names.Art/Animation: 3/10 (terrible)Rewrite looks ugly.  The art and animation is somewhat passable for the first couple episodes, and then it takes a quality nosedive in the second half.  8-shit decided to make this show CGI heavy and the result is atrocious.  It honestly gives Berserk 2016 a run for its money in awfulness.  I hate the character designs, which look too small and way too ""cutesy"" for my liking.  The character are very often off-model and look awful in motion at times.  Tensho, the director, is also very weak at framing good actions sequences so even if your just there for decent spectacle it can\'t even manage that.  Plus, a personal gripe, why is the lighting always so bright?  Jesus!!Sound: 8/10 (very good)Like... the one saving grace?  Maybe?  Something good to say about this trash is the soundtrack that was taken straight from the visual novel...Enjoyment: 1/10I honestly wished this anime didn\'t exist.  The fans of the visual novel and of Key deserve much better than this.  I feel very bad for people who loved the original material and was expecting something good.  Unfortunately this isn\'t the adaptation you were looking for.  If you aren\'t a fan of either Key or the novel, I don\'t recommend this either since there are much better options out there.  This entire adaptation needs a rewrite, and from a studio that doesn\'t rhyme with shit. Key and was a very interesting read.

This entire adaptation needs a rewrite, and from a studio that doesn\'t rhyme with shit.', 'I had to write a review for this. Because Rewrite is my favorite Key work of all-time. Because it deserved better than this.If you are wondering if this anime is worth your time, I say this: if the premise catches your eye, or the character designs, or anything at all, I absolutely implore you to check out the original visual novel. It\'s deep. It\'s beautiful inside and out. It\'s got a message that cannot be ignored. None of which can be said about this travesty of an adaptation. 8bit did not know what they were doing, and do not deserve five hours of your time...spent here. Avoid this trainwreck at all costs.The story jumps around like a pinball in a dryer. There is no semblance of cohesive storytelling to be found. It takes bits and chunks of the branching ""routes"" from the visual novel and attempts to tie them together in a haphazard, charmless sort of way. At first I wondered if this was on purpose, like the show was just meant to be a treat for people who have already read the source material it is based on, but no. No reader of the visual novel can find anything redeemable at how badly 8bit botched this.Characters have been derailed extensively. Shizuru, Lucia, and especially Kagari act in ways that are unthinkable for their VN counterparts. Kagari is supposed to be an ominous, mysterious entity, a legitimate threat to Kotarou\'s peaceful life and instead becomes a caffeine-addicted, narcissistic victim of fart jokes.The one thing that Rewrite gets right is the music. It\'s taken straight from the visual novel, some truly great pieces that practically tell a story all by themselves. The voice actors are all returned to reprise their roles for this adaptation, but Chiwa Saitou, whose turn as Kotori Kanbe made the character one of the most beloved in the novel, sounds almost chronically bored. It\'s a shame, but I think even she saw that this script and this adaptation would be lovingly omitted from any resumes she makes going forward. Kana Hanazawa, my favorite seiyuu of all-time, returns as Kagari, but I\'ve already mentioned how badly they\'ve botched her character, and it feels like KanaHana knew it too. She puts forth only just enough effort to keep the dysfunctional train on the tracks.The art is dreadful. The characters, whose designs are lovingly detailed in the visual novel, are reduced to frilly moeblobs with very little detail. There are some decent panning shots of Kazamatsuri, but that\'s about it. And the CG monsters that crop up routinely during the show are just about at the point where they might have looked passable in a 1980s Gundam show. But it\'s now 2016, and these CG dinosaurs and leaf dragon look pitiful. Perpetually locked at somewhere south of 18 frames per second, it feels like you\'re watching a particularly unappealing PlayStation 2 game.In short, this is something to be avoided. I thought I had learned my lesson when I watched their dreadful Absolute Duo adaptation, but at least that was a case where the source material was also uninspired and trite, so 8bit could be almost excused for going through the motions in adapting it. Rewrite is not only great, but a downright tome of greatness, with nearly 100 hours of content. There was no way they were going to be able to do it justice with just 13 episodes, but I would have at least respected an honest attempt to try. Instead, I got a fanservice-laden clusterfuck of scenes that go nowhere, schizophrenic pacing, dull action scenes, and an ending that teases the inevitable second cour. I\'ll be taking a pass on that, 8bit. Don\'t take it personal. I\'ll be too busy ""Rewriting"" my brain to cleanse it from this disaster.Until next time, may the Song of Destruction be heard all across 8bit\'s headquarters. spent here. Avoid this trainwreck at all costs.The story jumps around like a pinball in a dryer. There is no semblance of cohesive storytelling to be found. It takes bits and chunks of the branching ""routes"" from the visual novel and attempts to tie them together in a haphazard, charmless sort of way. At first I wondered if this was on purpose, like the show was just meant to be a treat for people who have already read the source material it is based on, but no. No reader of the visual novel can find anything redeemable at how badly 8bit botched this.Characters have been derailed extensively. Shizuru, Lucia, and especially Kagari act in ways that are unthinkable for their VN counterparts. Kagari is supposed to be an ominous, mysterious entity, a legitimate threat to Kotarou\'s peaceful life and instead becomes a caffeine-addicted, narcissistic victim of fart jokes.The one thing that Rewrite gets right is the music. It\'s taken straight from the visual novel, some truly great pieces that practically tell a story all by themselves. The voice actors are all returned to reprise their roles for this adaptation, but Chiwa Saitou, whose turn as Kotori Kanbe made the character one of the most beloved in the novel, sounds almost chronically bored. It\'s a shame, but I think even she saw that this script and this adaptation would be lovingly omitted from any resumes she makes going forward. Kana Hanazawa, my favorite seiyuu of all-time, returns as Kagari, but I\'ve already mentioned how badly they\'ve botched her character, and it feels like KanaHana knew it too. She puts forth only just enough effort to keep the dysfunctional train on the tracks.The art is dreadful. The characters, whose designs are lovingly detailed in the visual novel, are reduced to frilly moeblobs with very little detail. There are some decent panning shots of Kazamatsuri, but that\'s about it. And the CG monsters that crop up routinely during the show are just about at the point where they might have looked passable in a 1980s Gundam show. But it\'s now 2016, and these CG dinosaurs and leaf dragon look pitiful. Perpetually locked at somewhere south of 18 frames per second, it feels like you\'re watching a particularly unappealing PlayStation 2 game.In short, this is something to be avoided. I thought I had learned my lesson when I watched their dreadful Absolute Duo adaptation, but at least that was a case where the source material was also uninspired and trite, so 8bit could be almost excused for going through the motions in adapting it. Rewrite is not only great, but a downright tome of greatness, with nearly 100 hours of content. There was no way they were going to be able to do it justice with just 13 episodes, but I would have at least respected an honest attempt to try. Instead, I got a fanservice-laden clusterfuck of scenes that go nowhere, schizophrenic pacing, dull action scenes, and an ending that teases the inevitable second cour. I\'ll be taking a pass on that, 8bit. Don\'t take it personal. I\'ll be too busy ""Rewriting"" my brain to cleanse it from this disaster.Until next time, may the Song of Destruction be heard all across 8bit\'s headquarters.', 'Rewrite. The second highest rated Key Visual Novel on VNDB, only surpassed by Clannad. Something more than well worth reading, in my eyes.That\'s not what this anime is, at all. Not only was it hardly an adaptation with its gratuitous anime original content, but they managed to ruin any small thing they did adapt.Therefore, I\'m going to review this while trying to put aside my thoughts of the original material.Story: 1/10.-What is the premise? What am I watching? Where is the plot?- All questions asked throughout Rewrite\'s duration. None of which were answered. The fact is, this series had no direction....We have ""twists"" that are in no way surprising, and generally poorly executed. We have info dump after info dump of information that in the end, really amounted to nothing, and yet we still were left with a plethora of questions. We also got an ending with a vague after credits scene to try and lure us into the next season. A complete, and utter mess. The only reason I rate this a 2, is due to the fact there was a beginning and end, something that I admittedly cannot say for some anime series.Art: 6/10-While obviously lacking, and rather flat, I can\'t say I have much to complain about on this front. It was derpy, but hey, with the schedule Aniplex gave 8-bit, who can blame them?Sound: 2/10-The Sound Director for this series... was not originally a sound director. Poorly placed BGMs that blended together awfully, despite being very pretty on their own. Cringe like screams and grunts that generally felt unnatural. Only thing redeeming was the OST itself, which is absolutely perfect.Characters: 2/10-A large cast of characters, of which really only two were given any real development, which even then was minimal. Felt nothing for them, and little to no attachment to them existed. Only rated 2/10 because none of them were bad characters, just very two dimensional and forgetful.Enjoyment: 2/10-When the pacing and overall themes are so much of a mess they don\'t make sense, things go south quickly.Overall: 1.Honestly, I would\'ve dropped this at around Episode 3, if not for my fondness of the somewhat related original material. The show on its own didn\'t feel like a chore, but wasn\'t something I particularly looked forward to. I honestly wouldn\'t reccomend this anime to anyone, even to people who enjoy the genre. If it must be anime, I would have to reccomend something else.I do hope that the second season, supposedly adapting the later parts of the original, will be done well. I assume the only people watching it will be fans, or people who actually enjoyed the first season. If that\'s the case, let\'s hope for the best. :) We have ""twists"" that are in no way surprising, and generally poorly executed.

I get that producing a 2-cour series is expensive than 1-cour but due to how KEY\'s story structure is set-up, 1 cour is NEVER going to work.[Story]: (5/10)A lot of KEY fans who read the Rewrite VN hyped this series even though the red flags were already raised and flying. I do understand why though. Firstly, it\'s a KEY work. Their works are usually really great with great story and amazing characters. Secondly, I just started...playing the VN 2 weeks ago and it\'s a lot better than the anime but I\'m not going to do a lot of VN - Anime comparisons for this review. I\'m just going to write this review as if I\'m writing this with no knowledge of the source material. What were the red flags you ask? For starters, 8bit is handling the adaptation and the director is the same director who also directed that messy VN anime adaptation called ""Grisaia no Kajitsu"". I mean, need I say more?We all thought that 8bit was going to prove themselves by producing a 1 hour 1st episode. Turns out that wasn\'t the case. The biggest problem with Rewrite is how rushed the series is. The story wasn\'t even bad, by any means, but most of the time, the story can get really confusing because of how rushed it is and how they spend little-to-no time explaining what the hell is going on. The pacing did slow down a bit once the Common Route was over and switched up to the original route called ""Kagari\'s route"" (but it was still rushed as fuck) which wasn\'t present in the VN. Not like I have any problem with 8bit doing original route. That was kind-of the purpose of this anime adaptation. To advertise Rewrite and also, to present a new-original route for ""fans of the VN and new fans alike"". Notice the quotation marks? Take that quote as you may but my eyes were rolling when I read that quote.If you\'ve seen a KEY anime work before before then you\'re familiar with how the show is going to be structured. Rewrite\'s first 7 episodes is basically the Common Route. It introduces the characters, show some happy and fun slice of life moments and all that crap. I already mentioned this but I\'m going to say this again but the pacing pretty much ruined the first 7 episodes. How am I supposed to know the characters properly if the pacing is so rushed? I just didn\'t feel for the characters when the show decides to abruptly switches from a slice-of-life moment to dropping a dramatic character flashback right at my face. There\'s just no way in hell that\'s going to work if the show decides to focus on a certain female character for just 1 episode then her problem gets resolved at the end of the episode and switches to another female character in the next episode.Now I want to talk about the episodes past episode 7. Episode 8 and the rest of the episodes after that was when the plot finally began. The show introduces us to the Guardian and Gaia organization. They both work differently so that\'s why they fight each other but they have the same goal. Saving the Planet. It\'s just that their ways of achieving their goal is completely different from one another. One of the organizations (I forgot who it was) decides to get rid of the humanity because of how they ruined the Planet Earth. Yes, the plot is like some Environmental Awareness ad, to remind us how we\'re ruining this planet and to also, probably, make us feel bad about our actions. Kagari is also a major character for this arc and she got more character development than the rest of the characters in the series. That\'s not really a praise since Kagari\'s character development was just too messy, really rushed and the development wasn\'t that much. There\'s also a few plot twists, here and there, like how Kagari is actually the Key....whatever the fuck that means...And etc. Some surprised me, some didn\'t and some I just didn\'t care.Rewrites comedict aspect was a hit-or-miss. At times, it made me laugh and at times, it made me laugh...awkwardly. More like the show was trying to force me to laugh. I just didn\'t like Rewrite\'s sexual jokes. It was mostly Kotaru ""accidentally"" grabbing someone\'s breasts or that he always thinks about groping the ""president\'s boobs"". I\'d like to think that Rewrite\'s fanservice was anime-original because there\'s no way in hell that these fanservice scenes are present in a VN that\'s rated for ""all ages"".______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (6/10)I\'m going to be in the minority here when I say this but I\'m not really a fan of KEY\'s art style and the Character Designs in their VNs. I just find it really ugly. Because of those reasons, I prefer 8bit\'s Art Style and the anime\'s Character Design. Now, in terms of Rewrite\'s Animation, it\'s very mediocre. You can tell that 8bit wasn\'t given that much time to produce this series. Since Aniplex and a whole load of big-name companies are funding this production, I\'m very sure that the Animation Issues that this show had wasn\'t because of Budget Issues. For example, when it came to the fighting scenes, the staff had to resort to cheap animation tricks because of time constraints. The fighting scenes didn\'t even look good and it\'s just very unappealing to watch. Even in the 2nd OP Animation, you can tell that the Animation was just crap.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)If there\'s one thing that the staff did justice in this Anime Adaptation of a Visual Novel, it\'s the soundtrack. The VN\'s soundtrack sounds really good and it\'s one of KEY\'s best OSTs yet so I\'m glad that 8bit kept most of the OST. Even the 1st OP and ED from the VN was also in the anime. As the show\'s OP and ED theme song. For the first 7 episodes, at least.The OP theme songs are ""Philosophyz"" by Runa Mizutani and ""End of the World"" by Anri Kumaki. I\'m really glad that 8bit reused and even remastered the 1st OP, even if it was only for the first 7 episodes. Right now, I love the anime version\'s OP way more than the VN version. The anime version sounds more modern and puts more emphasis on the background, something the VN version lacked. As for the 2nd OP, it sounds really weak compared to the 1st OP. It\'s not a shitty song, per say, but the 1st OP is miles better than the 2nd OP. However, I still like the 2nd OP though and I like it way more than the VN\'s 2nd OP. I hated that song and it baffles me that a lot of people even liked that song. So I\'m glad that 8bit made their own OP instead of re-using/remastering the VN\'s 2nd OP.The ED theme songs are ""Sasayaka na Hajimari"" by Runa Mizutani and ""Word of Dawn"" by Aoi Tada. You wouldn\'t believe how much I squealed when I heard the 1st ED in Ep.2. The VN\'s ED is one of the best ED\'s (Also in my Top 10) I\'ve heard in a long-ass time and hearing the remastered version in the anime makes the 1st ED sound more beautiful. I also like the anime version more than the VN\'s version. Just like the 1st OP, they put more emphasis on the background and making it sound more modern which is the reason why I prefer the anime version. As for the 2nd ED, it sounds surprisingly great. I mean, it\'s not better than the 1st ED but it sounds really great and unlike the 2nd OP, the 2nd ED doesn\'t sound weak at all.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (5.5/10)Honestly, the only characters that I liked in the series are Lucia and Kagari. I liked Lucia because she\'s a tsundere and I\'m a big fan of tsundere girls. I also like Kagari because she\'s the only funny character in the series. As for everyone else, they could have been a lot better if they\'ve gotten a lot more screentime. Or in other words, the series needed MORE THAN 13 episodes to flesh out the characters instead of rushing through their character development. Also, those 1 episode arc that focuses on Shizuru and Lucia was simply not enough for me to give a crap about their past and the problems that they were facing in the present. They were simply too rushed.Now I\'m going to talk about some of the main characters. Kotarou Tennouji, the main protagonist of the series, is a high school student and has an ability called ""Rewrite"". I really have no more idea what to talk about him because his character is bland, his personality is really inconsistent, and he barely got any character development.  Why is his personality inconsistent, you ask? The guy doesn\'t have his own personality. His personality somehow switches depending on the girl that he hangs out with. The guy gets all perverted and idiotic around Akane (The president of the Occult club) but he acts differently when he\'s around with Kotori or Lucia. He\'s like a different person depending on the girl that he hangs out with and I just couldn\'t figure out his TRUE personality.Then there\'s Kotori, a childhood friend of Kotarou. She seems like an innocent normal person at first who doesn\'t know anything about the supernatural things but then there\'s a plot twist about her. I was, honestly, surprised learning the truth about her. Then there\'s Chihaya, a girl with super-human strength. Chihaya felt like she was a non-existent character. The show didn\'t really focus that much on her. It\'s like she only got 5 mins. of screentime every 2-3 episodes. Hell, I didn\'t even know her name throughout the show. While the show was airing, I kept calling her the ""Orange-dressed Tsundere girl"". I wasn\'t even sure if she was a tsundere but since she was an almost non-existent character, I just don\'t care.Then there\'s Akane Sunri, the president of the Occult club. She\'s a gamer because she can be constantly seen playing a FPS (First Person Shooter) game and she has the personality of ""Why the fuck am I here"" type of girl. Then there\'s Shizuru Nakutsu, a loli girl with an eye-patch that made her look like a chuunibyou at first but turns out, it was more than that and there was a reason why she was wearing an eye-patch. Then there\'s Lucia Konohana. All you need to know about her is she\'s a stereotypical tsundere girl who punches Kotarou from time to time and if you pay attention to her hand, there\'s a reason why she\'s constantly wearing a glove and that\'s where her 1 episode-arc will focus on. I admit, I enjoyed Lucia\'s arc but it could have been better.Last but not least is Kagari. A mysterious character who kept popping up on Kotarou\'s dream and making mysterious appearances on Kotarou\'s bedroom and his school. Kagari became my most favourite character in the series after episode 7 because I love her personality and she was really hilarious. Her jokes did become overplayed on the later parts of her arc. For example, her ""FEECOF"" jokes were funny at the start but became somewhat annoying at the end. I can\'t wait to see more of her in the next season because I heard from VN readers that she gets more focus on the ""Moon"" and ""Terra"" arc.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (6/10)Despite how mediocre this series, I still somewhat enjoyed this series. The 2nd arc was more enjoyable and bearable then the ""Common Route"".  I wouldn\'t say that this is the worst anime I\'ve ever seen because there\'s a whole lot more anime this year that\'s worse than Rewrite.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Rewrite could have been a great series if it had 26 episodes but sadly, it suffered the same fate as ""Charlotte"" and ""Angel Beats"". The story and the characters needed more than 13 episodes to flesh out the story and its characters. Instead, what we got is a series with a very rushed/poorly explained story and a cast of characters with barely any focus, screentime or character development.

I will not be talking about those issues.Even if an anime is poorly paced, there is a limit to how much an anime can jump from one scene to the next with wildly different tones without it being jarring. One scene can seem...pretty tense and traumatic, and then the next scene goes to a short BS school drama thing and sours all of the emotion of the previous scene. The characters act as if they have NO MEMORY of past events unless the plot demands it, and it screams bad writing. This occurs from the very first episode and doesn't stop until the plot kicks into high gear around episode 8-ish (your mileage may vary).The animation is serviceable in the slice-of-life-y portions, but in action scenes apart from maybe the last episode, the animation is cringe at times and almost laughably bad at others, especially with the anime's heavy use of CG. Even when the characters are standing still, I don't remember any points where they looked great. There is nothing visually interesting in this show, which really hurts it since some characters are supposed to be super powerful and action is supposed to play up the tension in some areas.These two things alone make the anime painful to watch, but if you are willing to look past them, then you might find a surprisingly interesting story with a few twists. The problem is that the storytelling is bad enough that you might not see the story.At the very least, I kind of liked the ending, for both ironic and non-ironic reasons. It sort of hints at the possibility of a continuation. Idk, it could go either way, but I can't say I'm excited to see another whole season with this kind of quality.My advice: Maybe watch the first two episodes. If it looks something like you'd be interested in experiencing, stop watching and figure out some way to play the game. The anime has a different story from the routes in the game, but every route in the game is probably way better than the anime so don't look back. pretty tense and traumatic, and then the next scene goes to a short BS school drama thing and sours all of the emotion of the previous scene.

The show follows him as he joins the Occult Club to research supernatural phenomena along with several girls from his school. He is also followed by a mysterious ribbon-wearing girl named Kagari who kills him in one of his dreams, causing Kotarou to consider her a threat.The anime is split into two story arcs with the first being the better one out of the two. In the arc, Kotarou learns a lot about the girls during their club activities. At times he is...also attacked by mysterious creatures forcing him to use his abilities to survive. The overall story of the arc is interesting and later takes a lot of unexpected turns. At times however, the plot can seem a bit rushed and may leave the viewer with a lot of questions.The second arc mostly follows the ribbon girl, Kagari, as Kotarou learns more about who she is and why she’s following him. Although the arc starts out pretty well, in the end it turns into a rushed mess with the anime trying to explain all the questions raised earlier in a way too short span of time. It also does constant twists that are all done in such a short amount time they only end up confusing the viewer. The ending feels like it was intended to be the something amazing but the writers simply didn’t have the time or the talent to execute it properly. In the end it turns out to be nothing but random events and twists happening constantly with the viewer having barely any idea of what’s going on.The interactions between the characters were the best parts about the show for me. One of the most enjoyable things about the first arc was watching Kotarou and the girls living their school lives and doing Occult Club activities. Also, the first half of the second arc, which heavily features both Kagari and Kotarou, was the best part about the otherwise lackluster arc for me.Kotarou is very different from the characters in other Key series. He doesn’t have the personality of the typical harem protagonist, making him one of the most unique main characters in a Key anime. Kagari starts out as an emotionless character but later on goes through a change and learns about the positive aspects of humans. The girls in the Occult Club are also very interesting characters. At first, they seem to be there just to create the harem setting most Key series are known for, but throughout the anime it’s revealed that there’s more to them than meets the eye. Some of the girls also have interesting backstories. While they help flesh out their characters, they end up feeling a bit too rushed to have any kind of emotional impact present in other Key anime. The show also feels way too short for the amount of characters in it which leads to a lot of the side characters not getting nearly enough screen time.I have some mixed feelings about the animation. The 2D animation for the most part is decent but can dip a lot in quality in certain scenes. There are still certain moments in the series such as the first ending theme that I feel are really well done. The 3D animation is definitely one of the weakest points in the series. It can be very low quality and feel out of place in a lot of the scenes that use it. Even the frame rate in some of the 3D scenes is very low, which should be unacceptable for a pre-rendered scene.The soundtrack is really good which is to be expected from a Key series. It fits the overall theme of the show really well and does a good job supporting a lot of the scenes. I also liked the opening and ending themes as well as the voice actors of the show. One of the noteworthy performances to me was Hanazawa Kana voicing Kagari as I felt like she did a good job portraying the curious nature of this mysterious ribbon girl as she learns about the daily lives of other people.I have a lot of mixed feelings about Rewrite. The show has its moments but ends up being way too rushed. It has a lot of potential with the story and the characters being interesting but suffers from poor execution. The anime felt like it was way too short to properly tell its story and flesh out all the characters.

If you just watched season 1 or haven\'t watched a season feel free to read because I didn\'t really wrote any spoilersWhen I watch, finish, understand and feel an Anime I get depressed after I finish it, thats how I rate an anime.This anime made me feel mixed emotions specially at the end of the two seasons. The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2...was already waiting for me. Of course that didn\'t lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1.Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn\'t) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn\'t ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn\'t really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn\'t continue.In short I describe this anime as ""Having a Beautiful Story and Character design."" I\'m guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn\'t reach the mainstream flatform but that\'s okay because this anime is really special was already waiting for me.

This section is entirely spoiler free.- The second section is dedicated to those who have already read the Visual Novel. This section contains major spoilers.First Section (for people new to Rewrite)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------An Introduction: Key is a company that is renowned for its visual novels, most of which enjoy critical acclaim. Almost all these VNs have anime adaptations, which enjoy varying degrees of fame – be it Clannad, which holds the position of one of the top few anime of MAL,...or Air, which is relatively unheard of. Whichever the case may be, the general consensus is that all these anime are quite good, since they all take advantage of the ‘feels’ factor (as in making the viewers attached to the characters and then making them feel some degree of emotional turmoil by putting those characters through adverse conditions). Rewrite is Key’s latest flagship VN, which was released way back in 2011. While Rewrite was very successful in the market, it still took around 5 years for it to get an anime adaptation, which we see here today. I shall be going into some detail about this anime in the paragraphs to come.Story (3/10):While the plot itself is passable, let me remind you that plot is not the only element under consideration in this section. The biggest issues with the story are the pacing and presentation.The pacing is extremely haphazard and the various scenes seem to jump from one to another without any concern for flow. This often ruins the impact of many important scenes and makes the viewer wonder what exactly is happening. The presentation of many scenes tend to unnecessarily give the viewers the wrong idea about these events of the anime, which can lead to a good deal of frustration.When you try to cram a 60+ hour Visual Novel into a 13 episode anime, there are two possible outcomes – A badly paced rush-job or a completely different story. While Rewrite was supposed to have a different story from the VN, it has all the features of the former case.Characters (3/10):I knew that the short duration of the anime adaptation would limit the amount of character development that could be given to most characters, but I never expected it to be this terrible.The characters are extremely clichéd to begin with - a happy-go-lucky protagonist, a childhood friend girl, an ‘aho’ transfer student girl, a modern tsundere class rep girl, a healing presence/small furry animal type kouhai, a domineering yet lazy senpai, a mysterious loli and a chuunibyou delinquent – basically a buffet of all the stereotypical characters that you may find in any school-based anime, with some combinations thrown in the mix…. And that’s the good part.A little later into the show, development is forced on the characters so hard that almost all of them feel broken by the end of it. Some of the characters are changed so much that they’re not even the same characters any more. Viewers who are new to Rewrite will have a lot of difficulty understanding the behaviour and dialogues of many of these characters.Sound (7/10):The soundtracks and the OPs are just remixed versions of the same from the VN, but are still quite pleasant to the ears, though there are some moments where the soundtrack doesn’t match the situation. The EDs are above average.Art (4/10):This is where the low budget of Rewrite really shows. The regular animation is passable at most times, though you’ll find a lot of horribly warped faces and such if you happen to pause at the wrong moment.It also makes use of some really clunky CG at times, which serves to further ruin the effect. The main issue is that the scenes where CG is used tend to be rather important to the plot, thus decreasing the enjoyment of the series on the whole.Enjoyment (4/10):The anime version of Rewrite seems to be fan service aimed at those who have already read the VN. Those who are new to the series will find it extremely difficult to follow. It is quite dull for the majority of the episodes, while some episodes are mildly intriguing.Overall (4/10):You’d think that 8bit studios might have learned something from their extremely messy adaptation of the Grisaia trilogy, but guess what – Rewrite is an even bigger abomination. I had predicted that it would end up something like Charlotte… looks like I was mistaken – Charlotte is infinitely preferable to this.As I have already mentioned before, the main purpose of this adaptation seems to be – to appeal to the pre-existing fans and to advertise the source material. Both of these seemed to have failed rather miserably.Verdict – Don’t watch it. You’re just spoiling a perfectly good Visual Novel for yourself. Even if you’re not planning to read the VN, the anime is still not worth the effort. Give this one a pass unless you really want to waste a couple of hours of your time (for which there are far better methods and shows).Second section (For the Rewrite veterans – HEAVY SPOILERS)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I’ll mainly be talking about the story and characters in this section.As you may already know, the anime was supposed to follow an original route, which should give a brand new story. In fact, what we actually got here is an amalgamation of pretty much all the routes, done in a very messy fashion.The base is the Terra route, with a few scenes from the Moon route thrown in every now and then. The first parts (back-stories) of Lucia’s and Shizuru’s routes are given one episode each, while Chihaya and Kotori are largely ignored. Akane gets a little bit of time, but more focus is given to her transformation into the new prophet rather than anything else. Pretty much all of them are broken or close enough to make no difference. In fact, the only character who actually got a decent representation was Yoshino, short as his screen time was. Kagari is the most messed up of the lot, as they completely changed her personality… and not for the better.In the end, this anime can be considered a tutorial on ‘How to butcher a perfectly good Visual Novel’. If you absolutely must watch it, go in with zero expectations, with only the hope of revisiting the world of Rewrite. Otherwise, just don’t bother.With this, I conclude.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- or Air, which is relatively unheard of.

Rich, vibrant realms can be created with the simplest of tools. Within them, characters can be given life, allowing us to form a compelling connection with whatever struggles they may face. But perhaps the greatest power which these stories can hold is the one to create impact--to inspire change within reality itself.The Rewrite anime isn\'t one of those stories--not even close. It\'s unable to craft any sort of concrete narrative. Storylines which seemingly have no connection to each other are tenuously stapled together, in a similar manner to a child\'s hopes being crushed by the towering expectations of...others. Yet, it never manages to convey anything internally, and it never cares to. Instead, it grows its own fragile ego of ostentatious themes and overly ambitious goals. Eventually, it reveals itself to be a guise meant to weakly dispel any acknowledgment of its own hollow identity.Initially, Rewrite\'s narrative goals weren\'t of grandeur, but of re-captivating a naive high school adolescence typically found in anime. In theory, its premise sounds heartfelt: Rewrite follows its main character, Koutarou Tennouji, who, while boisterous and unpredictable among his friends, represses his own isolation and longing for a sense of belonging. Eventually, Koutarou is given the opportunity to join the outlandish Occult Club, where he then gather his friends together, never failing to crack a smile in the way, in order to a live fulfilling youth under the pretext of solving supernatural occurrences.The High School Club is no revolutionary innovation for anime, but Rewrite\'s spin on seems like a fresh of breath air as, in opposition to the rigid, cynical, protagonists common in the setting, Koutarou is more than voluntary creating fun for his club. His situation becomes all the more palatable; there are no foreboding conditions to be made or dark, secret pasts covered by a mask. It’s just good ol’ fun.Yet, Rewrite manages to disassemble itself from ever becoming satisfactory, let alone becoming inspiring. And it does so in the worst way possible: making Koutarou an appalling asshole to watch.Usually, when describing what goes into good character writing, a common idea thrown is the one of making characters be multifaceted. However, character writing doesn\'t even need superfluous depth to be effective--that\'s just one way in which characters are made real. The simplicity of everyday life and idealism reflected by characters can, arguably, echo that reality much easier than the acclaimed Big Damn Heroes. A couple of mannerisms which form a character can go a long way if used with competence, such as giving autonomy to them that allows for coherence.Rewrite\'s Koutarou seems to have gotten the wrong idea as to what it is that constitutes a good character. Instead of mixing in one or two mannerisms his characters, Rewrite mixes in a boiling pot of tropes to compose Koutarou. He becomes absurdly multi-faced,  being one second a thirsty, flaming pervert, the next second a teen with a heart of gold, and in another instance an angsty philosopher strolling some somber ruins.Koutaru\'s character traits accumulate so much that they inevitably topple over, often contradicting each other in the process. When a depressed Koutarou wishes for friends in the morning, only to then taunt his only male friend on a whim, Koutarou can no longer be definitively defined by his desire for companionship which the narrative so strives to develop.Contradictory characters aren\'t inherently bad; they can be played for a compelling scenario of irony. A good example being the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise’s Kyon, who portrays a similar desire for extravagant fun to that of Koutarou\'s, but under the heavy guise of snarky cynicism. However, Kyon, unlike Koutarou, regulates his own traits. He\'ll only be snarky when he feels the time calls for it. Eventually, Kyon is able to form a middle ground between those two traits, one that humanizes what inflicts his wisecracking nature and what triggers his excitement. It\'s a process by which we\'re invited to form a greater connection to the events that stimulate Kyon as he develops, but also one in which Kyon is made more cohesive and, consequently, more believable in his actions.Koutarou is missing that natural cohesiveness that\'s important to making him work. His traits aren\'t connected with each other to form the bigger picture of the Socially Awkward Teenager he is, but instead deliberate throwaways meant to emphasize Koutarou\'s supposed humorous innateness as a character. They\'re abrupt, appearing at any moment whether appropriate or not, before fading away. Each instance of Koutarou feels like an entirely different character, up to the point where he no longer feels like a character, much less a person. He becomes an annoyance, enhancing none of the situations he\'s in but instead stripping away their authenticity.Arguably, Koutarou lacking any sense of character might be a deliberate thematic element Rewrite is going for. Under the implication, Koutarou\'s ""core"" as a character would be spawning different personalities to surpass his lack of any at all, only to then ironically drive home that Koutarou\'s many faces exhibit a hollow identity to the point of no longer feeling human. In a sense, Koutarou would be a criticism of high school anime protagonists saying that none of the wishful cliches they involve themselves are authentic experiences. They\'ll only serve as a means of egoistic indulgement, one that deteriorates any sense of ""being human"" in its own way.But Koutarou\'s character shouldn\'t be trying to make a ""point"" as an excuse for incompetent character writing. Regardless of whether Koutaoru is meant to satirize protagonists or just represent the hollow shell of a teenager, Rewrite never supplements any context to support such characterization. Under which societal standards found in Rewrite\'s fictional city, Kazamatsuri, would Koutarou be pressured to be devoid of character? Rewrite doesn\'t answer any questions which propose a further expanding of Koutarou\'s background as a person. Consequently, no characterization is given that humanizes his incoherency.Koutarou arrests every narrative goal to be in assistance towards his character, with everything revolving around him internally. Once Rewrite’s fictional city setting, Kazamatsuri, begins to center around just Koutarou, there are no contrasting comparisons which can be made of both him and his world that can develop both as genuine. It doesn\'t help that Rewrite’s first half is mostly framed around the high school setting--something which limits construction of an outside world. Kazamatsuri, as a result, loses its tangibility as a location with its own life.Despite the destruction of a setting being a narrative offense, especially in the case of shows heavy on worldbuilding such as Rewrite, a much greater offense is committed: the dehumanization of other characters as people.Sympathy and its importance in our relationships with others is a prevalent theme that Rewrite pushes through with Koutarou, who\'s selfishly blinded by his own lack of receiving any that he, at times, fails to notice the suffering of others. The first half largely consists of making Koutarou come to this realization through the additions of his club members: Kotori Kanbe, Koutarou\'s childhood friend, Shizuru Nakatsu, Koutarou\'s kouhai, Lucia Konohana, Koutarou\'s class president, Chihaya Ohtori, a transfer student, and Akane Senri, the founder of the occult club.Following the typical nakige anime formula, most of these girls have a hidden past, prompting them to have many insecurities covered by their mannerisms. In the context of the narrative, this formula is especially interesting due to how some of the girls echo Koutarou\'s flaws. This aspect of the characters is exploited most in their development. However, instead of fleshing them out as people, Rewrite establishes them as figures of sympathy used for drama first and foremost.Any other traits for these characters are passed aside, leaving many of them to just be unpolished archetypes and nothing more. Within their own universe, they\'re marginalized, forever trapped by their narrative roles. Kotori, for instance, can only ever be Koutarou\'s childhood friend. Every dilemma which she faces, every choice she makes, and even her interactions with others are centered on her relationship with Koutarou.We\'re restricted from ever having glimpses of these characters lives outside of Koutarou\'s World that may seem trivial, but add to their humanization as characters. And a lot of these characters clearly show lives beyond the narrative functions; I\'d love to see the introspective story of a sexually ambiguous Kotori. But with how Rewrite capitalizes on its characters potential to be melodramatic first, that\'s just not possible. With their treatment, these characters can no longer be deemed as clearly autonomous people. They\'re unable to convey any sense of real emotion, much like Koutarou.However, whereas some characters like Chihaya become utterly forgotten by their own story, quite a few are highlighted with sob stories. With their abrupt nature and lack of any meaningful context, the sob stories can barely function in giving texture to characters. However, Shizuru perhaps provides the single best instance of characterization throughout the whole show thanks to her sob story. In an accident involving her parents, a young Shizuru is left to live off as an orphan with heavy guilt. However, we\'re not demanded to sob with her, as it\'s a moment meant to highlight Shizuru\'s growth from that point onwards. She becomes independently strong, removing most of her regrets from that time. This moment, even if missing some key essentials to being great, is satisfactory enough to inspire a reason to be compelled by Shizuru.Yet, after this sob story, this aspect of Shizuru\'s character isn\'t ever developed, or even touched on, again. The sob story is revealed to have just been vague foreshadowing for some major plot points without showing much care towards Shizuru\'s strengths. She reverts back to her innocent loli archetype and continues to express her quirky nature to Koutarou in a flaunting manner until drama calls her back again.It\'s incredibly ironic how Rewrite shows a total disregard for character development in favor for the tiny tidbits of plot buildup, as said plot is entirely reliant on characterization. The destructive foreshadowing by which everything is sacrificed towards constitutes its second half, which is where Rewrite goes from being a Bottom-Of-The-Barrel title to being downright asinine; it becomes an insult just watching it.Rewrite\'s second half, for as convoluted as it can get, can be simplified into one narrative goal: challenging Koutarou\'s attachments. These attachments, whether they\'re Kazamatsuri or the Occult Club, become parts of Koutarou\'s character. However, while doing so, Rewrite denies its audience any attachment towards those settings. They become abstract, stagnant husks of places, devoid of any natural dynamism. This hinders the second half entirely, as it introduces a new setting that\'s established and feeds off of the hypothetical substance developed in the mundane one. However, as Rewrite evidently doesn’t develop any sense of meaning beforehand, viewers are left in the dark as incoherent melodrama ensues.[Disclaimer: From this point on, major spoilers regarding Rewrite may be discussed.]Supernatural elements are a recurrence in Rewrite\'s first half; it\'s what all that foreshadowing suggests towards. Yet, there\'s a total disconnection between the small scope of Koutarou\'s High School Life and the literal End of The World which Rewrite reveals as the plot of its second half. The apocalyptic threat in Rewrite feels incredibly inappropriate in comparison to anything the show has established beforehand. It\'s an atrocious plot twist that not only invalidates it\'s own story and confirms its own superficiality, but also neglects an audience\'s immersement. At this point, Rewrite no longer feels like a single, coherent show; it feels like two different shows entirely. When internal consistency in Rewrite\'s world becomes lost, no longer is there any reason to care for its destruction.Even in isolation, the Supernatural Kazamatsuri fails to create a sense of tangibility like its mundane counterpart. Rewrite builds a world of an ancient conflict between two organizations, Gaia and Guardian, who wish to either end the world or preserve it, respectively. Gaia can control familiars, whereas Guardian members are superhumans, both powers which, while interesting in concept, never seek their potential. But even neglecting their tactical strategies, warfare between the two is dealt with insensitivity. Ideologies are what solely define them and not the humanity behind them. Rewrite doesn’t just expect their abrupt appearance to be meaningful, but it also expects their single, underdeveloped motivations to be compelling to watch in conflict alone. For once in Rewrite, Koutarou shows relatability because of this as he barely betrays any apprehension once he discovers of the organizations\' existence.The main source of hostility between Gaia and Guardian involves around them seeking what determines the earth\'s destruction, a being dubbed as the Key. Rewrite\'s countless forms of exposition hinder this tension from being anything close to compelling, with information being told towards the viewer via still shots instead of showing it through the flow of action. Tension, while practically being a scarce element in its first half, becomes nonexistent in its latter half. This can be mostly thanked, however, to the representation of the Key itself: a moe, loli character voiced by Kana Hanazawa.Typically, characters like Kagari are played with for quick, cheap, future drama; take Fuku Ibuki from Clannad or Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters! as examples. Unfortunately, to the context of Rewrite\'s narrative, Kagari doesn\'t even get this minimal treatment. She isn\'t even treated like she has a narrative and in-universe function that determines the fate of the plot. She’s completely undermined; when she\'s undermined for laughs, she\'s treated as a socially inept figure who is obsessed with coffee. When she\'s undermined for her fanservice appeal, Koutarou will be ""accidentally"" groping her flat chest.Rewrite has absolutely no shame admitting that Kagari is merchandising potential with the small convenience of being a plot device that can be occasionally thrown around. Kagari\'s character is Rewrite admitting that, despite its attempts, it has no idea what it is it wants to be and then resorts to solemnly indulge, in defeat, by pandering.Even though nothing at this point can revive its dead narrative, Rewrite\'s visuals are, at the very least, satisfactory, even if inconsistent at times. If there\'s anything Rewrite gets consistent for the most part in its visual department, it\'s its ability to set scenes through lighting alone. Koutarou\'s room after a lethargic day of fooling around in school provides us with a faint, artificial light that represents Koutarou\'s own superficiality, only contrasted by a pitch black, unknown outside acknowledged by a window. It provides the tiresome, melancholic imagery that’s necessary to his character, but is rarely ever given the writing to back it up.The character designs by Masayuki Nonaka themselves are actually fairly endearing, even if the school uniforms of Kazamatsuri students are rather absurd. Masayuki shows a clear aptitude is being able to make his character designs come to live, having many of Rewrite\'s moments of vivid character animation be done by him. Ryouma Ebata also joins in on the fun by animating and storyboarding the first ED with his signature, realistic walk cycles. Other than these rare exceptions, Rewrite\'s character designs for the most part lack a nuance that\'s necessary for conveying characterization that plot alone can\'t. Character acting can at times be rigid, if at all. Still shots of characters with their moe, Itaru Hinoue eyes gravely kills some of its more serious scenes. It doesn\'t help that characters being off-model isn\'t an uncommon occurrence.Visually, Rewrite kills itself with conspicuous CGI. For the convoluted designs which many of Gaia\'s familiars have, CGI is used to prevent there from being some atrocious abomination of 2D animation. Nonetheless, the use of CGI itself still isn\'t mastered, with many of the models themselves showing repetitive animation cycles which just emphasize their artificiality. As familiars often interact with humans, who are 2D animated, them seeming out-of-place is made quickly apparent and quite awkward. The use of CGI is inevitable, but Rewrite fails to clear its stigma in any way.Being originally a visual novel, Rewrite shares most of its soundtrack with that of its source material, while also containing some anime original compositions. By itself, the soundtrack contains some real gems. Scene Shifts Here is a poignant, yet dramatically impactful piece which wonderfully builds up crescendos. VN music composer Shinji Orito is no stranger to living up the fun of everyday life and in Rewrite, this shows. Kazamatsuri is given the musical character it deserves with some of his pieces, with a personal favorite of mine being the campy DIS Is A Pain. The anime originals are fairly lukewarm, though, with most of them just utilizing motifs in previous tracks or just downright being unremarkable remixes.However, on a sound design level, Rewrite fails to realize the original emotions contained in its pieces. Many times will leitmotifs accompany characters, serving as reminders of their imprisoning roles, while melodramatic music will be incompetently placed in some scenes. Often times does the music itself try to be emotional substance, in substitution for the lack of any in writing, but ultimately fails. This usage of music becomes formulaic, causing the original tracks to become unfortunately underwhelming. It\'s a shame seeing some great tracks lose their shine, but with Rewrite\'s perfunctory directing, it\'s inevitable.In the end, I remain truly flabbergasted by Rewrite--at that point, it could have been anything, yet been nothing at the same time. With writing so incompetent, and characters to offensive, the possibility of Rewrite being deliberate garbage with minimal effort put into it wouldn\'t even be surprising. It creates an internal fool itself, meandering around in search for a purpose, as it makes jokes just to fill in a time slot. In the end, it never finds itself; no one, not even a perplexed audience, could develop a sense of meaning within Rewrite. It died like it lived: rebelliously underestimating storytelling, only to then rot and kill itself all together. others. Yet, it never manages to convey anything internally, and it never cares to. Instead, it grows its own fragile ego of ostentatious themes and overly ambitious goals. Eventually, it reveals itself to be a guise meant to weakly dispel any acknowledgment of its own hollow identity.Initially, Rewrite\'s narrative goals weren\'t of grandeur, but of re-captivating a naive high school adolescence typically found in anime. In theory, its premise sounds heartfelt: Rewrite follows its main character, Koutarou Tennouji, who, while boisterous and unpredictable among his friends, represses his own isolation and longing for a sense of belonging. Eventually, Koutarou is given the opportunity to join the outlandish Occult Club, where he then gather his friends together, never failing to crack a smile in the way, in order to a live fulfilling youth under the pretext of solving supernatural occurrences.The High School Club is no revolutionary innovation for anime, but Rewrite\'s spin on seems like a fresh of breath air as, in opposition to the rigid, cynical, protagonists common in the setting, Koutarou is more than voluntary creating fun for his club. His situation becomes all the more palatable; there are no foreboding conditions to be made or dark, secret pasts covered by a mask. It’s just good ol’ fun.Yet, Rewrite manages to disassemble itself from ever becoming satisfactory, let alone becoming inspiring. And it does so in the worst way possible: making Koutarou an appalling asshole to watch.Usually, when describing what goes into good character writing, a common idea thrown is the one of making characters be multifaceted. However, character writing doesn\'t even need superfluous depth to be effective--that\'s just one way in which characters are made real. The simplicity of everyday life and idealism reflected by characters can, arguably, echo that reality much easier than the acclaimed Big Damn Heroes. A couple of mannerisms which form a character can go a long way if used with competence, such as giving autonomy to them that allows for coherence.Rewrite\'s Koutarou seems to have gotten the wrong idea as to what it is that constitutes a good character. Instead of mixing in one or two mannerisms his characters, Rewrite mixes in a boiling pot of tropes to compose Koutarou. He becomes absurdly multi-faced,  being one second a thirsty, flaming pervert, the next second a teen with a heart of gold, and in another instance an angsty philosopher strolling some somber ruins.Koutaru\'s character traits accumulate so much that they inevitably topple over, often contradicting each other in the process. When a depressed Koutarou wishes for friends in the morning, only to then taunt his only male friend on a whim, Koutarou can no longer be definitively defined by his desire for companionship which the narrative so strives to develop.Contradictory characters aren\'t inherently bad; they can be played for a compelling scenario of irony. A good example being the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise’s Kyon, who portrays a similar desire for extravagant fun to that of Koutarou\'s, but under the heavy guise of snarky cynicism. However, Kyon, unlike Koutarou, regulates his own traits. He\'ll only be snarky when he feels the time calls for it. Eventually, Kyon is able to form a middle ground between those two traits, one that humanizes what inflicts his wisecracking nature and what triggers his excitement. It\'s a process by which we\'re invited to form a greater connection to the events that stimulate Kyon as he develops, but also one in which Kyon is made more cohesive and, consequently, more believable in his actions.Koutarou is missing that natural cohesiveness that\'s important to making him work. His traits aren\'t connected with each other to form the bigger picture of the Socially Awkward Teenager he is, but instead deliberate throwaways meant to emphasize Koutarou\'s supposed humorous innateness as a character. They\'re abrupt, appearing at any moment whether appropriate or not, before fading away. Each instance of Koutarou feels like an entirely different character, up to the point where he no longer feels like a character, much less a person. He becomes an annoyance, enhancing none of the situations he\'s in but instead stripping away their authenticity.Arguably, Koutarou lacking any sense of character might be a deliberate thematic element Rewrite is going for. Under the implication, Koutarou\'s ""core"" as a character would be spawning different personalities to surpass his lack of any at all, only to then ironically drive home that Koutarou\'s many faces exhibit a hollow identity to the point of no longer feeling human. In a sense, Koutarou would be a criticism of high school anime protagonists saying that none of the wishful cliches they involve themselves are authentic experiences. They\'ll only serve as a means of egoistic indulgement, one that deteriorates any sense of ""being human"" in its own way.But Koutarou\'s character shouldn\'t be trying to make a ""point"" as an excuse for incompetent character writing. Regardless of whether Koutaoru is meant to satirize protagonists or just represent the hollow shell of a teenager, Rewrite never supplements any context to support such characterization. Under which societal standards found in Rewrite\'s fictional city, Kazamatsuri, would Koutarou be pressured to be devoid of character? Rewrite doesn\'t answer any questions which propose a further expanding of Koutarou\'s background as a person. Consequently, no characterization is given that humanizes his incoherency.Koutarou arrests every narrative goal to be in assistance towards his character, with everything revolving around him internally. Once Rewrite’s fictional city setting, Kazamatsuri, begins to center around just Koutarou, there are no contrasting comparisons which can be made of both him and his world that can develop both as genuine. It doesn\'t help that Rewrite’s first half is mostly framed around the high school setting--something which limits construction of an outside world. Kazamatsuri, as a result, loses its tangibility as a location with its own life.Despite the destruction of a setting being a narrative offense, especially in the case of shows heavy on worldbuilding such as Rewrite, a much greater offense is committed: the dehumanization of other characters as people.Sympathy and its importance in our relationships with others is a prevalent theme that Rewrite pushes through with Koutarou, who\'s selfishly blinded by his own lack of receiving any that he, at times, fails to notice the suffering of others. The first half largely consists of making Koutarou come to this realization through the additions of his club members: Kotori Kanbe, Koutarou\'s childhood friend, Shizuru Nakatsu, Koutarou\'s kouhai, Lucia Konohana, Koutarou\'s class president, Chihaya Ohtori, a transfer student, and Akane Senri, the founder of the occult club.Following the typical nakige anime formula, most of these girls have a hidden past, prompting them to have many insecurities covered by their mannerisms. In the context of the narrative, this formula is especially interesting due to how some of the girls echo Koutarou\'s flaws. This aspect of the characters is exploited most in their development. However, instead of fleshing them out as people, Rewrite establishes them as figures of sympathy used for drama first and foremost.Any other traits for these characters are passed aside, leaving many of them to just be unpolished archetypes and nothing more. Within their own universe, they\'re marginalized, forever trapped by their narrative roles. Kotori, for instance, can only ever be Koutarou\'s childhood friend. Every dilemma which she faces, every choice she makes, and even her interactions with others are centered on her relationship with Koutarou.We\'re restricted from ever having glimpses of these characters lives outside of Koutarou\'s World that may seem trivial, but add to their humanization as characters. And a lot of these characters clearly show lives beyond the narrative functions; I\'d love to see the introspective story of a sexually ambiguous Kotori. But with how Rewrite capitalizes on its characters potential to be melodramatic first, that\'s just not possible. With their treatment, these characters can no longer be deemed as clearly autonomous people. They\'re unable to convey any sense of real emotion, much like Koutarou.However, whereas some characters like Chihaya become utterly forgotten by their own story, quite a few are highlighted with sob stories. With their abrupt nature and lack of any meaningful context, the sob stories can barely function in giving texture to characters. However, Shizuru perhaps provides the single best instance of characterization throughout the whole show thanks to her sob story. In an accident involving her parents, a young Shizuru is left to live off as an orphan with heavy guilt. However, we\'re not demanded to sob with her, as it\'s a moment meant to highlight Shizuru\'s growth from that point onwards. She becomes independently strong, removing most of her regrets from that time. This moment, even if missing some key essentials to being great, is satisfactory enough to inspire a reason to be compelled by Shizuru.Yet, after this sob story, this aspect of Shizuru\'s character isn\'t ever developed, or even touched on, again. The sob story is revealed to have just been vague foreshadowing for some major plot points without showing much care towards Shizuru\'s strengths. She reverts back to her innocent loli archetype and continues to express her quirky nature to Koutarou in a flaunting manner until drama calls her back again.It\'s incredibly ironic how Rewrite shows a total disregard for character development in favor for the tiny tidbits of plot buildup, as said plot is entirely reliant on characterization.

Pairing up with animation studios like Kyoani and P.A. works, the newest Key adaptation comes from our friends at 8bit who can\'t create a bloody cohesive story, Rewrite.  And I must beg the question.  8bit, you sure this series DIDN\'T need a rewrite?Story: Tennouji Koutarou is a classic harem protagonist going to a school that has...rather ornate-looking female uniforms.  Upon finding himself associating with the occult club, he is asked a question from its president asking whether or not if he had the choice, would he save the world?Following what has been confirmed as one of the final routes of the Rewrite VN, the story of this adaptation is...messy.  Yeah, I\'m not gonna sugarcoat it, it\'s confusing as f**k.  The first problem that comes from Rewrite as a whole is the fact that the entire series follows one of the ENDGAME ROUTES of the entire visual novel, you know, the route that you\'re only supposed to play or have access to when you have completed everything else and get an understanding for everything?  And so, because of this, the show comes as a confusing mess that attempts yet fails miserably at really creating a cohesive and concise story to explain the  themes and overall plot of the series.  Examples of this are when several characters talk about specific things or epiphanies which when you watch without any context, really doesn\'t make any or very little sense.Context aside, the bigger problem that I see with Rewrite is the fact that the show has awful pacing.  The show spends about half of its runtime with high school romcom/harem-esque setup that not only squanders the runtime, but takes away from the show\'s second half with a war between the two factions that this show exhibits, Gaia and Guardian.  I personally find this to be a huge shame to this series because the actual content of this series actually seemed interesting and it was a real downer to see that the show really didn\'t deliver on its potential.  Though granted, I\'m not sitting through 20 cours of material to get the full scope of this series, so...yeah.  Its rushed pacing broke the second half and added only more and more loose and poorly executed details that ended in an ending that unless you\'ve actually played Rewrite, you will most likely not get.Overview:+ Actually interesting storyline-  Piss poor pacing-  Endgame route which without context, doesn\'t make much senseCharacters: Visual novel characters from Key always have a tragic or less than happy backstory to coincide with the overall nature of their works.  Rewrite is no different, and therefore has problems because lol8bit.With Koutarou, you get what you would expect from a Key protag, which is basically the kind of character who is the complete opposite of your generic harem protag who gets flustered around women and is denser than the earth\'s core.  But really, that\'s all you get.  The pacing of this series is done in a way that as a character, anything regarding Koutarou\'s character in the slightest doesn\'t really change.  He\'s pretty stagnant all the way and things in the series just kinda...go along whether it\'s under his power or not.  Any and all change that he does have feels unnatural and rushed and overall doesn\'t really make his character any more or less interesting.  Granted he is a VN protagonist surrounded in girls, but hey, Key always somehow makes the player character interesting in some way, so it\'s not impossible to make them cool or at least interesting.The last character I will talk about is \'Ribbon Girl\'.  I\'m not spoiling her name for anyone who actually wants to watch this series (lol), but I will say that her name does actually get announced in the series, but it\'s so painfully late that I\'m still calling her \'Ribbon Girl\' for the rest of the series and as I\'m writing this.  Now, Ribbon Girl is what would arguably be this route\'s heroine.  The problem is, you don\'t really get to know or understand much about her.  The series treats her as the plot device object that everyone wants (which she...kinda is) but as a character, we don\'t get much about her.  She doesn\'t feel developed beyond some comedic character traits and understanding of such a character feels and is really minimal.As for the rest of the girls in the series who belong to their own respective routes that we\'ll never see...well, they\'re shafted.  There\'re really no two ways to go about it since that\'s just how these VN adaptations go.  For a few of them we do get a bit of an understanding of their tragic past and how they ended up the way they do, but they\'re just really unnecessary details that I feel really shouldn\'t even be bothered because the series doesn\'t focus on them since they\'re just treated as side characters in this specific adaptation.  Other side characters have even less detail and I would argue to not really give much thought to any of them if at all.Overview:+ Interesting and entertaining characters-  All members of the cast have little to no actual depth to themArt: As expected with 8bit, the artwork and overall style that they went with was pretty on-par with their standards and quality.  They stuck true to Key\'s moe artstyle and the entire look of the series has this nice bright sheen to it that adds to the overall quality.  There\'s little to no actual ecchi as you could expect in a series like this, so I suppose that\'s a sort of plus.However, what does bother me personally is the usage of CGI in this series.  The CGI that the show uses really clashes with the overall look of the handdrawn animation and is actually quite jarring to look at, especially since its usage is increased dramatically as the episodes go by.Overview:+ Good quality hand-drawn animation-  The CGI clashes with the look of the seriesSound: Apart from the second OP in the second half of the series known as ""End of the World"" (Hmm, I wonder what could be happening in this show?), the rest of the soundtrack really isn\'t all that exciting or memorable.  Only this one OP is perhaps the only real notable track that I could find throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment: Admittedly, I like Key.  While their works don\'t always get the best reception or adaptations due to the way that their visual novels are structured, I was intrigued to see what kind of things 8bit, a company that I\'ve had a pretty rough history with would do to completely and utterly destroy the kind of content that Key has made.  Watching Rewrite...I don\'t really know what I expected to be completely honest.  I went into this series thinking it was going to be subpar at best, and despite getting something that was admittedly worse than my original expectations, I didn\'t really expect anything less.Did I like this series?I like the characters.  While they were lacking in the development or backstory department as Key always does, their base character traits, especially Koutarou were enough to keep a smidgen of interest for me to continue, although the lack of development probably pissed me off more than it should.What didn\'t I like about this series?Ok, I never played Rewrite.  I went into this series pretty much completely blind.  Things.  Didn\'t.  Make.  Sense.  In order to make sense of anything in this adaptation, I had to resort to wikis and other information sources on the plot of Rewrite to even get an bit of an understanding as to what I was watching here.  And even with that, I still didn\'t get what was even happening.  This, this I hate.  I get that this was supposed to be an adaptation for the last route of the game, but at the very least, try and make the whole series somewhat cohesive.Would I recommend this series?Hmm...no.  My suggestion is to just play the VN is you actually want to understand the Rewrite series.  The actual content of this adaptation isn\'t terrible, it\'s just not that good and really doesn\'t have much merit to it because of the sheer number of plot holes and execution problems that this adaptation had.  Content-wise, it had something to it.  Execution-wise, terrible and should be ashamed of itself for its piss poor pacing. rather ornate-looking female uniforms.  Upon finding himself associating with the occult club, he is asked a question from its president asking whether or not if he had the choice, would he save the world?Following what has been confirmed as one of the final routes of the Rewrite VN, the story of this adaptation is...messy.

And so, because of this, the show comes as a confusing mess that attempts yet fails miserably at really creating a cohesive and concise story to explain the  themes and overall plot of the series.  Examples of this are when several characters talk about specific things or epiphanies which when you watch without any context, really doesn\'t make any or very little sense.Context aside, the bigger problem that I see with Rewrite is the fact that the show has awful pacing.  The show spends about half of its runtime with high school romcom/harem-esque setup that not only squanders the runtime, but takes away from the show\'s second half with a war between the two factions that this show exhibits, Gaia and Guardian.  I personally find this to be a huge shame to this series because the actual content of this series actually seemed interesting and it was a real downer to see that the show really didn\'t deliver on its potential.  Though granted, I\'m not sitting through 20 cours of material to get the full scope of this series, so...yeah.  Its rushed pacing broke the second half and added only more and more loose and poorly executed details that ended in an ending that unless you\'ve actually played Rewrite, you will most likely not get.Overview:+ Actually interesting storyline-  Piss poor pacing-  Endgame route which without context, doesn\'t make much senseCharacters: Visual novel characters from Key always have a tragic or less than happy backstory to coincide with the overall nature of their works.  Rewrite is no different, and therefore has problems because lol8bit.With Koutarou, you get what you would expect from a Key protag, which is basically the kind of character who is the complete opposite of your generic harem protag who gets flustered around women and is denser than the earth\'s core.  But really, that\'s all you get.  The pacing of this series is done in a way that as a character, anything regarding Koutarou\'s character in the slightest doesn\'t really change.  He\'s pretty stagnant all the way and things in the series just kinda...go along whether it\'s under his power or not.  Any and all change that he does have feels unnatural and rushed and overall doesn\'t really make his character any more or less interesting.  Granted he is a VN protagonist surrounded in girls, but hey, Key always somehow makes the player character interesting in some way, so it\'s not impossible to make them cool or at least interesting.The last character I will talk about is \'Ribbon Girl\'.  I\'m not spoiling her name for anyone who actually wants to watch this series (lol), but I will say that her name does actually get announced in the series, but it\'s so painfully late that I\'m still calling her \'Ribbon Girl\' for the rest of the series and as I\'m writing this.  Now, Ribbon Girl is what would arguably be this route\'s heroine.  The problem is, you don\'t really get to know or understand much about her.  The series treats her as the plot device object that everyone wants (which she...kinda is) but as a character, we don\'t get much about her.  She doesn\'t feel developed beyond some comedic character traits and understanding of such a character feels and is really minimal.As for the rest of the girls in the series who belong to their own respective routes that we\'ll never see...well, they\'re shafted.  There\'re really no two ways to go about it since that\'s just how these VN adaptations go.  For a few of them we do get a bit of an understanding of their tragic past and how they ended up the way they do, but they\'re just really unnecessary details that I feel really shouldn\'t even be bothered because the series doesn\'t focus on them since they\'re just treated as side characters in this specific adaptation.  Other side characters have even less detail and I would argue to not really give much thought to any of them if at all.Overview:+ Interesting and entertaining characters-  All members of the cast have little to no actual depth to themArt: As expected with 8bit, the artwork and overall style that they went with was pretty on-par with their standards and quality.  They stuck true to Key\'s moe artstyle and the entire look of the series has this nice bright sheen to it that adds to the overall quality.  There\'s little to no actual ecchi as you could expect in a series like this, so I suppose that\'s a sort of plus.However, what does bother me personally is the usage of CGI in this series.  The CGI that the show uses really clashes with the overall look of the handdrawn animation and is actually quite jarring to look at, especially since its usage is increased dramatically as the episodes go by.Overview:+ Good quality hand-drawn animation-  The CGI clashes with the look of the seriesSound: Apart from the second OP in the second half of the series known as ""End of the World"" (Hmm, I wonder what could be happening in this show?), the rest of the soundtrack really isn\'t all that exciting or memorable.  Only this one OP is perhaps the only real notable track that I could find throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment: Admittedly, I like Key.  While their works don\'t always get the best reception or adaptations due to the way that their visual novels are structured, I was intrigued to see what kind of things 8bit, a company that I\'ve had a pretty rough history with would do to completely and utterly destroy the kind of content that Key has made.  Watching Rewrite...I don\'t really know what I expected to be completely honest.  I went into this series thinking it was going to be subpar at best, and despite getting something that was admittedly worse than my original expectations, I didn\'t really expect anything less.Did I like this series?I like the characters.  While they were lacking in the development or backstory department as Key always does, their base character traits, especially Koutarou were enough to keep a smidgen of interest for me to continue, although the lack of development probably pissed me off more than it should.What didn\'t I like about this series?Ok, I never played Rewrite.  I went into this series pretty much completely blind.  Things.  Didn\'t.  Make.  Sense.  In order to make sense of anything in this adaptation, I had to resort to wikis and other information sources on the plot of Rewrite to even get an bit of an understanding as to what I was watching here.  And even with that, I still didn\'t get what was even happening.  This, this I hate.  I get that this was supposed to be an adaptation for the last route of the game, but at the very least, try and make the whole series somewhat cohesive.Would I recommend this series?Hmm...no.  My suggestion is to just play the VN is you actually want to understand the Rewrite series.  The actual content of this adaptation isn\'t terrible, it\'s just not that good and really doesn\'t have much merit to it because of the sheer number of plot holes and execution problems that this adaptation had.  Content-wise, it had something to it.  Execution-wise, terrible and should be ashamed of itself for its piss poor pacing.', 'If anyone has read some other review that he has done he will know that clarifies whether or not it contains romance and this is no exception.Rewrite is a full-fledged harem but it gives more importance to the mystery than to the same romance but of course the romance is more than present, each heroine has its own small story that helps us understand why its actions but not this Deceive them since centering more on the mystery leaves you more doubts than answers so if you are of people who hate not knowing what happens best think twice before seeing it, entering more into...the romance could describe it as boring and deceptive but clear Is my opinion of the first season, as it seems that the second will bring great changes. In short Rewrite is an anime that I catalog as a gamble as it may interest you or it may bore you. the romance could describe it as boring and deceptive but clear Is my opinion of the first season, as it seems that the second will bring great changes. In short Rewrite is an anime that I catalog as a gamble as it may interest you or it may bore you.', 'Have you ever look forward to a new episode that you can’t stop thinking about all throughout the week? Well, that was the exact opposite with me and Rewrite. Trying to make a joke about wanting the show to be “rewritten”, but now I just wished it wasn’t written in the first place. Everything about it was a whole lot of wrong.I’ll admit, I have not played the original visual novel. However, I won’t use that as an excuse to why I didn’t like it. There were other adaptations of works by Key that were fairly decent. Planetarian was one that was came out the...same time and was much shorter, but at least that was more entertaining. Again, I know nothing of the original source, so I don’t know what is faithful or not. But, that doesn’t mean I can’t distinguish a good story from a bad one.That brings me to the story. It’s so difficult to describe that I’m having trouble figuring out what to write in this section. The one thing that bothered me the most, when it comes to the story, is the lack of context. Rarely were things explained, and if so, it was in the vaguest way possible. What’s worse than a bad story is having horrible pacing added to it. I first noticed it in an early episode that focused on a certain character. We get their backstory, and it’s done so quickly that it gives us no time to appreciate (for a lack of better terms) this character’s history. The second half of the show goes so downhill and becomes mind-numbingly ludicrous that I didn’t even react. The overall mood was kind of a mix, as well. It seems serious at times, but isn’t afraid to put in a random fart joke (there’s only one, but it’s really off-putting).While the story may be out there, I can’t say the same thing for the characters. Zero personalities, zero chemistry, zero everything. There is not a drop of redeeming quality to these people that we’re supposed to follow for twelve episodes. I have the strange suspicion that they were well written in the visual novel because we’ll have more time to know them better. For me, I wouldn’t care if the story was terrible, as long as the characters were interesting enough. That’s definitely not the case with this. I couldn’t care less what happens to anyone, and when things did happen to them, I didn’t bat an eye.The only thing worse than a bad story and a bad set of characters is bad animation, and it really shows here. From episode one, right off the bat, the visuals were unpleasing, and it actually managed to get worse with each week. Not only do we get terrible-looking character designs and action sequences, we’re even presented with horrendously rendered CG creatures. When both of them are shown together, it is an eyesore. There was never a single moment where I was able to say that something “looked nice”.For the most part, I can get behind the idea that not everyone has the same opinions on something. Yet, there are shows like Rewrite that makes me wonder why there are people who did enjoy it. Currently, it has close to a rating of 7 on the site, and that puzzles me. How can one look at a single episode of this and say “that was good”? I knew, from the beginning, this show’s fate was already chosen.

I can smell the potential of the source material on it. However, it turned to be a big mess since the very beggining, and with second season ""Rewrite Moon and Terra"" coming, i feel the need of doing what I consider an accurate review of this show, specially about the main problem i have with.Talking first about its skin, the art in Rewrite is pleasant. It is your typical Key art with moe characters and eyes bigger than your hand but it\'s very colorful and shining. Animation is also rather good, with fluid movements and fights. CGI was ok and...overall a good animation for a studio with almost none specially previously good work.Well, i\'m pretty sure why this is not the exception.This is my main problem with Rewrite: It is indeed very rushed. Well, you can think this is not a major problem, it is very common skip some things while adapting and things like those, but the reality is that is VERY rushed to the point of being a total disaster. Usually, Key\'s visual novel structure, with some exceptions like Charlotte or Angel Beats (not necessarily good because of that) is made by a plain guy as a protagonist with a bunch of girls surrounding him with their own arcs and development. In Rewrite, of course, you have the plain guy, and 5 or 6 girls. The problem is Rewrite only focuses in two of them very vaguely (and just one episode), while the other girls are doing random stuff with nosense at all because they have been never explained at least as characters. The show explains you the basics of the world and how it works but suddenly everything changes. The characters on the ""bad side"" are never explained even the minimum. But  the problem, as i said, is not source material\'s, but adaptation\'s, because what i can feel on Rewrite is the lack of information, shown or said, that was cutted off for sure because it was probably an extremely long VN to adapt in 13 episodes.I\'ll give an example of this (light spoilers): In episode 2 or 3, the main character say something like: ""I\'m so happy with the occult club, we are friends and we have spent a lot of things together,i don\'t want it to be over"". He almost gathered all the girls in the club at that moment, so they skip a lot of probably episodic adventures to make it in time but that\'s just the beggining of the nonsensical character development of Rewrite. All the flaws i can think are related to be rushed as hell because the story has the potential to be good but the reason why most characters do what they do just fuck the entire story.""Why is this character doing this? why is she saying this? who\'s that character and why is suddenly so important for the plot? why they only try to develop some characters and other remain untouched, even when they are faced with each other, and both sides are right in some way?"" There are some important questions unanswered in Rewrite that turn it into just a shell of a good show. It has indeed no coherent soul. Maybe second season can repair this, but seeing how first one ended, i don\'t think so. Even if it could, the base material is already so bad that it\'s a snowball now.Overall, even if you like Key and its adaptations, this Rewrite anime is completely forgetable and skipable. It just has many things missing from the original VN, and i can say this without playing it, because is obvious if you are not abduced by the moe style and beautiful animation. overall a good animation for a studio with almost none specially previously good work.Well, i\'m pretty sure why this is not the exception.This is my main problem with Rewrite: It is indeed very rushed.

The main thing being that a lot of the characters really look alike when you just glance at them. I had legitimate struggles telling the difference between three characters because their face and their hair styles are so similar. As for the rest of the cast, there are two Moe girls and one sassy/tough girl, and this is all exemplified through their art style. The interesting thing about this art is how cartoonish is can get at times. Sometimes things will be serious and...really great art, but other times, things look more airbrushed. Another big problem I have is the use of CGI when it comes to some of the things in later episodes, and it really throws me through a loop. The characters themselves are pretty generic for a show like this: The stoic one, the moe one, the shy moe one, the sassy one, the childhood friend, and the overly happy one. As for the lead guy in Rewrite, he is your run-of-the-mill guy who gets embarrassed easily but is deep down kind of a pervert. He cares for his friends tremendously and that can be seen throughout the story which makes it very watchable.Music/Sound: The music that we hear through the show is actually pretty generic, and pretty forgettable. For example, I just watched the last episode this morning and I can’t remember the theme this afternoon. There are some good songs that can be found in the background of the show, but really there is only one song that really caught my attention and that was at the end of the final arc of the show. Sound itself did a pretty good job however. There were a lot of times where I would catch myself looking away and not really caring what was happening but all of a sudden there was a sound that caught me and hooked me back in. This is a trait I don’t see often and I would like to see more of.Story: Kotarou Tennouji is a seemingly average high school boy who just wants to be friends with the people around him. But something has been plaguing him and keeping him up at night the last few nights, a girl in a black dress with a red ribbon. He goes and tries to find her one night where he is seemingly killed by this girl. He wakes up, startled, and thankful that it was just a dream, goes back to sleep. But he has a new ability, the ability to rewrite any part of his body to give him more strength and more speed. He is convinced that this has something to do with the girl so he sets out and joins the Occult club, with his friends, to figure out what the heck has happened to him and what is so special about this girl.Personal Reflection: So the first thing I figured out about this show was that the first episode was 45 minutes, instead of 23. I did not sign up for that, and it was a little unwanted. There was nothing that moved the plot a long in those extra 23ish minutes, and it should have just stuck with being a regular episode. I don’t know maybe this show had a lot of hype, but to me, I was watching and the beginning was just so slow. After things began to pick up with the occult club and the friend group began to grow I was more interested in it. Then all of a sudden, all hell seems to break loose and the plot of the show changes dramatically. I won’t give it away, but the twist came so far out of left field that I almost stopped watching because it was almost like watching a completely different show. The nice thing is that they were able to tie it all back together by the end. Speaking of the end, there was a firm conclusion. I feel like this is actually uncommon for a lot of shows because the anime adaptation is from an ongoing manga or light novel series, but because this was a visual novel there was a clear end and no room for the story to continue. It provided me with a sense of closure that I don’t normally get. If you are into crazy club antics and deep dramatics with a group of friends, you will probably enjoy Rewrite!Overall Score: 6/10 really great art, but other times, things look more airbrushed.

I wanted to see how the animation would play out because in all honesty, I don\'t know how they were planning to go about it as in the visual novel I had only completed about 2.5 routes. Each route goes through a different point of view with a focus on on of the girls the MC interacts with and due to how that works out, I wasn\'t sure how the anime would decide to do things.As the anime started, I remembered parts of the...visual novel but essentially it skips a lot which I expected because the visual novel is so long and focusing on one route would be 12 episodes on its own I guess (or maybe a bit less). So in the anime a lot of things are skipped and you immediately reach the stages of ""Oh here is the other female members"" and ""we quickly get to a key part of that characters background"". Since I\'ve gone through part of the visual novel I already have some idea of what would have happened previously to get up to that stage but if you watch the anime without any prior knowledge, it\'s just a mess. Things occur in the anime where you are just thinking ""What? what happened? how did this happen? nothing really explains what is going on.""I only enjoyed parts of the anime just to see the characters in motion and as well as their personalities; Lucia\'s tongue rolling sound when she is angry and rolls her rrrrrrr\'s or Kotori\'s little humorous personality to make little random jokes and Shizuru\'s often puzzled expressions.At the moment, I haven\'t bothered to move on to the other half (sequel) and decided to recheck out the visual novel as that is more in-depth and provides to smaller scenes of character interactions where you can grow a liken to the characters.Rewrite in itself the visual novel was quite the hard thing to get around to but the anime is just trying to cram so much in in so little time it doesn\'t make sense to the regular viewer and because of that it ends up being Key\'s worst anime adaptation and I\'m having to cleanse my mind by going back to the visual novel just to not spoil the story.What I really wished to see in the anime is the fun little interactions between the characters that helped show off more of their personalities. visual novel but essentially it skips a lot which I expected because the visual novel is so long and focusing on one route would be 12 episodes on its own I guess (or maybe a bit less).

It was my firts 10 out of 10 in its genre, not because it's perfect, but rather because when I was reading it, it felt like it was made perfectly for me. And I'm not deaf to criticism, I've since read opinions of many people who were far less content with that story. And most of the time they've made valid points, but just like I said - while Rewrite wasn't story for them, it still was one for me.Now, why I'm writing this down? Because I think it's important...to show you my mindset at the time when I was starting this anime. You've already seen my score: 5. Merely five for something that I should like, no, love. But sorry, I couldn't. I may be a fanboy, but I'm also not blind. This adpatation wasn't a good one, having constant problems with knowing what it wants to show. Is it fanservice for people who are already familiar with the source material? I'd think so, because there were just so many parts that only they would understand. But then, it wasn't particulary good fanservice (Oh, by fanservice I mean seeing characters you like getting animated, revisiting familiar places and hearing this masterpiece of a soundtrack again. Not those lousy attempts to flash tits). Then again, maybe it was meant for people new to Rewrite, with all heroines route cramed to the first 5-6 episodes? But it still can't be right, because not only they wouldn't really get some parts, it would also spoil for them many plot twists without encouraging to read visual novel.Eh, damn it, that's exactly what's wrong with Rewrite anime - it's a convoluted mess that doesn't know to whom it want to appeal. But you know what? Screw that, let's take a look at anime original story of Kagari, which started in the second half of the season... Nope, still doesn't work. I don't want to spoil anything, so let me just say that the problems that were present earlier are still present here. Plus making tits flashing scenes with that budget and run time - really, 8bit? You just couldn't resist, could ya? And again, don't get me wrong. Oppai route/ending in visual novel made me cry laughing, instantly becoming my Sèvres's measure of fanservice done just right. So while seeing this new Kagari was interesting, that was all.Anyway, if you gonna watch it, please keep in mind that the whole thing doesn't represent what Rewrite really is. If you enjoyed - good for you, if you didn't - I hear you, but in both cases I'd suggest trying visual novel one day.This anime isn't good. to show you my mindset at the time when I was starting this anime.

Was it for the veteran VN readers or was it some sort of advertisement for the fresh anime watchers? Regardless of their target audience I think that 8-bit has failed miserably.Story: 2/10First, an introduction to the story. Kotarou is the main character of the show. The show literally follows him around as he tries to make the most of his high school life. He ends up reviving an old club in order to form memories with his closest friends. These friends include Akane (a snarky,...devious, and rich female), Chihaya (a super strong, airhead idiot), Kotori (Kotarou's childhood friend that loves pocket change), Lucia (the typical loud class rep), and Shizuru (the best girl loli). The first half of the story follows the events regarding Kotarou and the club. What happens later on will be up to you to find out. No spoilers here.Now if we can take a step back to talk about the quality of the story, I hope I can relay my thoughts. If we take away all connections and points from the VN and judge this show purely on what was presented in the anime, we still get a sloppy mess of a plot. The first 6 or so episodes of the anime somewhat features the common route of the VN. It was however really, really, really condensed down to fit inside the most minimalist of deadlines. The show does include the full cast from the VN which is a feat all on its own but rushes to all hell the introductions and initial character building. The characters somewhat feel like their VN counterparts (helped by the same voice actors and music from the VN) but they lack the punch that their VN counterparts have due to the rushed introductions and lightspeed route completions. What happens at the turning point of the story has very little impact due to this rushed character building.Animation: 4.5/10First bug-o-boo; I don't know what the hell is up with the character models in this show. They just look...off? Like the actual models look like the VN counterparts but they look really washed out. It might be just an A E S T H E T I C quality 8-bit tried to use to make up the show's visual style but it did not work. It ended up making the show look cheap and low quality. It however must be pointed out that the school dresses are really something to look at. Like holy mother of god they look like designer dresses.The more actiony scenes in the show seemed animated pretty well but that is all ruined once they throw the CG monsters on screen. To be perfectly honest the CG monsters in this show are some of the worst quality CG things I have ever seen in an anime. They just look so out of place.Sound: 9/10Most of the voice lines are just poorly written but that does not take away from the actual performance and quality of what was presented in the show. From what I can tell they used the same voice actors from the VN which is great because all of them are excellent. They are literally the only reason each character actually feels like a character (due to the rushed pacing as explained earlier on). The real star though is the music in the show. They were smart and took most of the musical themes from the VN and placed them very well into the show. Seriously going to pick up the OST for this when it becomes available (although if the VN already has one get that).Characters: 4/10I want to make something perfectly clear before I dive into this category. In the VN the characters truly have a life of their own. They are fully fledged out, feel organic, and are some of the best well-knit casts. The anime retains in my honest opinion half of the feeling that the VN provided. The characters are there and the VAs bring out their feelings but it is just not enough. The characters presented in the show just do not seem to meld well enough with each other. In the VN a huge part of the game is laughing and enjoying the interactions of the whole cast as they do club activities. I really did not feel that same sort of organic feeling in the anime when the same scenes were presented.Oddly enough the best part of the show was Kagari's personality. While I have played VN I don't really remember Kagari acting the way she does in the anime in the VN. This might be the new route that the new version of the game is going to include but regardless Kagari is the only character that I ended up liking in the anime. She feels fully fleshed out and honestly steals the screen when she is present.Overall: 4.9/10Again I want to make it abundantly clear that I absolutely love the VN this anime was based on. The VN tells a humorous and enjoyable story with a super well done cast that provide so many great scenes. The anime feels like a super watered down version of the VN. The lines are rushed, the character building/progression is rushed, the visuals look rushed, and the show in general is rushed. If this was a 24 episode show instead of 12 then maybe we would have gotten a worthy adaptation. We however got what we got; a rushed product that I still do not understand who the target audience is.Let me make this better for you in the long run; watch the OP of the anime and the OP for the VN. If it at all looks remotely interesting to you then go play the VN. I honestly think that watching the anime first then going to play the VN might ruined the experience you would have if you just played the VN without the anime's influence. You would miss out of experiencing the VN fresh without outside things hurting the plot twists. Do. Not. Watch. The. Anime.Enjoyment: 3.6/10Thanks for reading my review!

So, instead of giving us, the viewers, a complete anime. They half-assed us and gave us half.

I wouldn\'t read them anyway.Yo! It\'s I, The Self-proclaimed Idiot, DevilDuo come to live from the eye of the storm we call the Otaku community. ""Rewrite"" was it good?

Of course, some people will disagree. Again I got half the story so half the points.Art (8/10): Beautiful animation. They threw in a little bit of CGI, which I don\'t like, but it didn\'t feel out of place. Even the creatures felt pleasing to the eye.

So half probably!?!?!?!?!', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)“Rewrite” is a word that I am intimately familiar with.I cannot tell you how many times I have rewritten paragraphs within my reviews. Entire sentences. Even singular words. Each instance of rewriting getting me one step closer to a piece that I feel comfortable sharing. One that I can be proud of and say, “Yes. This looks good.”It’s never perfect because there is always something that can be rewritten. But what matters is going through that process in the first place.Unfortunately, I don’t believe Rewrite got the memo....STORYRewrite kicks off in dark fashion. Tennouji Kotarou, a high-school boy, dies in his dream at the hands of some ribbon-twirling girl. While he fears whatever curse has been laid upon him, he does his best to live a fun-filled, worthwhile life with his other friends of the Occult Club. But, when strange happenings and sinister plans surface, he finds that his curse is the least of his worries.Discussing Rewrite now is difficult. Not due to the complexity of the material itself, for, arguably, what Rewrite presents is not. But instead due to where the story concluded. It technically gave a complete story but, perhaps obviously, not a full one.As was seen, Rewrite’s season finishes with basically what visual novels deem a bad end. For everything pretty much went wrong: all the characters died, and vegetation engulfed the world. Kagari’s final scene, where she witnesses this timeline fizzle out alongside hundreds of other timelines that have existed or are existing, also backs this scenario up.But, as can easily be looked up (and given that the second season is currently airing at the time of this writing), this series is a split-cour. And, presumably, the second half will contain the same cast, continue the plot, and uphold the overall major ideas.To put it differently, Rewrite has much more to tell – and hopefully a more cheerful ending to get to.This season, then, acts as a primer of sorts. It introduces the important cast members (so that it won’t have to later), it provides the overall dilemma (Kagari’s role as the key to salvation or destruction), and it gives some insight into its more important themes (like environmentalism and that life is better with friends).Unfortunately, the anime fails on almost all accounts.When introducing the cast and, indeed, whenever Kotarou interacted with any of them, it felt entirely too much like its visual-novel source. One after another, Kotarou talks with the girls in a singular manner to meet some hidden quota, removing the naturalness of the events themselves.This awkward event handling goes away come the middle of the season. For, what replaces the school and the introductions is the meat of the plot. Guardian defeating the monsters that Gaia summons. The lingering doomsday prophecy. Separation of the Occult Club.Transitioning from the predominantly slice-of-life fun to the drama-heavy plot was made possible by the show’s smaller hints about the characters’ powers and the gradual reveal of the not-so-imaginary occult instances.What the anime transitions towards, though, is not the most engaging. Despite the title of the anime, Kotarou’s ability does not play too important of a role, diminishing his impact on the overall narrative to that of just the guy who jokes about wanting to grope Akane’s boobs and who hides away from the whole fray within a forested region for far too long. It also does not help that both Guardian and Gaia are hardly explored let alone clash to any major degree.To its credit, Gaia’s evil plan at least makes some sense. Rather than wanting to eradicate all of humanity just because, they feel this route will keep the Earth from destruction at the hands of its most impactful enemy: humans.Which leads into one of Rewrite’s themes: environmentalism. Although, using the word “theme” may be a bit too strong since, on a large scale, the anime does not fully explore this idea. The setting is that of a city where cleaner energy takes precedence, and, as was discussed, the anchor to the whole plot relies on protecting the Earth and its bounty. But the show doesn’t target climate change, the effects of abusing resource collections, or even the importance of vegetation in general. To put it differently, it’s more a small surface detail for the story rather than a prominent, nuanced motif.It’s other major theme – life is better with friends – is one that Rewrite more actively pursues (when compared to the environmentalism). Kotarou finding solace in the Occult Club, their eventual breakup fragmenting his life, his reliving of those happier times with Kagari, and the eventual reunion they (almost all) have at Kotori’s hideaway.This thread is well-meant, and it gives the anime’s narrative better footing. Sadly, it does not firmly plant its feet due to the weakness of its foundation While the Occult Club is a place where Kotarou and the girls hang out and enjoy life together, the anime has a tough time making said togetherness worthwhile.That is, they do not feel like a tightknit group of friends because the events therein do not give them that chance. They chase after a critter, but the highlight is Kotarou grabbing Lucia’s butt and a secretary lady using a fishing pole. They scour a forest, but the odd discoveries and the eventual dive into the heavier drama take over. They conduct a series of investigations into the occult (with fruitless results), but these are gone through so quickly that they mean very little in the long run.All this says nothing about a few awkward plot points (Chihaya not immediately giving Kotarou the super-important letter that Akane addressed to him), the weak action sequences (Midou and Lucia’s duel is about the only memorable one but, even then, just barely), and the anime’s avoidance of showing more of the final scenes (Lucia squaring off against and killing Touka, Chihaya fighting alongside the monstrous Sakuya).The continuation may turn it around, but, for now, this season simply doesn’t work.ANIMATIONRewrite’s character designs are quite nice. The frilly, pink-and-red dresses that the ladies wear are both cute and detailed. Each girl has her own set of accessories: Shizuru’s eyepatch, Lucia’s white gloves, and so on. And the slightly older style for their faces – large eyes, squarer heads – don’t take anything away but rather adds to their overall charm.Artistically, the anime does about as well as it can within its setting. The school isn’t too interesting, and same goes for some of its other more mundane spots like Kotarou’s house or the local town. It can have its moments, though, like in the clubroom with its furniture and bookcases.However, given its focus on environmental impacts, the various nature shots are a welcome inclusion. The lush forests, the greenery encasing flowers, and the immense overgrowth that eventually consumes the world are where the anime is at its prettiest.To be fair, the anime has a strong use of lighting regardless of the location. The school’s hallways casting shadows from the windows or Kotori’s hideaway basked in moonlight give Rewrite a lot in the way of nuance where it normally does not have much.The CG works against the show, though. It’s used rather sparingly, but Gaia’s dinosaur monsters and Kotori’s woodland defenders stick out too much from the surrounding art to be much else besides distracting. Although, admittedly, those defenders do have an interesting green-energy effect from their designs.Actual animation remains consistent throughout the season. Earlier episodes hold up rather well during its slice-of-life segments such as Lucia reacting to Touka (their teacher and her commander) blowing cool air on her ear or Kotarou running away from an evil demon dog. A lot of sitting and speaking goes on, but, even during these scenes, reactions to the situations and other comedic bits give the anime the chance to show off some movement.Later episodes aren’t as strong animation-wise, but they do include a lot more action. Shizuru riding her motorcycle, Lucia dueling Midou, and Kotarou struggling against the flying plant-like beast are just a few of the many examples where the cast do more than just eat snacks in the clubroom.Kagari’s ribbon manipulation (her makeshift crane, her slapping) are also worth noting. Her ribbons are almost always doing something, giving her character and the scenes in which she exists a nice amount of dynamism.CHARACTERSAs it was with the story, Rewrite’s split-cour nature and, more importantly, this season’s outcome (the “bad end”) makes it tough to talk about Kotarou and the other girls. The anime still has more to tell, but it still provided character-focused content worth discussing.Most notable are Shizuru and Lucia. Unlike everyone else, they get their own episode – which can be looked at in one of two ways.The first is with appreciation. The anime understandably wants (and needs) to showcase a lot of its important plot points, but it does not have a whole lot of time in which to do so. So, when the anime squeezes their entire backstory, development, and importance into a single episode, it’s more about giving them the attention they deserve (and likewise need) rather than worrying about the execution. In other words, it’s nice that the audience got something.The second is with question. Their dilemmas are poorly explained through large amounts of exposition. Pacing has no place. Some development occurs but lacks impact. Yes, the audience learns why Shizuru always wears an eyepatch or Lucia always wears gloves, but the events themselves are not handled with the best of care. The show gives them to the audience and that’s that.Of the two approaches, the second is the more arguable since not a whole lot happens with Shizuru and Lucia after these episodes (especially Shizuru). Lucia goes to help Kotarou and the others, saying “What could possibly take priority over protecting my friends?!” An indication of how she has changed her lonely self from before. But that’s about it. As for Shizuru, she eventually abandons her spot within Guardian, but it comes as too little, too late after being sidelined for so long.Rewrite handles Kotori’s character differently, but the conclusion is roughly the same. Arguably worse.She likes sleep, money, and the great outdoors. Extra emphasis for the last one on the list since she eventually reveals her druidic nature. Unlike Shizuru and Lucia, she receives a miniscule amount of backstory. One scene about how she turned down Kotarou’s love confession (meaning the meta childhood-friend curse continues), and one scene about how her parents died in a car accident (which led to her druid powers). The latter unable to support the drama that their second deaths (through their reanimated bodies) bring.Rumored to be a powerful witch, Akane “leads” their occult club – but mostly just plays her online FPS. She apparently skips class as much as she wants but still moves on to the next grade level, indicating some level of power or influence of a hierarchical nature (which is later proven true when her family connections are revealed).Her breasts are a (joking) motivation for Kotarou to investigate the otherworldly happenings presented to them. But, normally, she’s indifferent to the whole occult thing, often lazing about whenever Kotarou brings them all on yet another failed outing.Akane (with Chihaya) inevitably parts with the group once her Gaia affiliation comes to light. Although she does not seem too keen on following their ways, for the prospect of her mind melding with the other saints that preceded her and thereby losing herself, as well as the annihilation of the whole Earth, does not strike her as exactly favorable.Unfortunately, she does lose, succumbing to her undue fate and ultimately leading everyone to their demise. To put it differently, this season establishes and shows what happens when she isn’t saved. Hopefully, come the next season, Kotarou and crew flip that fate, but, for now, her role as the puppet worked well enough.Not much can be said about Chihaya, for Rewrite gives her next to nothing thrown her way besides her introduction and the occasional joke. It’s not a major problem right now since the anime chose to focus on Shizuru and Lucia and, to some extent, Kotori and Akane. Meaning, they must delve into Chihaya’s character more in the follow-up season – lest she end up as worthless when viewing the bigger picture.This leaves Kotarou. As the main protagonist of this tale, he’s the one that brings the other girls together. He does so for their sake but mostly for himself; he wants a place where he can feel comfortable and have fun with what little youth they have left to spend. For he has always felt like an outsider of sorts just like Yoshino and the girls.As such, he forms a friendly relationship with them thanks to his kindhearted personality. Lucia beats him up, Shizuru eats lunch with him, Kotori teases him, Chihaya gets familiarized with this new place through him, and Akane looks down on him. All playful and silly.But, as is shown, intrigue is afoot. His rewrite ability (what the anime is supposedly named after) is something he keeps hidden and uses to permanently alter his person. Actual occult occurrences appear from time to time. And an odd ghost nightly nibbles on his arm.The intrigue eventually forces the group to split, and, in doing so, leaves Kotarou by himself. Coincidentally, Kagari, the nibbling ghost, begins to follow him around like a regular person. His friendship with her reminds him of the fun he had in the club with the other girls, making him long for those peaceful times once again.While helping Kagari discover herself, he meets up with Kotori for the first time since the group split. She reaffirms the end goal of the war between Guardian and Gaia (saving the world) and explains in further detail that Kagari is the “Key,” a physical manifestation of the Earth that is (appropriately enough) the key to said war.Kotarou chooses to protect Kagari, doing what he can to train with his new Wolverine-energy claw so that he can avoid the problems he encountered in the past. While not much of it is shown beyond Sakuya tutoring him and him punching the air, he slowly improves his fighting prowess. All the while, Lucia and Chihaya reappear, giving Kotarou that feeling of comfort and fun that he felt at the beginning of the season.Once everything starts to fall apart, he does his best to fight Midou but must run away instead. And, during his fight with Sougen, he loses even after overclocking with his rewrite power. That is, despite all the training he went through, it didn’t amount to much of anything. An odd writing decision but perhaps a necessary one, considering the bad end achieved.To this end, twisted magic, from the ribbon planted within his arm and the echoing song that pierces the air, consume him, turning half of him into foliage. Yet he still gets to make the final choice: kill Kagari and save everyone from death, or save Kagari and doom everyone to nonexistence. It’s a callback to the philosophical question he answered on the questionnaire in the beginning of the season.“You have power, and are discontent with this world. Tell me, do you wish to change this world? Or do you wish to change yourself?”Kotarou originally answered, “I don’t know.” His choice to save Kagari seems as though he now would select changing the world, but it’s hard to know whether that’s the case since the continuation still looms. Because, given that his answer forms the crux of his character, answering it now would mean the end of his development.Overall, Kotarou is not a horrible character. He does what he can for Kotori and the others, he trains himself over time, and he still has that lingering question to answer. He’s not a very strong character either, considering his minimal influence and the lack of focus on him as a person. Still, he’s better than the rest of the cast, and he has that second season to hopefully pick up the slack.SOUNDMuch of the music within Rewrite does not have the kick required to be meaningful.Take its opening tracks. The first one has some solid guitar playing in the beginning as well as a semi-mysterious vibe during its middle section. But, by the halfway point, the piece picks up without saying much or feeling as though it matters. The second OP is the same. Besides the background vocalists and the ending, its pop-rock composition, like that of the first OP, does not hold up as anything special.Same goes for the original soundtrack. The mysterious track that gets played at the very beginning of episode one and the relaxing flute piece are small standouts, but, in general, the OST sticks to more pop-rock and lots of piano. They simply do not do much beyond sounding right for the scene.The main ending track at least comes off as more thoughtful. The drums slightly overpower it, but the bassline near the start, a more whimsical approach (violin, piano, chimes, water-droplet-like sound-effects), the dip in the middle, more background vocalists, and the trailing whispers craft a pretty, hopeful piece that fits Rewrite’s intentions.The anime also has a handful of other EDs such as “Koibumi” and “Sunbright” which play only once (respectively in episode four which is Shizuru’s episode and episode five which is Lucia’s episode.) These have the same level of impact as the OPs and the OST. That is to say, almost none whatsoever.Voice acting ends up all right. Masakazu Morita as Kotarou is playful when speaking with everyone around him (especially Yoshino). Saya Shinomiya as Chihaya takes part in her first major anime role. And same goes for Risa Akari as Lucia whose growl exudes her personality well.But a negative shout-out does go to Kana Hanazawa as Kagari. Her occasional “screams” near the end of the season were odd and unfitting, taking away from the scenes rather than adding to the drama.ENJOYMENTI liked this one more so in the first half than the second half for two main reasons.One, the slice-of-life direction. Kotarou “saving” Tomoko from the trash, Lucia’s tsundere tendencies, and Shizuru having a dream with jumbled dialogue were fun scenes. Nothing amazing, but I was smiling and chuckling.Contrast that with the second half which prioritizes the drama and the action more. I didn’t care for Akane’s plight within Gaia, and Shizuru fighting against monsters with her dual knives didn’t interest me. In fact, my favorite moments from the second half were slice-of-life ones again. Kagari yelling “Adios!” as Kotarou runs away with her under his arm and Sakuya basically dying because Kagari belittles his exquisite coffee were much more entertaining to me than the main dish.Two, the higher character density. Despite how strange the presentation of the events is due to the Kotarou-interacts-with-them-one-at-a-time format, it was still fun to see the show switch between them now and again. Kagari is a cute character that fills the void, but, without the others around as much, it just wasn’t as fun.Now, I understand that the narrative needed to separate them almost completely. But, on a personal level, when they’re replaced by a lame Fogo-wielding villain and odd plots involving a wheelchair-bound, on-her-deathbed woman who listens to some creepy choir, I can’t say I agree with the decision.Rewrite fails to begin in the right way. The story cannot nail its different elements. Many of the characters are not treated with care. And the music does not contribute much to the scenes in which it plays. Hopefully this season’s continuation was given the rewrite memo several times over.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, while the continuation will provide more details, VN-esque interactions, the unengaging plot, and the poor attempt at a friend-based theme make this first season too problematicAnimation: Fine, nice character designs, okay artistic direction, and okay actual animationCharacters: Fine, Shizuru and Lucia are rushed, and Kotori is mishandled, but Akane plays the role of puppet, and Kotarou at least has a few experiences along the waySound: Bad, bad OPs, bad EDs, bad OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, slice-of-life moments were fun, but not much else wasFinal Score: 3/10 STORYRewrite kicks off in dark fashion. Tennouji Kotarou, a high-school boy, dies in his dream at the hands of some ribbon-twirling girl. While he fears whatever curse has been laid upon him, he does his best to live a fun-filled, worthwhile life with his other friends of the Occult Club. But, when strange happenings and sinister plans surface, he finds that his curse is the least of his worries.Discussing Rewrite now is difficult. Not due to the complexity of the material itself, for, arguably, what Rewrite presents is not. But instead due to where the story concluded. It technically gave a complete story but, perhaps obviously, not a full one.As was seen, Rewrite’s season finishes with basically what visual novels deem a bad end. For everything pretty much went wrong: all the characters died, and vegetation engulfed the world. Kagari’s final scene, where she witnesses this timeline fizzle out alongside hundreds of other timelines that have existed or are existing, also backs this scenario up.But, as can easily be looked up (and given that the second season is currently airing at the time of this writing), this series is a split-cour. And, presumably, the second half will contain the same cast, continue the plot, and uphold the overall major ideas.To put it differently, Rewrite has much more to tell – and hopefully a more cheerful ending to get to.This season, then, acts as a primer of sorts. It introduces the important cast members (so that it won’t have to later), it provides the overall dilemma (Kagari’s role as the key to salvation or destruction), and it gives some insight into its more important themes (like environmentalism and that life is better with friends).Unfortunately, the anime fails on almost all accounts.When introducing the cast and, indeed, whenever Kotarou interacted with any of them, it felt entirely too much like its visual-novel source. One after another, Kotarou talks with the girls in a singular manner to meet some hidden quota, removing the naturalness of the events themselves.This awkward event handling goes away come the middle of the season. For, what replaces the school and the introductions is the meat of the plot. Guardian defeating the monsters that Gaia summons. The lingering doomsday prophecy. Separation of the Occult Club.Transitioning from the predominantly slice-of-life fun to the drama-heavy plot was made possible by the show’s smaller hints about the characters’ powers and the gradual reveal of the not-so-imaginary occult instances.What the anime transitions towards, though, is not the most engaging. Despite the title of the anime, Kotarou’s ability does not play too important of a role, diminishing his impact on the overall narrative to that of just the guy who jokes about wanting to grope Akane’s boobs and who hides away from the whole fray within a forested region for far too long. It also does not help that both Guardian and Gaia are hardly explored let alone clash to any major degree.To its credit, Gaia’s evil plan at least makes some sense. Rather than wanting to eradicate all of humanity just because, they feel this route will keep the Earth from destruction at the hands of its most impactful enemy: humans.Which leads into one of Rewrite’s themes: environmentalism. Although, using the word “theme” may be a bit too strong since, on a large scale, the anime does not fully explore this idea. The setting is that of a city where cleaner energy takes precedence, and, as was discussed, the anchor to the whole plot relies on protecting the Earth and its bounty. But the show doesn’t target climate change, the effects of abusing resource collections, or even the importance of vegetation in general. To put it differently, it’s more a small surface detail for the story rather than a prominent, nuanced motif.It’s other major theme – life is better with friends – is one that Rewrite more actively pursues (when compared to the environmentalism). Kotarou finding solace in the Occult Club, their eventual breakup fragmenting his life, his reliving of those happier times with Kagari, and the eventual reunion they (almost all) have at Kotori’s hideaway.This thread is well-meant, and it gives the anime’s narrative better footing. Sadly, it does not firmly plant its feet due to the weakness of its foundation While the Occult Club is a place where Kotarou and the girls hang out and enjoy life together, the anime has a tough time making said togetherness worthwhile.That is, they do not feel like a tightknit group of friends because the events therein do not give them that chance. They chase after a critter, but the highlight is Kotarou grabbing Lucia’s butt and a secretary lady using a fishing pole. They scour a forest, but the odd discoveries and the eventual dive into the heavier drama take over. They conduct a series of investigations into the occult (with fruitless results), but these are gone through so quickly that they mean very little in the long run.All this says nothing about a few awkward plot points (Chihaya not immediately giving Kotarou the super-important letter that Akane addressed to him), the weak action sequences (Midou and Lucia’s duel is about the only memorable one but, even then, just barely), and the anime’s avoidance of showing more of the final scenes (Lucia squaring off against and killing Touka, Chihaya fighting alongside the monstrous Sakuya).The continuation may turn it around, but, for now, this season simply doesn’t work.ANIMATIONRewrite’s character designs are quite nice. The frilly, pink-and-red dresses that the ladies wear are both cute and detailed. Each girl has her own set of accessories: Shizuru’s eyepatch, Lucia’s white gloves, and so on. And the slightly older style for their faces – large eyes, squarer heads – don’t take anything away but rather adds to their overall charm.Artistically, the anime does about as well as it can within its setting. The school isn’t too interesting, and same goes for some of its other more mundane spots like Kotarou’s house or the local town. It can have its moments, though, like in the clubroom with its furniture and bookcases.However, given its focus on environmental impacts, the various nature shots are a welcome inclusion. The lush forests, the greenery encasing flowers, and the immense overgrowth that eventually consumes the world are where the anime is at its prettiest.To be fair, the anime has a strong use of lighting regardless of the location. The school’s hallways casting shadows from the windows or Kotori’s hideaway basked in moonlight give Rewrite a lot in the way of nuance where it normally does not have much.The CG works against the show, though. It’s used rather sparingly, but Gaia’s dinosaur monsters and Kotori’s woodland defenders stick out too much from the surrounding art to be much else besides distracting. Although, admittedly, those defenders do have an interesting green-energy effect from their designs.Actual animation remains consistent throughout the season. Earlier episodes hold up rather well during its slice-of-life segments such as Lucia reacting to Touka (their teacher and her commander) blowing cool air on her ear or Kotarou running away from an evil demon dog. A lot of sitting and speaking goes on, but, even during these scenes, reactions to the situations and other comedic bits give the anime the chance to show off some movement.Later episodes aren’t as strong animation-wise, but they do include a lot more action. Shizuru riding her motorcycle, Lucia dueling Midou, and Kotarou struggling against the flying plant-like beast are just a few of the many examples where the cast do more than just eat snacks in the clubroom.Kagari’s ribbon manipulation (her makeshift crane, her slapping) are also worth noting. Her ribbons are almost always doing something, giving her character and the scenes in which she exists a nice amount of dynamism.CHARACTERSAs it was with the story, Rewrite’s split-cour nature and, more importantly, this season’s outcome (the “bad end”) makes it tough to talk about Kotarou and the other girls. The anime still has more to tell, but it still provided character-focused content worth discussing.Most notable are Shizuru and Lucia. Unlike everyone else, they get their own episode – which can be looked at in one of two ways.The first is with appreciation. The anime understandably wants (and needs) to showcase a lot of its important plot points, but it does not have a whole lot of time in which to do so. So, when the anime squeezes their entire backstory, development, and importance into a single episode, it’s more about giving them the attention they deserve (and likewise need) rather than worrying about the execution. In other words, it’s nice that the audience got something.The second is with question. Their dilemmas are poorly explained through large amounts of exposition. Pacing has no place. Some development occurs but lacks impact. Yes, the audience learns why Shizuru always wears an eyepatch or Lucia always wears gloves, but the events themselves are not handled with the best of care. The show gives them to the audience and that’s that.Of the two approaches, the second is the more arguable since not a whole lot happens with Shizuru and Lucia after these episodes (especially Shizuru). Lucia goes to help Kotarou and the others, saying “What could possibly take priority over protecting my friends?!” An indication of how she has changed her lonely self from before. But that’s about it. As for Shizuru, she eventually abandons her spot within Guardian, but it comes as too little, too late after being sidelined for so long.Rewrite handles Kotori’s character differently, but the conclusion is roughly the same. Arguably worse.She likes sleep, money, and the great outdoors. Extra emphasis for the last one on the list since she eventually reveals her druidic nature. Unlike Shizuru and Lucia, she receives a miniscule amount of backstory. One scene about how she turned down Kotarou’s love confession (meaning the meta childhood-friend curse continues), and one scene about how her parents died in a car accident (which led to her druid powers). The latter unable to support the drama that their second deaths (through their reanimated bodies) bring.Rumored to be a powerful witch, Akane “leads” their occult club – but mostly just plays her online FPS. She apparently skips class as much as she wants but still moves on to the next grade level, indicating some level of power or influence of a hierarchical nature (which is later proven true when her family connections are revealed).Her breasts are a (joking) motivation for Kotarou to investigate the otherworldly happenings presented to them. But, normally, she’s indifferent to the whole occult thing, often lazing about whenever Kotarou brings them all on yet another failed outing.Akane (with Chihaya) inevitably parts with the group once her Gaia affiliation comes to light. Although she does not seem too keen on following their ways, for the prospect of her mind melding with the other saints that preceded her and thereby losing herself, as well as the annihilation of the whole Earth, does not strike her as exactly favorable.Unfortunately, she does lose, succumbing to her undue fate and ultimately leading everyone to their demise. To put it differently, this season establishes and shows what happens when she isn’t saved. Hopefully, come the next season, Kotarou and crew flip that fate, but, for now, her role as the puppet worked well enough.Not much can be said about Chihaya, for Rewrite gives her next to nothing thrown her way besides her introduction and the occasional joke. It’s not a major problem right now since the anime chose to focus on Shizuru and Lucia and, to some extent, Kotori and Akane. Meaning, they must delve into Chihaya’s character more in the follow-up season – lest she end up as worthless when viewing the bigger picture.This leaves Kotarou. As the main protagonist of this tale, he’s the one that brings the other girls together. He does so for their sake but mostly for himself; he wants a place where he can feel comfortable and have fun with what little youth they have left to spend. For he has always felt like an outsider of sorts just like Yoshino and the girls.As such, he forms a friendly relationship with them thanks to his kindhearted personality. Lucia beats him up, Shizuru eats lunch with him, Kotori teases him, Chihaya gets familiarized with this new place through him, and Akane looks down on him. All playful and silly.But, as is shown, intrigue is afoot. His rewrite ability (what the anime is supposedly named after) is something he keeps hidden and uses to permanently alter his person. Actual occult occurrences appear from time to time. And an odd ghost nightly nibbles on his arm.The intrigue eventually forces the group to split, and, in doing so, leaves Kotarou by himself. Coincidentally, Kagari, the nibbling ghost, begins to follow him around like a regular person. His friendship with her reminds him of the fun he had in the club with the other girls, making him long for those peaceful times once again.While helping Kagari discover herself, he meets up with Kotori for the first time since the group split. She reaffirms the end goal of the war between Guardian and Gaia (saving the world) and explains in further detail that Kagari is the “Key,” a physical manifestation of the Earth that is (appropriately enough) the key to said war.Kotarou chooses to protect Kagari, doing what he can to train with his new Wolverine-energy claw so that he can avoid the problems he encountered in the past. While not much of it is shown beyond Sakuya tutoring him and him punching the air, he slowly improves his fighting prowess. All the while, Lucia and Chihaya reappear, giving Kotarou that feeling of comfort and fun that he felt at the beginning of the season.Once everything starts to fall apart, he does his best to fight Midou but must run away instead. And, during his fight with Sougen, he loses even after overclocking with his rewrite power. That is, despite all the training he went through, it didn’t amount to much of anything. An odd writing decision but perhaps a necessary one, considering the bad end achieved.To this end, twisted magic, from the ribbon planted within his arm and the echoing song that pierces the air, consume him, turning half of him into foliage. Yet he still gets to make the final choice: kill Kagari and save everyone from death, or save Kagari and doom everyone to nonexistence. It’s a callback to the philosophical question he answered on the questionnaire in the beginning of the season.“You have power, and are discontent with this world. Tell me, do you wish to change this world? Or do you wish to change yourself?”Kotarou originally answered, “I don’t know.” His choice to save Kagari seems as though he now would select changing the world, but it’s hard to know whether that’s the case since the continuation still looms. Because, given that his answer forms the crux of his character, answering it now would mean the end of his development.Overall, Kotarou is not a horrible character. He does what he can for Kotori and the others, he trains himself over time, and he still has that lingering question to answer. He’s not a very strong character either, considering his minimal influence and the lack of focus on him as a person. Still, he’s better than the rest of the cast, and he has that second season to hopefully pick up the slack.SOUNDMuch of the music within Rewrite does not have the kick required to be meaningful.Take its opening tracks. The first one has some solid guitar playing in the beginning as well as a semi-mysterious vibe during its middle section. But, by the halfway point, the piece picks up without saying much or feeling as though it matters. The second OP is the same. Besides the background vocalists and the ending, its pop-rock composition, like that of the first OP, does not hold up as anything special.Same goes for the original soundtrack. The mysterious track that gets played at the very beginning of episode one and the relaxing flute piece are small standouts, but, in general, the OST sticks to more pop-rock and lots of piano. They simply do not do much beyond sounding right for the scene.The main ending track at least comes off as more thoughtful. The drums slightly overpower it, but the bassline near the start, a more whimsical approach (violin, piano, chimes, water-droplet-like sound-effects), the dip in the middle, more background vocalists, and the trailing whispers craft a pretty, hopeful piece that fits Rewrite’s intentions.The anime also has a handful of other EDs such as “Koibumi” and “Sunbright” which play only once (respectively in episode four which is Shizuru’s episode and episode five which is Lucia’s episode.) These have the same level of impact as the OPs and the OST. That is to say, almost none whatsoever.Voice acting ends up all right.

To be honest, this would've made a better Slice of life with powers than having the actualy story. I mean it is just terrible.

As a key fanatic, nothing disappoints me more than having to write that sentence. Despite much anticipation, Rewrite failed to deliver anything close to Key’s previous anime adaptations and this, at a high level, is why:-\tThe character build up was rushed. Key anime typically take 24 episodes to develop characters and ensure that the audience is emotionally invested in them. Rewrite dedicated no more than 6 episodes to developing the five heroines, so no one cares about them.-\tThe magic realism came too hard, too fast and was inappropriately timed. I felt like I was watching a less interesting version of...a Fate franchise anime.

Whilst this is ok if done to provoke an emotional response from the audience (ie Evangelion), I honestly didn’t feel attached enough to the characters to care about the ending.

Then suddenly shit hit and they try to cram as much reference to all the heroine routes into one episode.You have Sakuya suddenly turn to Kaiju mode, Midow controlling Earth Dragon (Even though it supposed to instantly kill the controller), Transcription, Salvation from Shizuru & Akane route (Which have different mechanic due to the different circumstance mind you) happen at the same time. All of them without any foreshadowing or build-up at all crammed into 1-2 Episodes. The conflict between the 2 organization was never brought up and didn't have the complexity it have in the VN.Oh, and the mystery in the common route, they're all gone, all the supernatural stuff are on full display from the very beginning, there are no subtlety at all.Character: 1/10, almost all was butchered. Kotarou was turned to generic perverted protagonist and didn't undergoes any meaningful development that he does in the VN. Chihaya was reduced to just dumb airhead, Lucia was just Tsundere tropes, Akane stays her common route self and goes full villain with no build up whatsoever, Shizuru and Kotori is actually quite fine but Shizuru's barely in the series (After the common route story she disappear and then appear again in the end) and Kotori just become a background character.Kagari is probably the worst one though. She supposed to be this mysterious eldritch entity feared by everyone until her true nature is revealed in Moon. In this Season 1, she was butchered into a loli-bait who're addicted to coffee (yeah that's her entire character, a not even funny gag). I'm not even a fan of Kagari in the VN, and I'm quite offended by this change. The mystery aspect about her is all gone, replaced by that unfunny gag.To give you a prespective of how bad it is, when shit hits at that final episode. I literally can't make myself care about any of the character, while in the VN I care about every single of the character. It's even worse considering I've played the VN before watching the anime, they're just too different to make me recognize that they're supposed to be the same character. It's a complete waste of Source Material.Kotarou did got a better characterization in Season 2, but the other never got the chance (for spoiler reason).Artstyle & Animation: 7/10, By when it was produced it's actually pretty decent. It did have some flaws and fight scenes aren't that good. But all of those things wouldn't be apparent if only it have a good story (which unfortunately this anime does not). I enjoy the artstyle more than Clannad but still less than Little Buster.Sound: 9/10, the best aspect of the anime, not a surprise since most of them are taken from the VN. But there are some who are remade like Phylosophiz (OP1) which became really good. The placement also are quite good, unlike Little Busters who often recycle OST, the OST in this anime are quite diverse. Truly a shame as it show how bad writing can ruin a story.Overall: 3/10. If you're interested in the premise, I recommend checking the Visual Novel. It really is Amazing, I unfortunately can't say the same about the anime. Oh, and watching the anime will spoil a lot of things in the VN, so it's not a good introduction either. mostly pointless filler.

As for people comparing with angel beats and Clannad, is nothing like either.A town with two different groups waging a war on each other in secret, and using their powers to cover it up.    One sees the world need protecting and needs a reboot without humans, the other plans to kill ""the key"" to stop the planet ends.   Through the actions of both, it just speeds up the process of each side escalating the process and some start to realize, maybe...is not the best way forward and most miraculously are members of the occult club.The characters often come from tragic circumstances, a child who blanked the memories of her from her parent\'s mind, a girl whose parents died in a car accident, our MC whose parents work for the environmental group he hates, so natural rebellion,I found it was a different sort of anime, and one I hadn\'t seen before and it had tragic endings, which I know puts some people off.   The strong underlying, protect the environment, or it won\'t protect you was clear.So we see our key drawn to our MC from a childhood event that almost killed him, sneaking into his bedroom some nights, to suck on his arm. Very creepy, just to find part of her ribbon is inside him, and that\'s why she is drawn to him.The show continues with fights between the groups, as children with special powers as a usual battle against each other, or summon beasts which drains their life span.It\'s not the sort of happy anime some won\'t, it has lies, it has betrayal, it has a friendship that turns people on their own organizations and question how they do things, and is knowing it can all be for nothing,  Underneath it has a layer of love too..     It won\'t be everyones cup of tea, but was something different. is not the best way forward and most miraculously are members of the occult club.The characters often come from tragic circumstances, a child who blanked the memories of her from her parent\'s mind, a girl whose parents died in a car accident, our MC whose parents work for the environmental group he hates, so natural rebellion,I found it was a different sort of anime, and one I hadn\'t seen before and it had tragic endings, which I know puts some people off.

All I could say is it ended with everybody accepting their fate with the characters accepting the consequences of their actions. So you could say it\'s all done and wrapped. I suppose at the very end of the anime, kagari watched as a ""lifeline"" I suppose disappear so that concludes the human race and its extinction.BUT WHY IS THERE A SECOND SEASON OF THIS? shouldn\'t it have ended already? It seem like the perfect ending to wrap up the storyOk Just watched the second season and my theory was proven to be invalid..well half of it was anyway. ', ""This anime was HORRIBLE it wasn't funny we have NO BACKSTORY TO ANYTHING why kagari killed him, we don't even know how he got his ability where the fucking shiny blue blade came from and kagari was in the anime from the very start and for 8 EPISODES she didn't appear and then MAGICALLY she pulled up AND BECAME LIKE FUCKING BEST FRIENDS it makes 0 sense the intro was shit would not reccomend watching lazy artwork the only thing good i can say about this anime is the voice acting, there is not a dub yet but the  sub voice acting was amazing...but it was  wasted on such a bad anime overall this anime sucked ass and  i wouldn't reccomend but it was  wasted on such a bad anime overall this anime sucked ass and  i wouldn't reccomend"", ""Let me begin with a reminder so that you probably won't accuse me for not reading the visual novel since y'all like to harass me if I'm not in the majority view: I do read them. But looks like I'm on a majority on this, and that's my honest review, so probably you won't need to.In terms of adaptationality - they should get a low score. Admittedly the visual novel has some conflictive contents between routes, where, if y'all made it to the second season, understand the issue: the MC should take side to whatever the heroine affiliation is. And that means the affiliation should...be justified enough.The issue is we need to combine those routes so all options and contents are at least presented in an arranged manner, and that didn't happen. In comparison, Rewrite VN has 5 routes and as I concerned, they only covered half a road for each heroine, mostly first halfs with Kotori getting 3/4 of her route covered thanks to her being the main poster girl (in addition of the ribbon girl Kagari ofc). And Chihaya, sadly, had none of hers actually covered, which basically pushed her story, and so does her butler, aside. And that route also contains vital information.And those imbalance also lead to another problem - a misleading story. In original VN I should point out that the story do balance the routes so that it gives a neutral view of the character involved. But skipping through scenes and adapting half routes basically has ruined those view, so until near the end we are basically being lead to only a single side of the story, and that's basically misleading. Not even in a good way  I should say.And let's not forget the S1 which suffers the Grisaia problem - a very short slot for the SOLs and things where it should have more highlights. When the story starts being dramatic at the first half, you know it will be rushed anyway, more if we made ourself in mind that this is a VN adaptation which basically will fast forward things. And it has been proved right. No spaces for comedy and enjoyment because we want to rush in the drama - basically suffocating the mind.Animation is so-so tbh. Maybe average idk. But compared to other studios that has animated Key products, 8bit probably had lowest rank. It's quite flat and stuttering.At least, thankfully, we at least still had original VN OST played and rearranged where knowing that Key always want to control the music department of their medias, we still get to hear the masterpieces. be justified enough.The issue is we need to combine those routes so all options and contents are at least presented in an arranged manner, and that didn't happen.

Really the cliche and ""typical Key"" part comes to the first half of Rewrite. The first half of Rewrite gives us a sorta ""get to know the setting and main protagonist"", the main protagonist Kotarou Tennouji voiced by Masakazu Morita is your typical perverted snarky main protagonist you see in Key and at first he\'s a pretty bland main character, as for the harem, they are your typical harem fair, the childhood friend of Kotori Kanbe voiced by Chiwa Saito, Lucia Konohana voiced by Risa Asaki the clean freak tsundere, Shizuru Nakatsu voiced by Keiko Suzuki, the precocious mature loli, Chihaya Ootori voiced by Saya Shinomiya the ditz and Akane Senri voiced by Eri Kitamura the occult club president and ""Ribbon Girl"" voiced by Kana Hanazawa who has a link to Kotarou and really LA had two favourite characters in Rewrite, Akane and Lucia and LA will go into detail a bit later. But for the first half, because the setting and premise makes them very cliche and stereotypical of visual novel fair, the only exceptions really go to Lucia and Shizuru as we get their character development arcs during this.It\'s where it comes to the halfway point where things really change and all these wild plot threads come together. The anime really gets it\'s foot into gear and gets to the ""one part something bigger"" LA said at the start of the review, because of this, it goes into HUGE spoiler territory, if you want the short of this, the something bigger goes into either trying to save the world or destroy it with the occult club members divided because of it, it\'s also because of this we get to see Akane and Chihaya\'s deal and reasoning to the Occult Club and this last half of the anime is why LA liked Lucia and Akane, Akane for her character development and fleshing out the plot, Lucia because she became a badass. The last half also finally brings us who this Ribbon Girl is and the obvious hints as to who she is and even she gets a bit of character development (it makes sense as this anime is based on her route).If anything the last half of the anime focuses on both the world building in which Kotarou didn\'t see from his typical highschool days as well as bring into light that his ""normal highschool days aren\'t as what they seem"". The world building does get REALLY serious to the point of ""world destruction"" and can be either a mood whiplash from the highschool hijinks or you\'ll like it taking this turn. LA however really liked how they ramped this up and as to how the main cast are ALL affected by this (and develop them at the same time).The overall problems with this anime from both sides of the plot is this, it has filler episodes with typical cliche visual novel fair, cliche characters that do evolve their characters though Kotarou is the only exception due to his ""justice"" beliefs and wanting to protect his occult club members, sure he develops himself but in a very cliche way and is a more spectator for the majority of the anime and really Kotarou is the biggest crux to this story, you either think he\'s cliche and boring or you see his struggle. The other problem is that due to the change in tone Rewrite has it has some rather inconsistent pacing which can be rushed or slower than usual.The animation is by fair from decent but it\'s not horrible either, heck even the CGI monsters are typical and wildly weird looking but not to the point of being outright horrible. The animation on it\'s character designs from the anime poster alone shows us it has some decent vibrantly bright character designs. Really the animation is all over the place even if the animation has no errors or problems to it. 8Bit is trying but it\'s obvious the animation isn\'t the best element to the anime and can be easily another flaw in Rewrite.The voice acting be all means is decent across the board, LA didn\'t really like any voice actor in general as all their vocals were typical fair, but if you had a gun to LA\'s head, LA would pick LA\'s favourite characters, Eri Kitamura as Senri and Risa Asaki as Lucia. Not much to talk about in the voice actor department..NEXT!The ending was rather depressing to say the least, LA won\'t spoil at all, but it felt like fate couldn\'t be changed for all these characters which lead to this.......""ending"". Thankfully there is a second season in the works which can hopefully work to it\'s advantage, but for a *cough* bad *cough* end it was abrupt and outright depressing.Rewrite as LA said is a mixed bag and for a visual novel adaptation by Key but NOT done by Kyoto Ani but that\'s the least of it\'s problems, Rewrite has it\'s strengths and obvious weakness shown throughout this and there isn\'t much LA can say about this adaptation, it\'s mediocre at best, poorly handled at worse and the second season announcement, LA realize why they are doing that, but for the first season, it doesn\'t help with this ""route\'s"" adaptation if the final scenes of Rewrite is anything to say.

In the beginning it sort of had my attention and the only reason I even watched it through to completion is cause I am a competitionist.On the surface this is nothing more than a sloppily delivered hit piece on the destructiveness of humans, and their overwhelming capacity for bringing nothing but tragedy. That alone is reason enough to ignore this anime.Then you have the main villain, who is essentially your stereotypical individual who retains the memories of their previous lives and see humanity as a scourge upon this earth. They are poorly...written and leave no real lasting impression other than that they hate humanity.

Saibi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21027/Saibi,"['1 sentence review: If you don\'t like dark stories and heavy theme, and cannot handle being frustrated while story develops, you will not like this movie.Similar to Sangho Yeon\'s last movie, Dwaejiui Wang, Saibi depicts a darker part of the society, such as religious cults, swindlers, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence. Throughout the movie, the viewers are left to ponder about what is right and what is wrong, and may be very frustrated by how there is not a single character that truly acts on ""justice"". I will leave to to the viewers to decide what director Yeon was trying to communicate in this movie,...but I think he did an excellent job.The art and sound isn\'t outstanding, but it does not inhibit the overall presentation of the movie. Most of the animation is 3D, which some of us may not like, and there wasn\'t really a soundtrack that stood out. As far as I can recall, the soundtrack was quite minimalistic of it existed at all, but this actually helps in depicting the cold reality of this movie; there is no soundtrack in real life lol.The character in combination with the plot was simply great. At least that\'s my opinion. If I explain why, it will be a spoiler, so I won\'t talk about it in two much detail. There are two main protagonists of this story. One is an alcoholic father who abuses his daughter and his wife whenever he comes home. Another is a priest who leads a rundown church in the village which is about to be filled up with water due to a dam project. There are multiple conflicts that involves those two protagonists, and they all come together and reach an unexpected conclusion.I ran out of energy so ill just end my review here. If you\'re fine with dark heavy story, I recommend it. but I think he did an excellent job.The art and sound isn\'t outstanding, but it does not inhibit the overall presentation of the movie.

If you\'re fine with dark heavy story, I recommend it.', 'Saibi is a movie about how horrible life can be and how horrible some people can become. It focuses heavily on the ideas of right and wrong and how far you would go to represent your opinions. Would you even destroy happiness of others to do so?The story takes place in a poor village in South Korean. In this village is a small Christian church which a lot of the villagers visit, to pray and hope for a better afterlife.  You as the audience focus the conflict between the main protagonist and this church. The main protagonist is for me the most unlikeable character...of all. He is an aggressive alcoholic who beats up his daughter and his wife as often as he can while insulting everyone who he is speaking to. The movie sadly doesn’t go into any detail why he ends up being such an asshole, it gives you hardly any background information to any of the characters overall.Saibi is a very depressing movie. It won’t give any happy moments or a fulfilling feeling. The characters that you root for won’t get their happy ending.I am not the biggest fan of letting my cheers for the likeable characters getting crushed but this movie creates such a big impact because it is just like a very sad story about the real life and I guess that’s the movies biggest advantage… its proximity to reality. Of course there are some scenes where you ask yourselfe “what?”, or “how?”, but basically the movie resembles a shitty life in some poor south Korean village, as close as you can imagine it. (as a person not living there and only hearing stories)The reason I gave this movie a 7 was because I didn’t enjoy this movie that much. It has a very slow start and the first half was for me rather boring. I first really started to like this movie after the ending, when I looked back at it and put aside all my subjective feelings about what I wanted to see and how the movie should have been.The artstyle is probably the point why I thought this movie was boring. In such a depressing reality near movie it is very important to have an atmosphere to engage the audience to the story. The Soundtrack was fine and accomplished that, but the visuals just kept pushing you away from the atmosphere with its shitty cgi looks. I have to say that I have seen worse cgi in anime, but I just can repeat myself by saying that cgi in anime looks just terrible nearly every time.So overall Saibi is a very depressive movie and definitely not for people who like happy endings. It has a sad atmosphere to it which sadly cannot grip you that much because of its terrible visuals. But despite all its flaws Saibi will definitely be a movie you won’t forget so quickly after finishing it. of all.

I first really started to like this movie after the ending, when I looked back at it and put aside all my subjective feelings about what I wanted to see and how the movie should have been.The artstyle is probably the point why I thought this movie was boring. In such a depressing reality near movie it is very important to have an atmosphere to engage the audience to the story. The Soundtrack was fine and accomplished that, but the visuals just kept pushing you away from the atmosphere with its shitty cgi looks. I have to say that I have seen worse cgi in anime, but I just can repeat myself by saying that cgi in anime looks just terrible nearly every time.So overall Saibi is a very depressive movie and definitely not for people who like happy endings. It has a sad atmosphere to it which sadly cannot grip you that much because of its terrible visuals. But despite all its flaws Saibi will definitely be a movie you won’t forget so quickly after finishing it.', ""Rate a 5English SubtitledStory-Introduction was average.- Plot was average. Nothing mind breaking was shared. If someone is throwing out lies it only makes sense that people will be effected by those lies. Where is the surprising element? Although it was a nice movie in terms of making you think. Not great but nice. Good for filling in blanks to what one could perceive as unexplained evil.-Conclusion was realistic but not memorable.ArtTrouble with computer graphics is something wont look right. In this case it was the cars in some scenes. Luckily that was mainly it....character-lacked in character background on some characters.-Characters actions were suited properly with mood.Overall: You don't need a movie to tell you what to believe. You are most likely old enough to know things can go more than one way in life. There will always be elements of good and bad in each and every one of us. What is the movie trying to teach us? That life's individual actions should always be checked regardless? Yeah, that might be true but there is no realistic way that is happening any time soon. For people care deeply on time as well as money. character-lacked in character background on some characters.-Characters actions were suited properly with mood.Overall: You don't need a movie to tell you what to believe.

"", 'Oh, Lindenfilms. Please, please, never adapt a manga ever again.Saiyuuki\'s new anime is... a mixed bag. To say the least. Not what I wanted to say considering the great quality of the manga source. Yet still, it was somehow a peak of an otherwise completely uninteresting season for anyone not interested in *insert current trending drivel here*.Let\'s start with the elephant in the room. The art. A step up from Tokyo Revengers, Lindenfilms here manage to retain the detailed character designs. As with the aforementioned show though, the animation quality is rather low. It\'s very static, almost like a PowerPoint at times. The action...is reminiscent of clicking through the dialogue of a visual novel. Let\'s leave it at a five out of ten. High because of the quality of the designs they somehow preserved.Now the quality of the adaptation from the source. The pacing was very odd. They even adapted a 13 or so page gag side-chapter as an entire episode. 24 minutes of my time wasted on a minute long manga read, which was clearly there to save budget considering the stunted visual quality. I thought ""island episodes"" were a thing of the past, but here we are with one in a cour-long show. Other decisions to stretch out some subplots and in effect skip over others took out the majority of the ""mystery"" aspect present in the manga, where the two parties were locked in a war of attrition to figure out the intentions and abilities of the other.That being said, thanks to the source it came from, the story was very good. Best part of the Saiyuuki manga, in my opinion, and a decent anime as well. A bit of yokai-infused 4D chess crossed with Stardust Crusaders-style travelling westward. You can read the synopsis yourself, weeb.The sound was some generic anime sound effects crossed with some standard background music you can find anywhere else. Although, the OP and ED were pretty great. Love some GRANRODEO.Characters are a big part of Saiyuuki and they were preserved very well here, with the perfect cast of voice actors to accompany. As the pull of Saiyuuki, it\'s no wonder they\'re good.Luckily despite the anime being heavily restricted in what it could have done, I definitely enjoyed it as a big Saiyuuki fan. I\'ll end by saying this definitely isn\'t beginner-friendly and it\'s absolutely required that you read the manga set before this arc, but it definitely is worth watching, once you catch up with the manga, that is.7/10. is reminiscent of clicking through the dialogue of a visual novel.

It\'s one of the animes and mangas that I grew up on in high schoolso it\'s safe to say that Saiyuki is close to my heart. When I heard there was gonna be another season of Saiyuki, I was happy, mainly because I was looking forward to seeing the adventures of the Sanzo party coming to an end as they recuperate from the big finale of the Blast and are finally ready to take on Gyamaoh (probably spelled the name wrong, I apologize!).But seeing some of the promotional art and the trailers for Zeroin, I was.... disappointed. Yeah, this...anime was just retreading part of the Sanzo party\'s adventure that was already done... the story of their encounter with Hazel, the western priest who is able to bring people back from the dead.That\'s it, that\'s the entire arc, with some minor differences and some original minor bits from the manga. So for that, I\'ll give the story a five.The art was pretty good, though it seems like some corners were cut but seeing that it was the same animators from Tokyo Revengers working on this show, I was okay with it. But it\'s still kinda disappointing in some ways but I\'ll deal with it. The art and animation gets a 7.The sounds were pretty good, well the music and the voice acting were good (sorry but none of the OP or ED of the other Saiyuki animes will ever top ""ID"" from Saiyuki Reload for me). The sound effects were still good and everything was crisp and clear but I just think something felt off to me. The score for Sounds is a 5.Characters, oh the characters... They were alright. All the characters still have the same personalities as they did in previous seasons, except when comparing their development in Zeroin to the Blast season, it feels like they\'ve regressed but that\'s because the events of Zeroin happens before the events of Blast. So yeah. It was interesting seeing the characters in a similar art style as Tokyo Revengers but that\'s about all I can say really... SO the score for character is 7.Finally, we got to my enjoyment, my enjoyment was very low, I mean I enjoyed some things about Zeroin but eh, like I said before, this part of the Sanzo party\'s story has already been told. I don\'t think there\'s really anything new anyone can come up with unless you just do a random one shot episode that would probably feel more like it\'s derailing the flow of the story rather than adding onto it. With that said, my enjoyment was a 5.Overall, this series wasn\'t too bad but I think I was pretty much let down by the fact that it\'s just retelling the Sanzo party\'s encounter with Hazel, which isn\'t a bad thing usually but I think I would\'ve preferred there to be a mini side series detailing the shenanigans of Kougaiji\'s party, telling what theyre up to when they\'re not fighting the Sanzo Party. That would\'ve been cool until the manga\'s story is finally complete (if it isn\'t already) and we can just get the last steps of the story adapted into an official anime.So with that being said, don\'t be turned off from this anime, because it is the first thing we\'ve got from the Saiyuki franchise, anime wise, in like 5 years and I will soak up anything Saiyuki related until the Sanzo party\'s adventure is truly done. anime was just retreading part of the Sanzo party\'s adventure that was already done... the story of their encounter with Hazel, the western priest who is able to bring people back from the dead.That\'s it, that\'s the entire arc, with some minor differences and some original minor bits from the manga.

The animation gets the job done, and there are some moments where a lot is done with a little, but it's not going to blow anyone away. More than anything else, that's the main gripe with the show. However, it should, in no way, take away from enjoyment one gets from viewing this movie.The music is a mix of haunting and surreal, with a pure 80's power ballad at the end. Again, nothing truly exceptional here, but it holds up better than the animationThe main draw here is the characters, or, specifically, Remy.

', ""This is a very laughably bad show.  Probably the most enjoyment I get from this show is pointing out everything that is just outright terrible about it. The production looks alright, with decent enough music, sounds, and artwork, but after that the quality of everything else goes down the drain.For starters, the main character is simply awful.  Cecily Campbell is perhaps one of the weakest protagonists I have ever seen in anime.  She's clumsy and useless at doing anything without the help of other characters, and largely demonstrates very weak initiative throughout series as up til now.The show largely focuses on sex...jokes to inspire comedy value.  These often involve Cecily being sexually harassed or victimized through various means. Not only does this not make the protagonist look any better, it's very stupid and overdone to the point of becoming stale.The plot for the large part does not show any more hope either. Very little is done to develop character relationships aside from the multitude of sex jokes, and what little that may resemble a backstory or plot development is often overshadowed by the huge amount of fanservice that is stuffed into this show.Fight scenes in this show are pretty unspectacular, largely due to Cecily looking extremely incompetent and clumsy during most of them. Luke Ainsworth, one of the supporting characters admittedly does get some cool points for apparently being the so-called Sacred Blacksmith, and an expert swordsman to go with that. The same pattern of him constantly rescuing Cecily from her periods of sucking in combat is pretty darn lame however, not to mention Cecily's reliance on a Demon Sword rather than her own powers to be able to do anything in combat.As I've stated, the only reason why I even bother watching this show is just to make fun of how awful it is. If for some reason you can overlook the fact the main character sucks (probably literally too, but this isn't an adult rated anime), and you don't get tired of constant jokes about how Cecily's breasts are huge, you might find something worthwhile in this show.

This could have been good, with the underlying story being highly interesting.  The whole excecution of the story is unfortunately, horrific.The flaws in the storyline mainly lie with the protagonist.  Cecily as the main lead has shown growth but this is unfortunately obscured by her annoying personality.  The way her ""talk"" sequences were done was extremely off-putting, and her jarring voice made things even worse.  This links to the lack of a logical flow to the storyline whenever it involves Cecily.  One evening, she\'s in a life-threatening battle, the next day...she\'s smiling at her potential killers (twice...same people, same arc!).  Another example is excessive, irrelevant chatter during battles.  It\'s as if her speaking has a ""freeze"" effect on the enemy (yea right!).The supporting main characters, Luke, Lisa and Aria were highly pleasurable and fun, each having rather interesting backstories as well as a good source of laughter.  They fulfill their respective roles excellently.The art was average-good, with the use of an eye-pleasing palette.  Afterall, I started watching after seeing the nice art at the Animesuki season preview.  The girls were either cute or hot, depending on age!  The monsters looked ugly but aren\'t monsters supposed to be ugly anyway?  The animation sequences during battles were very well done.

It’s about going outside of your comfort zone, seeing a new place and a new facet of yourself, and being changed by the time you return home. Anime like that is filled with believable cause and effect. And then there’s The Sacred Blacksmith.The series opens with Cecily Cambell, a newly trained knight charged with the protection of the Third Independent Trade City. She is an excitable girl, stubborn, and full of bravado. She wishes to help people, but has little actual competence. The broken sword of her family is as much a symbol of her own need to be tempered...as anything. Towards those ends she pursues the services of Luke Ainsworth, a standoffish blacksmith with little patience for Cecily’s immaturity. Joining them are Lisa -- Luke’s pint-sized and spunky assistant -- and a woman with a mysterious and tragic past named Aria.Dark events soon push them together as tenuous companions. Some figure in the shadows is collecting Demon Swords, powerful remnants from the great war that ended forty years ago. The City is threatened and Cecily and Luke have their own reasons to stand against it.The setting and plot sound clichéd because they are. This is well-trodden ground. The first few episodes promise to offset that imbalance with the characters, but sadly that’s where things start falling apart.  As our protagonists quickly find themselves thrown headlong into one problem after another, their relationships become secondary. Instead of friendships blossoming from shared duress, they just seem to ‘bond’ because they shared the same scenes.Part of the problem is in Cecily’s characterization, which puts light on the deeper issue of Sacred Blacksmith’s incorrect focus.Two of my favorite moments are when Cecily realizes that her desires and willpower are not enough to become the best she can be and then, later, when she uses that deficiency to overcome a seemingly insurmountable object. That was when the story shined and I thought “yes! -this- is what this show is supposed to be.” Cecily is our protagonist in all her inept glory. Watching her stumble towards being a skilled knight is where the show -should- be focused, how each tiny victory and tiny defeat magnifies her growth.Admittedly, there are times when Cecily sheds her armor and shows some vulnerabilities in a realistic light, but usually she merely sheds her armor so someone can joke about how wonderfully large her breasts are. I like running gags as much as anyone, but Sacred Blacksmith never really earns the right to do so. They would be complementary features in a series less problem-ridden; instead they merely draw attention to themselves and make it difficult for a reviewer to be objective and not single them out for one whole paragraph. It gets to be a little bothersome when they just pop up out of nowhere.And, no, that wasn’t a boob joke.It isn’t that the foundation here is weak, but that it’s uneven. There are some really exciting and insightful moments and yet they are surrounded by plodding uninteresting plot and cloying melodrama. It sometimes feels like a writer du jour was invited on board each week to pen the script. The story is disjointed, populated with mini-arcs that hardly elucidate the main arc at all. Challenges seem incidental. Character development unearned. And then everyone dresses up like a maid.If that last sentence seemed to come out of nowhere and confused the hell out of you, it was supposed to. That’s exactly how I felt.The most irksome problem is pacing. The main story arc only gets underway late in the series, ending up rushed. Halfway through the series our cast of characters effectively doubles, but we have no time to get to know them beyond their two-dimensionally flat personalities. Worst of all, two battles are halted in their tracks while our heroes take a break to lollygag. Oh, I mean, “work slowly at making a weapon to continue the fight after all the scene’s original tension has been obliterated”. It felt more concise to say lollygag, though.Aside from that specific editing choice, the battles are actually engaging. In fact, my greatest praise is what weaponry gets used. For all the adherence to the conventions of the swords-and-sorcery genre, there are some uncommon armaments here. I can’t describe enough how visually refreshing I found this, to see different weapons and fighting styles. Like all the other good bits in the show this too doesn’t last long, but it helps break up the “This is a fantasy; we need more swords!” mentality that plagues the genre.Overall, the art and animation is of consistently high quality. The city is a vibrant place. Manglobe’s attention to detail in creating a living, breathing setting is laudable and effective (something I personally found lacking in their earlier work, Ergo Proxy). There’s an idyllic peace in the city when all hell isn’t breaking loose and a gritty immediacy when it does. That the city is built at the foot of a mountain covered with an ominous and never-moving cloud is a fantastic addition. The characters too are well-designed and have outfits that are intriguing albeit sometimes impractical. If only they were as cool as they look.I couldn’t help thinking back to last season as I watched this. CANAAN showed how to put together a compelling ensemble cast, while Spice and Wolf II showed how to dramatically weave the complexities of a relationship about two protagonists. Both lessons are lost on Sacred Blacksmith. There is neither a group dynamic nor a fully realized pairing. The one great friendship we do have between Cecily and Aria gets lost in the shuffle of events and hardly has the emphasis it deserves.What disappoints me most is what Sacred Blacksmith fails to do. It fails to do anything exciting with fantasy. It fails to test its characters’ resolve with any meaningful challenges or anguish. It presents so much magic… yet fails to capture any wonder. Once we understand more of Aria’s nature, for instance, a wild world of possibilities opens up. How does her nature impact the way she interacts with the city she lives in? The people she calls friends? Her own inner turmoil? Instead, her character development seems to have the same tedious trajectory that everyone else has: at least one episode devoted to mental struggles, a resolution easily attained, and a sanguine outlook the rest of the time.The music is a good analogy for the show as a whole. The OP starts strong, is rather catchy, reasonably dynamic technically speaking. The score of the series is standard fare medieval fantasy (recorders, lutes, tambourines, and the like) and other more traditional orchestrated pieces that are apt, but not spellbinding. Finally, the ED is the most randomly bright and unbelievably saccharine thing you have ever heard. While I freely admit my personality isn’t morning glories and sunshine, this outro is so distinctly misplaced and just one more example of Sacred Blacksmith’s disjointed elements.So who is this anime for? More forgiving viewers, I imagine. The series isn’t high art and let’s face it: it’s not trying to be. It doesn’t want to be a humble, little fantastical tale, but a brief little epic about a lot of different things. About companions trying to help each other, faltering romance, sociopolitical intrigue, freaky monsters, black villains, sleeping horrors. By including too much its scattershot attention span shows, but if you can overlook that and the other systemic problems, want a light-hearted romp with a peppering of drama, or happen to be a fantasy junkie, you might have fun with this.If there is a second season I can only hope they strip away the extraneous parts, peel back the deeper layers, and leave what remains proudly exposed and naked for all to behold.And, yeah, that was kind of a boob joke. as anything. Towards those ends she pursues the services of Luke Ainsworth, a standoffish blacksmith with little patience for Cecily’s immaturity. Joining them are Lisa -- Luke’s pint-sized and spunky assistant -- and a woman with a mysterious and tragic past named Aria.Dark events soon push them together as tenuous companions. Some figure in the shadows is collecting Demon Swords, powerful remnants from the great war that ended forty years ago. The City is threatened and Cecily and Luke have their own reasons to stand against it.The setting and plot sound clichéd because they are. This is well-trodden ground. The first few episodes promise to offset that imbalance with the characters, but sadly that’s where things start falling apart.  As our protagonists quickly find themselves thrown headlong into one problem after another, their relationships become secondary. Instead of friendships blossoming from shared duress, they just seem to ‘bond’ because they shared the same scenes.Part of the problem is in Cecily’s characterization, which puts light on the deeper issue of Sacred Blacksmith’s incorrect focus.Two of my favorite moments are when Cecily realizes that her desires and willpower are not enough to become the best she can be and then, later, when she uses that deficiency to overcome a seemingly insurmountable object. That was when the story shined and I thought “yes! -this- is what this show is supposed to be.” Cecily is our protagonist in all her inept glory. Watching her stumble towards being a skilled knight is where the show -should- be focused, how each tiny victory and tiny defeat magnifies her growth.Admittedly, there are times when Cecily sheds her armor and shows some vulnerabilities in a realistic light, but usually she merely sheds her armor so someone can joke about how wonderfully large her breasts are. I like running gags as much as anyone, but Sacred Blacksmith never really earns the right to do so. They would be complementary features in a series less problem-ridden; instead they merely draw attention to themselves and make it difficult for a reviewer to be objective and not single them out for one whole paragraph. It gets to be a little bothersome when they just pop up out of nowhere.And, no, that wasn’t a boob joke.It isn’t that the foundation here is weak, but that it’s uneven. There are some really exciting and insightful moments and yet they are surrounded by plodding uninteresting plot and cloying melodrama. It sometimes feels like a writer du jour was invited on board each week to pen the script. The story is disjointed, populated with mini-arcs that hardly elucidate the main arc at all. Challenges seem incidental. Character development unearned. And then everyone dresses up like a maid.If that last sentence seemed to come out of nowhere and confused the hell out of you, it was supposed to. That’s exactly how I felt.The most irksome problem is pacing. The main story arc only gets underway late in the series, ending up rushed. Halfway through the series our cast of characters effectively doubles, but we have no time to get to know them beyond their two-dimensionally flat personalities. Worst of all, two battles are halted in their tracks while our heroes take a break to lollygag. Oh, I mean, “work slowly at making a weapon to continue the fight after all the scene’s original tension has been obliterated”. It felt more concise to say lollygag, though.Aside from that specific editing choice, the battles are actually engaging. In fact, my greatest praise is what weaponry gets used. For all the adherence to the conventions of the swords-and-sorcery genre, there are some uncommon armaments here. I can’t describe enough how visually refreshing I found this, to see different weapons and fighting styles. Like all the other good bits in the show this too doesn’t last long, but it helps break up the “This is a fantasy; we need more swords!” mentality that plagues the genre.Overall, the art and animation is of consistently high quality. The city is a vibrant place. Manglobe’s attention to detail in creating a living, breathing setting is laudable and effective (something I personally found lacking in their earlier work, Ergo Proxy). There’s an idyllic peace in the city when all hell isn’t breaking loose and a gritty immediacy when it does. That the city is built at the foot of a mountain covered with an ominous and never-moving cloud is a fantastic addition. The characters too are well-designed and have outfits that are intriguing albeit sometimes impractical. If only they were as cool as they look.I couldn’t help thinking back to last season as I watched this. CANAAN showed how to put together a compelling ensemble cast, while Spice and Wolf II showed how to dramatically weave the complexities of a relationship about two protagonists.

Your first impressions are this is going to be a big disappointment. Sure! it may not be the best but it's enjoyable. There wasn't any surprises, nothing new but it was enjoyable. Don't judge it by the first episode. It really gets better.Story(6-fair)Cecily Cambell becomes a knight and she is totally useless. She's all talk. She is saved by Luke Ainsworth and begs him to make a katana like his. And so their relationship begins. The story was like a Déjà vu (literally!!) But it shines! It makes you laugh, sometimes cry and...feel the feelings of the characters in the story. It wasn't repetitive nor boring. Sometimes the fillers and disappointing. There is only one filler episode but in each episode there is a part that has nothing to do with the actual plot. Either it is at the beginning or the end. Even so, it's no boring or unbearable.Art(7-good)the art was exactly like K-ON's sometimes I thought Cecily looked like Yui just in a red version(LOL). I'm very picky about my art. It has to be up-to-date and such. But the animation flaws my eyes just don't see I don't know if there aren't or if there are. But the fights, when the swords are swung and the colors it's really catchy.Sound(4-Decent)The theme song matched the anime but it wasn't special in particular. The ending son was very catchy. Also, the background music, which sometimes I don't notice is good and it goes with the whole flow of the anime and it's set date.Character(10-Outstanding)I liked Cecily's character. She's useless but she understands others feeling and her feelings are genuine. She isn't one of those big mouth girls who cant do anything or the crappy type of girl she's a strong willed character that I like.Not only Cecily but all the character's have their share in the spot light, their time to shine. You can feel the feelings of all the main characters.Enjoyment(7-Good)As I said it is really enjoyable even without much action.Overall(7-Good)Just watch the anime!!! feel the feelings of the characters in the story.

It says that there will be an adventure, but doesn\'t says that the adventure will be so boring.Story - 3/10Fantasy world with demons, demon swords and some mysterious people. Sounds very nice, but the way that the story develops it\'s everything but nice. The demons are the usual, the sword too, not to mention the main antagonist - ""the man in black""... and this is not the worst. The main characters are also the usual strong boy and weak knight, the only ""new"" it\'s that the knight it\'s a female character....The development of the story it\'s boring and predictive, and the end it\'s in my personal top 3 of worst ends.Art - 7/10This is may be the best part of this anime. The characters are drawn very well, and are easy to remember their appearances. I don\'t really like the hairdo of Luke and this funny ""armor"" of Cecilly, which seems to be there only to make the viewer lough. The special effects are the best part of the art - lighting, the spells, and my personal favorite - when Luke forges swords.Sound - 6/10This is good too. The opening and ending are nice songs, although I wouldn\'t listen to them (not my music). The seyuus are good too, although they are nothing memorable. Background music it\'s there, but doesn\'t make any impression, so it\'s good.Characters - 3/10Compared to the story characters are good, but in fact they are just stupid and boring. Female knight with big breasts and funny armor, who looks like catches sword for first time in first episode and it\'s yelling ""mamoru desu""(I\'ll protect...) all over, and over, and over again. Male blacksmith, who is kind of bad-ass, but later very emotional and deep character with good feelings. Female demon sword complaining about how bad destiny she have, and how she want\'s to live peaceful life. Those are the good, and the bad are even worse. Some ""man in black"" who at the end reveals to be kind of absolutely non mysterious guy and kind of well known bad guy. Even the secondary characters are cliche after cliche.Enjoyment - 4/10If this was my first anime, may be I would think it was good, but it\'s not and everything in it it\'s well known and I\'ve seen it numerous times before. If it wasn\'t the good art and the studio I would never end this, and now I kind of regret i did it.Overall - 5/10This is one of the worst animes I ever watched, and the worst thing it\'s that it\'s made by Manglobe, studio with animes like Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy in it\'s catalog. Really, don\'t waste your time with this, just go out and bang your head against some wall... it will be less painful.PS.Sorry if there are some mistakes, but English it\'s not my mother language :) The development of the story it\'s boring and predictive, and the end it\'s in my personal top 3 of worst ends.Art - 7/10This is may be the best part of this anime.

', ""Guard, Save, Belive. No, you didn't just misread that. These are in fact the words etched into the stone of Chester Cambell's grave; spelling errors and all. I guess he must've been a little dyslexic. After he passed away from a serious illness, his daughter and only child Cecily was left with the responsibility of becoming head of the Cambell House, which has long been a prestigious representative of the Independent Trade Cities of Housman. Having now succeeded her father, Cecily enlisted as a third generation knight to uphold the tradition and respect of the family name. However, she is inexperienced and clumsy, and often...has to rely on intimidation using her title as a knight to hide her weaknesses. Eventually, this strategy ran out of luck, and when her combat skills finally had to be put to the test, Cecily was defeated and her family's precious sword shattered. Now she must seek out the blacksmith Luke Ainsworth to forge her a new sword, which consequently thrusts her into an unexpected chain of events that threatens her life and involves her in a dangerous plot. Between this and the fact that no one can take her seriously because of her huge breasts, it's needless to say that Cecily has plenty of stress on her hands.Yes, you'll find that there's no shortage of fanservice here. In fact, it's pretty much the running gag of the entire series that everyone pokes fun at Cecily's chest. This is further explored by convenient costume malfunctions and shameless bathing scenes. Thankfully all the pandering is at least tasteful enough that it never interrupts the flow of the story. The writing carries enough wit to know when sexual humor is appropriate.At a glance, much of Sacred Blacksmith's story is standard procedure for an average fantasy anime. It has all the elements one would expect; knights, magic, demon swords, and giant mythical creatures are abundant. It even comes complete with an angsty tsundere romance. Where the series falls short in originality though, it makes up for this in its near-flawless execution. All of the main characters are rich with distinct personalities and deep backstories that are revealed steadily as the plot unfolds. The story progression also strikes a perfect balance between comedy, drama, and action; constantly keeping the viewer engaged with these three elements while the pacing never stutters or moves too quickly. Even episodes that could potentially be considered filler don't really feel like it, as they serve up plenty of character development to excuse them. Although at its core the plot is fairly familiar and straightforward, Sacred Blacksmith is not without some of its own twists on the genre either. It mixes a strangely light-hearted tone to the story with very dark and mature medieval themes, and while demon swords may sound conventional for the setting, their ability to transform into rather unassuming humans with more nuanced intentions is quite unconventional. Though it may seem like this odd mixture wouldn't blend well at first, the series somehow manages to make it all mesh together nicely.It's worth noting that Sacred Blacksmith's narrative is heavily character-centric to such a degree that traditional fantasy tropes one would expect to see in its setting are often absent or take a back seat to character development. This may be off-putting for some coming into it expecting to see a Tolkien-esque expansive epic, which is unfortunate because the series does otherwise tell a very good story for what it is, but it often gets a bad wrap from critics who may be judging it based on something that it was never aiming to be. Sacred Blacksmith takes its time to flesh out its characters and doesn't invest much in the adventurous side of fantasy or exploring its world. Although it's clear that there is still a rich history behind it from the brief glimpses we are occasionally given, nonetheless this is not the story's focus.The series' character-driven plot does often work to its advantage though, because where Sacred Blacksmith truly shines is in its ability to masterfully craft a cast of characters whose interactions make them instantly likable and constantly engrossing; never leaving the audience with a dull moment. Cecily's unwavering dedication to helping others is interesting to see being put to the test as her inability to defend others frequently conflicts with her convictions. Aria's mysterious past as the demon sword of wind hides behind the veil of her lovable friendliness, making you eager to find out more about her history and motivations. Even the most seemingly loathsome characters can become hard not to sympathize with as more of their histories and backgrounds are uncovered. It is commonplace that conflicts arise between them purely because of of how sharply contrasting and vibrant their personalities are. Luke's cold and dismissive attitude perpetually clashes with Cecily's stubborn determination, which makes for some particularly entertaining dialogue. The script is often written rather heavy-handed, but it helps establish the strong characterizations of the protagonists. Still, Cecily's melodramatic monologues can occasionally overstay their welcome.The production values of Sacred Blacksmith's art and animation are nothing short of superb as well. Character designs are thoroughly detailed depicting even the subtleties of Luke's fake eye, and animation is consistently smooth and fluid. Couple this with its epic orchestral soundtrack and solid voice acting that fits the characters and effectively brings them to life, Sacred Blacksmith satisfies in nearly every aspect of its design. All of this is accompanied with quality intro and ending segments set to some J-pop tunes. The ending in particular has a rather catchy and cute arrangement, which is further enhanced by the associated artwork with it that really shows off the impressive designs of the characters. In fact, it's possibly my personal favorite ending piece just because it's so adorable and the music and visuals play off each other so well. The intro on the other hand has a decidedly more standard song choice that isn't quite as interesting, but it more than makes up for this with a good mixture of action scenes and beautiful perspective shots of the characters. Sufficed to say, this is one of those rare cases where I found myself watching both the intro and ending for every episode because they were simply that enjoyable.With everything right that Sacred Blacksmith has going for it however, it's difficult to take notice of any of its major flaws--until it ends. Just as soon as it feels like the journey is only beginning, it is abruptly cut off. This unfortunately is Sacred Blacksmith's greatest shortcoming. By the time the series come to its conclusion, many major plotlines and ambiguities in the story have yet to be fully fleshed out. It's clear judging by the finale that there was still much more of the story to tell, but for one reason or another there appears to be no sequel coming in the foreseeable future. As of the writing of this review, you will need to consort the manga that the series is based on if you wish to delve deeper into its story. Despite this, it's not enough to break Sacred Blacksmith's strong momentum from start to finish. Even with these problems, the anime still manages to deliver as satisfying a resolution as can be reasonably expected while leaving the plot open for continuation. With its colorful cast of characters, high production values, and engaging narrative that has its own twists on the genre, Sacred Blacksmith is sure to entertain many fans of fantasy anime. has to rely on intimidation using her title as a knight to hide her weaknesses.

From what I watched, I found this anime great in many aspects because of one of the main songs (not themed) that helped create the atmosphere of the simple yet very interesting storyline concerning the Empire's General wanting to recreate a catastrophe to gain dominance using what they call the Devil's Contract.  The devil's contract seemed to use some sort of enchantment to create a...demon from a human heart.  The main villain is blamed for the death of the father of the 2nd main character, Luke Ainsworth, resulting in his will to seal away the main antagonist, Valbanill.  The main protagonist is a clumsy knight recruit following her father's footsteps.  She wants to live the glory that her father once lived defending the nation against the onslaught of Valbanill's demonspawn.  As these demons are spawned, so are the weapons of focus -  the demon swords.  There are several demon swords, and few of them even were granted the forms of normal humans who have their own stories, personalities, and ambitions.  What I found odd yet intriguing about this story is the background of Luke Ainsworth's assistant, Lisa.  This story also involves a merging of the knowledge of molded swords and folded swords such as the katana, which is the preferred weapon of Luke.  Luke is the believed Sacred Blacksmith who is ultimately the catalyst of stopping Valbanill's wishes of purging the world in to hell as it was once before purged 44 years before this story takes place.  How you assume Luke is that Sacred Blacksmith is the use of prayer contracts to create powerful elemental (ethereal) katanas only capable of 3 successful slashes.  Some negative aspects of this production involve silly and unnecessary insertions of fan service surrounding the main protagonist, Cecily Campbell.  This production is however shorter than most only planned to span half a season and for it's short-lived airtime I personally felt it was worth watching.  The story being great and all however may be bumped by the slow progression of the first few episodes.  Overall, this anime deserves a 9 overall.  Happy watching to all those interested!!! demon from a human heart.

Luke is the believed Sacred Blacksmith who is ultimately the catalyst of stopping Valbanill's wishes of purging the world in to hell as it was once before purged 44 years before this story takes place.  How you assume Luke is that Sacred Blacksmith is the use of prayer contracts to create powerful elemental (ethereal) katanas only capable of 3 successful slashes.  Some negative aspects of this production involve silly and unnecessary insertions of fan service surrounding the main protagonist, Cecily Campbell.  This production is however shorter than most only planned to span half a season and for it's short-lived airtime I personally felt it was worth watching.  The story being great and all however may be bumped by the slow progression of the first few episodes.  Overall, this anime deserves a 9 overall.  Happy watching to all those interested!!!"", ""The Sacred Blacksmith is a decent anime that I really enjoyed; partially due to a load of crap I happen to be watching, and also I had really low expectations of this show. When I heard of that this series is gonna get animated, I went ahead and read a few chapters of the manga and frankly, the story isn't anything impressive. Any many other similar works becomes worse when animated so yeah... that is what I've expected out of this series.Now, I don't remember the studio Manglobe nor remember if I've watched any series from that studio, but it turns out that Manglobe does...a damn fine job with it. Even if the manga wasn't good material, I'm glad they stuck with the pacing of the story instead of going inventive, which usually sucked. The colours are brilliant and the animation are crisp; and for once, the action scenes are actually pretty good. I don't know how a series like this got that kind of budget but hey, I'm not complaining.I didn't think much of the story but I really love the characters, even Cecily, who I thought was irritating in the beginning for being really useless, but her really cool action scenes towards the end made up for it. The ending of the story feels like one of those last minute addition to create a finale (I don't know because I didn't get that far in the manga), and though the main villain is a pretty crappy character the ending ain't too shabby.A fairly nice series to watch if you're a fan of medieval settings, like me.Plot/Concept: Fairly GoodStory Style: Great!Audio/Visual: Great!Value: 7 a damn fine job with it.

Her armor got shattered so of course! We\'ll see her breasts. The girls are ALWAYS talking about boobs and Oh God, why?It\'s pretty much pathetic.Another issue is the design of Luke,  he looks like a mashed up potato,  and there\'s a serious matter about his left eye.The soundtrack is just....  bad, I\'ve seen many animes which you can\'t ignore the soundtrack, but not this one.Bottom line: Not recommended, I gave it 6 because I can\'t ""admit"" I\'ve seen such a bad anime like this, it can be for little girls who don\'t care to see some nudity. fight each other, it\'s just people who meet the main character and stay for some episodes and then go.The main character, Cecily is an annoying person who is weak and always lecture about boring things.Luke, is boring as well, he doesn\'t care about anything but his goal.There\'s a major issue in this anime- the nudity which comes out of the blue.It looks like the creators had no idea what to do now so let\'s just put nudity!

Yes, it starts off pretty slow and not all that interesting, but around episode 7 it picks up the paste. I was just about to drop this anime last night, until I decided to watch the new episodes. Witch by the way caught me off guard. The story line seems to get more and more interesting as the episodes go on. And NO, its not based on Cecily's breast like the guy above me says.

Check it out and don't give up on it so quick."", ""“The Sacred Blacksmith” is what happens when You create something that should be mentioned in the Britannica Dictionary under “subpar”.If there ever was an anime that has little to no originality, uses cheat tricks to force an emotional reaction in a viewer and has barely any logical sense plot wise… this is it.Apart from very few exceptions we witness the plot from the perspective of Cecily Cambell - a young, a bit naive, idealistic and energetic knight. Despite having the heart to protect people of the city she lacks the skills and mental fortitude (at least in the beginning) to make difficult decisions. After losing...her father’s sword in a fight and witnessing the power of a katana he pesters Luke Ainsworth - a skilled blacksmith with an attitude problem, to forge her one. After being trusted with one of the demon swords her life takes a pretty wild turn.The main cast consists of 4 forgettable cardboard cut-outs that have one trait each that was turned to a pseudo-personality. Luke is a cold, reserved prick, Lisa is a mascot with a pretty poorly hidden secret, Aria is a sword with a life crisis and Cecily is an annoying, energetic, loud mouth with deficiency in the brain department.There is a silver lining. Despite the character themselves being pretty boring and subpar their interactions, especially Luke and Lisa, and Luke and Cecily, are rather well written. Not good but passable. At least there was effort put into writing it and the clash of personalities. Shame they didn’t extend that effort into showing how the characters grow on each other. One episode they have a pretty nice banter but still keep their distance and in the next Luke is spilling his guts to Cecily about his past. I call that lazy. I get that exposition dumps are a standard in anime and organically showing growth and development is hard but damn… this is taking laziness to a whole new level I thought was reserved only for the likes of Sword Art Online.I will give the writers this: There is visible growth in Cecily. During the 12 episodes she grows as a person and as a knight. Yes, it’s not much but it is still progress. Something a lot of anime protagonists don’t really get. This shows the writers weren’t total hacks and given enough time they probably could create something worthwhile.But that’s about it. The rest of the writing is mediocre at best. The dialogs are lazy and full of cheap tricks to make viewers care, the fight choreography is practically non-existent and a pretty interesting aspect with demons, demon weapons and pacts is treated as an afterthought for most of the show.The show feels more like a fantasy slice of life with a little bit of action than anything else. Despite being called “The Sacred Blacksmith '' the whole blacksmith thing and Luke himself are pushed to the background up until the last 3 episodes.I truly don’t recommend this show. It’s boring, predictable and lacks anything original.

The story centres around Cecily a female Knight who not particularly good at being a Knight. She is saved from certain death one day by Luke (the sacred blacksmith) who has the ability to forge magical Katana swords in the heat of battle.Lets get one thing out of the way first, the English dub is awful. Cecily’s voice grated on me so much I switched straight to subtitles. Most of the voice cast sound like they have just walked off the set of high school musical....Avoid the dub.The story itself centres around a town which Cecily protect and the rising demon hordes that are causing trouble around the town. Luke is often called upon to save Cecily as she so inept and then like a sulky teenager disappears back off to his workshop with his apprentice Lisa.This is only a short series so you expect it to stick to the main story which centres around the revival of a demon god and how people are entering into demon contracts effectively turning themselves into demons. It doesn’t. Instead we get the ridiculous Charlotte Frobisher story arc as well as an entire episode dedicated to shopping (seriously). We then have supporting characters like Aria who is a demon sword who can also take human form (seriously). This is never fully explained so you just have to go with it.The character designs are good but nothing amazing and the battle scenes are pretty average as well. The show also suffers from the –I’m going to do a speech so all fighting stops problem. Enemies also seem happy to let Luke forge his Katana mid battle.Cecily as a character is quite shouty and annoying while Luke spends much of his time sulking and trying to avoid Cecily.  Its only in the last four episodes do we get some character and story progression.  We find out why Luke has a face like a slapped arse and also see Cecily progress from being useless to reasonably competent as a knight.The series has some decent ideas like the forging of magical swords but they are poorly executed. The story is not particularly original, couple this with some rather annoying main characters, the series pushes the boundaries of your patience.  There is some mild nudity which seems a bit out of place and the constant referencing of Cecily’s ample chest wears thin after the first episode. The animation quality is fairly fluid and sound is ok with a very cheesy closing song which sticks in your head.It’s difficult to recommend Sacred Blacksmith if it wasn’t for the final four episodes this series would have been a total waste of time. The series also doesn’t have a conclusive ending and you feel there is much more of the story left to tell which makes it all the more puzzling why so much time was wasted with side stories at the start of the series.

I really enjoyed watch blacksmith, it is one of the recent animes i have enjoyed watching, as all other new animes are made just to show bras and panties so ""pervs"" would atleast watch them, and that makes their t.v rating go up even though they have no base story, or a really shitty one. But blacksmith isn\'t one of those animes, it isn\'t ecchi at all, theres comedy, and a bit of romance, but its mostly an action based-slice of life anime, with considerable...strong story. One of the best things about this anime is that art. It is very colorful, and one of the best ""new"" animations i\'ve seen. In the end its your choice to follow all the negative reviews under mines, or give it a chance. I say GO FOR IT! its awesome! strong story. One of the best things about this anime is that art.

I say GO FOR IT! its awesome!', 'When you think of blacksmiths, you think of large, strong men who make swords, horseshoes and other appliances for a medieval world. What you normally don’t see is a kid doing all this with a smaller kid as an apprentice. That’s what happens when you watch this one.The characters seem not fleshed out enough, and we barely see a back story to any of them except Luke and even that happens a little to late in the game. By that time, the characters felt a bit stale, and hard to relate to. In a 12 episode show, they shouldn’t be dinking around like they...do, mostly bringing up jokes about Cecily’s breasts and her strange breastplate that seems to be way to close to her to not of been molded on her breasts. And what’s with her mother even bugging her about it? Really? It’s not enough that the whole town talks about her breasts but her mother too? I’m not fond of how this show seems to move a bit too slow this show gets, but once it gets to the point, it is pretty good, and then it ends... Really, they spend more time talking then fighting and nothing really gets said.It seems that everything leans up to the climax but many of the things are lost in the first part. For instance, the only time I find out that that Luke has a fake eye is to the second to the last episode. If it was a big thing with the story then it should be said earlier in the story along with Luke’s story. I feel like I only got half the story through the show and I wish there was much more to help me see the lines. It just screams second season to and from what I know of, there isn’t one.The artwork is pretty nice though some of the characters look familiar to other shows. Little Luke reminds me of Sora from Kingdom Hearts and I can pick out little things hear and there that felt like rip offs. And don’t get me started on the creepy monsters that attack. It plays out mostly like a monster of the week style though the story makes it hard to watch them out of order. The comical parts in the art seem forced in whenever we have a serious point and trust me, that happen way to much for this show. I wish they chose a side, ether comical artwork with comical plot, or serious artwork with serious plot.The voice acting is pretty good but I am a little put off by one or two of them.

From reading the short description on Netflix I concluded that this would be an adventurous series with the possibility of a good plot.  I was wrong…very wrong.  I’m going to try to tell you why NOT to watch this series and keep it short at the same time.I am not sure what the plot is or if it ever existed at all.  The plot is supposed to be continuous from episode to episode but, it is impossible to tell how the plot reached the current point...from the previous.  It seems like somebody wrote a series of short random events modified and arranged them into a short story board putting forth as little effort as possible.Character development is a far more serious problem than the plot itself.  Characters make leaps and bounds forwards in one episode then might regress twice as fast back in the following episode.  Or you wonder where the characters came to a certain conclusion and can only conclude that it was in between the episodes when there was a massive plot jump.  This makes it even harder to understand or relate to the main character.  The character all seem to be drawn the same as well and then modified.  Copy and paste is not working in their favor.  (I was wondering if this was just me but then I saw it in somebody else’s review as well.)Theme; tits.  I’m sure this is the theme…every episode seems to finish off talking about Cecily Cambell’s breast size.  One episode has entire dinner scene talking about Cecily’s boobs… as well as a pool scene and many others.  Boobs are actually shown in this series which does nothing to enhance the show.  It is a poor and failure of an attempt at comic relief.Dialogue is horrible and when it is not horrible it is so absurdly cheese it is intolerable.  Music enhances anything and everything that is cheesy and is vastly overused.  The animations are possibly the only redeeming fact about Seiken no Blacksmith.If you still want to watch this series after reading this review be my guest, but I do not recommend a 4/10 rated series to anybody.

The series is more about the main character's daily life and interaction with other characters of the series rather than the main character itself. They focused too much on the main characters that the story was neglected and at the end, it was rushed to complete the series. If...there were just one more episode, I believe that the anime could've ended on a nicer note.Art - Like most of the anime that are currently being released, character designs and animations for them are pretty good. I particularly liked the designs of the houses like they were in medival times. Other than that, nothing much to say here.Sound - The only music worth mentioning is the opening and ending songs. Other than that, I have no impression of any noticable music really. Which is also one of the main flaws of the series. Although fights need not necessarily require music, it does add to the flavour and feel of the situation at hand.Character - Character development is fantastic. The main character does grow over time and slowly gets people to acknowledge her, though of course it's not like she was ostracized, bullied or looked down upon by the community in the first place, just that she wants to prove a point and she did. The only flaw is that we don't get to actually see the character become strong since everything was rather rushed towards the end.Enjoyment/Overall - Aside from the flaws I mentioned,  I rather enjoyed this series and I do hope that a season 2 will be made.

I have to admit with this anime I was not expecting much n my god...even with no expectation I was disappointed!Ok well let me explain, this anime suffers from three main problems. And two of these I see occur in most short anime series.First it's about a clumsy knight (Who seriously need to invest in a bra, n whose animators need to actually decide what size and shape her breasts actually...are.) named Cecily Cambell and her quest to get a new sword from a blacksmith named Luke. All the while she must protect a demon sword that can take human form named Aria. There is also a god-like demon that is tied into Luke's past that Cecily tried to unravel.No this! ...I love this! While this does not make it the anime of the century is does get very interesting, the characters could use a bit more development, but I love this. What happend to Luke? Why are his swords so amazing? (yes, that's what she said, hardy har) What is the secret behind Aria? And there are so many things that come up in the anime that are amazing that can be expanded upon.....until.....we run into the first problem with our anime....There are side plots and filler episodes that go nowhere and do nothing for the show and are rather quite boring...we have our obligatory shopping episode. Then a side plot come the hell out of nowhere where some illegitimate princess shows up and tries to prove who she is, but her father won't listen and why!? Just why!? Why do we care? Why are you here?What does this have to do with demons and swords!? Nothing! It serves no purpose and is just boring!Then our second problem, and Hell Girl suffered from the same thing...the main story doesn't come in until like the last four episodes! Only then do we find out about Luke's past! Only then do we find out what our villain's motivation (or lack there of) was! And normally I wouldn't mind this...if the rest of the anime wasn't useless filler! There are bits of interesting plot sprinkled throughout only held together by boring subplots only to get slammed with the heavy stuff at the end.And finally our last problem though one that I guess could be excused, but nothing is explained! not the original novel and manga (both I have not yet read) are still going. So yes some animes such as Deadman Wonderland, if the original material is not yet completed, rather then just going off on filler (like there wasn't enough in this series already) they will just end and go then continue with another season once they have more material to go on. But at least Deadman left things off ominously, this....it just ends!

So yes some animes such as Deadman Wonderland, if the original material is not yet completed, rather then just going off on filler (like there wasn't enough in this series already) they will just end and go then continue with another season once they have more material to go on. But at least Deadman left things off ominously, this....it just ends! Not even leaving you room to think what might happen next.The manga or novel might be worth a look at if they just stick to the main story, this anime however, it won't hurt you to just pass on to the next."", 'This is a review of the DVD version of ""Sacred Blacksmith"" (Seiken no Blacksmith) released by Funimation in 2011. It was viewed with English voice overs.""Sacred Blacksmith"" falls into the category of fantasy action adventure with some minor elements of comedy.Parental Advisory:The age rating is listed as 17+.  However, this is absurdly high - the show\'s content does not merit this high of an age rating.   Two or three of the episodes include some very brief scenes with female topless nudity.  There is combat violence in several episodes, but it isn\'t overly graphic.   As a result, this show would...likely be suitable for teens 13 and up.Story: 7/10The show is comprised of 12 episodes.  During the episodes, several characters are introduced including the main protagonist Cecily, the blacksmith Luke, his assistant Lisa, and a few others from the city.  Along the way, the world\'s history is revealed bit by bit.  Without giving away too many spoilers, there was a previous war involving a demon and the repercussions of that are still being felt.  Some of the main characters are directly related to the events of that war.Much of it is fairly typical for a fantasy story, but there were a few interesting elements introduced related to the blacksmith and how he is able to magically craft weapons with his assistant.  Some of the ultra-powerful demon swords can also take human form which is explored in a few episodes, but is never fully explained.Near the middle of the series, a new set of characters are introduced almost out of the blue.  At one moment they a supposed to enemies, and then suddenly they are allies, and the sudden shift doesn\'t make much sense.  A few episodes later, they are whisked away.  The few plot developments and pieces of information that are introduced by these characters could have easily been provided in other ways, and leaving these characters out of the series entirely would have led to a stronger series, and provided more time to focus on some of the other characters.The series ends on a cliffhanger, which seems to indicate that a 2nd series was planned.  However, I have found information about this, or when it might be released.Characters: 5/10Visually, many of characters in ""Sacred Blacksmith"" are more normal in size and appearance compared to those in other modern anime titles.  Most of the females are especially demure, and the males aren\'t overly muscular.The main character, Cecily Cambell is an overly inept knight.  She is a very weak character to serve as the main protagonist, and this is a drag throughout the entire show.  Through the series, some other characters make jokes the size of her bosom, but these fail to be humorous, partly because her breasts aren\'t really that big, at least not compared to characters in other modern anime.  Her breasts are shown briefly in a couple of episodes in an apparent attempt at humor, but the scenes barely register on the funniness meter, and could have been left out.Luke, the blacksmith, and his assistant, Lisa, are more intriguing characters.  Some of the key plot developments relate to these characters.  I would have liked to have seen them involved in more scenes instead of Cecily.The main antagonist seems overly cliché.  He\'s presented as a mysterious figure in a black cloak, before his real identity is uncovered.  However, it was really obvious from the beginning who it was for those paying attention.  The lack of originality of this character is a bit of let-down, as are his motives.Other characters are introduced such as guards and key members of the city government, but they don\'t get much screen time.  Rounding out the characters are a couple of living weapons one of which gets a fair bit of screen time, but not enough to fully explain their background.Art / Animation: 7/10The animation in ""Sacred Blacksmith"" was good overall, but not spectacular.  It seemed to use a lot of recycled art through the series.  For example, scenes of the city show an ominous, yet never-changing volcano apparently spewing a large ash cloud over the city.  This erupting volcano is never mentioned or explained.  I liked the blacksmith\'s magic weapon forging scene, but that too was essentially recycled a few times with few or no changes in later episodes.Some of the character designs are a bit basic but nice, and thankfully they were not as over-the-top as some characters found in other modern anime.  The outfits evoked a fantasy atmosphere, and their style had a simple elegance.  I found Aria\'s outfit to be quite lovely and rather fitting for her wind-nature.A few of the combat scenes were enjoyable to watch, and they seemed to capture elements of the action rather well.Sound / Voice: 7/10The soundtrack and background music used an orchestral piece which was quite good.  Other sound effects, such as during the combat scenes, were fine.  The English voice acting seemed ok.Enjoyment: 4/10While I enjoyed parts of this show, it really wasn\'t that enjoyable to watch it.  At times, it seemed like the story could be quite good, and it had the potential to set things up for a serious fantasy adventure, but then it would shift gears and try to inject comedic elements that didn\'t really work.  A big part of that problem is due to the main character Cecily - her ineptness more or less forces her to be used as comedy relief for many of her scenes.  It\'s like trying to inject a character from “Slayers” into “Record of Lodoss War” - the results are predictably bad.Final Verdict: 6/10I really wanted to like this show.  It had a cool fantasy setting with a very interesting backstory, some enjoyable combat scenes, and a few characters that were intriguing like the blacksmith.  However, the unimaginative villain, the sudden introduction of extra characters, and the focus on Cecily end up derailing this story, never allowing it to climb out of mediocrity. likely be suitable for teens 13 and up.Story: 7/10The show is comprised of 12 episodes.

Thus, I went into this series not only unaware of what it was, but with no expectations either way.As I said, though, I watched the first episode on Netflix (which has only dubbed anime) and enjoyed it well enough; I liked the character designs, the voice acting was alright for a dub (except Lisa whom I wanted to throttle after 3 lines) and it seemed like it could develop into a decent story, so I decided to continue. However, fate intervened, and I was unable...to get to netflix the next time I wanted to watch, so I looked it up online and found the original--and OH GEEZ was it good comparatively. Especially the voice acting:Sound: 10 AMAZINGWhen the obnoxious girl from the English dub was replaced by Toyosaki Aki going to the original after one episode, I nearly exploded with joy (she is my personal favorite Japanese voice actress). Besides that, Luke was now voiced by Okamoto, Nobuhiko (whom I recognized, having just finished watching To aru Majutsu no Index). So I will not deny that my love for the voicing and music are indeed partially due to the sub-par dub counterparts I was originally exposed to. Even so, the voice acting is incredibly strong in this series, from the entire cast. The theme song took a few episodes to grow on me, but it certainly did, and it is now one of my favorite anime themes. Toyosaki Aki singing the ending theme won me over after the first 3 lines.Story: 7 GoodThe story does fall into a few stereotypes and uses a few stock characters, but they\'re not too distracting and the rest of the story has some interesting ideas to it. The idea of the object/not-quite human character struggling with questions of their existence is nothing new (Data from star trek, even Hatsune Miku in the song ""The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku"" explore similar issues) but the story offers enough of a twist on this admittedly cliche but interesting plot point to make it acceptable.Art: 7 GoodNot too much to say here, the art wasn\'t super amazing but it was by no means bad, and each of the characters were distinct and memorable.Character: 9 GreatThis mixes with what I said about the story--which is partly because most of the story is exploring the characters and their pasts. All of the protagonists, and even some of the minor characters, are developed surprisingly well and enjoyably, especially Lisa. (I won\'t go into detail there to avoid spoilers)Enjoyment: 8 Very GoodThis would have been a 9. It was almost a 10 actually, until the end. I won\'t give away WHY but the ending was....infuriating. I found out why later--the series, like many anime, is based off a light novel series, and of course the anime finished before the books did, and so the anime writers had to slap together an ending. There are some times where this is successful, at least to a point, but this NOT one of them. Little is resolved, the final battle is frankly STUPID and the ending left me sitting there saying ""what, THAT\'\'S HOW IT ENDS?!?!?!"" I still enjoyed the rest of the series, but such an awful ending could not let me leave it with a perfect score.Overall: 7Despite the atrocious ending, this anime is still more than worthwhile I think. I thoroughly enjoyed following the growth of the characters, and as I said, the amazing voice acting. Though there is little hope, as this wasn\'t the most popular anime, I do wish they would make another season to give it a respectable ending, but nonetheless I do not regret seeing this anime, and still would recommend it to anyone. to get to netflix the next time I wanted to watch, so I looked it up online and found the original--and OH GEEZ was it good comparatively.

This was one series that deserved to be stretched to double the amount of episodes it has. Sure, the series was rushed but it has more character development than any other long anime series I've seen. Although short, they showed a lot of character development in the main characters (Particularly Luke Ainsworth). I admit that I am a fanboy when it comes to Medieval setting and Holy references. But many modern day anime lack what this anime has. Jealousy is a very common factor in modern day anime and I saw no hint of jealousy here....Seiken no Blacksmith is one of those series where I've had a ton of enjoyment and will always by one of the best Medieval sword themed anime I've seen.

A production of FUNimation Entertainment, this series could have been much, much better than it was.STORY 3/10The story takes place in the Independent Trade Cities of Housman, where we meet the main character Cecily Cambell, a young, obnoxious, naïve girl who has decided to become a knight and continue her father’s bloodline even though she has no type of skills or talent. She is entrusted with protecting the demon sword of the village and has a virulent relationship with Luke...Ainsworth, the blacksmith. Together they must also protect the city from the threat of Valbanill.ART 8/10The artwork in this anime was lucid and colourful. The setting and the characters were reminiscent of an RPG game. Because of the different blend of colours, it made watching the anime easy on the eyes but dull on the brains due to lack of story progression. Nevertheless, the art was a positive highlight of the series.SOUND 5/10The musical scores in the anime were pretty mediocre and the woman’s voice in the opening piece gravitated towards the annoying side especially towards the end of the tune. The ending song was pretty cute, even the images were adorable. In this area, there was nothing that made it stand out.CHARACTER 4/10The characters in this anime were typical of most animes, the annoying girl, the apathetic guy, the cute whiny child and the whimsical girl. None of these characters grow or display any change from the beginning of the series until the end and this was largely as a result of there being no real progression with regard to the story and hence the characters were unable to display any sort of transformation.ENJOYMENT 3/10The first episode displayed some promise but as the series progressed, the action and story development was limited to the first three episodes. Other characters entered into the mix that did nothing in advancing the plot but only served to kill a couple of episodes. The series lacked depth, a really good story and proper character development as well as proper closure.OVERALL 3/10This series did not have much going for it, only the brilliant artwork. The story was lost before it was ever found and the characters did not progress either. This series would have worked if they had stuck to the original story which they had started with in the first episode but they went off track by introducing other characters whose presence did not serve any vital purpose in the anime. If you are looking for light entertainment with little or no type of brain activity, then this anime is for you but I would personally not recommend that you waste time with this one even though the animation is pretty nifty and the first episode provides the genjitsu for you to continue watching on further.

The series essentially divides itself into arcs focused around various conflicts that Cecily and Luke encounter with a different situation pertaining to the two said scenarios. One of the show's biggest weaknesses proves to be the choice in which it follows its plot direction. The series has you believing at first that the plot would be focused around Cecily and Luke unraveling the schemes of the mysterious man until...it tosses in the element of the Demon Swords. This brings about the arc involving Charlotte which while a touching one to look into, it doesn't do anything in advancing the other critical plot development involving the mysterious man.Adding to these complications with the plot are some unexplored plot elements such as why some Demon Swords like Aria are able to take human form and preparations for the battle against the powerful demon being feared. Pacing also seemed fairly rushed towards the show's second half leading to unnatural developments with plotting and characters due to the lack of proper buildup on such elements such as the revelation of the mysterious man and improvements in Cecily's swordsmanship. In addition to these issues, I was getting quite turned off by the show's cheap attempt at getting humor off nods to Cecily's bust size. While fan service isn't rampant in Sacred Blacksmith, hearing the characters tease or mention Cecily's breasts did annoy me at points.What does work for the series are the character relationships and developments witnessed throughout Sacred Blacksmith. The series does a decent job in fleshing out prominent characters in regards to their backgrounds and their personal beliefs. The series also establishes character relationships that mesh well enough to have you care for the bonds that said characters have for one another such as Charlotte and her posse from their struggles for acceptance by Charlotte's kingdom and the unique wielder-weapon bond between Cecily and Demon Sword Aria. Visuals also look decent on the eyes sporting clean details and vivid colors in regards to scenery, as well as good-looking character designs like the attractive human form of Aria and the various demons that are slayed throughout the series. Animation often consists of static shots during battle scenes, but has its moments of great animation during sword fights involving major characters and the sword forging spell used by Lisa and Luke.The Sacred Blacksmith is far from being the best anime one will come across due to its shoddy direction in plotting and rushed pacing in the show's second half that hamper developments and elements within the series. However, the character bonds and the individual developments of said characters do help alleviate these major flaws to a degree.

It mean, the fanservice is definitely better than Love Ru darkness, but man, it doesn\'t really fit this kind of genre anime.- The pacing of the story, or the plot line is pretty slow. Many things tend to be digress into the build up of relation, learning about their world, seeing cute interaction between...characters (although, since i find the female protagonist annoying, it kinda ruins it for me), and doing things that digress from moving the plot forward.- Despite being an anime with genre like Action, Adventure, Fantasy anime. There seems to be alot of slice of life stuff going on here. And that\'s not what i came for. The Male protagonist is pretty badass.

Most of the reviews on this anime are against it, i guess my opinion is different since i liked it, not loved it but i liked it.Plot:The plot is original i assure you and though its not a strong one it does satisfy the watcher. Theres not much to say on the plot, it focased more on the building of the characters than the enemy at hand but it didnt make it bad in any way.Art: The art was good, it was clear and descriptive and...yet still easy to watch.Sound:The sound was average, not bad at all.Characters:The main character were what the anime's episodes focased on, you may be thinking duh but what i mean is the anime made most of the episodes about their growth and development and bits of their past. The main enemies were not very main at all, although they were meant to have a place in the plot they didnt. They had maybe 3 or 4 episodes about them in general and didnt really tell us what happened to them afterwards.Overall:The plot was not what it was supposed to be but it was fine although i would have liked to see more about the antagonists and less of the protagonists.

There\'s an anime I adore, World Trigger and one of the protagonist there is weak af, but in there it\'s handled properly. He doesn\'t smile like a moron when his weakness gets in the...way of accomplishing things. He works and he takes his weakness seriously, he takes it into account and treats it severely because he knows people might die if he didn\'t. This bitch is all sappy about being saved 3 times in a row by a civilian after mouthing off and mouthing off that she\'s a knight. Disgusting. And that\'s just from the first scene! You know what\'s worst? It turns from trash to shit every episode!From the first episode alone you see what kind of idiot this girl is.

There were very few ecchi scenes and they only happened in the first half of the season. Other than those few scenes, there was no real fanservice, not even a single jiggle. On the opposite side, if you hate ecchi, then this tag shouldn't cause you any trouble other than the very few scenes of randomly showing breasts.Story:The plot twists with the past were pretty decent...and the politics in the matter made plenty of sense. The story was probably the best part of the show that actually made it enjoyable.Art:The combat animations seemed strange and wonky at times and didn't feel very natural. Combat was slow, short, and not too entertaining. At times the mouth movements were very chompy when talking (at least for the dub).Sound:The volume levels were pretty bad especially in the first episode. Character voices don't stand over the background sounds or music making the characters harder to listen to. On the bright side there was one pretty decent song in the soundtrack that had an epic fantasy vibe.Character:The 2 major main characters got on my nerves more often than I'd liked throughout the story. They're both bratty, rude, and senseless towards each other. I never ended up liking Cecily but the blacksmith Luke did become more enjoyable after his backstory was revealed. Lily was adorable.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this enough to keep myself occupied with my time.

Ill just skip to what I have personally experienced watching this show. Its kinda mediocre though the story's plot is great and all it wasn't really convened properly in the anime feels like every episode there was that dull moment to it. I was expecting more of like Full adventure action romance but i guess i expected too much of it. Has potential. though its best to just read the LN or Manga "", ""First of all, if you are new to anime, don't listen to what I'm about to write. Just download it and you might actually enjoy it. However, for people who have watched anime for multiple years/decades, I simply cannot recommend this series to you.Why? Because it's an amalgamate of every trite trope in the anime industry, set as generic fantasy. Nothing original really happens until the whole Lisa/Lisa thing (which is in the last 3 eps of the series), and no one EVER leaves town. There were times in which I liked the plucky, simpleminded, crusader-of-justice Cecily, but there were also times I couldn't stand...her hackneyed rants. Luke can easily be seen as the archetypal male tsundere character, so nothing much from him either.

However I feel like while its no masterpiece, its certainly a great anime that's worth a watch if you've got the time. The heroine seem to drag our hero on her adventure despite his protests. I found it amusing that when the heroine asked our hero for a sword he politely told her that if she doesn't have the money she can't have one.The main thing that sets this anime apart from all the other anime out there is actually...the thing that I have the biggest problem with, not to say that this isn't enjoyable its just that I feel like it is done a bit too much in the anime.The anime has a running theme that no sword is unbreakable, which is true, unlike what other anime's like Bleach would have you believe, a real sword requires careful cleaning and constant repair to maintain and it is not and unbreakable object. However this anime seems to sometimes take this idea too far, often resorting to it in what seems like every episode in order to make an action scene seem more intense. While I like the idea of an anime where the swords can break, the swords in this anime seem like they are made of hardened glass, and break just as easily.The ending is good, but leaves you wanting more not necessarily in a good way. to put in it in a metaphor so that I don't spoil anything, it's like they killed a lion but never entered the lion's den to kill the rest.Confusing metaphors aside, I did enjoy the anime and feel like it was well worth the time I spent watching it, and while its definitely not on my top ten list, its most certainly an anime  I'll watch again sometime. the thing that I have the biggest problem with, not to say that this isn't enjoyable its just that I feel like it is done a bit too much in the anime.The anime has a running theme that no sword is unbreakable, which is true, unlike what other anime's like Bleach would have you believe, a real sword requires careful cleaning and constant repair to maintain and it is not and unbreakable object.

At 12 episodes, I've been able to watch the entire series multiple times and enjoyed it each time. It is fairly lightweight, has a good pace, and has some fun characters. I like the soundtrack - particularly the opening theme and the music for the fight scenes. The dubbing is well timed and the dialog runs the range from serious to humorous to emotional. And then there's the pleasure of seeing bonds of friendship form between the characters and the hint of future romance.What first captured my attention was the character of Cecily Cambell, a teenage, rookie knight who starts...out severely lacking in experience and confidence. On the plus side, she has an unyielding, noble heart, great courage, the drive to protect everyone, and compassion for human life. Qualities that I highly admire. She is frequently teased about her large, but not overly large, breasts and her flustered, embarrassed reactions add a charming element as well as provide a certain levity to the show (a little bit of fanservice). Some may dislike her for being initially weak but I find it makes her more real.Pretty much immediately you find the blacksmith character, Luke Ainsworth, is a very taciturn fellow who shows a near complete lack of consideration and empathy for others. Not exactly endearing qualities but...stick with him and you'll find out why. It is going to take someone special, perhaps a particular strong-willed female knight, to draw him out. He is a master swordsman and somehow always seems to be around when Cecily needs him the most. Imagine that.You aren't going to find a really deep plot or backstory here and the animation is fairly standard. Some criticisms noted in other reviews are definitely valid. It feels like there should have been more episodes between the 8th and 9th and thus the ending comes sooner than expected. Definitely prepped for a sequel.What I see is a fun little show with some sword play (katanas and demon swords), characters to admire and feel for, the very early stages of a budding romance usually manifest as verbal (and occasionally physical) sparring, and a lot of heart.

You know when an anime is good when you realise you're halfway through the series just like that!The anime is in basic, a girl who wants to be a hero and a blacksmith who is rude. Now it sounds bland but honestly, the characters in the opening episodes were written well. Luke, the blacksmith slowly builds up his character and shows he cares. Lisa is that classic cute little girl who has that voice actor who you would swear is in EVERY anime ever, so just a run off...the mile character. But her story is entertaining and fun to watch, not the best written character but for the role she plays, just fine. Cecily is a busty and clueless character, but in a good way. She comes off as this want to be hero but slowly learns the meaning off a knight. She's well written but I think her back story could have been fleshed out.Now here comes the ending off the praise, the other characters. You know when an anime is bad when you can remember many of the main characters names. Honesty episode 7 and on wards is a total waste off time. New characters come in and for a whole two episodes, Luke doesn't appear. Now I'm all for new characters but they just turn up and they don't have any real back story.The voice acting was meh, it sounded like it's one off those animes they made because off how popular the fantasy genre is but didn't give a crap about making it good like past fantasy animes such as Castlevania and Seraph of the End, both off those shows flesh out the characters and make you want to root for the heros and Hell, even the villains are good. The voice acting just seems like a B grade, the first episode has some voice acting which sound like something you'll get in a fan dub.The artwork was meh as well, nothing fancy. Most anime's artwork is meh isn't it. I guess here and there you get some decent art work but this anime isn't a stand out. It's just your run off the mile fantasy harem ecchii anime (Yes you get to see Ceila's chest). I guess watch this if you're not looking for anything great, a good anime to legit waste your arvo. Got time to kill? This is the perfect anime. Don't expect to much, expect a bit off laughs and story telling but that's it.Overall 5/10Not anything special but it's not half bad.

Now I'm all for new characters but they just turn up and they don't have any real back story.The voice acting was meh, it sounded like it's one off those animes they made because off how popular the fantasy genre is but didn't give a crap about making it good like past fantasy animes such as Castlevania and Seraph of the End, both off those shows flesh out the characters and make you want to root for the heros and Hell, even the villains are good. The voice acting just seems like a B grade, the first episode has some voice acting which sound like something you'll get in a fan dub.The artwork was meh as well, nothing fancy. Most anime's artwork is meh isn't it. I guess here and there you get some decent art work but this anime isn't a stand out. It's just your run off the mile fantasy harem ecchii anime (Yes you get to see Ceila's chest). I guess watch this if you're not looking for anything great, a good anime to legit waste your arvo. Got time to kill? This is the perfect anime. Don't expect to much, expect a bit off laughs and story telling but that's it.Overall 5/10Not anything special but it's not half bad. Could be better."", 'Good Lord; what is wrong with the writers, directors, and producers of this very anime, really?I mean, let’s say you are a group of anime writers. You come up with a terse, very able, mysterious and very well written main character (Luke Ainsworth) who is an incredible blacksmith who also uses katanas he conjures with magic, then comic relief secondary lead character (Cecily Campbell) who is in fact too clumsy and too humanist to be a knight, and a mysterious and yet very nice sidekick who also has some elf powers and surely elf ears (Lisa). You also come up with something called a...demon contract that turns humans to some sort of ogre and a city-state that should be protected from this evil demons, and a bad guy like Voldemort named Valbanill who caused much death and destruction in the past. Then you introduce a demon sword that can turn into a real girl named Aria. So, what do you do with that? You write a great anime show and sit down and develop all these great points together, right? You focus on the relationship between Luke and Lisa, Cecily and the sword Aria, and how they develop as individual characters  and as a group to defend their city against evil demons. Right? Wrong.Instead, they introduce a stupid, odious, pathetic figure of a so-called princess at episode 5, spend 1/3 of the series without any reference to Luke, the city being threatened by demons, or the relationship between the three main characters. Instead, you focus on that bratty so-called princess who is denied that rank or any relationship by her alleged father the emperor, then send her and her bodyguards away at the end of episode 8 without having achieved anything important for or relevant to the main storyline or character development. Oh, and the loser knight Cecily turns into a beast of a warrior within these 3 episodes but we cannot realise why, either, and then, again for reasons we cannot see, she becomes really clumsy once again beginning with episode 9, becomes extremely enlightened at episode 11, a perfect sword fighter at episode 12, and the storyline this time focuses on demon swords, Luke and Lisa’s past (I was to write Leia for an instant!), and political games and a meaningless demon attack on their home town. No coherence, not a single thought about how to develop characters and relations, not a single explanation who the lord of evil Valbanill was and if he is alive, why the “man in black” is his agent even if he never met him, and so on.So, in short, The Sacred Blacksmith is an effort that could have been a legendary anime, but instead it loses its focus completely for reasons that defy me. Then, it returns to be first story but now it has not enough time nor depth to deal with the main issue as there are only 3 episodes left. I am so disappointed. Still, it can be watched to pass time and Luke and Lisa and the sword Aria are all interesting characters. To sum it up, you can watch it to pass time, but you don’t have to worry about why the story goes like it does or characters act the way they do. demon contract that turns humans to some sort of ogre and a city-state that should be protected from this evil demons, and a bad guy like Voldemort named Valbanill who caused much death and destruction in the past.

It took two episodes for me to enjoy, which is fair enough for most stories to introduce the beginning plot.The story is a comedy/fantasy adventure. The artwork is quite refined, the background, the stills, and animation can compete with the current modern anime series.The sound on my DVD can be watched in original Japanese or English Dub. I had no problem with either, although I prefered to watch in English as a personal preference.The intro and ending theme music was catchy anime. Nothing...out of the ordinary but catchy with nice Chibi styled animation to accompany the ending credits.The story has its turns in enjoyment. It is well written, the script can be hilarious, if you have seen puni puni poemy, then this will be right up your alley, in the style of punchlines. The jokes are throughout the series, there to give light relief to the story and the characters.The Story dips midway, but this is fine with me, because the animation was great and the jokes flowed. But this dip in the story does lead into the ending well, has a neat twist which is probably not impossible to guess, but seems it could have several possible endings, and I was happy with the result.Overall its fun, mature, and simple fantasy setting.-HOTgreat animation and dubbingconsistent full bodied light humoured storynice theme music and battles-COLDfantasy setting and monsters perhaps not intense but still pretty enjoyablesome of the jokes could be regarded as sexist (depends who you are) out of the ordinary but catchy with nice Chibi styled animation to accompany the ending credits.The story has its turns in enjoyment.

Ten minutes into the first episode and it is already established trice that her fighting skills suck and she is in constant need of some uncaring pretty boy to be appearing out of nowhere and saving her with his awesome sword in the last second. Said pretty boy is named Luke. He is very good at crafting swords; thus he can slice in half other common weapons...just because his works are quality material. He is also living together with a loli elf which can imbue his sword with extra powers in case conventional methods don’t work. Said loli elf is fascinated with boobs and never misses to mention how it would also want to have gigantic ones instead of a flat chest. Sadly for her later on a whore with another pair of watermelons appears and her jealousy grows even more. There is also some sort of a world threat regarding a demon who wants to destroy the world and turns people to monsters but you will barely notice it because every five minutes you will be getting some boob joke, Luke getting a nosebleed, and Cecily hitting him for that. Hooray for priorities.I understand that Japan has its own way of animating the fantasy genre but they never managed to produce a single well-made epic fantasy anime in their entire history. The closest ones to the “rather good” status still are Record of Lodoss War, followed by Guin Saga. All the rest are nothing but goofball comedies and ecchis, or horribly low-budgeted Middle-Earth imitations. This belong in the former category and all you are offered is an uninspired premise, a generic setting, awful cheery pop songs that are completely off with the genre, and lots of done-to-death softporn jokes that are completely out of fashion after we were plagued with four seasons of Queen’s Blade.The funny thing is, many people expected something good out of this show because it was animated by Manglobe. I have no idea why that is proof of anything since they have made a couple of great shows and a bunch of mediocrities. This one is in fact their worst job yet, both in production values (which are average to bad) and context (which doesn’t exist). The director or the writer didn’t produce anything significant in their whole careers either, so again you have nothing to expect.Even if you try to view this show as a silly comedy in a fantasy setting, it is still bad, since it is hardly as funny or exciting as similar shows from almost two decades ago, such as Slayers and Mahoujin Guruguru. If you want a more specific reason of why it is so bad, all you have to do is to separate the anime into the background part and the foreground part.- The background part is good in terms of creating a generic but otherwise interesting setting. The sceneries are very detailed and indeed make you feel they are part of a medieval world. The BGM is indeed made to sound like it’s a fantasy/action show. The backdrop story is indeed made to appear as the classic tale of a demon trying to take over the world and releasing demons everywhere, while a band of brave adventurers sets out to stop him. These are all very good and dandy.- The foreground part where all the plot and action takes place is a complete mess. The characters are all drawn in a most generic and boring way, with too much focus on boobs, plus their personalities are simple and lack any interesting or meaningful development. The intro and outro songs are completely trash material, full of cheery squeaking singers. The dialogues are all full of retarded softporn jokes and juvenile talking about friendship and compassion. Voice acting is nothing much because of the lack of seriousness that would require from them to sound any better, plus the few loli characters have that annoying pinch in voice I hate so much. The plot is to the most part aimless strolling around with lots of dead time and ecchi moments, plus there are cases where the characters make some really out-of-character decisions, plus the ending is left open. These are all bellow average material.Down to it, this is a terrible anime and I don’t recommend it not even as a time waster. It will forever be known only as Sacred Boobsmith, the worst show made by Manglobe.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (hit-or-miss)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (very detailed)Animation 1/2 (average)Visual Effects 1/2 (typical)SOUND SECTION: 5/10Voice Acting 1/3 (retarded)Music Themes 2/4 (good BGM, bad intro and outro)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 2/10Premise 1/2 (generic)Pacing 0/2 (stupid)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (typical)Personality 1/2 (generic)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Catharsis 0/2 (none)VALUE SECTION: 3/10Historical Value 1/3 (none, unless you consider it the worst show made by Manglobe)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch it)Memorability 0/4 (no reason to remember it)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 0/1 (looks lazy)Sound 0/2 (sounds boring)Story 1/3 (feels generic)Characters 0/4 (booby cardboards)VERDICT: 3.5/10 just because his works are quality material.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I think Cecily's kind of cute (and yes, I ship her with Aria instead of that tool Luke), but again, it's just not very memorable.I mean, the anime goes through great pains to show how brave and strong Cecily is, and then it sacrifices all the progress for a cheapo ecchi moment when her breastplate falls off after she taps it.  Just... there's a time and a place for that kind of thing, but undercutting your MC's kick-ass moment isn't one of them.I don't like Luke, I think...he needs to grow up- and let's face it, he's obviously more interested in Lisa than Cecily.  It's just...It's an okay watch.  But that's all it really is.

I was debating a 6 or a 7, but I decided a 7 because of some of the characters. The story itself is fairly generic, a clumsy, weak knight who needs someone to save her all the time. The main character, Cecily (don't worry she says who she is like before every fight I probably will never forget her name) grew on me at times. She started off annoyingly weak, but got stronger (?) (sometimes). She tended to kind of be in everyone's business, but she did it with good intentions, and I respect that. She has an...insane sense of justice, like maybe even Seryu levels.

The main character Cecili Cambell maybe a goof and most of the comedy areas are based mostly on her breasts she is an honorable knight. People shouldn't expect to much just because of the title. Even though it's highly unlikely it gets a second season I really hope it does it's actually a great Anime "", 'War is Hell.  These words, famously spoken by Union soldier William Tecumseh Sherman during the American Civil War, have lived on ever since, and they’ve been used on many occasions to describe the bloodshed and rampant loss of life that can happen when nations engage each other in combat.  It’s probably one of the most apt metaphors ever constructed by man, but what if it were to obtain a literal definition as well?  What if there was a war that actually involved the forces of hell, with actual demons fighting both against and alongside the human race?  This is exactly what...happened in the Vaalbinill war, a conflict where mankind used a powerful magic to turn human sacrifices into powerful demonically-possessed swords called...  Well, Demon swords.  To do this, a human on the verge of death must read the death song that every person has hidden inside them, which creates a contract for them to sign...  One that binds their souls to a magically enhanced sword...  Only a few of which can take human form afterwards.Alas, this war ended forty-four years ago, when the warring nations realized the damage these demon swords were causing, and reached a peace treaty to prevent the collateral damage from reaching a point of no return.  Now, in the present day, the stories of demons and sacrifice have faded into legend, and people are just trying to get by, with very few reminders of the conflict left to haunt them.  One of these, a demented homeless veteran of the war, is creating a scene in the middle of the marketplace when Cecily Campbell, a third generation knight who has vowed to protect the city and uphold justice in her late father’s name, is almost killed by this man before a quiet boy with a strange curved sword saves her from him.  Realizing his occupation as a blacksmith, Cecily becomes determined to convince him to make her a sword that’s just like his...  A katana, the sort of weapon from a faraway land, which she believes will aid her in her quest of heroism.  He refuses, but she’ll have to find a way to change his mind, as the past has rapidly began to catch up to their land, and Cecily’s courage will soon be needed more than ever before.Sacred Blacksmith was produced by Media Factory, who, incidentally, are also directly related to MF Bunko J, the company who published it’s light novels.  Both companies are located under the umbrella of the Kadokawa Group, and from what I could tell from Media Factory’s Wikipedia page, they mostly do small jobs for other production companies, especially to Studio Gonzo and TMS.  Out of the titles I actually knew, I couldn’t find any anime credited to them that had their name listed as their primary producer, with the soul exception to this being 2009’s The Sacred Blacksmith, and if that’s indicative of the larger truth, then thank God, because this show looks a bit on the mediocre side.  Maybe that’s kind of mean of me, because I’ve definitely seen a lot worse looking anime than this over the years, but it’s kind of obvious that they had a small budget to work with, and it looks like they probably didn’t know how to handle such a hindrance in such a way that it wouldn’t be too noticeable.I don’t know what bothers me more...  How cheap this show looks, or how commonly cheap it looks, as it carries a lot of the same visual problems that an anime from the late 2000’s is likely to have.  It tries to juggle it’s budge responsibly, with minimal movement being featured whenever possible in order to save more money for action scenes, but those stationary scenes look lazy as hell, as characters freeze almost right into the background when they’re not talking or reacting to anything, and they often do so while just slightly off-model enough to create an uncanny valley sensation, and the action scenes aren’t great either.  They’re plagued by close-ups and zoom effects to make it look like you’re not just cutting from one stationary image to the other, and while this doesn’t always look too bad, especially if the villain of said scene is represented by some pretty decent CG animation, the amount of cut corners is telling.  Backgrounds can be nice and highly detailed, especially when taking place in the market, but that doesn’t save the characters inhabiting them from looking stiff and lifeless.In terms of the visuals, the only thing about this show that really gives it any sense of identity is the design of the main character, Cecily Campbell, who almost seems like she was drawn to catch the eye, what with her striking shade of red hair and highly questionable knight’s armor that looks like it was specifically molded in such a way as to accentuate her breasts(we’ll get to that).  With the exception of the Demon Sword characters, who look like support characters taken from various Final Fantasy games, everyone else looks pretty generic, from the titular blacksmith, who’s only real memorable feature is the fact that his left eye is always shaded differently from his right eye(there’s a reason for it) to the villain, who...  And I realize this is a spoiler, but come on, who wouldn’t see this coming...  Is of course a sinister looking guy with long white hair.  This is an anime, damn it, and you should expect things like that by now.  The non-human villains look pretty good, especially the CG ones, but we don’t get very many of them.I didn’t really notice the music while watching the series, but I never had any complaints about it either, which I guess is a good thing.  The opening is your standard rock anthem, with Mayumi Goto belting out lyrics about virtue, triumph over evil and the struggle to do so, and while it’s pretty generic, it sounds nice.  Some of the show’s best and worst animation is showcased during the video, clumsily moving between stiff characters in the middle of breathtakingly beautiful backgrounds to characters awkwardly trying to move against said backgrounds.  A lot of the same could be said for the ending song, miracle happy day, which is also nice but generic.  I like how each song is meant to represent a different character, with the opening representing Cecily and the ending representing little Lisa, but the latter has the added benefit of also being the character’s actual voice actor.  As for the rest of the score, it was composed by Terashima Tamaya, and it’s pretty cool overall, especially the epic Kishi no Hokori.  The sound is appropriately medieval, with a lot of drums and wind instruments at play.While the music and animation may not be quite good enough to make an impression on you, the English dub is another story entirely.  Funimation did a fantastic job on this one, to the point that even at some of it’s worst moments, the quality of the acting can still get you through.  While these titles are by no means her first starring roles, it wasn’t until Strike Witches that she started to become a big name in the industry, and her role in The Sacred Blacksmith came right on the heels of that, and if anything, it proved that she could carry a series while moving away from more diminutive characters.  It combines her likeability, strength and sincerity in such a way that it feels almost like a precursor to some of her future roles, like Lucy in Fairy Tail, Asuna in Sword Art Online and Ilia in RWBY.  From what I’ve read, the character of Cecily was a really unpopular one in the original sub, with fans reacting negatively to her due to her big, grandiose talk and seeming inability to back it up, but Cherami’s performance does a lot to alleviate that issue and saves the character, even at her worst in the early episodes.I’m normally not a huge fan of Blake Shephard, but he does a pretty damn good job as the titular Blacksmith, Luke Ainsworth.  The character is supposed to be really cynical and blase, which Blake captures really well with his lack of intonation and devil-may-care attitude, adding in just enough hopeful or long-suffering vibes whenever necessary.  Monica Rial plays his assistant, a cheerful little girl character who’s generally happy-go-lucky and annoyingly obsessed with his love life, and while this may sound like the kind of role Monica normally gets typecast into...  And it is...  Her casting was NOT a frivolous decision, nor was it just-another-paycheck for her.  She does a lot with this character, and deserves praise for it.  Anastacia Munoz plays the demon sword Ilia, and she does a great job, but oh what the hell, I’m just glad to see her.  I’m a huge fan, and she doesn’t get enough work.  The rest of Funimation’s usual squad of regulars show up at some point or another, with some highlights including Alexis Tipton as a spurned princess, Brina Palencia as a tragic victim of fate, and Colleen Clinkenbeard and J Michael Tatum as probably the only choices that could have made the boring villains more interesting.And speaking of making things more interesting, that’s exactly the kind of task that Funimation had in front of them when they acquired this anime, which is probably why, when they announced the upcoming release, they were not the slightest bit coy about the fact that there’d be nudity in the release that wasn’t there in the original TV run.  I don’t know if that nudity was censored on TV or if Funi just edited it in, but whatever the case, it’s really telling that they went to such great lengths to advertise the presence of some unobscured boobs, although as many forum-dwellers noted back then, it was probably due to the lack of interest that people had for the title.  It’s true that nudity can be used well, and be an essential or at least acceptable part of a story, but in this case, it was very obviously being used as a crutch in order to help sales of the title, much like they wound up doing years later when they accidentally released the censored version of Sankarea; Undying love a few years later.Now, at first glance, if you’re coming in blind and just looking up the plot synopsis and descriptions of the series, it looks like you’d be in for something awesome.  It’s a show about knights and demons in a feudal setting, starring a cute and well-endowed female protagonist, and it deals with the introduction of katanas into a western society.  There’s a lot of potential there, and you could be excused for going in with some pretty high expectations, even to the point that you’d probably be willing to look past the sub-par animation quality.  The katana worship kind of suggests that there’d be some element of eastern influence creeping into the show’s western setting, or that Luke would have some kind of foreign background that could be explored, or hell, even the plot about the war that took place decades prior to the events of the series could have amounted to some kind of interesting intrigue.  What I’m saying here is that there was a lot of room for cool ideas, and while they may have possibly been exploited to some extent in the source material, they weren’t here.Right off the bat, this series shows signs of disappointment from pretty much all corners, from the bullshit about swords cutting through other swords to the fact that anything cool about the art of blacksmithing would be largely glossed over in favor of magical weapon creation.  The plot and setting are extremely derivative and offer nothing new or unique to stand out against the thousands of feudal-type anime out there, and the villain is about as boring as you can get.  I don’t even remember what his plan was, and I seriously didn’t care about any scenes dealing with the effects of said plan.  It takes a special kind of failure to make small demons popping out of peoples’ mouths boring, but that’s where we are here, and the main characters aren’t much better.  Cecily and Luke are trapped in a will-they-won’t-they dynamic that never goes anywhere, not that you’d WANT it to, you just want it to go literally anywhere else so you don’t have to listen to their inane bickering and cliched nonsense.Part of this is of course Cecily herself, who appears to be some kind of joke character, preaching idealistic virtues like justice and compassion, self-sacrifice and heroism, all while proving herself to be ridiculously incompetent, having to be saved at every turn and not being taken seriously by just about anyone.  She kind of reminds me of the protagonist of Now and Then, Here and There, but taken completely out of context to her own detriment.  Her relationship with Luke is full of pure cringe, as she plays the rough, brutish tsundere to his asexual jerk, flashing boob and berating him for accidentally seeing it, blushing and fervently denying any feelings for him when called out, and most insulting of all, trying to weasel out of paying for the katana she wants him to make.  Cap all of this off with a little girl obsessed with playing matchmaker and pointing out how generously well-endowed Cecily is, you’ve got what looks on the surface to be a jumbled mess of bland, cliched elements that nobody was asking for all merged into one show.So, is there anything in this show that makes it worth watching?  I think so, but this is the part where things are going to get a bit uncertain.  If there’s anything interesting about this series, then it’s not in the text, but in the subtext, or at least out of what I could read into it.  Now keep in mind that this is an entirely speculative interpretation of the material, so take it with a grain of salt, because there’s quite a bit to unload here.  I didn’t start to pick apart any kind of deeper meaning to this series until the character ilia was introduced(at which point the series does manage to get quite a bit better, assuming you were able to make it that far in the first place) but when I did, I started noticing some very specific subtext, from which I managed to work backwards and figure out the over-all theme of the story, and I’m actually quite confidant about this part of it(my interpretation gets a little shakier later on), where the main unifying idea of the Sacred blacksmith seems to be the importance of self-identity, especially when compared to the indentities placed upon you by others.This idea is explored in some surprisingly diverse ways, with the most obvious being the storyline between Luke and Lisa, but that’s kinda of heavy with the spoilers, so I’d instead like to start off with Charlotte, a young girl who begins to make trouble for our heroes halfway through the series.  She declares that she’s a princess, the bastard daughter of the king, and demands her rightful place for the sake of her late mother.  She instead gets refused by her father, and at the end of her arc(mild spoiler alert) she instead abandons her royal lineage and defects to another nation.  This may sound like defeat, but think about what she was trying to do...  She was trying to fulfill the dreams of her mother and gain the approval of her father, but was either of those goals what she wanted?  What would avenging her deceased mother or proving herself to her father have done for her?  I mean, there’s obviously the idea of attaining wealth and status as royalty, but she doesn’t show any interest in that.  Instead, she dropped the Royal title from her name and started over on her own terms, choosing to define herself as an individual.There’s also the demon swords, three of which can turn into humans...  Well, four, but we only spend any time with three of them...  And they all seem to fall into the same category, as characters who are burdened with the identities thrust upon them by their creators.  Even the chant that they use to change form explicitly states that their purpose is to slay God, which could be read in exactly that way.  While two of them are also heavily rooted in spoilers, I think we can talk about the first one, ilia, the demon sword who possesses the power of wind.  Ilia has been around since the great war, where she was born on the battlefield, and she’s been responsible for countless deaths, the lives of which were taken by her wielders as well as by people wanting to become her wielder, killing said wielder and taking their place.  She’s sick of being used as a tool of murder, which is why her life changes so drastically when she forges a partnership with the idealistic Cecily, who...  Oh dear, it’s time to start talking about her now.Okay, so, this is the part where it really becomes a stretch, so bear with me.  The idea of self-identity gets a lot more complicated with Cecily, as it also starts to creep into the territory of sexual identity and gender identity, yeah, it’s that kind of show.  Cecily is a character who’s trying really hard to find out where she belongs inbetween the masculine and feminine aspects of her personality.  Unlike Charlotte, who wants to become a princess for the sake of her mother, Cecily becomes a knight for the sake of her father, even though such an occupation is explicitly shown to be male-dominated, and she’s never taken seriously as a member of their ranks, facing both condescension and open resentment for trying to do what’s considered a man’s job.  I’d even go as far as to assume that her breast plate was molded specifically for the purpose of accentuating the shape of her bosom, as the military considers her more of a mascot or a PR stunt than an actual knight, and in all fairness, she doesn’t do much to prove them wrong.Now, I’m not the kind of person who sees a sword in a story and says “That’s a dick,” unless I’m making a joke about Bleach or something, but that old symbolism cliche does kind of fit in this case, when you consider just how unsuccessful Cecily is while trying to wield them in her attempts at doing what’s considered men’s work.  Either they break in her hands, or she flat-out refuses to kill, which is both suggestive of compassion which is a traditionally feminine trait, and on a more low-brow note, a sign of impotence.  Yes, I am also including the fact that she’s unable to get the main male character to ‘erect’ a sword for her in my analysis, and you’re welcome for that.  Keep in mind, though, she’s just as bad with feminine pursuits, as she’s uncomfortable with the idea of drawing attention to her looks, and she fails hard at performing house work, and she’s really awkward in any sort of feminine clothes, so it could be said that both masculine and feminine ideals are waiting just out of her grasp.Having said all of that, she doesn’t start to grow as a character, to gain more confidence both socially and in battle, until she acquires a female partner who acts as a sword for her, and she’s finally able to perform successfully.  Granted, there’s no actual confession of love or confirmed affection between her and Ilia, but it’s still really easy to read their relationship as a romantic one, with some seriously Utena-esque subtext to back it up.  There are several lines of dialogue that seem to almost deliberately imply something deeper than friendship, although that could have just been Funimation rewriting things.  I don’t know how things between Luke and Cecily went in the source material, but it’s typically not my style to look into things like that, and Cecily really does seem to grow and develop as a person after her and Ilia form their partnership.  Granted, this doesn’t really go anywhere special, as Ilia’s insistence on Cecily continuing to pursue Luke does kind of echo the very Japanese idea of lesbianism being a teenage phase, but I’m just the interpreter, I didn’t write the damn show.So, to summarize, The Sacred Blacksmith seems to insist that you can’t become a complete person until you come to terms with your own identity, and in order to do that, you shouldn’t live by other peoples’ standards, you shouldn’t live for the approval or fulfillment of your parents, you shouldn’t try to be more of a man, you shouldn’t try to be more of a woman, you shouldn’t try to live up to the role society has placed on you, and you shouldn’t live according to the rules of your creator...  You are you, and you shouldn’t lose sight of who you are and what you want.  And what if I’m just pulling all of this out of my ass?  What if I’m just reading too far into the material and seeing what I want to see?  Well, that’s incredibly likely, but it would be a damn shame, because that added depth is really the only thing this show has going for it.  On it’s own merits, The Sacred Blacksmith is just about the blandest thing you’ll ever see, with it’s only real saving grace being that it gets less boring about a third of the way through, so I’ll stick to my interpretation, thank you very much.Sacred Blacksmith is available from Funimation, now as a part of the SAVE collection.  The original light novels are not available stateside, but the manga adaptation by Isao Miura are available from Seven Seas entertainment.  It also makes a very brief cameo in the anime Haganai.In a general sense, I want to like everything I watch, or at the very least, I want it to be worth liking, and since there really isn’t anything outright awful about this particular title, the fact that I’m able to read something deeper into it helps me to appreciate it perhaps a bit more than it actually deserves.  It’s not one of the worst anime I’ve ever seen, not by far, but the fact that it’s not interestingly bad just adds to it’s lack of noteworthy qualities as part of the reason why I don’t think I’d ever recommend it to very many people.  I guess you might like it if you’re a hardcore fan of either the feudal setting or of Cherami Leigh as an actor, or hell, maybe if you’re going through some crisis of identity and need to watch something that might help you affirm your own self-image, and maybe you’ll see the same subtext and symbolism that I did.  Other than that, it’s not an outright bad anime, but it really doesn’t offer anything that you couldn’t find elsewhere in both bigger and better portions.  I give The Sacred Blacksmith a 5/10. happened in the Vaalbinill war, a conflict where mankind used a powerful magic to turn human sacrifices into powerful demonically-possessed swords called...  Well, Demon swords.  To do this, a human on the verge of death must read the death song that every person has hidden inside them, which creates a contract for them to sign...  One that binds their souls to a magically enhanced sword...  Only a few of which can take human form afterwards.Alas, this war ended forty-four years ago, when the warring nations realized the damage these demon swords were causing, and reached a peace treaty to prevent the collateral damage from reaching a point of no return.  Now, in the present day, the stories of demons and sacrifice have faded into legend, and people are just trying to get by, with very few reminders of the conflict left to haunt them.  One of these, a demented homeless veteran of the war, is creating a scene in the middle of the marketplace when Cecily Campbell, a third generation knight who has vowed to protect the city and uphold justice in her late father’s name, is almost killed by this man before a quiet boy with a strange curved sword saves her from him.  Realizing his occupation as a blacksmith, Cecily becomes determined to convince him to make her a sword that’s just like his...  A katana, the sort of weapon from a faraway land, which she believes will aid her in her quest of heroism.  He refuses, but she’ll have to find a way to change his mind, as the past has rapidly began to catch up to their land, and Cecily’s courage will soon be needed more than ever before.Sacred Blacksmith was produced by Media Factory, who, incidentally, are also directly related to MF Bunko J, the company who published it’s light novels.  Both companies are located under the umbrella of the Kadokawa Group, and from what I could tell from Media Factory’s Wikipedia page, they mostly do small jobs for other production companies, especially to Studio Gonzo and TMS.  Out of the titles I actually knew, I couldn’t find any anime credited to them that had their name listed as their primary producer, with the soul exception to this being 2009’s The Sacred Blacksmith, and if that’s indicative of the larger truth, then thank God, because this show looks a bit on the mediocre side.  Maybe that’s kind of mean of me, because I’ve definitely seen a lot worse looking anime than this over the years, but it’s kind of obvious that they had a small budget to work with, and it looks like they probably didn’t know how to handle such a hindrance in such a way that it wouldn’t be too noticeable.I don’t know what bothers me more...  How cheap this show looks, or how commonly cheap it looks, as it carries a lot of the same visual problems that an anime from the late 2000’s is likely to have.  It tries to juggle it’s budge responsibly, with minimal movement being featured whenever possible in order to save more money for action scenes, but those stationary scenes look lazy as hell, as characters freeze almost right into the background when they’re not talking or reacting to anything, and they often do so while just slightly off-model enough to create an uncanny valley sensation, and the action scenes aren’t great either.  They’re plagued by close-ups and zoom effects to make it look like you’re not just cutting from one stationary image to the other, and while this doesn’t always look too bad, especially if the villain of said scene is represented by some pretty decent CG animation, the amount of cut corners is telling.  Backgrounds can be nice and highly detailed, especially when taking place in the market, but that doesn’t save the characters inhabiting them from looking stiff and lifeless.In terms of the visuals, the only thing about this show that really gives it any sense of identity is the design of the main character, Cecily Campbell, who almost seems like she was drawn to catch the eye, what with her striking shade of red hair and highly questionable knight’s armor that looks like it was specifically molded in such a way as to accentuate her breasts(we’ll get to that).  With the exception of the Demon Sword characters, who look like support characters taken from various Final Fantasy games, everyone else looks pretty generic, from the titular blacksmith, who’s only real memorable feature is the fact that his left eye is always shaded differently from his right eye(there’s a reason for it) to the villain, who...  And I realize this is a spoiler, but come on, who wouldn’t see this coming...  Is of course a sinister looking guy with long white hair.  This is an anime, damn it, and you should expect things like that by now.  The non-human villains look pretty good, especially the CG ones, but we don’t get very many of them.I didn’t really notice the music while watching the series, but I never had any complaints about it either, which I guess is a good thing.  The opening is your standard rock anthem, with Mayumi Goto belting out lyrics about virtue, triumph over evil and the struggle to do so, and while it’s pretty generic, it sounds nice.  Some of the show’s best and worst animation is showcased during the video, clumsily moving between stiff characters in the middle of breathtakingly beautiful backgrounds to characters awkwardly trying to move against said backgrounds.  A lot of the same could be said for the ending song, miracle happy day, which is also nice but generic.  I like how each song is meant to represent a different character, with the opening representing Cecily and the ending representing little Lisa, but the latter has the added benefit of also being the character’s actual voice actor.  As for the rest of the score, it was composed by Terashima Tamaya, and it’s pretty cool overall, especially the epic Kishi no Hokori.  The sound is appropriately medieval, with a lot of drums and wind instruments at play.While the music and animation may not be quite good enough to make an impression on you, the English dub is another story entirely.  Funimation did a fantastic job on this one, to the point that even at some of it’s worst moments, the quality of the acting can still get you through.  While these titles are by no means her first starring roles, it wasn’t until Strike Witches that she started to become a big name in the industry, and her role in The Sacred Blacksmith came right on the heels of that, and if anything, it proved that she could carry a series while moving away from more diminutive characters.  It combines her likeability, strength and sincerity in such a way that it feels almost like a precursor to some of her future roles, like Lucy in Fairy Tail, Asuna in Sword Art Online and Ilia in RWBY.  From what I’ve read, the character of Cecily was a really unpopular one in the original sub, with fans reacting negatively to her due to her big, grandiose talk and seeming inability to back it up, but Cherami’s performance does a lot to alleviate that issue and saves the character, even at her worst in the early episodes.I’m normally not a huge fan of Blake Shephard, but he does a pretty damn good job as the titular Blacksmith, Luke Ainsworth.  The character is supposed to be really cynical and blase, which Blake captures really well with his lack of intonation and devil-may-care attitude, adding in just enough hopeful or long-suffering vibes whenever necessary.  Monica Rial plays his assistant, a cheerful little girl character who’s generally happy-go-lucky and annoyingly obsessed with his love life, and while this may sound like the kind of role Monica normally gets typecast into...  And it is...  Her casting was NOT a frivolous decision, nor was it just-another-paycheck for her.  She does a lot with this character, and deserves praise for it.  Anastacia Munoz plays the demon sword Ilia, and she does a great job, but oh what the hell, I’m just glad to see her.  I’m a huge fan, and she doesn’t get enough work.  The rest of Funimation’s usual squad of regulars show up at some point or another, with some highlights including Alexis Tipton as a spurned princess, Brina Palencia as a tragic victim of fate, and Colleen Clinkenbeard and J Michael Tatum as probably the only choices that could have made the boring villains more interesting.And speaking of making things more interesting, that’s exactly the kind of task that Funimation had in front of them when they acquired this anime, which is probably why, when they announced the upcoming release, they were not the slightest bit coy about the fact that there’d be nudity in the release that wasn’t there in the original TV run.  I don’t know if that nudity was censored on TV or if Funi just edited it in, but whatever the case, it’s really telling that they went to such great lengths to advertise the presence of some unobscured boobs, although as many forum-dwellers noted back then, it was probably due to the lack of interest that people had for the title.  It’s true that nudity can be used well, and be an essential or at least acceptable part of a story, but in this case, it was very obviously being used as a crutch in order to help sales of the title, much like they wound up doing years later when they accidentally released the censored version of Sankarea; Undying love a few years later.Now, at first glance, if you’re coming in blind and just looking up the plot synopsis and descriptions of the series, it looks like you’d be in for something awesome.  It’s a show about knights and demons in a feudal setting, starring a cute and well-endowed female protagonist, and it deals with the introduction of katanas into a western society.  There’s a lot of potential there, and you could be excused for going in with some pretty high expectations, even to the point that you’d probably be willing to look past the sub-par animation quality.  The katana worship kind of suggests that there’d be some element of eastern influence creeping into the show’s western setting, or that Luke would have some kind of foreign background that could be explored, or hell, even the plot about the war that took place decades prior to the events of the series could have amounted to some kind of interesting intrigue.  What I’m saying here is that there was a lot of room for cool ideas, and while they may have possibly been exploited to some extent in the source material, they weren’t here.Right off the bat, this series shows signs of disappointment from pretty much all corners, from the bullshit about swords cutting through other swords to the fact that anything cool about the art of blacksmithing would be largely glossed over in favor of magical weapon creation.

I don’t even remember what his plan was, and I seriously didn’t care about any scenes dealing with the effects of said plan.  It takes a special kind of failure to make small demons popping out of peoples’ mouths boring, but that’s where we are here, and the main characters aren’t much better.  Cecily and Luke are trapped in a will-they-won’t-they dynamic that never goes anywhere, not that you’d WANT it to, you just want it to go literally anywhere else so you don’t have to listen to their inane bickering and cliched nonsense.Part of this is of course Cecily herself, who appears to be some kind of joke character, preaching idealistic virtues like justice and compassion, self-sacrifice and heroism, all while proving herself to be ridiculously incompetent, having to be saved at every turn and not being taken seriously by just about anyone.  She kind of reminds me of the protagonist of Now and Then, Here and There, but taken completely out of context to her own detriment.  Her relationship with Luke is full of pure cringe, as she plays the rough, brutish tsundere to his asexual jerk, flashing boob and berating him for accidentally seeing it, blushing and fervently denying any feelings for him when called out, and most insulting of all, trying to weasel out of paying for the katana she wants him to make.  Cap all of this off with a little girl obsessed with playing matchmaker and pointing out how generously well-endowed Cecily is, you’ve got what looks on the surface to be a jumbled mess of bland, cliched elements that nobody was asking for all merged into one show.So, is there anything in this show that makes it worth watching?  I think so, but this is the part where things are going to get a bit uncertain.  If there’s anything interesting about this series, then it’s not in the text, but in the subtext, or at least out of what I could read into it.  Now keep in mind that this is an entirely speculative interpretation of the material, so take it with a grain of salt, because there’s quite a bit to unload here.  I didn’t start to pick apart any kind of deeper meaning to this series until the character ilia was introduced(at which point the series does manage to get quite a bit better, assuming you were able to make it that far in the first place) but when I did, I started noticing some very specific subtext, from which I managed to work backwards and figure out the over-all theme of the story, and I’m actually quite confidant about this part of it(my interpretation gets a little shakier later on), where the main unifying idea of the Sacred blacksmith seems to be the importance of self-identity, especially when compared to the indentities placed upon you by others.This idea is explored in some surprisingly diverse ways, with the most obvious being the storyline between Luke and Lisa, but that’s kinda of heavy with the spoilers, so I’d instead like to start off with Charlotte, a young girl who begins to make trouble for our heroes halfway through the series.  She declares that she’s a princess, the bastard daughter of the king, and demands her rightful place for the sake of her late mother.  She instead gets refused by her father, and at the end of her arc(mild spoiler alert) she instead abandons her royal lineage and defects to another nation.  This may sound like defeat, but think about what she was trying to do...  She was trying to fulfill the dreams of her mother and gain the approval of her father, but was either of those goals what she wanted?  What would avenging her deceased mother or proving herself to her father have done for her?  I mean, there’s obviously the idea of attaining wealth and status as royalty, but she doesn’t show any interest in that.

Well, four, but we only spend any time with three of them...  And they all seem to fall into the same category, as characters who are burdened with the identities thrust upon them by their creators.  Even the chant that they use to change form explicitly states that their purpose is to slay God, which could be read in exactly that way.

Ilia has been around since the great war, where she was born on the battlefield, and she’s been responsible for countless deaths, the lives of which were taken by her wielders as well as by people wanting to become her wielder, killing said wielder and taking their place.  She’s sick of being used as a tool of murder, which is why her life changes so drastically when she forges a partnership with the idealistic Cecily, who...  Oh dear, it’s time to start talking about her now.Okay, so, this is the part where it really becomes a stretch, so bear with me.  The idea of self-identity gets a lot more complicated with Cecily, as it also starts to creep into the territory of sexual identity and gender identity, yeah, it’s that kind of show.  Cecily is a character who’s trying really hard to find out where she belongs inbetween the masculine and feminine aspects of her personality.

Other than that, it’s not an outright bad anime, but it really doesn’t offer anything that you couldn’t find elsewhere in both bigger and better portions.  I give The Sacred Blacksmith a 5/10.', 'A red-haired tsundere who has a crush on her love interest but acts tsundere to him, the love interest is at best have is the strategist of the group, in a fantasy world with magical weapons, demons and or monsters appear and attack the main cast. What do mean this isn\'t Shakugan no Shana??????Ok all joking aside, LA will say this as bluntly as possible......Seiken no Blacksmith is average at best.Seiken no Blacksmith is your typical medieval fantasy anime focusing on a fantasy world of magical swords, demon contracts and a knight who needs a new sword from a mysterious yet justifiably gloomy blacksmith...you would...think that LA said this statement, this anime would have been great!...it\'s...it\'s not. Why? well...let\'s get on with this shall we?In terms of characters, well one of the biggest problem goes to our main characters, Luke Ainsworth voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto the titular blacksmith and Cecily Cambell voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, Luke\'s problem isn\'t his character development as once his backstory and focus on during the current main plot gets, he becomes sympathetic at best and he becomes one of the more well-rounded developed character by the end of it. But the thing is when he isn\'t on screen or he is in focus, he\'s essentially the tsukommi to Cecily\'s boke or worst, he\'s just hardly in it when it doesn\'t revolve around him which is about half of the runtime!. Cecily Cambell is quite the opposite however as her main problem is that she\'s such a one-note character with hardly ANY character development (and when is involved in the plot, most of her development goes either to Lisa, Aria or Luke, not herself, it becomes a problem as we see this fantasy in HER eyes, but she\'s almost a blank slate aside from her strong sense to protect people but that\'s it)  and her constant running gag of her big breasts (yes it\'s one of THOSE anime gags) it becomes extremely grating for any sense of comedy from her though she is constantly jabbed at Luke, Cecily just reacts to everything and is filling in the ""tsundere archetype with the strong sense to protect everyone"" and nothing else. Bad things aside, the other two main characters Lisa voiced by Aki Toyosaki, an assistant to Luke and Aria voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi a magical wind sword gets their proper developments as well as having a point in the majority of the plotlines she\'s in if it is there\'s focus on her or not. Quite easily, Aria very quickly became LA\'s favourite character, due to her being a magical sword and having a likable personality in general. In terms of villains, we do get our ""usual crazy sword-wielding crazies"" here and there and their stock crazy because of the war kind of villains, however the black-cloaked man villain at the start of the anime is essentially the mastermind and this villain doesn\'t comes into focus until the final arc...so when it comes to villains, their either stock cliche (crazy or wanting revenge) or are more working in the background at best until they need to be there. Essentially it\'s not the main cast WANTS (besides Aria and Luke as he actually has an excuse due to his backstory) to move the plot forward, it\'s the villains and by extension the plot itself will move the plot forward, due to this it\'s more of a slow-moving narrative with the characters having almost no sense of urgency until it\'s too late and in that sense it brings up constant hints (through backstory as such) throughout the anime that makes it (nearly) predictable like signaling a bloody blaring SOS message later down the line. On speaking of slow-moving narrative...The plot at worst is inconsistently unfocused, it has multiple plot points brought up at the start and at the same time it focuses on a new plot point be it from our demons or crazy sword-wielding madmen to our main cast involvement in the plot in general but when it comes to character development, is where the plot\'s strengths comes from. Although the world building is extremely slow, what slow information they talk about magical swords and the lore they give out is ""interesting"" to the plot at least and brings in that ""medieval fantasy"" it has...not so much ""adventure"" however as the main cast NEVER leaves their city. What\'s worse is that once a character called Charlotte E. Firobisher voiced by Kaori Fukuhara comes into focus, her ""development"" into the plot becomes almost filler to say the least as besides one-sentence info Charlotte says to Cecily at the end of her arc, her arc has no impact on the actual plot..thus filler...see what LA means by inconsistently unfocused?. GREAT character development when it does god damn focus on them (with Luke, Aria, Lisa and yeah even the mini-filler arc character Charlotte) but slow yet somewhat interesting world building, yet it has constant faffing about and slice of life comedy moments in between all this (and fine you can chalk this up as have a breather episode, but can LA just say that this anime only has 12 episodes...TOO much faffing about is nothing but wasting what little screentime you got Seiken no Blackmsith) when it could have gone into a more focused development on their main cast or it\'s world building. LA isn\'t saying devoid itself of comedy, as it can have comedy, it just can\'t be constant big breasts jokes and annoying character jabbing. Inconsistent. Unfocused as hell.In terms of animation done by the defunct (as of writing this) Studio Manglobe and really this is one of their lesser works in terms of animation, it\'s decent enough this including the colorful medieval-like backgrounds and character designs, however LA says ""lesser works"" from them due to their rather lackluster battle animation, it\'s at best sword beam spamming occurs a lot and yes there are some swordplay but the majority leads into the sword beam spamming, LA isn\'t saying that the animation there is lackluster as the animation is great and at least consistent in this regard, it\'s more so, the ""flow of battle"" is sooo slow and relying on sword beam spamming too much. The animation from a character design to background however is just ""decent"", but nothing to harp on about.In terms of voice acting, we have some really good casting from Nobuhiko Okamoto as Luke and Aki Toyosaki as Lisa and even Megumi Toyoguchi as Aria, -sigh- yes LA had a bit of a problem to Cecily and it\'s not as if Ayumi Fujimura did horrible in this role, it\'s just more like, there wasn\'t enough good material for her, LA KNOWS she can do better (See Misaki Ayuzawa from Kaichou wa Maid-sama!), but with what her tsundere stereotype Ayumi had to work with, LA can\'t blame Ayumi for this role. LA\'s favourite voice actor quite easily goes to Megumi Toyoguchi for obvious reasons.What the final 3 episodes went into what with Luke and Lisa FINALLY properly focusing on them, the final arc was where it\'s strengths comes in again however the major villain who\'s been in the shadows manipulating every other villain the main cast faced in question throughout the anime tucks his tail and runs away at the last minute...YUP it\'s a ""read the light novel"" ending...-sigh- LA was kinda expecting that. The ending sorta goes with a compromise with a great character development to Lisa and Luke that the anime desperately needed, but ended without a resolve...LA\'s feelings to the ending goes to predictably disappointed by this ending with ""some"" compromise.Seiken no Blacksmith is nothing but an average romp into a fantasy medieval world where it\'s just a lowly knight wanting a sword from a blacksmith and either him or the knight taking down the crazy red shirt/villain of the week. Seiken no Blacksmith has lots of wasted potential as the world building and magical swords are interesting when brought up, the characters that goes into focus becomes the more interesting characters once they do but it\'s brought down by that filler-character focused arc, constant faffing about and annoying running gags and hardly giving one of your main characters hardly ANY character development and being more as an active spectator than anything else and the ""read the light novel"" ending didn\'t help. There are MUCH better fantasy animes with magical swords under the same concept, Seiken no Blacksmith?...lacks in execution in many elements in which it\'s contemporaries and heck predecessors did better. think that LA said this statement, this anime would have been great!...it\'s...it\'s not. Why? well...let\'s get on with this shall we?In terms of characters, well one of the biggest problem goes to our main characters, Luke Ainsworth voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto the titular blacksmith and Cecily Cambell voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, Luke\'s problem isn\'t his character development as once his backstory and focus on during the current main plot gets, he becomes sympathetic at best and he becomes one of the more well-rounded developed character by the end of it. But the thing is when he isn\'t on screen or he is in focus, he\'s essentially the tsukommi to Cecily\'s boke or worst, he\'s just hardly in it when it doesn\'t revolve around him which is about half of the runtime!.

No, you weren\'t, no one has ever thought that, except apparently the person who thought of this show.This is a very generic anime, it has a cast of character archetypes that pretty much write themselves. The main mechanic is that swords are terrible and break pretty much right away, but this one dude can make katana, which apparently are super durable, only actually he makes weapons...by magic and they also break after like one hit. I dunno, it\'s really really silly. Not that real world logic need apply, but being very durable is not a feature of katana compared to other swords.The show also has more nudity than you\'d expect, not inherently a bad thing but it felt pretty weird alongside the tone of this show. Fan service is not a surprise here given the genre, but this has full chest nudity which seemed pretty odd. Probably worth knowing that if your gonna be watching this one with other people, which you shouldn\'t beacuse it\'s trash, but still, you\'re obviously considering it if you are reading this.Overall it\'s very mediocre and there are any number of far better anime you could be watching.

I would have loved an anime where a blacksmith helped out his allies by forging legendary blades but the ""Forging"" he has might as well have been some kind of combat skill (conjure a blade but has limited uses.) The forging aspect of Luke is for the most part ignored and instead just tool for the anime\'s plot. Now the true MC of this anime is Cecily no seriously this anime might as well been a plot of maturation for her as she has seen the most development. However as a character shes well...terrible. All those training montages...she has? No payoff for them. So many times when she takes the field I find myself emulating that megamind meme and saying ""No Martial?"" Aria would have been a monster in literally anyone else\'s hands. The ""blade conjuring skill"" (that\'s what I\'m gonna call it) has always been a consistent instant win button (yes it has weaknesses but Luke has never been put into a disadvantageous situation) and while I signed up for OP anime protag by clicking this anime, the same move kinda does end up getting stale... she has?

Men certainly still show the power, although you have to consider the time it was shot for. On the whole, there\'s still a total lack of proper transformation. Visuals are so so and almost every character is easily forgettable. I think the side characters alone are enough...reason to not want to watch this. It wasn\'t bad, but it certainly wasn\'t good.

Kasei Yakyoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4485/Kasei_Yakyoku,"['As ever, feel free to to skip most of this review down to the last paragraph before the colophon, if you want to avoid any spoiler and just know whether it is recommended by the house.~How much sacrifice are you ready to consent in the name of love? It is a simple question Kasei Yakyoku offers to answer through the pang of four characters, during a tumultuous era of Japan. KY [thank you to banish on the recess of your mind any salacious joke in relation to a certain brand of condoms] is a original Josei tale geared around the very idea of emancipation. Indeed,...the personal dilemma of Taka, Akiko, Sara and Kiyokuni hinges around it. Akiko looks to escape the confinement of the prestigious house of the Marquis Hasho, her father. At the light of the first wave feminism ideal (which is in vogue at the time) she thinks of the traditional Omiai as a dusty matchmaking device, to the dismay of Kiyokuni. Her assertive femme du monde composure breaks like a shell past the harrowing reality check, after she first interacted with the man she fell for. As for Kiyokuni, the heir of a solid banking company, he occupies an unique place in this tale for he is the only one to relinquish any vague desire of self made independence. He thinks of his arranged marriage as a necessity as much as a benediction. It highlights his complete unselfishness and then an attitude improper for a healthy romantic relationship. As for Sara, the maidservant and childhood friend of Akiko, she embodies the old-styled maiden ideal. She wants to owe nobody but ends with manifold predicaments due to her ingenuity in regards to the cruel world she steps in. Taka, the main protagonist is simply prisoner of his situation as a high-ranked mobster, whose talent to dispatch ""wordly"" affairs is much coveted by his organization\'s boss. It pretty much forged his seemingly reserved and detached character. As you notice, there is an interesting quator to weave a compelling story around. KY\'s success is heavily dependent on a right dramatization. So, does it deliver at it? Yes, it does!...This success can partly be attributed to the solid direction of Osamu Dezaki. Properly efficient at conveying a melancholic atmosphere to his pre earthquake disaster love tale, it unfolds with drawling gravity, earnest key dialogue lines and Dezaki\'s trademark use of pastel freeze frames, which accentuates a transient and yet etched intensity. While it lacks foreshadowing regarding certain questions (as how and when exactly Taka fell for his assistant\'s sister), the story holds itself well together with the limited available length it has. Probably due to time constraint, the animation can somewhat look stilted at times, which is particularly noticeable during certain action scenes. Also, the cuts to earthquake\'s countdown information would have gained in being inserted into the screenplay, rather than being simply shown with a drab static card. However, these are minor concerns and overall the cinematography aged finely thirty years later... Art direction in itself is lavish, particularly in the wake of the introduction.

It\'s as if it had two different takes and the staff was unable to choose one so included the two redundant together) the personal dilemma of Taka, Akiko, Sara and Kiyokuni hinges around it. Akiko looks to escape the confinement of the prestigious house of the Marquis Hasho, her father. At the light of the first wave feminism ideal (which is in vogue at the time) she thinks of the traditional Omiai as a dusty matchmaking device, to the dismay of Kiyokuni. Her assertive femme du monde composure breaks like a shell past the harrowing reality check, after she first interacted with the man she fell for. As for Kiyokuni, the heir of a solid banking company, he occupies an unique place in this tale for he is the only one to relinquish any vague desire of self made independence. He thinks of his arranged marriage as a necessity as much as a benediction. It highlights his complete unselfishness and then an attitude improper for a healthy romantic relationship. As for Sara, the maidservant and childhood friend of Akiko, she embodies the old-styled maiden ideal. She wants to owe nobody but ends with manifold predicaments due to her ingenuity in regards to the cruel world she steps in. Taka, the main protagonist is simply prisoner of his situation as a high-ranked mobster, whose talent to dispatch ""wordly"" affairs is much coveted by his organization\'s boss. It pretty much forged his seemingly reserved and detached character. As you notice, there is an interesting quator to weave a compelling story around. KY\'s success is heavily dependent on a right dramatization. So, does it deliver at it? Yes, it does!...This success can partly be attributed to the solid direction of Osamu Dezaki. Properly efficient at conveying a melancholic atmosphere to his pre earthquake disaster love tale, it unfolds with drawling gravity, earnest key dialogue lines and Dezaki\'s trademark use of pastel freeze frames, which accentuates a transient and yet etched intensity. While it lacks foreshadowing regarding certain questions (as how and when exactly Taka fell for his assistant\'s sister), the story holds itself well together with the limited available length it has. Probably due to time constraint, the animation can somewhat look stilted at times, which is particularly noticeable during certain action scenes. Also, the cuts to earthquake\'s countdown information would have gained in being inserted into the screenplay, rather than being simply shown with a drab static card. However, these are minor concerns and overall the cinematography aged finely thirty years later... Art direction in itself is lavish, particularly in the wake of the introduction.

Makes me wonder and eager to search more for the ideal work by Dezaki. I'm really interested and fan of two things in this: the historical period it is dealing with, and realistic anime, both in the art and storytelling. I just love these works where they try to make characters and situations look and act as real as possible, competing with films even. Curiously, plenty of such examples (and far better) are found in manga compared to anime. Imagine if this was done by a talented group specialized in noir, my rating...would definitely go higher than 6. would definitely go higher than 6."", ""I'm unsure about how I feel about this anime. The story started off well, and I found its unique approach interesting. However, halfway through the second chapter, it seemed to lose its meaning in terms of how the relationships in the story were developed. I understand it's a short anime, but it lacked context and proper character development. Everything related to the characters was quite confusing. The ending is left open to interpretation, which wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't outstanding either.One thing worth mentioning is the outstanding animation and character designs. They have a very aesthetic appeal, and I appreciate the dramatic shots...reminiscent of a Mexican soap opera. I would recommend it if you're interested in watching a perplexing love story. reminiscent of a Mexican soap opera. I would recommend it if you're interested in watching a perplexing love story."", 'With aesthetically pleasing character designs, a Taisho era setting, and intriguing tales of romance against the backdrop of a natural disaster, “Kasei Yakyoku” is a decent OVA. However, with only four episodes, it is far too short to provide necessary character development and a satisfying resolution to the story.The character-driven plot involves a rich young woman named Akiko; her maid, Sara; Kiyosumi, the wealthy banker that Akiko is being pushed to marry; and Taka, a handsome member of a crime syndicate. All of the characters, rich or poor, are restricted in some way. They yearn for freedom and independence, and think that the others have...what they lack, although those that they consider “free” are just as bound as they are. As the drama centered on these characters unfolds, and their lives intertwine, the date of the Great Kanto Earthquake inches closer. What will happen to these characters after the earthquake strikes? Will they be able to find each other and confess their honest feelings?I will go ahead and say that while the ending of the OVA does hint at some developments, it is open-ended and vague; I guess the intent was to have viewers pick up the manga afterwards to find out how the story went. (The manga appears to be out of print, by the way.)The characters are unique, and it’s interesting to see how they play off of each other. Akiko’s immaturity and naiveté can be a little grating, but it’s understandable. Sara, who arguably is the heroine of this OVA, gets fairly good character development for what little time there is for it. Kiyosumi is rather undeveloped, but he fills his role satisfactorily. Taka acts like a jerk half the time, and a kind and considerate person for the rest; his character is a bit unstable and could have benefited from more backstory.The music is decent; pleasant to listen to, but on the bland side. It does fit the tone of the series well, however. The voice acting is okay. Sometimes, it felt like the actors were speaking too quickly to try to cram as many lines in as possible (perhaps, again, due to this only being 4 episodes long). But the voices were appropriate for the characters.As for art, the character design is superb. Designed by Akio Sugino, who also designed characters from “Rose of Versailles,” the characters in “Kasei Yakyoku” have a classic Art Deco look that’s really appealing. The backgrounds look nice as well. The animation is good, but there are some parts (particularly dramatic scenes) that switch to still artistic shots for some reason, perhaps for emphasis.The basic story is solid, but the execution can be a bit off. Scene transitions are a bit rough at times, and there are some parts that just don’t blend well together. While most of the plot is carried forward logically, there are a few critical instances that rely on convenient coincidences, which strain one’s suspension of disbelief. As mentioned earlier, the ending does not conclude anything for any of the main characters, and thus is unsatisfying.Also of note, there are a few sex scenes and some mild nudity, but they are important to the plot (i.e., not strictly “fanservice”). There is also some violence, and a few of the secondary characters are killed on screen.Overall, due to the design, the characters, the setting, and the unique premise, this is an interesting OVA, although it’s difficult to recommend to a general audience due to the objectionable content and the inconclusiveness of its story.

Still, it's fun to see the gang do an old fashioned crime like a bank robbery, compared to the crazy stuff they are usually up to in these.The villain is a flashy one in this, Rasputin. A crazy monk with a gimmick where he pokes his finger into various orifices on people's faces, like their mouth or nose. He's a...very over the top evil villain, and of course he wants what is in the bank as well.Lupin's samurai pal Goemon is used very oddly in this one. He's studying meditation and whatnot under Rasputin, so he doesn't have as much fun as usual. Inspector Zenigata doesn't have much to do here either.Fujiko has some cute funny moments though, and the classic duo of Lupin and Jigen is great as always.What makes this a merely decent Lupin movie is that it just feels like random events stuck together, with little holding it together. Cars explode, people shoot at Lupin, and they're always on the run.That wouldn't be a problem if the movie relished the fun absurdity like Lupin often does, but this one lacks that feeling. This is the last special directed by Osamu Dezaki and with character design by Noboru Furuse. Which is good, because they really didn't bring enough flair to the visual department in these first four Lupin specials.All in all, this is a decent Lupin romp, though uneven and a bit lacking in style. Lupin fans should have a pleasant enough time watching this, but I'd recommend checking out the gang's other better adventures. very over the top evil villain, and of course he wants what is in the bank as well.Lupin's samurai pal Goemon is used very oddly in this one.

Lupin yanks off a woman's top in the opening scene for no reason. Mobsters play with dolls and paint their toenails for no reason. Fujiko tells a bunch of big rig truck drivers that the loves smelly unwashed men for...no reason. The Rasputin character sticks his fingers into other characters' mouths, noses, and ear-holes constantly throughout the movie for no reason. All of this in a middle of a story about tracking down the lost gold of the Romanovs? The awkward strangeness of the comedy is so far out there and over the top, even for Lupin, that it takes something away from the action and adventure aspects of the show and really comes up short at the climax compared to almost every other Lupin TV special.The art and animation are on the low end of average for a Lupin special. FRWL was made in 1992 when ink & paint animation was still in fashion, so it has that much going for it at least. Some of the special effects sequences and character faces in certain scenes were not as well animated as other Lupin anime from about the same time period, however. The director also seems to have a thing for panning over an image in the middle of an action sequence three or four times to emphasize an explosion or other special effect, which this day and age just looks cheap.The sound in the movie is positively average. Same voice cast in all the major roles since the 70's, same old theme music, appropriate but forgettable closing credit music. If there was an upside to the movie's bizarrely inappropriate antagonists, at least their voice actors gave respectable performances for the characters, however little time they may have spent on screen.The other disappointing aspect of this special is the fact that it has such a huge cast of credited characters. The whole regular cast is there, of course: Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko and Zenigata. Fujiko also has an additional partner in this movie by the name of Judy who assists the gang with the heist. There is also a pair of mercenaries trying to steal Lupin's book, the Rasputin character, two Italian mob bosses, an effeminate black market banker, a trigger-happy Texas sheriff, 20 truck drivers, and caricatures of George HW Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. Most of the secondary characters are completely flat and uninteresting, but there are so many of them and they get so many speaking lines that the main cast ends up playing an unusually small role in the story. Zenigata and Goemon particularly don't do very much in the movie and don't have very many speaking lines.Overall, From Russia With Love was okay to see one time, if for no other reason than to find out how the Lupin formula can be handled badly and not reach its full potential. There are so many other fantastic Lupin specials out there though, this one probably wouldn't be my first pick to watch with friends, and a single viewing is probably more than enough for anyone. no reason.

Whether that’s a good thing is up to you. It ticks all the boxes that most Lupin movies hit, a generic villain, a love interest, and Fujiko betraying Lupin. Goemon and Jigen are also there but neither of them really do anything entertaining or important. With that being said I still think it's a decent  Lupin movie.Let's start with the positives of Bank of Liberty. Bank of Liberty felt a lot more western than most of the Lupin movies I have seen up until this point. The art was also a lot different to most...of the other movies in the franchise as well. I’m not sure how most people feel about the art in this movie but I personally enjoyed the look of it. The music in this special was pretty normal for Lupin as well, and there are some of the same tracks on other Lupin movies as well.Now let's talk about the story. There aren't a whole lot of positives about it. There was a generic main villain, a generic and forgettable love interest, as well as a pretty generic plot. With that being said I still think that this movie was enjoyable throughout and I wasn’t ever bored throughout the hour and a half of run time.There are definitely flaws in this one. This special didn’t really innovate or expand on anything about Lupin. But maybe that's because it was one of the first specials to really kick start Lupin's yearly appearance in specials and movies. With that being said I don’t think that coming back to this movie is really going to blow anyone’s mind, but it’s still an enjoyable watch if you like generic Lupin movies.In conclusion, if you are looking at this review to try to get into Lupin then I would just tell you to watch, “Goemon Ishikawa’s Bloodshed”.

Mahou no Angel Sweet Mint,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2040/Mahou_no_Angel_Sweet_Mint,"['Mahou no Angel Sweet Mint is a pre-Sailor Moon magical girl anime.Emerald haired Mint, princess of the magic kingdom is ordered to restore beauty to the valley of flowers. The flowers there are special as they only bloom when the human world is happy. Mint thus has to leave the magic kingdom together with her pet fying penguin Waffle for some time, living with her aunt and magician Herb (most characters are named after food, plants or music), where she works at her store, the Happyness Shop.See soon befriends the adventurous (but actually pretty cowardly) boy Plum and the shy girl Nuts. Both of...them are aware of her origins and also work the shop. Another regular character, growing more important as the show progresses, is neighborhood boy Tact. He’s a lot younger than the rest of the cast and unaware of Mint’s powers.Interestingly the show does not feature a school that Mint and friends attend. Most of Mints adventures are connected to the Happiness Shop. There’s also no reoccurring antagonist, and most stories are violence free. Said stories usually revolve around a problem that Mint & friends have to solve, e.g. a bakery that closed down due to the owner losing all motivation, a bank robbery, a ghost that wants to see his old hometown again...Mint’s magic is often, but not always, the key to solving these problems. She can either use it to magnify an objects or persons special traits or to temporarly change herself into an expert of pretty much any field, e.g. baseball star, bike pro...The show was made in the early 90s but apparently designed to look just a bit older and takes place in the imaginary ToaruTown  (word play meaning roughly ""a certain town"", it appears to be 1970s-80s-ish town located in Europe) This gives it an almost fairytale like quality.The overall artwork quality leaves much to be desired, especially earlier episodes.Episode 3 marks the absolute low point of the series, with deformed limbs, proportion and perspective mistakes as well as poor animation. Luckily it never drops to that level again. If you decided to watch Mint, best skip this one and watch it at a later point.Many other episodes are high quality all around and memorable, e.g. Tact fighting for the preservation of a park, Mint’s pet Waffle running off, Mints race against time to recover her magic abilities.A general problem is that some episodes end too abruptly. This really stood out in one emotional episode where Mint is supposed to deal with a heavy loss, almost feeling like the setup for a two-parter episode, but close to the end everything just gets resolved and the episode simply ends, the events never get mentioned again.Opening and ending were sung by Hiroko Kasahara, voice actress of Mint, herself, and are memorable. (btw. the second of the two openings is extremely well drawn and a must see). Background music during the anime is generally very well done and fits the mood. Apparently there are also character songs but the CD is borderline impossible to get now.While this review highlighted a lot of the downside I can\'t stress enough how enjoyable this series was. Despite many technical flaws and a fair share of episodes that could have used more finetuning, I\'ve hardly seen anime that does the feel-good theme so well.While Mint was mainly aimed at girls, I had no problem enjoying it as male, adult viewer (just as it was the case with the 90s version of Sailor Moon). Ultimately its Mint energetic nature, Plum’s and Tact’s antics, Nut’s good heart and the overall positive message that people can be good and get along that sold me on this.Mint is a show to watch with your family, or a dear one, or something to enjoy before going to bed to erase the memories of a frustrating day. I give this weill made hidden gem a clear recommendation. them are aware of her origins and also work the shop.

Said stories usually revolve around a problem that Mint & friends have to solve, e.g. a bakery that closed down due to the owner losing all motivation, a bank robbery, a ghost that wants to see his old hometown again...Mint’s magic is often, but not always, the key to solving these problems. She can either use it to magnify an objects or persons special traits or to temporarly change herself into an expert of pretty much any field, e.g. baseball star, bike pro...The show was made in the early 90s but apparently designed to look just a bit older and takes place in the imaginary ToaruTown  (word play meaning roughly ""a certain town"", it appears to be 1970s-80s-ish town located in Europe) This gives it an almost fairytale like quality.The overall artwork quality leaves much to be desired, especially earlier episodes.Episode 3 marks the absolute low point of the series, with deformed limbs, proportion and perspective mistakes as well as poor animation. Luckily it never drops to that level again. If you decided to watch Mint, best skip this one and watch it at a later point.Many other episodes are high quality all around and memorable, e.g. Tact fighting for the preservation of a park, Mint’s pet Waffle running off, Mints race against time to recover her magic abilities.A general problem is that some episodes end too abruptly. This really stood out in one emotional episode where Mint is supposed to deal with a heavy loss, almost feeling like the setup for a two-parter episode, but close to the end everything just gets resolved and the episode simply ends, the events never get mentioned again.Opening and ending were sung by Hiroko Kasahara, voice actress of Mint, herself, and are memorable. (btw. the second of the two openings is extremely well drawn and a must see). Background music during the anime is generally very well done and fits the mood. Apparently there are also character songs but the CD is borderline impossible to get now.While this review highlighted a lot of the downside I can\'t stress enough how enjoyable this series was. Despite many technical flaws and a fair share of episodes that could have used more finetuning, I\'ve hardly seen anime that does the feel-good theme so well.While Mint was mainly aimed at girls, I had no problem enjoying it as male, adult viewer (just as it was the case with the 90s version of Sailor Moon). Ultimately its Mint energetic nature, Plum’s and Tact’s antics, Nut’s good heart and the overall positive message that people can be good and get along that sold me on this.Mint is a show to watch with your family, or a dear one, or something to enjoy before going to bed to erase the memories of a frustrating day. I give this weill made hidden gem a clear recommendation.']"
Mahou Shoujo Ore,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36902/Mahou_Shoujo_Ore,"['Princess Tutu? Madoka? Cardcaptor Sakura? Yeah, these are all cool and shit, but at the end of the day, little girls are only in the way when manly men are in town.From the director of \'The Legend of the Legendary Heroes\' comes the next masterpiece of badass and bro, Mahou Shoujo Ore. Show about cool delinquents and crazy GAR motherfuckers who turn into magical girls and save the day from the evilest things with the power of friendship. By friendship, I mean the power of bro because these are manly men and not ponies.The story along pretty much everything else follows the similarly generic...mahou shoujo theme. The difference being in the completely comical approach. This can be seen as a parody towards mahou shoujo in similar way as the shonen rom-com series \'Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun\' was a parody towards shojo series. When comparing to mahou shoujo in generally, Ore is much more mature, less sweet and not as girly due to its initial target audience being young adult males. It also contains gender-bending and humor typically seen in shonen comedy series.The art is pretty cool. I especially liked those shots about mahou shoujo transformations, as well as the scenery where characters stood against nature\'s backdrop and the setting sun was used to make them look like GAR-jesus from low angle. The art is used frankly rather well to capture what this show essentially is about. A lot is put into the details, be it persons hair taking a heart-shape for a second or weird muscle-creature smirking in the background.The music is often quite uplifting and adds to the atmosphere. I have zero complains about the voice acting. Also I die of laughter when our Yakuza-bro says ""Love Power Index"" with the deepest and most alpha voice imaginable.I enjoy manly and bro things, and badass comedy, so this show is really made for me. I can pretty much recommend this to anyone who tends to like bizarre and over the top comedy. Especially the fans of \'Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\' should check this out ASAP. mahou shoujo theme.

Especially the fans of \'Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\' should check this out ASAP.', ""Magical Bros turned out a way better and funnier than anticipated (or Mahou Shoujo Ore if you prefer). It's a thoroughly entertaining, if slightly uneven, magical girl parody that has plenty of funny meta-jokes, self-aware commentary, and a cast of likable characters. Perhaps its source material simply wasn’t long enough to be adapted into 12 episodes, but aside from some sluggish pacing around the series midpoint, it's a worthwhile watch.Even now, the plot synopsis sounds like a crazy fever dream. The first two episodes are supremely ridiculous parodies of a typical intro to a magical girl series. Protagonist Saki plays the straight man in...a world of insanity, with hilarious well-timed reaction faces and her perfectly dumbfounded voice performance. Her mom already knows magical girls exist because she was one, contracted by the same scary yakuza guy who’s trying to sign on Saki. Even Saki's singing partner in their up incoming idol duo, Sakuyo, and their manager were totally chill with her magical girl transformation. Oh yeah, she transforms into a burly dude in a dress. Instead of using magic, she has to use her stick to beat the shit out of demons in bloody brawls complete with pixelated piles of bodies to censor the carnage.At first, it’s really funny to see how quickly everyone accepts her demon-fighting form as normal while she continues to freak out. This joke wears off as the show progresses, settling into a stable level of absurdity to give the story a chance to flesh out its characters. The show loves to make the joke of how much carnage magical girls would actually have to cause if they didn’t have flashy light effects, it comes up whenever Saki has to save everyday citizens from legions of fluffy demons. At the start of the show Saki has a typical fairy-like mascot flying around her while she dreams about becoming a magical girl and having her love interest Mohiro fawn over her; only to hilariously awoke to a ludicrous reality where her mascot is the mini yakuza guy floating around her and unable to even look at Mohiro without foaming at the mouth like your average horny harem protagonist dude.It’s not until both Saki and Sakuyo gain magical girl powers that they go from being total failures of aspiring idols (not one fan at their barren roadside concert) that they actually gain popularity. Seeing Saki’s offbeat singing pair with Sakuyo’s comparatively great performance is quite funny, especially when their manager bluntly criticizes how terrible she is. Thankfully the show gives him more screen time to become someone who’s actually likable, we understand why he’s so critical and wants to see them succeed by the end which makes the greatest development the series has to offer.Also, there’s a lot of singing in the first few episodes, the first sign that they’re stalling for a time due to the meager 12 chapter manga being adapted. The singing was good unless it’s intentionally off-key then it’s quite goofy, Mohiro and his idol partner Hyoue were shown performing the show’s great ed song on a tv behind the girl’s empty streetside performance. Perfectly showing how far they have to go to catch up to Saki’s love interest who’s also Sakuyo’s brother.Their relationship quickly becomes something like a love triangle with Saki in love with Mohiro, Sakuyo in love with Saki, and Mohiro in love with Saki’s manly form. It’s sometimes cute to see but also the show occasionally portrays Sakuyo’s gayness as a threat to Saki (there was even a bad rape joke with Saki in bed crying while Sakuyo in manly form looming over her with a cigar). However, like most jokes in the show as it appears more often with increasing stakes it gets better. By the end, she becomes less of a threat and balances out to someone who’s trying to actually protect who they care about. It’s not a good portrayal of a gay character, but at least it doesn’t actively prevent you from enjoying the comedy.Ore takes any chance it can get to poke fun at the magical girl genre, idols, and the anime industry. It points out all of the glaring troubles idols face like not being allowed to date, the age limit, the extreme contract guidelines, and how they have to meet and shake hands with anyone (oh god the condensed milk joke). Also, like any good absurdist comedy, it's surprising and does whatever it can to subvert your expectations to maintain your interest. Whether it be a joke playing out differently than you first anticipating, or even the story taking a direction as opposed to where it hinted it might go.The show also takes a whack at Kamen Rider the hero icon that was stomped out when Magical Girls became popular. The recurring character Ichigo Fujimoto is basically the embodiment of a modern Kamen Rider, living in a run-down apartment, having to make his costume out of trash, constantly being forgotten. He angrily scolds Saki for being one of those weak magical girls just annoyingly lingers around her from time to time. Like most of the supporting cast, he’s an entertaining digression from the main duo’s dynamic.It's clear that Mahou Shoujo Ore didn't have the highest budget. The animation is typically lacking, with lots of camera shaking and so-so background art, but typically they make the best out of what they have. Whenever characters are drawn with the simpler style they're always expressing some over-the-top emotion like a typical reaction face would, so it saves money and improves the jokes. There’s plenty of jokes on the meager animation budget too; a monster that turns the backgrounds black and white, the camera cutting to the 'nice boat' meme during bloody action scenes, most hilariously the art quality being lowered to toddler level for one of the conflicts, and how episode 5 is a riff on the animation studio producing the show.The episode-long digression the show takes to rag on Studio Pierrot is funny and well made, but it has practically nothing to do with the show! It handles the Godzilla plotline even better than its latest anime incarnation, the monster representing an animator who just wanted the latest episode of Mahou Shoujo Ore to be released on time. Even so, this episode came out of nowhere and didn't develop any part of the story or characters. There's a lot of downtime in this show, so much so that it makes you wonder why they didn't shorten it to 10 episodes. The Godzilla episode was totally unnecessary, the hot springs episode was literally one joke for 10 minutes, so much singing, and the 'anime original' idol duo is just a copy and paste of Saki and Sakuyo but with less development. For all the time that Mahou Shoujo Ore wastes, it's mostly good content, and even when it's stalling out the plot progression it's still watchable.Mahou Shoujo Ore knows the limits of its budget and makes an enjoyable time out of it. I wish the insanity from the first few episodes was more present in the rest of the show, but I feel like I will remember this series more for the time it gave to develop the characters. Rather than leaving them as the one-note stereotypes meant to riff on similar shows, it surprises you and makes you want to see what absurd situation they'll be put in next. a world of insanity, with hilarious well-timed reaction faces and her perfectly dumbfounded voice performance.

And to be frank, parody anime as a whole is a tricky business: jokes being repeated to exhaustion, plots that refuse to go anywhere (when it can afford to have a proper plot to begin with) and characters who are just basic archetypes tend to be the ground rule, which means the number of parody anime that manages to be something more than a bunch of random gags stitched together is ridiculously small. Binan Koukou Chikyuu Boueibu...LOVE!, which also tackles the mahou shoujo/magical girl genre, made great use of its clichés in its first season a few years ago, while others like Hatsukoi Monster aimed to obliterate shoujo conventions, but in the end turned out to be nothing sort of a nonsensical mess.Thankfully, Mahou Shoujo Ore delivers much more than a glorious synopsis. It suffers from some of the problems I’ve mentioned earlier, especially since the plot struggled a bit to fulfill a 12 episode run, but it still manages to stand on its own two (muscular) feet. In fact, it’s a pretty solid parody title, perhaps even finding its way into the classic mahou shoujo canon someday.Still, the road traveled wasn’t always the most pleasant: things were rocky not only for our protagonists, but also for the show’s audience.“Unpopular female idols transform into brawny men in miniskirts in order to fight cuddly but evil demons” is the main gimmick here and the basis for most of the jokes, with commentary on idol groups and the anime industry appearing every so often. The comedy hits more than it misses, but since humor is subjective, you may find yourself scratching your head more than chuckling on some episodes given how inconsistent the jokes are.The first two episodes (aired back to back when the anime first premiered) are among the best structured, perfectly introducing the plot while delivering some solid laughs. A good amount of the humor is presented on how the animation for both the action scenes and character expressions are made to be pretty crude and abrupt compared to your average flashy mahou shoujo anime. The girls’ mascot turning out to be a scary looking yakuza with a soft heart is the best example of this. There’s a good amount of references which range from well-placed to “what was even that”, but they don’t overstay their welcome and are usually over rather quick. Still, this may test the viewer’s patience as the episodes go by.Animation is pretty crisp, the main focus obviously being the attractive muscular men that protagonists Saki and Sakuyo turn themselves into, but the aforementioned character expressions are also a treat to watch. The way the show makes fun of itself when they deliver some bad animated sequences is hilarious on its own, but when you realize it’s the same studio that gave us the extremely rushed and poorly animated Tokyo Ghoul:re adaptation, the irony is just too funny. Episode 5 goes as far as comparing Studio Pierrot Plus with a Godzilla-esque creature, showing that the writers clearly don’t give a f*ck.The characters are something of a mixed bag. They hardly change from the first episode to the last end card, to be quite honest. Character progression is still present though, albeit quite faintly, but it feels like it was tossed on to make the plot move forward for the most part. Saki and Sakuyo are likable enough for this to not be a major problem, but I can’t say much for the rest of the cast, although they aren't necessarily bad. While Saki's mom goes on to have an episode just to focus on her retirement as a magical girl, other characters like the male idol duo STAR PRINCE is basically there as plot conveniences, and this sucks quite a bit considering one of their members is both Sakuyo’s older brother and Saki’s crush.Voice acting is on point, with solid performances from the whole cast, though personally I feel that Kouji Yusa was underused as Hyuoe, with his best contribution being the vocals to some of the songs present in the anime. The opening track was the most generic song I’ve heard all season, but maybe the show was spoofing how simple your average mahou shoujo song is (WE MUST GO DEEPER!).The ending song fares a bit better and was stuck in my head for a while, not going to lie.Much like its protagonists, Mahou Shoujo Ore’s trump card is its charisma, which shines through even when the pacing is flimsy or the jokes are lacking. This is because it’s evident that the writers are having the time of their lives coming up with these (seemly) random situations. Every episode had at least one thing that I liked, be small jokes on the contracts the characters had to sign or the satire of idol “meet and greet” events, it has something for both new and veteran anime fans.Even if the series pokes fun at nearly anything, at the same, it feels like a love letter to the anime industry, embracing all the good and bad aspects of the medium. The confusing, but ultimately rewarding fifth episode showcases that very well, resulting in an inspired, lunatic masterwork that matches shows such as Gintama and South Park at their best. Name another anime which aired this season that referenced/made fun of Pokemon Go, anime production issues, School Days and the United States of America (and not just as throwaway gags, as this all contributed to the plot) in the span of twenty minutes. Yeah, even if you’re Barack Obama, you can’t.I enjoyed the heck off of this show (even with all its faults), particularly since I watched it with a good friend, and we breezed through these 12 episodes together always wondering what the hell would happen next. As much as it is silly, Mahou Shoujo Ore manages to stay unpredictable and vibrant from beginning to end.At the end of its run, I’m left satisfied for the most part. It’s a little show that is oozing with ideas and social commentary, even if some of it does gets lost among repeated gags and slow pacing. It didn’t turn out to be Madoka Magika part 4… but then again, who REALLY needs another Madoka Magika title?!

A young girl finds out that her mom was a Magical Girl but can no longer do her job so she takes her mother's place. In this series Magical Girls have the bodies of men since they are built for fighting. A key plot point is that there are really complicated ties between characters. The main three characters love one another but in different physical forms but don't know it. This creates a lot of tension and opportunities for awkward/funny skits which are really well done.ART: 9The art is great. It is consistent, the coloring,...effects, and detail is well managed and alone makes it worth watching. The animators do get to have fun with some of the facial expressions as this is a comedy.SOUND: 8Nothing to complain or cheer about.

Mahou Shoujo Ore now fills the box for ""Mahou Shoujo"" parody, but does it do the genre justice?Story: Mahou Ore starts out like a generic SoL anime, with your main character who has an unnatural hair colour and their love interest. The whole build up to the magical girl contract is also pretty standard, but the small gimmicks are what set this show apart from the regular genre\'s main entries. Instead of there being magical girls for one generation, it seems that it\'s now a generational thing, with Saki and her mom both becoming one. Now,...aside from the gimmicks, the story itself isn\'t one that really feels set apart from anything I\'ve seen so far. All that happens is that they go and fight demons, have some memeable moments, then move on. Sometimes, this just ends up feeling like I\'m watching something like Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu again or something. Overall, the story is just eh.Art: It\'s 2018, so art is basically good throughout, which is still correct for this show. However, the art is only just good. Nothing stands out in terms of backgrounds or fight scenes that much, but the small effects are what seem to have a bigger focus. Instead of animating a large budget fight, why not add some gag blood effects while we pan across an audience\'s horrified faces? This just comes off as trying to save time into other scenes, but these scenes do need some attention as well. The moods are present in scenes, but honestly, everything needs to be a bit more detailed with art. However, despite these flaws, I did find some fun in character expressions. The minimalist, almost Saitama approach to these characters really reflect the awkwardness and tension within a scene.Sound: Theme song is pretty good, but I\'m going to talk about voices more. The voices in this show are well done, with the male voices really shining out of them all. As their regular selves, Saki and Sakuyo sound pretty normal, with pretty typical lifelike reactions, but as magical girls, the other voices show more emotion in my opinion. As a male, Saki becomes more expressive when showing awkwardness and confusion, and Sakuyo just sounds like a shounen anime protag that just wants to profess his love to his love. However, what I find to be very enjoyable is best boy Kokoro-chan. Something about magical girl terminology coming out of a yazuka member sounding person just seems to bring me joy. But anyways, the sound is something that\'s good, but not anything extremely amazing.Character: Wew lad, character. Being a gag anime, character is more or less something that can be tossed at the side. They do this, but it\'s justified. Although character development isn\'t needed past telling us who the characters are, and maybe a little bit about them, I usually want to see the extra, juicy info. I\'m fine with what they gave us here, but I can\'t go off of much for the characters besides the fact that they like someone, and want to be able to protect that person.Enjoyment: Despite my criticisms, I do enjoy this show. The tiny sprinkles that are put into episodes are in the form of the art, side scenes, and much more. These all come together to allow me to watch this show and be able to enjoy each strange gimmick in a way that doesn\'t overwhelm, or underwhelm. There\'s also a good balance between serious and joking in this show, with little bits of both mixed in with both. Your serious scenes have sprinkles of meme moments, making you remember that this is just a joke anime, but also letting you enjoy the scenes that shouldn\'t be all about comedy.Overall: Mahou Shoujo Ore is just one of those parody animes that feel like they can go somewhere, but you know that they probably won\'t. The story is average, and the art is charming in portions, rather than throughout. However, the little gimmicks that are placed throughout the episodes do keep me watching (and also my no drop policy).Verdict: Would I recommend this anime? Depends on the person. If you\'re fine with parody animes and know that the entire purpose of them is to poke fun at a genre, then I\'d say to go for it. However, if you\'re here for a regular anime with a storyline, character development, and backstories, then this show probably isn\'t for you. There were many things that could have been done better in this show, but only time will tell us what\'s going to happen next for Saki and friends. aside from the gimmicks, the story itself isn\'t one that really feels set apart from anything I\'ve seen so far. All that happens is that they go and fight demons, have some memeable moments, then move on. Sometimes, this just ends up feeling like I\'m watching something like Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu again or something. Overall, the story is just eh.Art: It\'s 2018, so art is basically good throughout, which is still correct for this show. However, the art is only just good. Nothing stands out in terms of backgrounds or fight scenes that much, but the small effects are what seem to have a bigger focus. Instead of animating a large budget fight, why not add some gag blood effects while we pan across an audience\'s horrified faces?

Magical Girl.. it's a genre. I personally never watched any Magical Girl anime and I am not planning to do so, but I was pretty surprised with Mahou Shoujo Ore. It is a parody of the Magical Girl genre, but even as a non-watcher of the Magical Girl genre this anime is still enjoyable. Grab you microphones and get ready to kick some ass, this is my review of Mahou Shoujo Ore.Story: 7/10The story is as basic as you can get, but...with it being a parody it has a twist. Saki and Sakuyo wants to become a idol just like Mohiro (stick with me). Saki wants to become a idol like Mihiro because she is in love with her (trust me, stick with me). When Saki discovers that her mom was once a Magical Girl, she insists of becoming one too (just trust me). So she becomes one... but the twist is if she is a Magical Girl, she turns into a sexy guy. On top of that, Mohiro falls in love with the guy form of Saki. To add more to the mess, when Sakuyo becomes a Magical Girl (if you can still call it that), she confesses to Saki. With all of that, Saki and Sakuyo must defeat evil to protect Mohiro.The story is still pretty basic, but it is ridiculous enough to be enjoyable.Animation: 6/10I will be in the minority here, but I think it is clearly that this anime had a tight budget. While the action scenes look really good, the rest suffers from it with stiff and choppy animations. It is especially apparent in the first half of episode 3 where the mouth animations are just laughable. I can’t really harshly criticize Mahou Shoujo Ore for it, but it’s a mild annoyance.Music: 8/10I really like the music. The background music is a mix of Pop and Jazz and it is just a joy to my ears. Also the OP is fantastic.Characters: 7/10Not much depth, but that is not a bad thing. This anime clearly isn’t focused on the deepness of the characters. Saki is a girly girl that has dreams on becoming a idol, Sakuyo is nice and gay and Mohiro is also nice and gay. Again, not really deep characters, but for a parody it doesn’t need them.Enjoyment: 8/10This is the good part. The humor in Mahou Shoujo Ore is really good. Even if you can’t pick up the tropes that Mahou Shoujo Ore parodies, the sheer ridiculousness and insanity in this anime is enough to make you laugh.Overall: 7/10This is a anime worth watching. It’s kinda like Pop Team Epic only it has humor that everyone can enjoy. Pro Tip: Skip the first half of episode 1. Thank me later. with it being a parody it has a twist. Saki and Sakuyo wants to become a idol just like Mohiro (stick with me). Saki wants to become a idol like Mihiro because she is in love with her (trust me, stick with me).

I really don't really get the anime at all .Its like a big joke at all dialogues scenes are so cliche that in some way you probably feel you just watching any other anime but in the same time is totally bizarre the setting with jojo's mahou shoujo with dreamy fairy-yakuzas trying to become the idols that everyone want to be.It's a story about how Love can change someone and where ambitions can take someone.The episodes 5 and 10 are in totally diferente level of the others...i think in these two you can really grasp the meaning of deconstruction of the genre of mahou shoujo even madoka couldn't achieve that.The episode 12 Mahou Shoujo Watashi is when shit get real. The name WATASHI and all the meanings behind EVEN Evangelion doesn't have that much symbolism. Maybe the problems with the site don't give us the information but i really think Hideaki Ano and Hayao Myazaki worked in this masterpiece.The illustrations of Monokuma in the ending are really incredible.Maybe you'll like the anime just don't watch with big expectations..

Love POWER."", 'A parody of the popular magical girl genre.Was it good? Not exactly. Actually, this show had some opportunities for success. The concept of a girl turning into a guy in a magical girl parody show isn\'t that bad. However, they seem to lose focus a lot. There isn\'t a lot of creativity when generating the scenarios of the episodes. For a parody and comedy show, it falls short completely. I mean, I\'ll admit, there are some scenes that are funny, but overall, it\'s pretty bad. There\'s just a lot of ""fluff"" and actual action, believe it or not, among all the episodes. Plus, there\'s...a bunch of side characters that get entire arcs that are plain bad, like the mother arc, prisma arc, and the fujimoto arc. I just feel like the main cast isn\'t involved in those because the people making the show were running out of ideas what to write about. Honestly, if the episode scenarios weren\'t so bland, I think this show could have been very good. But instead, I just get some boring episodes. I mean, even the comedy isn\'t that bad. There are some good laughs out of those episodes, but the way the episodes turn out are just really predictable and mundane. You\'d think a show focusing on comedy would have comedy, but I feel like there is more fighting than in an actual magical girl show. It doesn\'t focus on comedy, which is just a shame. Especially the ending, it tries to be comedic, but they really pushed it with the action.The characters aren\'t so bad, but Sakuyo is actually just hella boring. First of all, she only has a real personality when she transforms, and overall, there is practically nothing dedicated to her, other than the backstory we get. She\'s one of the main characters, come on. Do something with her, rather than just having her as an add on to Saki. However, most characters aren\'t bad. They just don\'t get much of a time to shine, since the plot is so boring.Unfortunately, poor storytelling does none of the characters justice, and this anime would be lifted much higher, if it only had better episode layouts. a bunch of side characters that get entire arcs that are plain bad, like the mother arc, prisma arc, and the fujimoto arc.

Whether a show is a slice of life or a shonen series, they want to be different from the rest. To stand out. Sometimes, the anime goes as far as to make fun of the genre they exist in. Creating a meta sort of show. Magical Girl Ore is a satire of the magical girl genre. Magical Girl Ore is about a startup idol named Saki partnered with her best friend Sakuyo. Although Saki isn’t very good at singing or dancing, she is determined to become closer to her love, and Sakuyo’s brother,...Mohiro, who is a successful male idol. One day, Saki finds out that her mother is a magical girl and she meets her yakuza looking contractor fairy. The same day, her love Mohiro gets kidnapped by buff but cute demons, and Saki makes a contract to become a magical girl. Although, a young girls body won’t do when trying to defeat demons. So instead, powered by her love for Mohiro, transforms into her magical girl form, which is a huge muscular manly man. Along the way, Sakuyo also becomes a magical girl. Their manager, a magical girl fanatic, sees their transformation and decides to make them into an idol unit.Magical Girl Ore was pretty hype this anime season. Described as a fantasy, comedy, magic show. People were reasonably surprised at the manly early JoJo-esque man that seemed to be crossdressing as a magical girl, the show. During the first couple episodes, I saw that this show was poking fun at itself. It was a self aware parody that didn’t take itself seriously. Aside from the obvious genderbended magical girls, the show goes into the classic running with toast in mouth, the fact that they don’t really use magic items and use various weapons to bludgeon the demons to death. It's a subversion in every sense of the word. It gets wilder from there.The animation is average, but the art is both similar but very distinctive to other magical girl shows. The music also mimics what’s normally in these types of shows. This is also the case with Saki’s personality, but that’s as far as that goes. Sakuyo’s deeply in love with her that borders on stalking. Their manager is a magical girl fanatic and legitimate fanboy. The yakuza fairy is meant to be one of the trademark mascots of these types of shows, even with his gruff exterior.I would recommend this show to those who already know some things about the magical girl genre. All to better laugh when this show takes it in a different direction. Despite that, there’s a reason to watch it just because of its comedy. I give this show a 7 out of 10.

This isn't to say that fans of classic magical girls won't find enjoyment in it, too, however. There's plenty to love,...from a wide cast of amusing characters to fun music and competent animation. The staples of the magical girl genre are parodied and then some, with just as many jokes often falling into poking fun at typical anime tropes. Sentai? Godzilla? It's all there. And more importantly, it's all funny.The plot, while terribly predictable, holds up well thanks to the humorous slant on everything that happens. The attempts at suspense are almost embarrassing, but do little to dampen one's enjoyment. The sincerity the characters show between slapstick and gags can be surprisingly genuine as well, with the climax managing to be downright touching. Some episodes in the middle may fail to hold up to scrutiny, and the quality dips occasionally with what can feel like filler episodes, but the strong opening and satisfying close make them worth the watch nonetheless.It may not be perfect, but what Magical Girl Ore tries to do, it does with aplomb. from a wide cast of amusing characters to fun music and competent animation.

It\'s a major cringefest from start to end. The main idea here is moronic characters, being fairly self-aware and the surrealistic setting. It pokes fun at the standard mahou shoujo stuff with girls who transform into macho men and beat things bloody with physical items or fists. I mean, it\'s pretty much what you\'d get when you think ""what if we took the standard mahou shoujo trope and reversed pretty much everything to the complete opposite?"". So, instead of cute girls, we have macho men, instead of cute mascots, we have creepy yakuza-like mascots, instead of...magical beams and magic wands, we have wands made for physical lashing, instead of the pretty fluffy way enemies are supposed to be defeated in, we get a lot of blood and censored bodies, instead of ugly, warped monsters, we have cute mascot-like demons/monsters.Well, you get the idea. So, it\'s all kind of flipped around and that\'s the thing this show is going for, having little to no other interesting parts about it. It was fairly amusing, but giving it more than a 6 is honestly impossible, especially as I was getting more and more bored towards the end(not to mention that even after a few episodes around the middle, there was already an episode or two that I just wanted to end already while I watched it, might\'ve been complete filler episodes though). It relies on surrealism and breaking conventions to the point where once you get used to it, it\'s just kind of boring. The jokes themselves aren\'t really that creative or good, it\'s just a wacky comedy that would\'ve done better with twelve ten minute episodes(since the manga is just 12 chapters, that would\'ve truly been a much better way to do things). Twelve full length episodes from 12 fairly average in length chapters... There\'s a lot of fillers to go around. Yeah, reading the manga might be a better experience, could probably read it all in an hour easily instead of wasting a bit more than four hours on watching this thing, sadly it\'s not completely translated.Well, that\'s what this show is about. Oh, I kind of found the love/romance part to be annoying, might as well mention that as well. ""Love power"" is the power source of these girls(surprise, surprise), so all of them have to love someone a lot to be able to transform. This gives us a situation where everyone is in love with someone else. What this author decided to do was to, probably for the sake of comedy, make all of them fall in love with someone who doesn\'t love them. Kind of like, this girl loves that guy, that guy loves/likes a transformed magical girl and then we have magical girls loving other magical girls. The author made it like this for the sake of comedy but this means none of them actually end up together or has any chance to, it ends up feeling a bit tragic. By the end, we still have no relationships whatsoever going on and it feels somewhat lackluster and disappointing. There\'s also a lot of plot holes present, which can be frustrating to some people even if they didn\'t watch it for any story or plot. At least I wish they would\'ve told us a bit more about certain characters who were just skipped over after making a big entry as if they were important, like fujimoto the self-proclaimed cyborg. What was even up with that guy? The author got us interested in his backstory and then just completely stopped using him, urgh.So, 6/10 is me being generous because it was fairly amusing despite the many flaws.

I'm not going to reiterate the synopsis of the show, but this is essentially a satire of the magical girl genre. You got cute girls turning into burly magical men and demons that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime. Already sounds odd and hilarious right?But it goes deeper than that: enemies that disrupt animation, Godzilla(?), sauna competition, using the magical girl rod to literally beat enemies to a pulp, Yakuza fairies.... the list goes on.For me the...show was a mixed bag. Ya, it's funny with the gender bending magical girls, but the novelty got old for me about halfway through. The show in my opinion was best when it was completely random and off the wall (my favorite episode was the Godzilla episode). It was trying to make fun of a lot of magical girl and idol tropes, but it also felt like it didn't always succeed in its delivery. It felt pretty repetitive at times and in some ways it fell victim to some of the tropes it was trying to make fun of. It didn't take itself seriously, which is the point, but it also didn't take its comedy too seriously which left this show feeling dry.Just because you're using overused tropes and showing how boring and stupid they can be doesn't mean it's any easier to watch if it's not executed well. I felt like this show should have really amped up the satire and comedy and make it even more crazy and out of nowhere. During the Godzilla episode I was wondering what the hell I was watching, but it was absolutely hilarious, I was dying during that episode. I wish there was more of that. Most of the time though the comedy felt flat and some times it was excruciating to watch because of how boring it'd get. But at random points in the show it'd throw a curve ball at you that'd keep me entertained just enough until the next curve ball came. But overall I didn't feel too satisfied once I reached the end.In terms of satire, ludicrousness, and comedy, I was let down, this is definitely no Space Patrol Luluco.For the characters, they're not much to write home about. They fulfill their roles fine for the show, nothing much more to say about them. The MC is about what you'd expect out of a magical girl MC, but it's different since she turns into a muscular man which makes it kind of funny (some of those camera angles though lmao, there's definitely manservice in this show). There's a complicated love triangle that's kind of assuming and some of the side characters are funny too, but are mainly pretty forgettable. The art and animation is pretty average, not much to say here. The episodes with the intentionally bad animation was pretty funny though.To sum it up, I wouldn't really recommend this show to anyone unless you're just dying to watch some macho men in magical girl outfits with some crazy antics and a lot of pokes at the magical girl genre. In terms of comedy, there's not a lot of great material here and the delivery was hit and miss, even for some of the better episodes (Godzilla episode was great though). This was an interesting experiment that seemed like it was a lot of fun to make, but in a lot of ways I feel like it fell felt and didn't have much else to offer besides its main selling point: burly men in magical girl outfits. But maybe, that's all it ever wanted to be. show was a mixed bag. Ya, it's funny with the gender bending magical girls, but the novelty got old for me about halfway through. The show in my opinion was best when it was completely random and off the wall (my favorite episode was the Godzilla episode). It was trying to make fun of a lot of magical girl and idol tropes, but it also felt like it didn't always succeed in its delivery. It felt pretty repetitive at times and in some ways it fell victim to some of the tropes it was trying to make fun of. It didn't take itself seriously, which is the point, but it also didn't take its comedy too seriously which left this show feeling dry.Just because you're using overused tropes and showing how boring and stupid they can be doesn't mean it's any easier to watch if it's not executed well.

There is honestly nothing to say about this anime, I can't comment on it, because I'm not sure the maker could explain what happens in this anime, but I'll try.The idea is that Saki, a 15 year old, is a (not very good) idol and (really really bad) singer trying to make it big to impress her can kinda not really talk childhood friend Mohiro, with her gay for her regardless of gender friend, Sakuyo.

MahoYome,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36502/MahoYome,"[""MahoYome is a collection of 24 short chibi animations. Instead of the mystery feel of The Ancient Magus' Bride, these shorts instead focus on comedy which they do surprisingly well. The events that happen in the shorts are mostly unrelated to the main anime and don't add anything to its story.The animation in the shorts isn't great because it's chibi figures moving around but the colours used are very vibrant which works pretty well and makes it more bearable. The voice acting is just fine and there's often some background music creating a similar atmosphere to the main anime.Overall it can be fun...to watch if you like the characters and don't mind the switch from mystery to comedy. The entire ONA is less than 30 minutes so even if you don't like the type of humor, it's not like you've lost a lot of time. to watch if you like the characters and don't mind the switch from mystery to comedy.

Mai-HiME: Kuro no Mai/Saigo no Bansan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8062/Mai-HiME__Kuro_no_Mai_Saigo_no_Bansan,"[""First, let me say that I gave this a 10, simply because I'm a big fan of the franchize and, surely, this special was pretty entertaining and nostalgic somehow. As I review, I'll give more suited rating.Story: It's a beach episode, actually. Yes, the good, old, never-getting-old beach episodes. But putting that aside, it revolves around tormenting Reito. Now's the time to say - if you haven't completed Mai-HiME, don't watch this. You won't get a thing. Now I must say, of all the specials I've seen, this is the most entertaining so far, it was funny, sort of a parody and hillarious. Some may...not like that a lot of characters don't have lines and the special is only about the humour though. It was a simple story filled with smiles - Let's say an 8 ;)Art: I personally think, that the art is even more beautiful than the art in the anime itself. The animation was smooth, the shadows and light effects were nice, everything was drawn so well. There's this one scene though, when Reito turns back and looks at Mai and Mikoto - they got a little lazy there and it doesn't look alright. Still, a perfect 9/10 from me. This is by far, the special with the most awesome art I've seen up to date. And that's saying something.OST: Well, nothing new here, but if you're familliar with the soundtrack for Mai-HiME - then you shouldn't doubt that this gets a 10/10 from me. Also, never have I seen so many songs included in just one 4 minute special. Watch it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. The VAs did an awesome job as always, too.Characters: 9/10 Well, my only complain is that not everyone had their chance to shine, sadly. But still, for the 4 minutes at our disposal, the characters totally will grow on you once again. Everyone's acting like usual, but that's not always a bad thing. At the end of the special, I was already sobbing that there's no 2 season. They will make you feel nostalgic, that's for sure. Oh, and, Mai is acting pretty funny at the beginning so she actually made me like her a bit more, even though I'm not a fan of hers. And what's more - the heroine that brings me nuts /I'll save it for myself who she is/ actually didn't disturb me at all this time. It's all so nice and calmy; Perhaps you'll forgive those you hate, too. Even if just this once. Did I mention we have fanservice? Smoothly animated, too.Enjoyment:10/10  Well, I'm a Mai-HiME fangirl, so I didn't expect less. I knew I would enjoy it but really, it was even greater than I expected. If you are also a big fan like me, you'll most probably enjoy it.

Mamotte Shugogetten!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/626/Mamotte_Shugogetten,"[""I can't believe I finished this anime. Why? Well first of all, it's not the kind of anime I would watch. The way the characters were drawn were a bit sub par for me (and there were occassions when Takashi's hair was miscolored) the color pallette used was a bit too tacky and it looked kinda old and dowdy for some reason. I just finished it because that's the way I am - I finish what I start.I have to say though that watching it was a bit too painful at times. Some episodes were just so bad, like the episode were Shaorin first went...to school. let me tell you - it was bad. It was so boring I find myself half asleep and not bothering to understand the situation fully. There were episodes that were ok, like the one where Takashi, Tasuke's friend, accidentally took with him Shaorin's uniform. That was an episode that gave me a lot of laughs.It did remind me of Ranma 1/2. I would say it was a combination of Ranma and Ah! My Goddess, but the problem was the execution. It was executed poorly and it wasn't nearly as good as the two series I mentioned. I think it was the bad storylines - I just thought that some of the topics were shallow.The music was the first thing that got me to watch the anime. The opening and ending sequence showed Tasuke and Shaorin singing the songs, and apparently it takes that much to impress me. I realized later that the songs tend to be stupid and boring after the first two episodes, and it doesn't make up for the bad storyline.There were good points though. I loved the hoshigami. Rishu and Kohan were just too cute. I also find the Tasuke - Shaorin match up to be a bit endearing. Other than that, I can say no more.Like I said in the beginning, the fact that I finished watching all episodes is a bit surprising. I probably wouldn't even have watched it if I had known it had a weak storyline and poor execution. I can't say it's the worse anime ever, but It's definitely in the bottom of the food chain. to school. let me tell you - it was bad.

Well, in the beginning, at least. After that what follows is a bunch of...formulaic standalone episodes which pretty much follow the same pattern; something triggers a random event, Ruan makes the matter worse - usually while trying to get Tasuke’s attention- Tasuke gets in trouble and the kind Shaorin comes to save the day.As the story progresses, the only change is that Tasuke’s and Shaorin’s feelings for one another become clearer. But that doesn't necessarily mean that is actually a good thing as it can get annoying at times; the cheesy inside monologues and pointless melodramatic scenes do not really help.But it's not just Tasuke and Shaorin who want to express their love, everyone loves them, what every single character wants is either to gain Tasuke’s or Shaorin’s love or just to be there to support them, they have no other purpose and no development, a cast full of dry stereotypes. Even though there were a bunch of likeable side characters they were left in the shadows due to the poor storyline.I tried hard to enjoyed it as much as I could, with no results, it was with all honestly, a completely waste of time. I would not recommend this to anyone over 13-14 years old.

I\'m sort of in the same boat.The story is your basic magical girlfriend plot line;  if you\'ve seen this kind of show, you know what to expect story-wise. It doesn\'t really do anything new in this department. Each episode tends to be a different misadventure of your main cast, and some of them can get kind of ridiculous, stupid, or boring. Mamotte Shugogetten tends to put more emphasis on the comedy than on the romance, though...the humor can be really hit and miss. It might be enough to get a little laugh out of you, or might not.The show has a cast of about 8 main characters. A lot of the time the show seems to just cram every character it\'s got into each episode and it can feel kind of overwhelming and unnecessary. The characters themselves are, again, not anything very new, but I think they can be enjoyable. Shaorin and Tasuke are your main couple, and they\'re cute enough, just your average couple you would see in this genre. The rest of the cast is the center of comedy, with the main gag being that they\'re all constantly trying to win the affection of either Tasuke or Shaorin (with the exception of two of them). This joke can get really stale when it gets used so often.I think the art style is very nice, and Shaorin especially has a great design. Another one of the characters, Ruuan, also has a unique design that really sticks out. The animation itself isn\'t always great, but it does what it needs to do for this kind of show. The voice acting is fine and  voices suit the characters. The background music is just generic synth/MIDI-sounding stuff, nothing special there. However, the opening -- and I hate to say this -- is really the best thing in Mamotte Shugogetten. I didn\'t skip it even once. Its a really awesome song with visuals that suit it perfectly. The ending song is also pretty nice, with interesting and creative visuals.So, I didn\'t hate Mamotte Shugogetten, but I was let down. I was expecting something more unique and interesting. I guess the best way to describe this show is ""harmless"" or ""mediocre"". It doesn\'t really bring anything different or new, but it also isn\'t atrocious or offensively bad, and there is some charm to it. If you go into this show expecting a serious show and something really fresh and new, you\'re going to be seriously disappointed. But if you just want some simple lighthearted fun, I guess this is an okay anime for that, but you could do better.The manga is pretty different and focuses more on the romance instead of the comedy, and it also doesn\'t have the filler that the anime does. So if any of the ideas in this anime interest you, I\'d recommend to just read the manga instead. You will have a much better time. the humor can be really hit and miss.

Master Mosquiton,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1805/Master_Mosquiton,"[""Master of Mosquiton is a short OAV, that inspired the Master of Mosqution '99 TV series. This OAV is not very well known, but is definitly well-worth a watch.StoryThe story of Master of Mosquiton is a young girl named Inaho, uses her blood to awaken a vampire that her grandmother had told her about, so she can obtain the O-part. The O-part is said to give eternal life, and Inaho dreams of being young and beautiful forever - for Mosquiton, apparently. She's starts this mission at the age of 17, and as the years go by, she gets increasingly more desperate.AnimationThe animation is top-notch. OAV's...are usually pretty good for this, and the characters all have good designs, as well as movement. The colouring is perfect for the dark settings, not to bright, but not muddy. It's very well done.SoundThe opening music fits perfectly. This anime takes place in the early 1900's, so it has an old-style music feel, which helps set the mood. The actual in music is very well done, and fits every scene almost perfectly. As much as I adore the ending theme, it's a tad out of place, and prevents this from being a 10. However, it's a beautiful song, with pretty lyrics.CharactersInaho, our main character is quite simply, an annoying, vain little girl, who wants to be young and beautiful forever. Mosquiton himself, if what makes the show. He is a bumbling vampire, who is quite silly, and has a hilarious English voice. However, when he takes blood from Inaho, he becomes a full vampire again, and is a killing-maniac. After he kills enemies, he usually turns on Inaho, who has to stake him through the heart, revert him back into dust, and then start the whole process all over again, of a drop of blood on the ashes.Mosquiton also has two cliche spirit guardians. But cliche is only in appearance. Yuki is (as the name states) the ice guardian. However, she appears as a little girl, and cannot use her full powers until she transforms into a grown woman. Hono (also as the name states) is the fire guardian, who like Yuki, needs to transform to use his full powers.Finally, there is Camille, Mosquitons over sexed ex-fiancee. Camille alone manages to bring up the rating to this show, so just wait for her, she's a fun, almost-always-naked character.EnjoymentThis series has serious replay value. The first viewing might leave you a little confused, so it makes you watch it again. About the second time around (unless you are VERY observant, or watching with someone who has already seen it all) makes it all very clear, and I can practically guarentee you'll fall in love with the series as well.Overall / My Comments / My FeelingsWhen I first watched this OAV, I had rented the first VHS (of 3). It was the only one available, and I watched it a LOT. This series was so hilarious, and I just couldn't get enough of it.As I got older, one year for Christmas, I was given the first VHS as a present. Not to long after, I finally found the second VHS for sale, at my local manga store. Camille was... a life-scarring character, but I honestly grew to appreciate her, and how she twists the plot.I couldn't find the third VHS, until I searched on Ebay, and found it for 1 CENT, brand new, SEALED IN IT'S PACKAGE. Wow. So I bought it, and fell in love.My sister than bought me the TV series for my birthday, which I only watched once, but those OAV's I've watched over, and over.About grade 9, I joined an manga club at my local library, and I met a friend. She was drawing on the giant paper at the front of the room, and I commented that it looked familiar... kind of like, maybe Mosquiton? I was right, and we've been friends ever since.She'd only seen the first VHS (she rented it from the same place as me. That explains why I couldn't always find it), so I lent her the other two. She also fell more in love with it.In conclusion, this is an amazing series, that deserves more attention. It's not like it's something you'll be collecting forever, because my friends said that the OAV has been released on 1 DVD now. So go buy it. Right now. This series is definitly worth the few bucks you'll pay. are usually pretty good for this, and the characters all have good designs, as well as movement.

However, when he takes blood from Inaho, he becomes a full vampire again, and is a killing-maniac. After he kills enemies, he usually turns on Inaho, who has to stake him through the heart, revert him back into dust, and then start the whole process all over again, of a drop of blood on the ashes.Mosquiton also has two cliche spirit guardians. But cliche is only in appearance. Yuki is (as the name states) the ice guardian. However, she appears as a little girl, and cannot use her full powers until she transforms into a grown woman. Hono (also as the name states) is the fire guardian, who like Yuki, needs to transform to use his full powers.Finally, there is Camille, Mosquitons over sexed ex-fiancee. Camille alone manages to bring up the rating to this show, so just wait for her, she's a fun, almost-always-naked character.EnjoymentThis series has serious replay value. The first viewing might leave you a little confused, so it makes you watch it again. About the second time around (unless you are VERY observant, or watching with someone who has already seen it all) makes it all very clear, and I can practically guarentee you'll fall in love with the series as well.Overall / My Comments / My FeelingsWhen I first watched this OAV, I had rented the first VHS (of 3). It was the only one available, and I watched it a LOT. This series was so hilarious, and I just couldn't get enough of it.As I got older, one year for Christmas, I was given the first VHS as a present. Not to long after, I finally found the second VHS for sale, at my local manga store. Camille was... a life-scarring character, but I honestly grew to appreciate her, and how she twists the plot.I couldn't find the third VHS, until I searched on Ebay, and found it for 1 CENT, brand new, SEALED IN IT'S PACKAGE. Wow. So I bought it, and fell in love.My sister than bought me the TV series for my birthday, which I only watched once, but those OAV's I've watched over, and over.About grade 9, I joined an manga club at my local library, and I met a friend. She was drawing on the giant paper at the front of the room, and I commented that it looked familiar... kind of like, maybe Mosquiton? I was right, and we've been friends ever since.She'd only seen the first VHS (she rented it from the same place as me. That explains why I couldn't always find it), so I lent her the other two. She also fell more in love with it.In conclusion, this is an amazing series, that deserves more attention. It's not like it's something you'll be collecting forever, because my friends said that the OAV has been released on 1 DVD now. So go buy it. Right now. This series is definitly worth the few bucks you'll pay."", ""Master of Mosquiton is a quirky, funny, and unapologetically 90s OVA which has a lot of potential, but falls short in a few vital ways. I'd say the major issue here is that it starts off strong, but rapidly deteriorates over the course of its brief run. By the end of episode 1 I was even prepared to give it an 8, but there's not enough staying power, resulting in an unremarkable finished product. Beginning with the story, it charts the course of this show's overall quality rather nicely. It astounds right off the bat with a world that feels alive with magic, and a...compelling goal for our characters to pursue. There are mysterious, threatening villains, and ominous forces beyond regular human conception which drag the main cast into the path of fate. There are references to real historical figures throughout, and clever references to 20th century horror. It's hard to pin down, but by around episode 3 or 4 it begins to get confused. It breaks its own rules for how the world works, it randomly adds in extra plots and subplots, it peppers in high-stakes scenarios which feel random and unearned, and ends up losing all the character and magic which gave it such a strong start. The viewer is ferried to a lackluster conclusion on the back of a plot which loses its sense of identity halfway through. The same thing happens to the art, which I regardless feel is still the strongest aspect of this show. It begins with all the glories of late 90s anime, with everything from the painstakingly detailed and colorful world to the masterful character design and facial expressiveness, absolutely dripping with passion. You can tell the animators poured their heart and soul into this piece. Unfortunately, it falls off about the same time the story does, taking cheap shortcuts and making decisions which are ultimately lazy, diminishing the work. This is the worst part, as the art really is a spectacle, until they inexplicably stop putting nearly as much effort in. One wonders if they ran out of time in order for something like this to happen. The sound is a thoroughly mixed bag, unlike the first two. Beginning with the good, the OST is wonderful and immersive, and at times jazzy, which you wouldn't think would work as well as it does here, lending emotion and atmosphere to all the right moments. The bad, however, I suspect in part to be a result of garbage audio mixing. The sounds of life, things like footsteps or breaking glass, either get lost behind the music or overpower the dialogue. As for the voice work, I had a uniquely difficult time choosing between the sub and the dub. The sub is more accurate to the original Japanese, as well as fitting the tone of certain scenes better, but the Japanese voice work is almost inaudible. Meanwhile, the dub is much funnier, speaking to the intrinsic spirit of this show as more of a comedy than anything else, and enjoys superior audio mixing, but the body of drastic changes it makes to the original dialogue is a sin. It is a shame to see such unnecessary, gratuitous rewriting. So, while the dub is somehow higher quality, making for a superior viewing experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend it, and ended up going with the sub myself. The characters are the only aspect of this show which inhabit the middle ground of quality. They all fulfill their roles within the story, and are easy to get invested in while also being broadly unremarkable. Still, my favorites from among the cast are our two main characters, Mosquiton and Inaho. Overall, Master of Mosquiton is an anime with so much potential, which it ultimately squanders, leaving no cushion for its fall from grace. I will choose to remember it for its first half rather than its second, and can only recommend it to those of you who are truly passionate about vampire stories or 90s anime. compelling goal for our characters to pursue.

It's fanservice and jokes, their was never any depth intended, and anyone taking this show seriously is a fool.Nurse Witch Komugi is a parody-laden romp laced with sight gags, slapstick and sheer randomness.  And like Excel Saga it works pretty well.  References to other anime are frequent and often hilarious, and Komugi makes an over-excitable but likeable lead character.  The series is pretty much made up of stand-alone stories, with Komugi having to face a different problem in each episode, which...usually start with her doing a job for her modelling agency before everything goes wrong and she has to change into Nurse Witch Komugi.  It may be a bit formulaic if it was done over a long series but over the six episodes, it stays entertaining without becoming too predictable.It's hard to analyze the story of Nurse Witch Komugi when there is no story to speak of.  Boob jokes and fan service pepper this show like Naruto headbands at Anime Expo.This is a show that's neither plot-driven nor character-driven, but exists only as eye candy and comedy.The artwork is higher end quality, but not original. Even Mugimaru, the obligatory cute animal mascot, looks like a reject from the Di Gi Charat cast. The real work that goes into the visuals is in rendering the cosplay outfits with detail, and cosplay is inherently not original, so thats kind of the point.On the bright side the artwork is the crisp, high-contrast color scheme, despite being a touch on the simple and kiddy end of the spectrum (think again back to di gi charat). The animation is decent on the number of frames vs motion, it moves smooth enough to give a flowing feeling and it actually pulls off the exaggerated, comedic action quite well, unlike some anime where actions are stiff and walking is like watching a sticky pad flip art.Overall, this show is worth watching if you enjoy things like popotan, puni puni poemi, excel saga, and sailor victory, but if you took a look at the dvd cover art and had any expectation of an anime with any depth, you entirely missed the point here. usually start with her doing a job for her modelling agency before everything goes wrong and she has to change into Nurse Witch Komugi.

The whole show is really funny, and it doesn't seem to be very plot-driven, but rather character-driven, so if you're like me and dislike plot-heavy stuff I really recommend this anime!!The main character, Komugi, is SO freaking adorable. Her character design is so cute.As previously mentioned I feel like this show is really driven more by the characters themselves than the plot. But if you like shows that have a strong plot then maybe give this one a miss.The only complaint that I personally have about the show is that...there's a bit of fanservice. I found myself hitting the fast-forward button once or twice in each episode due to those scenes. there's a bit of fanservice.

I don’t know who decided to actually make an anime out of the stupid pinked haired girl Komugi from SoulTaker, but they need to be forced to watch this themselves.The story starts out talking about a rather odd place called Vaccine World where a virus has broken out of prison and went to earth. Because of this, the Goddess of Vaccine World sent this little talking… squirrel-puffball-annoying sidekick-thing… to go find a human to use the magic baton to defeat the virus. He finds Komugi who...takes the job only because she wanted to cosplay as a nurse witch. Yep, its one of those shows… the shows where its all fun and games to the person trying to save the earth. I wish he would of at least looked around a bit more or at least thought twice about giving the baton/wand to the first girl he saw. At least someone who gives a crap what the hell the magic was actually supposed to be used for! She, of course, is in love with Kyosuke Date like in SoulTaker. Unlike SoulTaker though, he has the personality of a wet noodle. I have a feeling that this is what Komugi wanted him to be. In fact, I would consider this to be exactly what was going on in Komugi’s empty head all threw Soultaker.Anyway, then we have Runa who in SoulTaker was the sister of Kyosuke but in this world is nothing more then a childhood actor who does anything for money. There’s Asuka who is a movie actress here but is the love interest sort of in SoulTaker. There’s Shiro who is her manager Yui… both really doesn’t have much of a personality on there own.I guess the show isn’t all bad, its better then Puni Puni Poemii by a long shot. The artwork is better and the story is a bit more consistent then Puni. If it has fan service, then it has fan service… if it wants to play on parodies, then they do it. They know exactly what they want to be and don’t try to be anything more.The animation is actually quite good, though sometimes not consistent throughout. I was surprised that Kyoto actually had in doing the artwork and it shows with its rather bright and detailed artwork in no matter what part. The lines are crisp and the colors fill the whole area. Characters don’t normally lose their proportions unless its to push the comedic affect. The characters do look like they were pulled straight from SoulTaker (however, their personalities are actually destroyed) to the point that it’s easy to see who was who.The English voices are consistent with SoulTaker and so must of it will be said in my review on that series but her’s the low down on this, I CAN’T STAND KOMUGI’S VOICE! She’s a whinny, immature, shell of a girl who is pretty much played off as just the normal everyday high school girl with a crush and a secret. Of course, in order to combat her voice, they have little puffball there a 12-cigarette pack a day voice with a high pitch whine. This we have to hear everytime he talks with Komugi with almost all his sentences ending in ‘Komugi’… ‘We got to save the world, Komugi. Your our only hope, Komugi’… Um… Ya… I like Kyosuke’s voice yet it doesn’t work for the personality they did for him. The opening music is actually quite catchy, and a rather cute piece. Some of the other songs like when Kyosuke is supposed t be singing is actually some pretty nice stuff. I have to say that most of the soundtrack is created rather well and has a nice tone to it, at least when there are vocals. On the flip side, when there is only background music, it doesn’t stand out much and just gets lost or unnoticeable.In the end, its bad, but not as bad as some others I watched.

This is a spinoff OVA to their sister series SoulTaker and yet I’m going in without watching the original series. From what I heard about the show, people absolutely hated it, mostly because they found the character Komugi was so annoying in SoulTaker, a whole OVA series that revolves around her would spell anger into a lot of fans, non-fans and even anime reviewers, especially a certain wolf/angel-based reviewer I know. *wink wink*.Ungrar, the King of Viruses, has escaped from his prison cell in Vaccine World. Maya, the Goddess of Vaccine World sends Mugimaru down...to Earth to find a human to accept the powers of Vaccine World and become the Magical Nurse. He finds the best (and the only willing) person for the job when he meets Komugi Nakahara.“Komugi is a playful, lazy, and easily distracted (typical) teenager whose dream is to become a cosplay idol and balancing her career with the Kiri-Pro Promotion Company and her new job battling Ungrar's loyal henchman and the Magical Maid Koyori.” – That’s what part of the plot synopsis said when I read it on ANN, I swear.Well, Komugi is all those things but sometimes she gets very cringe worthy to deal with and it’s not just her. I really can’t stand the constant bickering between Komugi and Megumi, who mostly tease each other’s breast size and they do it every time and it gets real old real fast……in other words, I can’t just both of these girls. Then came Koyori, who is Komugi’s friend that works as a model and cosplayer and yet she’s also her rival when it comes to them being magical girls. But how does she turn into that? She loses consciousness………yeah. There is also Runa, a child star who also works for Kiri Pro with Komugi and also teases her about her being flat-chested but yet she seems to be the one that annoys her the least but not a favorite of mine.Matter of fact, nobody on this show is a favorite character of mine. There are either too bland or too annoying to give a shit about. I’m sure some of the characters from the original series have more character than they do here. They scream, yell too much, overact, and try to overexcite one too many times.Now for the animation department, Tatsunoko Pro, being the original animation company for SoulTaker but in here, they are around with the help of Kyoto Animation……yes, that Kyoto Animation and for what it is, the animation is fine with what it is and there is some hiccups especially in some of the magical girl and fight sequences in between the series, thankfully it lasted 5 episodes or 6 if you count episode 2.5 or the other OVAs that I didn’t know of.The music does have that very cutesy J-Popish sound that many people know and the music is about as bland as the rest of the series. The first time I listened to these songs I just wanted to skip the whole music sequence together and for you either liked these songs, then all the power to you. As for the English dub, some of the original SoulTaker cast from The Ocean Group/Geneon dub does appear in here, although NWK was distributed by ADV Films but yet it was such a chore to go through. The voice actress for Komugi, Jocelyne Loewen, is really grating on the ears and feels like her motivation in the script is to annoy you. Luci Christian does play the role of Mugi-maru and yet it’s sad to see her doing this part considering she really is a great voice-actress and they got her sounding like Webby from Ducktales smoking up menthols.FINAL VERDICT: As it all comes down to this, this OVA is really so damn annoying but it’s nothing to rage about and the simple fact that it’s too dull to rage this series. It’s something nobody really wanted or needed but either way you watched it and regret it but not really care for it. to Earth to find a human to accept the powers of Vaccine World and become the Magical Nurse.

It’s something nobody really wanted or needed but either way you watched it and regret it but not really care for it."", ""I'm going to make this short because there's no need to be long-winded about such an unserious anime. Also, no, I have not seen the anime this is based off of, Soultaker. I'm basing this review on Nurse Witch alone, since Soultaker is not required viewing to watch Nurse Witch.The show is a parody of the magical girl genre, particularly that of the early moé boom. There are references to many other anime and live action dramas (Evangelion, Macross, Anime Tenchou, Sailor Suit and Machine Gun, etc.) throughout. If you find referential humor funny, especially otaku-media references, you'll probably enjoy Nurse Witch.The character designs...are by Akio Watanabe (Poyoyon♥Rock) of Monogatari Series fame. His art style is iconic and on full display here. Nurse Witch is a must watch for fans of Poyoyon♥Rock's work. The art/animation quality is inconsistent but above-average for an OVA.The director is Yasuhiro Takemoto, someone who would go on to have a leading-role in some of Kyoto Animation's best anime. One of those would be Lucky Star, a referential anime which appears to have taken some inspiration from Nurse Witch (especially with the Anime Tenchou references).The VA cast is equally amazing and surprising for an anime of this quality. The standouts for me are Ikue Ootani (Koyori), Haruko Momoi (Komugi), and Yukari Tamura (Asuka). These VAs are known more for their other roles, such as Yukari Tamura's later performance as Rika Furude in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, but they bring that power to Nurse Witch. The VA for Komugi, Haruko Momoi, is a famous otaku of Akihabara, and she fits her role perfectly. As a matter of fact, she often cosplayed as Komugi in live performances with her music group, Under 17, in the early 2000s. Haruko practically embodies the character of Komugi. The voice acting is definitely an out-performance of the expectations for an anime of this type.You may notice that I've said a lot of good for an anime I've only rated a 6. That's because I really can't justify anything higher. Nurse Witch is self-evidently an unserious work. It's also a niche work, and that niche is otaku culture. If this is one of the first 10 anime you watch (and I mean full series, not just individual seasons or the completed count on MAL), you will not get or like this show. That's my perspective on it, at least. If you've been around the block and can enjoy some odd-ball anime, give this a try. Otherwise, I would recommend watching some more well-regarded referential anime first, such as Lucky Star, Steins;Gate, or other anime of that kind. are by Akio Watanabe (Poyoyon♥Rock) of Monogatari Series fame. His art style is iconic and on full display here. Nurse Witch is a must watch for fans of Poyoyon♥Rock's work. The art/animation quality is inconsistent but above-average for an OVA.The director is Yasuhiro Takemoto, someone who would go on to have a leading-role in some of Kyoto Animation's best anime. One of those would be Lucky Star, a referential anime which appears to have taken some inspiration from Nurse Witch (especially with the Anime Tenchou references).The VA cast is equally amazing and surprising for an anime of this quality. The standouts for me are Ikue Ootani (Koyori), Haruko Momoi (Komugi), and Yukari Tamura (Asuka). These VAs are known more for their other roles, such as Yukari Tamura's later performance as Rika Furude in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, but they bring that power to Nurse Witch. The VA for Komugi, Haruko Momoi, is a famous otaku of Akihabara, and she fits her role perfectly. As a matter of fact, she often cosplayed as Komugi in live performances with her music group, Under 17, in the early 2000s. Haruko practically embodies the character of Komugi.

Considering that this was a parody like anime, I wasn’t too surprised over what I was dealing with. This anime is makes fun of the magical girl shoujo characterization, which is famous in anime like “Precure”, “Sailor Moon” (obviously), “Cardcaptor Sakura”, while also parodying “The Soultaker”. The funny part about this show is that besides the main characters abilities, it also makes fun of the cosplayer stereotype that makes most cosplayer-like characters in today’s anime seem interesting to watch. There were moments that I wish they made fun of the cosplayer...culture a whole lot more than I wish they made fun of the magical girl plot line, as it would have been a whole lot easier to do so.It also says a whole lot that Mugi-Chan ended up being one of the memorable characters in the shows first half (granted it is a short series), as I laughed at the fact that he gets relegated to be the perverted bunny rabbit that is also the helper of a teenage nurse witch like Komugi. Koyori’s character, from when she slips between good and evil, can be entertaining from time to time. However, she does seem to (almost) make me lose interest in her, mainly because I think more interested in how they managed to make “The Soultaker” into a parody in the first place. Even with that, it is still a good anime for its time, and I can’t wait to see the reboot of this in the future. culture a whole lot more than I wish they made fun of the magical girl plot line, as it would have been a whole lot easier to do so.It also says a whole lot that Mugi-Chan ended up being one of the memorable characters in the shows first half (granted it is a short series), as I laughed at the fact that he gets relegated to be the perverted bunny rabbit that is also the helper of a teenage nurse witch like Komugi.

Oh my Haruhi! I discovered this OVA through the Akio Watanabe character designs and I\'m truly grateful that I gave it a shot. Yet another perfect example of why you shouldn\'t trust MAL scores. Most of the time, anyway.This anime is more important than ever.  Komugi Nakahara is given the responsibility of eliminating viruses that negatively affect the lives of ordinary, everyday people. The leader of all of the viruses, Ungrar, escaped ""The World of Vaccines."" I watch anime...to escape reality, not to be thrown back into it. If only the people of Japan could\'ve masked up, it would\'ve saved a lot of time. An hour and forty minutes to be exact. Ungrar has a henchmen named Koyori, a classmate of Komugi who got possessed, who does all of his dirty work for him. She creates mayhem and mischief with her viruses, and it\'s up to Nurse Witch Komugi to stop her.What an absolute gem this show was. I could go into more detail about the characters. Like how Komugi is an idol who is also an aspiring actress. Or how she gets bullied for not knowing her lines. Or how she has a crush on a guy named Kyosuke who she wants to do the horizontal monster mash with. Or the show\'s fetish undertones. Or how Shinichi Watanabe is here again. None of that stuff. I want to talk about the hilarity of this anime. The OVA is only five episodes but gets better in quality with each consecutive episode. Episode one is about a giant 2chan cat monster transforming innocent people into smaller 2chan cat monsters. They don\'t kill anyone, they just act like a bunch of 2channers. Lot of meta humor and internet humor in that one. There\'s an entire episode about anime production and midway through the episode when Komugi is in battle, the visual art style changes to rough storyboard animation. This is one of the few times when the anime has a mixed media art style and it fits the situation well. There\'s another episode where the anime is doing a Gatchaman parody and has this really slow, sluggish, ugly Speed Racer/Carmageddon 3D generated scene that looks like it\'s being run on a Windows 95. I seriously believed the video was lagging and quickly realized that it was the anime doing that. It was a very surreal scene. The insanity in each episode escalates as you keep watching, until you get to episode 5 which is a very confusing fluster cuck of an episode.I find Nurse Witch Komugi and Puni Puni Poemii to be some of the best comedy anime out there. I already made a Puni Puni Poemii  review, but these two shows are so similar with the hyperactivity and chaotic madness. In the endless sea of generic, bland, and by the numbers anime that do the same thing over and over again, Komugi and Poemii stand out in my mind. If you\'re like me and you love insane plotlines and over-the-top humor you will adore this OVA. This is a MUST-WATCH. to escape reality, not to be thrown back into it.

I watched the first 4 episodes of R and then dropped it. Note: I have not seen more than like 10 minutes of Soultaker.The originals are great. Simply put, they are funny and entertaining.

I'm not aware of the legal issues or licensing process and all that, but I'd imagine there's a story to be told there. As you might infer from me dropping it, Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R is awful compared to the original. It is unfunny and not entertaining. The art style is nauseating. There are some cute idol song cutscenes, which I'm a huge sucker for (the CGI isn't even that bad in this case), but that's not enough to get me to sit through the entire series.

Nobunaga the Fool,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21177/Nobunaga_the_Fool,"['""It was inevitable!"" - Oda Nobunaga.Nobunaga The Fool is a pleasant surprise of this season, a very curious yet enjoyable mix of many genres : Mecha, Sengoku Period, Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Romance, which may raise many brows given the unique sense of history of this anime, but that flamboyant extravagance has many charms, just like the main protagonist, Oda Nobunaga, a foolish and persistant man who aims to conquer heavens and earth as he is said to be the Savior-King by his allies, Jeanne d\'Arc and Da Vinci. His resolve and potential steadily draws other characters to him, allies and enemies alike. Gaius Julius Caesar,...King Arthur and many other notable historical figures make their entrance, while the internal strife of the Oda clan is at its peak. Nobunaga The Fool shows us foolishness, determination, betrayal, sacrifices, hope, and love. It appeals to our emotions and keeps the suspens till the very end. The well executed overall presentation manages to catch our attention with an impredictable conquest, a rich cast of voice actors, a beautifully handled animation and a very memorable soundtrack. The fast paced story, the intense interactions between the characters, the epic battle scenes, and the subsequent plot twists make it an anime you look forward to where it would take you.

Anachronism definitely has the potential to produce beautiful things (e.g. Gintama or Samurai Champloo), and going into this show, I was excited to see how its producers would handle a historical/mecha fusion. Now that I’ve completed it, I’m disappointed to say that it felt more like a disjointed mishmash of genres than a smooth blend.When I say that NtF was a mishmash of genres, I don’t just mean historical and mecha. It was often fantasy, occasionally supernatural,...sometimes shounen, sporadically romance, and towards the end, sci-fi as well. Hence the comparison to a jack of all trades, master of none. NtF essentially gave itself too much to do. It had too many themes to neatly put together and ended up spending time focusing on different subjects without really combining them. There were magical evil imp children, melodramatic love triangles, power-ups with spirit dragons and cyborg limbs (I'm not even kidding), and so on. In the end, it was hard to tell what exactly the series was supposed to be about.My score is 5.9/10. Read below for the full review + rating breakdown.- - -Story = 5/10Layout:If you want to enjoy NtF, be ready to suspend your disbelief. The show is a war story takes place on two stars, east and west. The east star is dominated by Japanese warlords from the Sengoku period. The west star is dominated by random famous Europeans plus Chandra Gupta. (If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, you probably won't like this anime.) As you might guess, the allusions and references are all over the place. Here’s a small sample of the references made in NtF: Schrodinger’s cat, Excalibur, and Hercules—and that’s only in one episode.The topic for each episode is set by tarot cards. At some point in each ep, a new card is revealed (like Hanged Man or Empress), and the card signifies a character or event during that episode. It's generally predictable, but it does make the anime more entertaining. The idea is admittedly clever.Characters spend a lot of time fighting over regalia, which are mystical pendants that grant physics-defying upgrades to giant war armors (NtF's mechas). When activated, they draw from the power of ley lines and cause extra weapons to immediately materialize. Yeah...just roll with it.Plot:There's a prophecy that two kings will be born—a Savior King and a Destroyer King whose destinies are to save and destroy the world, respectively. The higher-ups on the west star believe that Arthur, an enigmatic and seemingly faceless man, is the Savior King. After Jeanne Kaguya d'Arc has premonitions of an east star warrior named Oda Nobunaga, she and Leonardo da Vinci defect to the east star to see if he's the actual Savior King. They join the Oda clan, and Jeanne goes into disguise as a page named Ranmaru. Nobunaga and co. then continue their efforts to unite heaven and earth. Or conquer the world. Whichever sounds better.The plot isn't too hard to follow, but it's still unnecessarily contrived. Things get especially confusing during the last few episodes.- - -Characterization = 3/10Warning: characters' personalities don't necessarily reflect those of their historical counterparts. (Don't expect Jeanne to be a badass warrior. You will be disappointed.) The names are just there for the sake of making characters look cooler. The east star warlords at least bear some resemblance to the figures on whom they're based, but the west star knights of the round table (which include members like Hannibal Barca and Alexander the Great, and are not to be confused with King Arthur’s other knights of the round table) show little to no evidence of historical context. Caesar says “veni, vidi, vici.” Cool. Hannibal and Charlemagne speak to each other in French. Nifty. That's all you really get, in terms of historical influence. You won't be getting any Fate/Zero sort of background info on the characters, either.Historical inaccuracy aside (Jeanne Kaguya d'Arc...really? I know she's supposed to be a pseudo-Mori Ranmaru and have ties to the east star, but come on), the characters at least have interesting, distinct personalities. The reason why I'm giving a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 is because the character types aren't any less than what you'd get from your average action anime. A lot of the supporting chars may be one-dimensional, but they're rarely boring.Moving on, the biggest qualm I have regarding characterization is that the main characters have these little tics and habits, and the show abuses the heck out of them. Mitsuhide flips his hair. Hideyoshi rubs his nose. Nobunaga adjusts his shirt sleeves. I've seen each of these happen at least once per episode. Why do I say they're abused? Habits are supposed to reflect a character's personality, not define it. The habits shown in NtF are extremely overstated and, for the most part, not special. Among other things, the issue with the habits highlights how static the characters are. Their most obvious traits are literally tiny habits.Quick note about development: the main characters do go through changes in their ambitions and temperaments, but the changes are often sudden and not sufficiently explained.- - -Art = 8/10You can tell a LOT of the animation budget went into the giant war armors, which are the only things that are CG. They look gorgeous, and fight scenes look amazing. Unfortunately, although the art is very good overall, the discrepancy between quality for giant war armors and everything else is pretty noticeable. The CG animation = 10, the rest = 7.Interesting thing I noticed: in the Owari setting, you see the same looped animation of this dude ringing a bell for every invasion scene. The only explanation is that the guy is secretly immortal and never rests, eats, or gets hurt even when his city is being attacked by laser beams.- - -Voice Acting = 9/10The voice acting is great overall, though a little over-the-top at times. (The “over-the-top” part applies mostly to Hideyoshi. As much as I love Kaji Yuki, I think I've heard him make enough monkey noises to last a lifetime.)Additional props to Miyano Mamoru, Sugita Tomokazu, and Nakamura Yuichi for pulling off Nobunaga, da Vinci, and Caesar so well.- - -Music 6/10The BGM is a mix of traditional and orchestral music. It fits the series well, but isn't exceptionally good. The most memorable tracks are the ones played during the more intense scenes; they're one of the things I like most about NtF.- - -Story (25%) = 50Characterization (25%) = 30Art (20%) = 80Voice Acting (15%) = 90Music (15%) = 60Total = 59/100 = 5.9/10 —> 6Thanks for reading! sometimes shounen, sporadically romance, and towards the end, sci-fi as well.

The first is the likes of classics such as Texhnolyze or Serial experiments Lain, where the show was intentionally made convoluted by the authors in order to leave interpretation up to the viewer. These are shows that are purposefully made with the assumption that the viewer must decipher the plot for a philosophical reason.The second type are shows that are convoluted not in order to convey anything special, but because the writers of the show have absolutely no idea what they are doing and couldn't write a good story to save their...pathetic behinds.This anime is unfortunately the second type.

Tons of genres, tons of ideas, but none of them well done."", 'A show like Nobunaga the Fool will make you look like a fool at first glance. The premise sounds absurd, not to mention foolish and the first episode stops nothing at all to make viewers ask themselves what is going on. What it offers is a mixture of historical figures ranging from Joan of Arc, Leonardo da Vinci, Da Vinci, King Author, among others. It doesn’t stop there however. Rather, it steps up one more stage and decides to make usage of mecha warfare in a world of the unknown. Nobunaga the Fool is the type of show where you’ll be watching it trying to...escape a labyrinth.To venture into a show like Nobunaga the Fool will take an imaginative and open mind. While it seems absurd at first glance, one should acknowledge the creativity of the show. For instance, take a closer look at the setting. It’s divided into two halves, the West and East Star. Upon a closer glance, there’s conflicts in their world involving warfare. And as even a fool can guess, the show trifles by the idea of war as result of ideologies. But let’s go back to the basics. The show fuses together legendary historical figures, tosses in the mechanics of mecha, and empowers them in this bizarre setting.For what’s worth, we get fusion of a steampunk/historical setting. The characters involved in the show may seem to be related to their legendary ancestors. Yet, their similarities only seems to scratch its historical domain. Starting off, there’s a blur of reality as Jeanne Kaguya d’Arc (based off of the character ‘Joan of Arc’), is burned at a stake in a typical witch hunt endgame style. Then flash forward and we find out that she has a powerful object that can potentially influence the world. Not only that but she also has visions relating to the one individual that will save the world, also known as the Fool, Oda Nobunaga. Here’s where the fun comes in. Oda Nobunaga is exactly as his name states. Not only is he the titular character but he is literally portrayed as a fool with his brash personality. His actions and behavior will get people talking despite it being harmless, on occasions anyways. But looking carefully, Nobunaga is a man that’s difficult to understand. It’s not an understatement either since his character is a representation of The Fool card based off of the tarot legend. The tarot cards bring about a purpose that serves as a fortitude of each episode. But behind those cards lies a meaning that unlocks each episodes’ morality through imagery, perhaps relating to the true visage of our titular character.Nobunaga the Fool isn’t just about making a prophecy come true.  Throughout the series, we see different sides of Nobunaga and Jeanne. Nobunaga for instance is portrayed as a hotheaded man that he seems to wear like a mask. Yet, we do see a different side of him when he is with those closer with others, such as his family like his sister Ichihime. Later on, Nobunaga’s relationship/partnership with Jeanne grows closer. It reaches to a point where he strives to protect her no matter what. At the apex, he puts his own life on the line to save hers. And as seemingly incompatible as the duo is at first, Jeanne herself also develops feelings throughout their journey. Originally, she questions herself whether it’s worthwhile to accompany Nobunaga. Later, there’s a 180 degree turn where she strives to help him no matter what. To point it in easier perspective, the duo becomes more than just partners in crime. There’s even instance of Jeanne seemingly question what she is to him. Unfortunately, the romance angle of the show is vague, with only sparkles towards the end. It fails to communicate that part of the message without a meaningful purpose in the first place.Figures and legends that historians have been studying for ages. Nobunaga the Fool is a collection of noticeable characters from various backgrounds. One character of notoriety is Leonardo da Vinci. In contrast to Nobunaga, he is a man of intelligence known for his inventions from the West. His role as a journeyman is to seek out truth. Rather than power, he strives for knowledge and acts as a guide. With Nobunaga are also two other companions known as Akechi Mitsuhide and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. They serves as his arms and legs during his travels and yes, they are based off of historical figures from Feudal Japan. And finally, we can’t forget about someone that longs for Nobunaga’s attention. Serving as a love interest, Himiko (the queen of Yamato) makes offers to Nobunaga in exchange for one simple thing: his love. But a show like this only demonstrates love with a cliche way. It’s more like a niche, a badly executed one if it tries to construct a Romeo & Juliet story. The lack of chemistry is apparently present and their only closeness seems to be their common interests. On other hand, Nobunaga’s chemistry with his family makes up much more of his character. In one later episode, it truly brings out Nobunaga’s visage behind the mask he is wearing as he shows his sincerity, rage, and regret.It’s hard to describe the style of Nobunaga the Fool. Absurd would be one of them for its package of colorful characters. Yet, the story itself does make sense later on when dangerous antagonists are thrown in and plot holes are formulated in Nobunaga and Jeanne’s quest. What stands between them is more than ideologies, but also weapons that can wipe them off the planet. The world this show takes place in has adapted the usage of mecha. Now, this comes with an odd mix because their world obviously has historical themes such as the shrines and temples. Nonetheless, mecha exist and stands for a testimony for being a superpower as a destructive ways of combat. The mecha are described as ‘sacred treasures’. Nobunaga pilots one of them which he nicknames “The Fool”. This doesn’t occur until after it’s unlocked by Jeanne with a little device known as the ‘regalia’. At that point, the show starts venturing off into a more sci-fi zone. Not only that but other characters also get their own mecha. It becomes absurd to a point of deconstruction where characters fight for affairs using these mecha devices despite having little to no experience prior. And here, I thought the taste of anachronism was weird.Artwork comes together clustered but that’s because the fusion of historical and science backgrounds added together in a mix. When you have that, it comes out as zany. Yet, most of the designs are solid in particular with the world class backgrounds. It’s creative and invites attention to questions for viewers behind its origins. This can also apply to the mecha with their innovative designs that gives them a menacing appearance. The action they demonstrate will draw in eyes for attention with rapid movements thanks to its artillery. The characters themselves also have a good balance of mixture with their designs. Nobunaga looks like a badass, he behaves like a badass, and technically, he is a badass. Other characters such as Da Vinci, Ichime, and Hideyoshi stays true to their consistent character designs to match the right persona. On the other hand, Jeanne is hard to take seriously. Despite being portrayed as a stunning beauty with her long blonde hair, curves, and figure, her character doesn’t match at all with the historical counterpart. It’s just too damn silly.Judgment of its soundtrack goes towards mostly for our characters’ voice mannerism since the show focuses a great deal to portray them individually. Of all the main characters, Nobunaga stands out the most with his commanding tone, intimidating nature, but also the same time a man heart of gold. However, others such as Himiko and Jeanne can come off as forceful with their voice mannerisms in particular during climatic scenes. On the other hand, background music has a decent degree of variances. It feels natural despite all the absurdity going on on occasions. The OP and ED songs also provide support for its moderate coordination with the OST.It’s easy to say that Nobunaga the Fool isn’t for everyone. Even if you’re a historian, this show will at times dance around with its gimmicks to a point of deconstruction. But looking closely, the show have some merits to its themes and style. It’ll take time to get used to it but some patience may pay off. On the other hand, be ready for some cliché and gags that can be hard to praise with everything thrown together. The story itself is also clustered with weak writing and uninteresting characterization when it comes to development. All in all, this show isn’t like reading a history book to get its message. Rather, it’s like a foolish textbook of literature taught by a professor of the coming ages. escape a labyrinth.To venture into a show like Nobunaga the Fool will take an imaginative and open mind. While it seems absurd at first glance, one should acknowledge the creativity of the show. For instance, take a closer look at the setting. It’s divided into two halves, the West and East Star. Upon a closer glance, there’s conflicts in their world involving warfare. And as even a fool can guess, the show trifles by the idea of war as result of ideologies. But let’s go back to the basics. The show fuses together legendary historical figures, tosses in the mechanics of mecha, and empowers them in this bizarre setting.For what’s worth, we get fusion of a steampunk/historical setting. The characters involved in the show may seem to be related to their legendary ancestors. Yet, their similarities only seems to scratch its historical domain. Starting off, there’s a blur of reality as Jeanne Kaguya d’Arc (based off of the character ‘Joan of Arc’), is burned at a stake in a typical witch hunt endgame style. Then flash forward and we find out that she has a powerful object that can potentially influence the world. Not only that but she also has visions relating to the one individual that will save the world, also known as the Fool, Oda Nobunaga. Here’s where the fun comes in. Oda Nobunaga is exactly as his name states. Not only is he the titular character but he is literally portrayed as a fool with his brash personality. His actions and behavior will get people talking despite it being harmless, on occasions anyways. But looking carefully, Nobunaga is a man that’s difficult to understand. It’s not an understatement either since his character is a representation of The Fool card based off of the tarot legend. The tarot cards bring about a purpose that serves as a fortitude of each episode. But behind those cards lies a meaning that unlocks each episodes’ morality through imagery, perhaps relating to the true visage of our titular character.Nobunaga the Fool isn’t just about making a prophecy come true.  Throughout the series, we see different sides of Nobunaga and Jeanne. Nobunaga for instance is portrayed as a hotheaded man that he seems to wear like a mask. Yet, we do see a different side of him when he is with those closer with others, such as his family like his sister Ichihime. Later on, Nobunaga’s relationship/partnership with Jeanne grows closer. It reaches to a point where he strives to protect her no matter what. At the apex, he puts his own life on the line to save hers. And as seemingly incompatible as the duo is at first, Jeanne herself also develops feelings throughout their journey. Originally, she questions herself whether it’s worthwhile to accompany Nobunaga. Later, there’s a 180 degree turn where she strives to help him no matter what. To point it in easier perspective, the duo becomes more than just partners in crime.

The series very loosely adapts elements to the historical personas of each character in the series with some of the major characters (particularly Jeanne and Nobunaga) gaining aspects of the historical character they are based off of while many of the Westerners don't get much to them beyond being archetypal evil characters per...Japan's usual penchant of demonizing other countries in their works. Mecha, magic and elements of steampunk are also tossed into the mix as mecha serve as the main means of combat for the military in this series with powerful gems called Regalia that serve to amplify the abilities of a mecha and Leonardo Da Vinci milking use of fortunetelling to foretell upcoming events within the series.The first half of the series sets up Nobunaga's rise to becoming the ruler of his clan and exploring the world of his planet as he gets into conflict with other clans, claims Regalia and hints are dropped over the lurking threat of the Western Planet's influence. This point of the series was solid in that it helped establish the backgrounds and problems facing the major characters of the series and the world of the Eastern Planet.Unfortunately, the second half is where things start becoming a mess with the title's plot as many of the major Western Planet characters lack the depth and personality of the Eastern Planet ones and makes an attempt at trying to be an epic clash between the Western and Eastern sides yet comes across as more predictable thanks to its milking of action and mecha anime cliches. It also tries establishing an unconvincing love triangle with Nobunaga, Jeanne and Himiko that doesn't get much focus thanks to the plot's greater focus on the conflict between the Western and Eastern planets. Also, the ending of the series is rather awkward as details on aspects of character motives and prophecies are suddenly tossed into the series finale without any hints to their coming or earlier exploration of them.Visually, the series is one of the better-quality titles I've seen for the year thus far with vivid scenery and a good amount of detail with scenery and character designs. The mecha used in the series are rendered in CG animation and move fluidly in action during heated battle scenes, though they stick out quite prominently compared to the regular animation.Overall, I found Nobunaga the Fool to be a case of an anime that started off well for its first half, yet crashes and burns for its second half. What started off as solid character focus and plot buildup devolved into fairly typical territory that action/ mecha titles delve into and a subpar attempt at trying to be grandiose with later plot developments.

Kind of regret having to go through the second half of this title."", 'Nobunaga the Fool is one of those shows that attracted my attention immediately. It seemed to be a cross between Star Driver and Sengoku Basara. So, a vaguely historical drama with giant robots that battle it out for reasons only vaguely explored. With lots, and lots, and LOTS of ham-fisted flash and dazzle, of the kind that makes Gurren Lagann look like a couple of kids waving sparklers about. Not the most intellectually stimulating thing I can think of, but good for a laugh.However, once the initial, introductory dazzle has simmered down and the show starts getting down to business, it becomes quite clear...that the show can’t quite decide WHAT the business at hand actually is. The show seems to hop between fictitious historical drama, science-fiction, fantasy, mecha, occasional romance, a little bit of shounen, and a whole host of other genres scattered about here and there.The problem with Nobunaga the Fool is that it wants to do EVERYTHING. It not only wants to have its cake and eat it too, it wants the cake of the five or six people sitting next to it as well. You can only eat so much cake before the inevitable, and what the Fool vomits over the course of its tedious twenty-four episode run is about as pleasant to sit through as the metaphor implies.But don’t get me wrong here, the first few episodes of the show are actually rather well-written, and promise great things to come. The political strife and backstabbing that occurs during Nobunaga’s rise to power is well thought-out and gives clear insight into character motivations. Here, the trio of Nobunaga, Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi truly shine, as whilst the three are united by a common goal, what they are willing to do to achieve that goal varies, and the actions certain individuals take towards that goal promise some serious ramifications down the road. Of the three, Hideyoshi is the only one not given any real character, being assigned the role of “comic relief” (I suppose SOMEONE has to do it) but as actions speak louder than words in this show, character becomes of secondary importance, as battles are fought, people are killed, and talk is cheap.…and then the West gets involved, and all hell breaks loose, as talk becomes central and battles are downplayed in favour of what goes on behind the scenes…which actually isn’t as interesting as it was initially, as Nobunaga has secured his power by this point and as the West is governed with an iron fist by King Arthur, there is little room for intrigue.Characterization for the Fool from that point forward is, for the most part, poor, as characters fail to really develop beyond their initial roles. Outside of their relationships to one another – and not even that in most cases – there is little to associate these characters with the historical figures they represent; in fact, if these characters had any other names, the show would likely be all the better for it, as then the contrast would not be quite so jarring. Some, like Jeanne Kaguya (yes, really) D’Arc have been butchered entirely, abandoning their historical depiction in all but name only to adopt a guise (in her case, it would be large-breasted damsel-in-distress with the secondary functions of apocalyptic prophet and love interest) that serves to drive the ill-conceived mess of a plot along. There are a few moments where Mitsuhide in particular breaks out of his stereotypical servant’s angst for some moments of genuine, heartfelt emotional turmoil, and it’s difficult NOT to feel something concerning the love triangle involving him, Ichihime and Caesar at times, but for the most part the show is focused on how misunderstood and smart the reputedly foolish Nobunaga is, and how much of a big deal the grand East vs. West war is.The terms “Saviour King” and “Destroyer King” get thrown about a lot, and the result at the end is surprising, but lacks the gravity it should, as the overarching plot is never given sufficient explanation or detail for it to have any sort of impact beyond a raised eyebrow. The story for the Fool is both predictable in how its going to end, and unpredictable for what is going to happen from moment to moment. This makes it both entertaining and tedious to watch, as events become isolated, rather than sequential. Each episode could be taken as standalone and, whilst this is not necessarily a bad approach, it is bad in the sense that nothing really ties events together. Things just happen; reasons and reactions are disguised, downplayed, or often just outright ignored, leaving the viewer wondering exactly WHY they should even give a damn about all this.Structure is given to the show by the tarot-card theme, which, like everything else, seems to have been thrown in there for convenience’s sake, and because hey, tarot cards are cool, right? It worked for Persona 4! Ironically, in defining the character’s actions by forcing them to fit to tarot cards, each episode feels  limited by the card description, and the sense of two worlds colliding is replaced by a very soap-opera feeling as the shallow, stereotypical characters lament on their personal (and often entirely uninteresting) dramas. Whose actions are represented by the card this episode?! This shallow, one-dimensional approach would have been so much better if explanation were not provided at the end of each episode, instead being left to the viewer to decide. The result is that episodes become focused on a single character, and everything else that happens in the episode is dismissed. When people are dying, betraying one another and fighting epic battles (or what SHOULD be epic battles) in giant robots, it gives a profound sense of mistaken priorities, and some missed opportunities for character development.Battles in the Fool fail to live up to expectation, being standard clashes between two characters who probably aren’t even sure WHY they’re fighting (Alexander the Great, at the very least, seems quite bored with the whole thing) a lot of the time, with little in the way of special moves or inventive combat styles, despite the fact the Regalia they use to pilot the suits are elementally-attuned (surprise!) and individual suits are all quite different in design, so should have fighting styles that differ from just “swing your weapon of choice to win”. There is no Gundam-style creativity here, unfortunately, and little in the way to recommend it. Star Driver had an awful plot, but fantastic fight scenes, which mitigated the offense somewhat. Nobunaga the Fool’s fight scenes are about on-par with its plot in terms of excitement.A typical East vs. West conflict with mostly out-of-context historical figures (Jeanne KAGUYA D’Arc, I ask you!) and stereotypical religious undertones in the guise of tarot-card titled episodes for good measure, Nobunaga the Fool is a grand exercise in stupidity that can’t even decide WHAT type of stupidity it wants to be. Stealing piecemeal ideas from almost every genre conceivable and then stripping the of anything even remotely resembling depth, what starts as a vaguely interesting and promising show quickly turns into a dull, convoluted mess that would make even the most inexperienced of fanfiction writers cringe in embarrassment. Avoid if you would prefer to keep your brain cells healthy and fully functional. Watch if you haven’t had quite enough bollocks in your life recently and are in the mood to completely and utterly waste your time – you’d be hard-pressed to find an anime that will waste it much more than this will. that the show can’t quite decide WHAT the business at hand actually is.

The technology in the show is that of Feudal Japan and the Feudal West, except that there are huge robots. That\'s pretty ludicrous, but it didn\'t bother me too much. Other than that, the show is obviously well crafted and well thought out (but I can\'t explain why because that would be spoilers) and the show isn\'t afraid to kill, like so many...action anime are.

Something that bothered me, however, was that all of the people on the Star of the East have counterparts from the Sengoku period, and the entire star is just Japan. All. Japan. The characters on the Star of the West are from the Classical/Dark-Age and Chandragupta was from India, how is the India West. Why? But this shouldn\'t bother many people, just me. Despite that, the depth of the main characters have me awarding the Characters with a score of 9.-EnjoymentI liked it. 8.', ""This is very frustrating.Nobunaga the fool is an anime of big contrast and conflict. The best way to describe my feelings after watching it is love hate relationship...On the one hand, every topic of the visual arts are masterpieces! No matter what: mecha design, character design, background, animation. Simply beautiful and perfect. Further there are plenty of new ideas and new concept in the story. The way they separated the western and the eastern world into two planets or tries to combine so many genres into unity are refreshing!On the other hand: how comes that a story with that big potential becomes kind.. boring?...There are just little of character development (except Caesar), no success of going deep into character's psyche, most of the important characters appear facile, dialogues mostly are not interesting.The story could become much more complicated, very emotional and incredibly dramatic, but the most part of them turned out too simple too understand.At least: Caesar truly knows how to steal people's heart!

Heart pounding, emotions at an all time high you see the shape of a rectangular gift wrapped up in beautiful wrapping paper with a delicate bow on top.  You...hold it in your hands, the perfect gift, and take it all in. Soon it will be yours. With careful hands you remove the tape oh so carefully, doing your best to saviour the moment. Then you give in and begin to shred the paper and all that gets in your way. They it is in front of you, your brand new skateboard. You take some deep breaths to calm down, only to find in front of you not the skateboard you wanted, instead you find a cheap piece of plastic with shoddy wheels and a clown decal on the underside...

I'll try not to spoil the series and do my best to convey my thoughts and opinions about the series.Story: 10The story was amazing. With the end each episode, I was always excited to see what would happen next. The story took many twist and turns that had me surprised. One moment, I'd think that one thing was going to happen, but then something happens that I was never expecting. This series isn't your run of the mill mecha anime. Niether is it your run of...the mill Oda Nobunaga series. It's a fusion of Sengoku period and futuristic times, taking popular figures from long ago and throwing in giant robots. It's sure to please anyone who likes these two types of series.Art: 10When it comes to anime, I love when the art is appealing. This anime meets AND exceeds my expectations. The character designs are eye catching, the setting is beautiful, and the the mechas look amazing. CG is very cool and this anime does it just right.Sound: 10Oh man.. Let me tell you about this anime's soundtrack. I find myself humming the OST all the time. Even when I'm not watching the anime. It's just that catchy. The vocal tracks are awesome as well. There was an insert song by Jam Project which kicked so much butt! The openings and endings are also great. I listen to them all the time when I'm on my jog.Character: 9The only reason why this gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there are a couple of characters that I did not like. Mainly because of some of the things they did in the series. However, the majority of the main cast are really cool. Nobunaga is a take charge guy who isn't afraid to fight back. This is the kind of protagonist I like. One who knows what he wants and does as he pleases. That's what makes him great.Enjoyment: 10There is never a dull moment when watching Nobunaga The Fool. Not once have I ever felt bored or disliked an episode. Each played an important part to the story and always had something cool in it to keep me entertained, whether it be a fight or character development.Overall: 10In conclusion, Nobunaga The Fool has to be one of the best anime of 2014. Others may not agree, but that's what I believe. It's a series that makes you wanting more. It has a set plot that never gets too confusing, but isn't too predictable either. It also makes you think one thing, but will throw a curve ball and change it up so that it leaves you with a dropped jaw. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll cheer. This anime will fill you with a variety of emotions while watching it. It has enough drama to make feel for the characters and enough action to keep you on the edge of your feet.

So much so I made an account just to reviews it.I would say the first two episodes you kinda have to force yourself to keep going. Your mind is telling you this is quite dull....and very confusing. But by the third episode I was forcing my husband to sit and watch it with me cause I knew it was gonna be epic.The story is extremely detailed and if your don't pay close attention you may miss something. It is a very tightly packed story so much so they actually so skip scenes where characters narrate what...has happened. So be prepared for the skip scenes....I was kinda confused at first...makes you think you missed an episode somewhere.The art is good. Not the best art I've seen but no where near the worst. It seemed to be the style changed maybe 15-20 episodes in. The characters seemed more life like...maybes it's just me.The opening and ending song for the first half of the anime is freaking awesome. Please just fast forward through the opening on the second half. It was major let down. The ending isn't terrible but not my favorite.Over all I will own this anime as soon as I can get my grubby little hands on it. And it will have a spot on my shelf of the like 10 anime I deem important enough to own. I just can't tell you why...you have to watch it to find out. has happened.

It may not sound interesting considering the fact that there are other historical figures in the series like Leonardo da Vinci. The story overall isn't too terrible nor is it fantastic. The story in a way is original but it's just that the writers occasionally didn't know what they were doing so they placed some random plot elements and it fully doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Both ending themes I really like (both in animation-wise, which isn't much but well done in its own right)The OST itself felt a little transparent although one track comes to mind in comes to be memorable but I forgot what the track is called nor what it's used for but it sounds the most memorable to me (I'll edit this review when I find it).Characters: 7It's kinda hard to explain everything in the section, since I'm not supposed to spoil anything.

Combining historical characters, history, fantasy, mecha and magic, this series delivers an ambitious and creative narrative and stands as a unique offering in a sea of ""been-there-done-that"". My spoiler free review:Story: 7.Nobuanaga The Fool\'s story is ambitious, it combines elements of Japan\'s history, famous figures from world history and magic and creates this incredibly juicy story that at it\'s core is about destiny. The way the show uses the cards - pulled once per episode by characters to fortell an event to come - is so incredibly unique...and intriguing. The cards meaning often unfolds in a way you don\'t expect but guessing the meaning along the way - with the characters - as the story unfolds both per episode and as a whole creates a very unique experience. The story was heavy on detail and does require you to really pay attention as it unfolds but it also delivers a great deal of action and suspense as well. The story was well-paced, unique, and kept you guessing till the very end.Art: 7. Nobunaga The Fool has an appealing art style - it boasted great character designs, beautiful backgrounds and scenery and a great use of colour. Present - as with most mecha\'s these days - are the clunkier CGI mechas I am NOT fond of and I found their design did detract from my appreciation of the art. I am not fond of clunky, CGI mecha\'s and I never will be.Sound: 9. Nobunaga The Fool had a great soundtrack. A nice wide range of pieces that really enhanced each and every scene when used. I was very fond of the two battle theme\'s, in particular, Destruction-King and it\'s use within the series. The 1st set of openings and endings was very good - I really enjoyed both songs, especially the ending theme, though the second cours themes weren\'t quite as special.Characters: 7. Nobunaga had such a WIDE range of characters. Nobunaga Oda, Julius Caesar, Jeanne d\'Arc, Leonardo Da Vinci, Alexander, Cesare Borgia,  Hideyoshi, King Arthur, etc. The cast of characters - and their very unique use in this series - was very enjoyable. I have a deep love of history and I appreciate nothing more when history is used to inspire something creative and thought provoking and these characters were used so uniquely within this series and really delivered that for me. The characters as a whole were well developed - there were times when I questioned Nobunaga\'s development but I soon found my questions answered and was very happy with his journey. A few could have been focused on and developed a bit more, but overall, the series did a good job in that department. Each character had an important journey, lessons to be learned, truths to be realized and destiny\'s to both fight and accept - and their journey\'s were well handled and developed and ultimately, very very enjoyable for me.Enjoyment: 9. I deeply enjoyed this incredibly creative series. It\'s use of magic and history - my two favorite things in the world - to deliver this unique story with this odd, yet incredible cast of historical heroes was so refreshing. Nobunaga delivered on so many levels with it\'s great OST, interesting and unique story that is far from predictable with it\'s twists and turns (and before watching this, I felt starved for something truly unique!), high action and great use of magic. Fans of history, mecha, magic and high action will really enjoy this wonderful series which is sadly, very underrated. It wasn\'t perfect but it was a unique, highly enjoyable gem of a series.Overall: 8. and intriguing.

It's not even spectacular since everything is so predictable.Really disappointed in this show. You can see they put money in it yet...Such a shame. "", 'I almost didnt give this one a chance due to the low scores it had and the random mix of genres, but after reading some reviews i decided to give it a chance - which im really glad for. I exctually did enjoy it quite alot. I recommend that you watch this show with an open mind, like a colourful circus or like a roller coaster in the funny house. So I will now get down to why I enjoyed ""Nobunaga the Fool"" (who in all means lives up to his name).Story: 6/10By all means the shows weakest part, but its actually not that bad...at all. There are a lot of plot holes and alot of things are never explained so they can never be really understood. As the page tells you, its a quite unique mixture of action, historical, mecha and sci-fi. And it aslo magic, super power, fantasy and romance in that mix. A mix at least I never seen before in anime. As expexted it gets messy sometimes, but shore not lets you down in the entertainment aera. This is a story of two worlds (east star and west star) thats are connected by forces that are never really explained, but you can clearly see a influence of western historia (west star) and eastern historia (east star). On the west star we have Europen historical personas as Jeanne d´Arc, Di Vinci, King Arthur and Julius Ceasar to mention some. On the eastern star you can also clearly see historical Japanese influences, with samurai clans, tea cermonices and traditional clothing. But there the historical part ends. Because in both world wars are held with giant mecha suits, and the most powerful worries carries a""secret treasure"" which amplifies their power in some elemental way (wind, fire, earth etc.). The basic storyline is that Jeanne d´Arc tries to find out if Nobunaga is the ""Savior King"" or not, and a power struggle first internally on the east star, and then later between the eatsern star and the western star. A red thread in the story is that in each episode Di Vinci lets someone (often Jeanne) to draw a tarotcard, and he explains the diffirent meanings of that card. The card is always directed to some of the characters (which is where you come in to guess whom its diredted to), and the character in question will for fill that during the epsiode. Without spoiling anything I can say that the end of the show suprised me alot and I did not see that coming, which was refreshing and made me like the show more.Art: 9/10If the story is ""Nobunagas the fools"" weakest part, the art and animation is it strongest part. As expected of studio Satelight, the animation and art is great. As usual it has its flaws, but character designs, colours and backgrounds are beautiful and colourful. Motions are fluid and smooth, and the CG mecha fights are pretty good as well.Sound: 7/10The music and sound are by no means outstanding, but its absolutly above average. The music is mostly intrumental towards the classical, which suits the mood and diffirent settings in the show good. I liked the first opening song quite a bit, but the second one never really got to me. I watched the dubbed version and the voice actors were not magical but they did there job well, and had manage to capture the nature of the characters good as well.Characters: 7/10Overall there where no major character developments, but at least you got to know the main and supporting cast well enough to give the story life and actions motivated.First out we have one of our MC´s Nobunaga. He is the heir to the Oda clan, and is in no way espacially eager to take up on the responsabilites that comes with it. He can many times come out as a jerk but at least he is honest. Nobunaga is a very stong willed person, who always do things his way - no matter what. He can seem pretty care free and foolish, but do have deeper feelings and if his close ones needs him he will cross worlds to save them. As expected from a MC he has some character development, there he gets to terms with who he is and what his purpose is.Jeanne d´Arc/Ramarou - Had more potentail then was exicuted in the show, but by no means a bad or boring character. She has visions of future events, ever since she was a child. In classical historical anda she was seen as demon who only brought unfurtiune to others. That made her to not trust herself, which she has deal with under many occasions during the show. Her strongest belives are that Nobunaga is the ""Savior King"", who will save both world from distruction - but even those belives are put to question.Di Vinci -  Can be seen as your guide in this malstream of generes and events. He is the observer - following the events with a kind of distached facination. He is the one with the tarotcards, with his actions and words pulling the story forward without being directly in the actual events.And definitely worth mentioning is Himiko, Ichihime, Ceasar and Mitsuhide, who all are contributing to the story. They all have their own peronalities, wills and diseres that will contribute to that the plot is moving forward, sometimes in very drastic ways.Enjoyment: 8/10I actually really enjoyed myself watching this show. You never really know what next episode would go, which made it intresting to watch for me. Yes, sometimes I was pretty confused, and asked myself - what the hell did just happened and why? But it was never boring and managed to entertain me alot.Overall: 7/10It was most definitley worth my time. Yes, the plot wasnt that outstanding and sometime confusing (which normally goes against my standards of a good anime), but it never failed to entertain me. The great animation and art was clearly a huge plus. I would definitley recommend ""Nobunaga the fool"" to you who want to see something totally different and dont mind unique mixture of geners. at all.

They all have their own peronalities, wills and diseres that will contribute to that the plot is moving forward, sometimes in very drastic ways.Enjoyment: 8/10I actually really enjoyed myself watching this show. You never really know what next episode would go, which made it intresting to watch for me. Yes, sometimes I was pretty confused, and asked myself - what the hell did just happened and why? But it was never boring and managed to entertain me alot.Overall: 7/10It was most definitley worth my time. Yes, the plot wasnt that outstanding and sometime confusing (which normally goes against my standards of a good anime), but it never failed to entertain me. The great animation and art was clearly a huge plus. I would definitley recommend ""Nobunaga the fool"" to you who want to see something totally different and dont mind unique mixture of geners.', 'Summary: This is a mech anime that isn\'t really a mech anime. It is more an epic story about the unification of 2 kingdoms with tons of historic figures reprising various roles and lots of awesome battles and story arcs. The anime jumps the shark a few times and there are definitely a few things to be desired but I thoroughly enjoyed this for all it\'s flaws. In lieu of a long review I will sum up the positives and negatives:Positives:An epic story that develops from something pretty simple and straight forward to downright epic. The story involves tons of epic historic figures from Alexander...the Great to Julius Caesar to King Arthur. Seeing how each character evolves and the role they play is a pleasure.The art is gorgeous and well done. This is a GREAT looking anime.The music is nice and well put together. The fighting sound track is also excellent and the voice actors do a fantastic job.I enjoyed the story from beginning to end. Regardless of it jumping the shark and being a bit confusing it wasn\'t afraid to cover all sorts of angles and go to dark places unapologeticly. It is also A COMPLETE STORY. You don\'t need to read a LN or Manga... this is the total package from beginning to end. Boy isn\'t that nice!Negatives:There are some confusing points to the story. I swear there is an episode missing with Mitsuhide and Caesar that confused me endlessly. The ending is definitely meg and I have a hard time imagining anyone being satisfied with it.Happy ending... not so much. Lots of characters will die... and I mean LOTS. Do NOT watch this if that kind of thing is too dark for you.The ending is a bit flashy and too convenient. A little to much of ""boy that wrapped up neatly"" though I won\'t fault it too much because it was not afraid to go in an unexpected direction.Final Summary: If you like excellent story driven narratives this is for you. It has good fight scenes but is mostly story/character drives. Prepare for an emotional roller-coaster. It is a good experience, it starts a little slow but it is a great adventure.

Enjoy!', ""A short Review for everyone who is still not sure if to watch it because of the 'bad rate' :Nobunaga the fool was one of my favourite Anime - at least for the first 15-18 episodes. Before that turning point it's a very good anime with a good story, awesome story developement, much comedy and a nice and cute Lovestory. I really enjoyed it! But after episode 15-18 the whole mood changes to a depressing, not very comedical, tragic story with an aweful ending that doesn't make any sense.Still I would recommend watching it - if not for the end of the story it would...be a clear all in all 9 ...but like this...Nevertheless - watch it an enjoy it! I also rewatched the series a few times (till the episodes 15-18) and I'm still planning on doing so again :) be a clear all in all 9 ...but like this...Nevertheless - watch it an enjoy it! I also rewatched the series a few times (till the episodes 15-18) and I'm still planning on doing so again :)"", ""NO SPOILERS C:I started watching this show 4 years ago and dropped it after 4 episodes, and it's just now that I decided to give it a second chance. Difference being that at that time, I didn't know any of japanese historical characters. Knowing few facts about the real warlords changed the way I see the characters, and made it more interesting too follow.Story fair to good enough but had greater potentiel.Characters developements Ok to good.Seiyus' acting was great as always and musics ok.The Art good as well.Overall 7,5/10It wasn't the anime of the year, but even if the first episodes were a...bit a torture to watch at last I enjoyed the show And I don't regret giving it a second chance! bit a torture to watch at last I enjoyed the show And I don't regret giving it a second chance!"", ""God this anime could have been awesome but it managed to ruin everything. Before I start be warned that this review might contain minor spoilers.The summary of the story sounds awesome to the ears. Especially for a big fun of Fate/zero this anime would be the next best thing. But unfortunately it isn't like that. In contrast with Fate/zero which is a clearly battle anime with some philosophical aspects , ''Nobunaga the fool'' tries to mix all kinds of genres and the results is a huge disaster. From the first episode the anime was shouting from the distance that it was going to be boring....And unfortunately it was. Well, at least for the first 14 episodes. After that it became better but I don't thing that anyone is so patient to bare watching until then. It wasn't that the anime had problems with the pacing. In fact it is a very violent anime with a huge body count up its sleeve. What makes this anime boring are it's really uninteresting characters and the failed try to mix almost every genre in 24 episodes leaving this way a lot of plot holes and things that didn't make any sense. For example in the first episodes Nobunaga looses some very dear persons of his but we don't  see their deaths to have any effect on him until the very end, making us to forget them really easily. The worst part of this anime though were the characters. Nobunaga is clearly a Kamina rip-off with the only difference that he was boring as hell.  Same goes with almost all of the characters and that's really bad because this anime especially at the end becomes really character-driven, but with the characters to have almost none character development it didn't end up nowhere. Only exception was maybe Caesar's character but he was also ruined near the end   The  only thing I liked about the story was that the world was really well introduced to us. Especially the huge anachronisms made it somehow fun although it couldn't save a lot of things. After that comes the animation which was good but not for a production of 2014. The mechas were animated solely by CGI which I didn't like really much but I let it slide. About the sound I didn't like neither the first opening, nor the first ending but the second OP/ED  were really good and catchy. But  the voice acting had some flaws. With Mamory Miyano as the protagonist and some other huge names for the secondary characters (like Takahiro Sakurai, Yuki Kaji, Tomokazu Sugita and my personal favorite Kazuya Nakai) you expect some big performances but the results are rather disappointing. Having experienced all those big names in some very amazing roles in other anime and knowing their potentials I have to say that in this anime they were somehow off especially Miyano but I believe this was mostly because of the badly written characters.So as you probably understand I didn't like this anime. It had a really good main story but it ruined it with a lot of nonsensical things that made the plot really boring. Of course this is only my opinion. If you don't agree with me I will gladly listen to your arguments in a  peaceful way. I hope I helped you somehow and sorry for my bad English. And unfortunately it was.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Gotta ""review"" it before I forget what it was all about, this clusterhell of an Anime.✦StoryYou know... reason I kept watching was because I couldn\'t figure out whenever this was a masterpiece or an absolute bollocks. Thankfully last episodes helped me to decide that this was an horrid Anime. Aside synopsis I must say story was somewhat ""good"" because of it actually tried to have story, lot of sides of the story and the depth. But instead it felt as everything was tossed in, giving lot of...narration and dialogues, which fell apart on it\'s own weight. Point being, story was attempted too serious for its thematic and also had an failed presentation. In another words story/world was quite inconsistent, pacing all over the place, even if story links made sense, they didn\'t feel any good. And way characters were tossed left and right plus that finale, made it even more  moronic than it should have been. Point being,  ""story"" was horrid, inconsistent and too much was attempted to throw in.✦Art & SoundAnother aspect of mixed feelings regarding this Anime. Art and animation for the most part felt okay, while at some times (especially some character close-ups) it felt as I was watching at some paint image. Meaning it felt very basic and plain art at times.As for OST, to be honest, I cannot remember any. Which means either they were as bad/mediocre or didn\'t have enough presence. Did youtube few tracks afterwards, but opinion remains.✦CharacterProbably part I liked the most, lot of stereotypes and moronic ""depth"" characters that tried to do/be something too hard and that simply felt stupid in the end. (hate overall people/characters with typical facade/lies characteristics..etc.).Going to mention only main trio, few side-kicks and character I liked in a most simplistic way.We have main guy, a loud meathead. We have a main girl, beautiful oppai moral compass and a squad gatherer the Da Vinci, who is some odd theatrical guy.As for sidekicks. Aggressive monkey, Silent killer/tactician and bunch of others.And the character who I loved the most was ""Himiko"", she was adorable.✦Enjoyment & OverallAs mentioned, it\'s a clusterhell of an Anime, with too much attempted to throw in, too many moronic story aspects, and annoying characters and all over the place consistency. Too serious/heavy for it\'s own good. It crushed with it\'s own attempted weight.

Everything on paper says this anime should at the very least be enjoyable as a minimal amount of mindless entertainment, but it is not. Everything that happens in this anime simply precludes a yawn and a ho-hum.So why is this show bad? It's...not a complex reason at all really. Because at any point in time the entire cast could have been replaced by a new cast and it would have probably been for the better. Nobunaga the Fool tries so hard to jam pack itself with tons of different story elements it completely neglects the crucially important art of making sure your characters aren't horribly one dimensional. What was Nobunagas main motivation throughout the show? I can't even remember, because the writers and director never made it a big deal. Why do the female characters find him attractive? What are they even like? Do they even have a personality? None of that seemed to matter to the creators of this anime.In order for a story to be interesting, the characters must be at least relatable. If a story doesn't tell you anything about any of the characters at all, then what you have is an outline with the potential to be a story - not an actual story. That's what Nobunaga feels like: a potential story that could have been good if the writers focused more on what matters and less on trying to be an epic about the universe. not a complex reason at all really.

Sound was great to i do not like the characters because the way the presents Jeanne D'Arc is not the image of Jeanne D'Arc i have. Jeanne D'Arc was brave and tough, she was not this weeping little girl this anime presents. It was two things this anime hade correct about Jeanne D'Arc. The first is that she was beautiful...and the second is that she got premonitions from god. There image of Julius Caesar was real weird it was both right and wrong with the image i have. It was some of the things i did not like with this anime. I like that they created the anime with such big names though.

I think my review will be like all others here.Story - 6 (fair)Why I'm giving this story a six?, well... because plot wasn't so bad, the execution is the problem here...

This is the reason of my poor enjoyment of the show... CHARACTERS ARE CRAP. I mean... Joan of Arc should be a badass woman and this version of her is an insult, I even like a bit more Himiko than her, at least she did something in the whole series. Oda Nobunaga is a bit better, but why is so one-dimensional character?, I didn't like how they wrote his personality. And well... the rest of the cast, except the ninja girls, the lady in charge of mechas maintance and Ichihime... are so annoying or entirely different from their real counterpart. And WTH... King Arthur ressembles more a dark sorcerer than a king... He was acting more like Betelgeuse from Re:Zero or Gilles de Rais (Caster) from Fate/Zero, really disgusting.Enjoyment - 4 (decent)It wasn't SO bad.

Character design styles are typical but the animation, consistency of body proportions, and generally smooth animation is a plus. There is use of some level of CGI but it isn't super out of place and other than nitpickers, this bit isn't a big deal.Sound: 71st ED was decently catchy. The sound track was overall okay. It isn't on masterpiece levels but it's not terrible. Leans on the good side.Character: 6Some characters were...a bit bizzarre or somewhat difficult to understand. Other were easier to swallow and they did focus down on enough characters that each major one gets some development. The villain side is mostly not grey though and the character alignment per side is pretty typical for a standard narrative. This department doesn't really stand out but it is done okay.Story: 7For most of the story, since you can get somewhat attached to the main cast, the characters do have impact when they die or get injured. One recurring element is the tarot card draws which hint at what will happen that episode. While not gamebreaking, it does get just slightly tiring from the repetitiveness. Furthermore, while most of the plot makes sense, the ending episodes did feel slightly rushed, though the ending itself is still satisfying.Overall: 7Who is this for:-mecha fans-fans of history inspired worksWho is this not for:-history geeks who can't stand historical inaccuracies-mecha haters-CGI nitpickers/haters a bit bizzarre or somewhat difficult to understand.

Nobunaga the fool was a beautiful and tragic portrayal of determination and arguably selflessness. Even though he said it was his dream to ""Unify the lands"" I truly believe that what resulted this was him being fed up and tired of the war period on his star. And how he reacted to the death of his comrades in those first few episodes with Hideyoshi and Mistu showed that. Which lead to that magnificent scene in which...they promised to ""Unify the lands and change the world!"".The anime also displayed scenes of the MC\'s development and struggle elegantly I would say. It also  perceived different sides of Oda Nobunaga that iam certain weren\'t obvious or known at the beginning through out the story. Which truly amazed me for I did not expect him to change in said way. And the plot twists at the end truly keep you at the edge of your seat.I am also a big fan of music, so I really care about good Osts, Ops, and Eds. And Nobunaga The Fool covers that aspect very well. Some osts were combined into scenes where it amplified the emotion and message of that scene significantly.This anime is a mix of genres and has a bit of everything, but if you truly enjoy anime without a strict preference on a certain genre, then I believe this could be a great show for you.This is what I believe, hope it helps you. they promised to ""Unify the lands and change the world!"".The anime also displayed scenes of the MC\'s development and struggle elegantly I would say.

Anyone can watch this and feast their eyes, bring themselves up to speed with what One Piece got going at the moment, even for Manga readers, it must be nice to get a bite-sized adaptation of all of those great moments.I would...even say, if you're not a One Piece fan but are interested in getting into the series, you can safely taste the water with this episode action wise.

Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai: Under the Innocent Sky.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9922/Oretachi_ni_Tsubasa_wa_Nai__Under_the_Innocent_Sky,"['I know it\'s unjustifiable to give an 8 to an anime that has a GOD DAMN AWFUL FIRST EPISODE but before you hover that mouse pointer on top of the ""Not Helpful"" vote, please do take the time in actually reading this first.Harem would probably be my least favored genre as this includes the generic moe/ecchi or whatever fanservice they could come up. I might also disfavor the said genre because of the fans which consists mainly of the typical perverted otaku who faps to his 2D waifu. Nonetheless, I still push myself to watch anime of the harem genre in hopes of finding something...different. Though skeptical at first, I was amazed on how Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai turned to be.First and foremost, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai or simply OreTsuba, is nothing more of your typical harem. It is idiotic. It doesn’t make sense. It leaps from scene to scene. It is filled with generic tropes and stereotypes. It is overloaded with panty shots. It has a cast filled with idiots and perverts. It is absurd. Now most people would jump the gun and say it is nothing out of the generic harem and moe crap we see everyday and drop it at episode 1. That is undeniably true, given the first episode had a huge cast filled with cute girls or moe-blobs so to speak. However, OreTsuba is not one anime that presents its real facet in its premise. It needs a distinct amount of time for a viewer to understand what it’s all about. The outside generic harem appearance is only a means to fool the viewer to think that OreTsuba is one harem badly done but no, there is something much more to it.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is based off a visual novel which was developed by the company Navel. Having a visual novel as a source material would mean cute girls that could either range from lolis to the older sister type. Unlike other harem/ecchi anime that won’t mind the appearance of the characters as long as there are panty shots or the so called fanservice to render, OreTsuba is quite more attracting as it had its visuals done neatly and it probably is its selling point. The character designs were very appealing and the backgrounds were fluid. It somehow incorporates real-world scenes to the 2D world of OreTsuba making it have a 3D feel of the background which is quite nice. As for the production value of this anime, I believe it is quite high seeing that the characters and backgrounds were something much more than the usual; even the design of the school uniform was obviously done with effort.Along with the clean and cutesy character designs would be the truckload of fanservice scenes. There would be no 5 minute that would pass by without a decent amount of panty shots. For having cute and adorable character designs, the fanservice were not as distracting as some might think, in fact it blends in pretty well. I know majority of those who’ve dropped this might be because of the ridiculous fanservice but by all means, try to give it one more chance and if you can see pass through that you’ll see the fruits of it afterwards. As for the pervs who continued watching this, I’m a 100% sure by now that you’ve realized that it actually has a worthwhile plot.Though it may contain tons of it, this is not an anime about panty shots, it is the story of 3 young gentlemen namely: Takashi Haneda, Shuusuke Chitose and Hayato Narita. Having 3 male leads led to an ef - a tale of memories reminiscence and it is actually how the story goes; 3 young male characters paired with 3 young female characters only in OreTsuba, it is quite less serious, random and perverted.First off, Takashi Haneda is paired with Asuka Watarai. Asuka is basically the typical campus crush who has no personality or whatsoever only that she acts like a respected princess. As for Takashi, he’s the typical school boy who actually has no personality too except that he’s a good boy and the somewhat cowardly lead. Basically they are cardboard cut-outs which is undoubtedly one of the weakest asset that OreTsuba could display affecting their chemistry which is rather poor.One of the better couples would be Hayato Narita’s pair with Naru Ootori. Hayato Narita is a delinquent whose friends are gang members and the like. He works exclusively at night doing what other people would tell him to do. As for Naru, she’s the younger sister of a gang leader. She’s a somewhat shy little girl who took interest in Hayato after helping her in finding a lost bike. As the story goes, Hayato and Naru’s pair would look like the cutest with their cutesy and lovely interactions, with Hayato protecting Naru from other people although at the same time the weirdest of the bunch as it is a delinquent paired up with a loli.The third pair and the best in my opinion would be the pair-up of Shuusuke Chitose and Hiyoko Tamaizumi. Shuusuke works as an article reviewer for a local magazine. He’s the typical boisterous and jolly happy-go-lucky pervert. Hiyoko on the other hand is the serious type of girl who writes novels. As for why they are the best; the anime focused more on their development and as well as for their relationship to enhance. Shuusuke helps Hiyoko achieve her dream of being a successful novelist while at the same time, the feelings of Hiyoko develop more and more for Shuusuke. Watching them both mature, though stupid and nonsensical at times, is really a treat.Aside from the 3 pairs, there are a lot more characters in OreTsuba. However, not all are of importance as some only serve their roles as mere plot devices. Some if not plot devices serve as a part of the mindless comic relief the anime has. Although it has mindless comedy, that is only for itself, the comedy. As it is backed with stupidity and senselessness, it is deceiving.  The plot is actually well thought out or so to say ingenious that needs well analyzing to place in the correct pieces.As aforementioned, the story rotates around the 3 pairs. There is something much more and this something is very unusual for an anime of this type. As harems are very predictable, throw any expectations in the gutter as this isn’t. Aside from the genre tags which include: Drama, Ecchi, Romance, and Harem; it is missing one more, and this genre is Psychological. First impressions might conclude that it is very predictable. Wait until you’ve reached episode 4 which includes a sudden plot twist and you’ll know what you’re getting. However after that, seeing the first scene at episode 1, some will say that they already know where this is leading but I would suggest keeping your thoughts to yourself because I know the outcome of this anime will leave you in awe because of its unpredictability. It does well in disguising itself as a harem and an idiotic one at that to deceive its viewers in thinking that this is their run-of-the-mill rom-com.Having started as maybe one of the stupidest anime I have seen, I’m amazed with how it turned the tables with a single deus ex machina done amazingly near the end making everything fall into place. With just one snap and then boom, everything was revealed, everything was answered, everything makes sense. It answered everything completely without any cliffhangers that would require millions of hypotheses to answer.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai might not be your generic harem but accompanying it is the somewhat generic music. Although generic, they are still highly likeable. The opening song entitled “Spread Wings” by Aki Misato which is cute and lovely which perfectly fits a harem setting. The first ending song entitled “PARANoiA” by the same songstress, accompanied by a video of knights, beasts and RPG-like adventure has quite an easy feel to it while the second ending song “NEVERLAND” is well, just the same as usual which is expected from a harem.As for the voice actors, some sounded really annoying. Some sounded like someone who’s wearing a nose clip. Some were screechy. As for the remaining others, they were good which is somewhat above average or if not, just average. Along with the voices were the soundtracks. Well, for a loud and crazy anime, it is expected that the soundtracks used were loud and funky as well, which suits the lively and energetic atmosphere albeit sometimes as well as it had its fun moments, it also contains boring and “unfunny” scenes.It had its dull moments, there are times when it tries too hard to be funny, and there are those times when it’s just plain downright stupid. Looking past through that, this light and fluffy feathery ride which is called Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is one unique experience. Predictable and stupid as some might dub harem to be; stupid is true but predictable was nowhere near. A definite must watch for harem fans. Now they have something to brag about harem; that it’s not all about ecchi/moe or anything in between. And as for those who are not into harems (including me), I guess I could safely say that Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a “Do not judge the book by its cover” or more like “Harems although of the same feather, do not always flock together… because some of them don’t have wings.” (Yeah it\'s that random) different. Though skeptical at first, I was amazed on how Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai turned to be.First and foremost, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai or simply OreTsuba, is nothing more of your typical harem. It is idiotic. It doesn’t make sense. It leaps from scene to scene. It is filled with generic tropes and stereotypes. It is overloaded with panty shots. It has a cast filled with idiots and perverts. It is absurd. Now most people would jump the gun and say it is nothing out of the generic harem and moe crap we see everyday and drop it at episode 1. That is undeniably true, given the first episode had a huge cast filled with cute girls or moe-blobs so to speak. However, OreTsuba is not one anime that presents its real facet in its premise. It needs a distinct amount of time for a viewer to understand what it’s all about. The outside generic harem appearance is only a means to fool the viewer to think that OreTsuba is one harem badly done but no, there is something much more to it.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is based off a visual novel which was developed by the company Navel. Having a visual novel as a source material would mean cute girls that could either range from lolis to the older sister type. Unlike other harem/ecchi anime that won’t mind the appearance of the characters as long as there are panty shots or the so called fanservice to render, OreTsuba is quite more attracting as it had its visuals done neatly and it probably is its selling point. The character designs were very appealing and the backgrounds were fluid. It somehow incorporates real-world scenes to the 2D world of OreTsuba making it have a 3D feel of the background which is quite nice. As for the production value of this anime, I believe it is quite high seeing that the characters and backgrounds were something much more than the usual; even the design of the school uniform was obviously done with effort.Along with the clean and cutesy character designs would be the truckload of fanservice scenes. There would be no 5 minute that would pass by without a decent amount of panty shots. For having cute and adorable character designs, the fanservice were not as distracting as some might think, in fact it blends in pretty well. I know majority of those who’ve dropped this might be because of the ridiculous fanservice but by all means, try to give it one more chance and if you can see pass through that you’ll see the fruits of it afterwards. As for the pervs who continued watching this, I’m a 100% sure by now that you’ve realized that it actually has a worthwhile plot.Though it may contain tons of it, this is not an anime about panty shots, it is the story of 3 young gentlemen namely: Takashi Haneda, Shuusuke Chitose and Hayato Narita. Having 3 male leads led to an ef - a tale of memories reminiscence and it is actually how the story goes; 3 young male characters paired with 3 young female characters only in OreTsuba, it is quite less serious, random and perverted.First off, Takashi Haneda is paired with Asuka Watarai. Asuka is basically the typical campus crush who has no personality or whatsoever only that she acts like a respected princess. As for Takashi, he’s the typical school boy who actually has no personality too except that he’s a good boy and the somewhat cowardly lead. Basically they are cardboard cut-outs which is undoubtedly one of the weakest asset that OreTsuba could display affecting their chemistry which is rather poor.One of the better couples would be Hayato Narita’s pair with Naru Ootori.

Nowadays there is greater understanding of the ailments of the mind, and with that has come a rise in the number of tales featuring the subject as a central theme. That said, there is a tendency to focus on clinical depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, and other well known illnesses, which may seem a little odd until one realises that the most...commonly fictionalised ailments have one underlying connection - they all made the national news. The press is rife with tales of psychopaths, suicides, serial killers and more, and while there are stories that are based on one (or more), of the lesser known mental illnesses, the majority of authors and screenwriters will immediately utilise those that the public finds familiar.Based on the eroge of the same name by Navel, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai (We Without Wings) – Under the Innocent Sky (or OreTsuba as it's more commonly known), follows the daily lives of Haneda Takashi, Chitose Shuusuke and Narita Hayato, three young men living in the city of Yanagihara. Each leads a life that is very different to the other two, and at first they seem to have no connection to one another ...And that's about as clear as things get for quite a few episodes.From the outset there's no apparent direction or focus to the plot, and this continues until late in the series, at which point the shape of a storyline begins to appear. Now given the ultimate focus of the narrative one might argue that the somewhat dizzying sequence of events during the first half of OreTsuba are a purposeful attempt to elicit a sympathetic reaction from the audience by making them confused and uncomfortable. Unfortunately that sort of reasoning is a bit too far fetched in the cold light of day as the story appears to have been written by someone with little to no knowledge of mental illness whatsoever. In addition to that one does have to question the sanity of the person who decided an ecchi, harem romantic comedy was the best vehicle for a narrative where the core themes are not only being mentally ill, but also how it affects those around you.Speaking of harems ...OreTsuba features an array of characters who are paraded across the screen like pedigrees at a dog show, and the sheer number can initially seem impressive until one realises that the majority of them are nothing more than window dressing. There's little in the way of actual development going on, which wouldn't be a bad thing if some effort had been put into defining the characters from the start, so it's unfortunate that this is yet another anime populated by cardboard cutouts. Even worse is that almost every opportunity for growth or added definition during the first half of the series is wasted on stock events that grace many an ecchi harem tale, and while the latter portion of the story does present a few interesting scenarios, these are not enough to raise the show from mediocrity.If nothing else, OreTsuba is consistent in that the generic characters and plot tokens are very clearly reflected in the acting, and unrealistic voices abound in this series. The lead roles seem to lose interest in the project after the first episode and appear to perform little more than lines by rote for the rest of the series, but maybe it's not the fault of the seiyuu as the dialogue is sorely lacking in originality and imagination.This apparent lack of creativity also extends to the music, and many of the background tracks are of the type that one might find in just about every other ecchi harem romantic comedy, including the pieces used in Gretagard. The opening and ending themes are no better, and OreTsuba manages to uphold the best traditions of eroge and dating sim adaptations by finding the most generic J-pop tracks it can for the series OP and ED.Now given that this is an adaptation there's an inherent limitation placed on design, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing for some shows, viewers should remember what the source material actually is. The problem is that OreTsuba, like so many other eroge and datings sims, uses a stock set of character designs that have gone beyond a simple stereotype, and are now more of a hallmark for these types of story. In addition to this the animation is workman-like, and that blandness is most prominent when the character are undertaking some sort of frenetic activity.In all honesty Nomad, like so many studios before them, appear to have been unable to muster the effort to produce a good looking series.On a side note, one of the most annoying things about OreTsuba is that the visuals sometimes show a few flashes of original thinking, but these moments are often derailed or buried completely by the sudden and pointless introduction of fanservice. There are far too many occasions where events are progressing in an interesting manner when all of a sudden the screen is covered with underwear or jiggling ... things.So is OreTsuba enjoyable?Well, the story lacks any real charm or grace and the core theme has been handled in a far more sensitive manner by Mahoraba ~Heartful Days~. In addition to that, the seemingly mindless adherence to the stereotypical production methods of eroge and datings sim adaptations and the overabundance of pointless fanservice actually detract from any efforts to move the plot in a more meaningful direction. The simple fact is that OreTsuba is about as subtle and sensitive as a hammer to the face, and one event in particular highlights this as there's nothing in the series up to that point to justify the sudden revelation that one of the characters had an imaginary little brother.OreTsuba is a singular example of pretty much everything that's wrong with the anime industry these days, which is actually the only good thing about it. Watching the series is far more work than it should be, and while the source material appears to have been written and designed by people who like to wear jackets with lots of straps and really long sleeves, that's no excuse for a poorly executed adaptation. There are many ways the series could have been handled (as Tears To Tiara proved), but it looks like nobody really cared enough about this anime to make the effort.So the only question left is why on earth was it made in the first place? commonly fictionalised ailments have one underlying connection - they all made the national news.

The one weird thing for me, is that this is kind of my “guilty pleasure” anime. I know it’s horrible, but I enjoyed it for some reason despite not knowing what the fuck was going on for over half of the 12 episodes. I give it a 9/10 on my list simply because there I rate things based on enjoyment, but I’ll be more critical in this review.Plot – 5/10What Oretachi attempts to do is to put a twist on the usual “harem” genre where three or more...girls fall in love with one guy. I won’t explain much of the plot because, honestly, I don’t necessarily understand much of it myself.Art – 8/10I thought the characters designs were pretty good. It’s kind of a mix between seinen and shounen so it’s not too much of either. The only problem is maybe some odd colors for school clothes and some weird gang member in the earlier episodes with a bizarre design. The art of the city they live in which I suppose is Tokyo is fine though it doesn’t stand out as being exceptional.Music – 8/10I don’t count Openings and Endings in reviews but I just want to mention that I really like this show’s opening since it was what initially convinced me to watch this show. But the music during the episodes isn’t anything remarkable, just kind of average like the art so not much to talk about.Characters – 7/10The characters are interesting, but pretty stereotypical. There’s girls working in a maid café, a loli or two, and the main personality-split guy. There are three main characters and one not-as-important character. The problem here being that the not-as-important one is one the most hilarious and amazing minor characters I’ve ever seen. He only really gets an appearance in one episode (I believe 7) but it makes it the best episode of the series. You could honestly just watch that episode, laugh, and go on to watch something better as far as I’m concerned if you don’t want to be extremely confused.Enjoyment – 9/10I did enjoy this show. As much as I was confused and noticed how bad it was, I liked it for no reason that I can explain. Hey, we all have some show like that don’t we, something we know we shouldn’t like but still do? This isn’t one of my favorite shows by a long shot, but I’m glad I watched it. Still I wouldn’t recommend it, since I doubt many other people would feel the same weird feelings about this show that I did, but if you want to go for it. At least try episode 7, it had me laughing non-stop and it’s basically a filler episode so not too much problem in getting caught up on the events of the story. girls fall in love with one guy. I won’t explain much of the plot because, honestly, I don’t necessarily understand much of it myself.Art – 8/10I thought the characters designs were pretty good.

I have no reason to be biased and i only watch animes for...entertainment and i have plenty of other shit to do so if you think fanboying over some random stuff on the internet is healthy or good for me you better think twice, the only reason i\'m saying it is because its actually true - i still have yet to see a better anime than Oretachi ni tsubasa wa Nai and when you read this you should have in mind that at the end of the day this is a comedy, romance, ecchi anime so you can\'t possibly watch this and expect robots or space exploration or some shit like that so if you\'re going to hate on it only cause its an ecchi then you have some issues - no one is forcing you to watch animes that you normally don\'t enjoy just like how i don\'t watch animes that i normally don\'t enjoy. Oretsuba is awesome for its genre and discriminating it based on genre is stupid and i seriously don\'t see how can i rate this any lowerThe art is 10/10, the anime was made seven years ago (2011) and it still looks better than animes coming out to this year. The backgrounds are detailed and well-drawn and the waifus are top tier and you can\'t really get better art, just different, which is subjective and taste based so my rating of its art is based on the execution not the style but i do like the style as well cus they\'re cute af.The sound is 10/10, there\'s barely a single character who\'s voice annoys me a bit but all others sound perfect, they also sound unique (not like other animes where everyone sounds like a character from another anime) and the background music is actually good as well so the production value is quite highThe plot to me is 10/10, mainly because of how it\'s portrayed but the story is also good and a believable one. The portrayal of the story is unique and it\'s also a big confusing which is why you shouldn\'t watch this anime on autopilot else you\'ll get angry cus you\'re a lil triggerlord. It does take a few episodes to ramp up and become a bit more clear on your first watch but if you pay attention perhaps you\'ll be surprised in a good way instead of confused little rage god divaCharacters? Well - 10/10 obviously. There are a ton of characters in this anime and most of them are awesome and the only \'downside\' is that we don\'t really get to know any of them that well but for the amount of time we see them they are clearly defined and good. I don\'t think the length of the anime is a downside as well because i think that the anime\'s story progression is perfect and doesn\'t feel slow or rushed and this may not be the best anime to get overly-attached to some of the characters but nonetheless they\'re still good.This is based on a visual novel but it doesn\'t really matter what its based on as we\'re only reviewing the anime and the only thing that matters is the anime and how good that was. I\'ve seen a lot of people complain over bad adaptations or manga being better and what not but this doesn\'t matter at all when you\'re talking about anime so i don\'t think the VN has anything to do to the anime and what i\'m judging and rating what i saw so i\'m not going to get biased over visual novel this visual novel that.Despite the overwhelming amount of fanservice the anime is actually grown up, the characters are grown up and they also swear and insult a lot plus they\'re members of a gang and there\'s actually some violence (well it\'s not that big of a deal) and i actually believe that the creators are grown up and reasonable as well, unlike most other animes where you\'re thinking ""wtf who made this character dude?"" I dont think the fanservice is triggering or anything like that, if you\'re getting triggered by small stuff like this you should re-think your internet life cus it doesn\'t sound very healthy. Just take it with a smile or something. The humor is absolutely fantastic, i\'ve seen it five times and i still laugh at the jokes (altho it was over the years so it\'s not like i remembered everything down to the last line)This is NOT your typical harem no matter what others are saying, i\'ve seen a lot of typical harems and most of them have a ton of unreasonable characters or a garbage story or both and most of them are full of kids or teens which isn\'t the case here.I don\'t think the anime ever tries too hard or forces things too much, to me it felt completely natural and it never felt like a drag like a lot of other animes do. The last episodes were wrapped up nicely as well (unlike most other animes.. again) and finishing it leaves me with a good feeling in my tummy instead with annoyanceI did read a bit of people\'s thoughts to understand oretsuba\'s low score and it seems like some people are blaming the anime for them not understanding the anime which is dumb as hell. I understand the anime so there\'s clearly no problem with that, don\'t blame something else if you\'re the problem in the first place. I also read some people comparing this masterpiece to some garbage and saying that this is bad cause it has pantsu shots, seriously? How does a pantsu-shot make the story irrelevant? You know panties exist in real life too right? At the end of the day this is a comedy and an ecchi anime so these two things are expected and it\'s supposed to make you smile not rage and perhaps you don\'t need comedy but a mental treatment if things like this annoy you.I will almost certainly re-watch this anime in the future as Japan seems to prefer to release some utterly forgettable garbage as most of the stuff that\'s airing right now (that\'s almost a pain to watch and if not that it\'s also incredibly ugly with a low budget art , which simply isn\'t the case here) and we\'re not helping them by letting kids down-rate masterpieces like this. I was watching Oretsuba while it was airing and it had 6.8/10 before half of the anime was even released and that makes absolutely no sense as the story wasn\'t even remotely developed by then but then again this is democracy so everyone can vote and everyone has an equal voice. The farmer\'s vote is the same as the Doctor\'s vote even if the subject at hand is actual medicine so that goes to show you how stupid democracy is and why you should never trust the majority of people.. simply because they\'re not qualified to judge correctly (and yet they still do).Watch this anime if you\'re into FUN and CUTE GIRLS and ROMANCE (those 3 things are basically the point of life). I can\'t find a better one, you probably won\'t as well. Hell this anime even has diversity (not that i care), there are black people and there are gay people what more do you want?Don\'t watch this anime if you\'re a little rage-god diva and if you hate laughing and fun. I\'d say ""and cute girls"" but this anime actually has good male characters so even if you dont care about cute girls there\'s more than that in here! entertainment and i have plenty of other shit to do so if you think fanboying over some random stuff on the internet is healthy or good for me you better think twice, the only reason i\'m saying it is because its actually true - i still have yet to see a better anime than Oretachi ni tsubasa wa Nai and when you read this you should have in mind that at the end of the day this is a comedy, romance, ecchi anime so you can\'t possibly watch this and expect robots or space exploration or some shit like that so if you\'re going to hate on it only cause its an ecchi then you have some issues - no one is forcing you to watch animes that you normally don\'t enjoy just like how i don\'t watch animes that i normally don\'t enjoy. Oretsuba is awesome for its genre and discriminating it based on genre is stupid and i seriously don\'t see how can i rate this any lowerThe art is 10/10, the anime was made seven years ago (2011) and it still looks better than animes coming out to this year. The backgrounds are detailed and well-drawn and the waifus are top tier and you can\'t really get better art, just different, which is subjective and taste based so my rating of its art is based on the execution not the style but i do like the style as well cus they\'re cute af.The sound is 10/10, there\'s barely a single character who\'s voice annoys me a bit but all others sound perfect, they also sound unique (not like other animes where everyone sounds like a character from another anime) and the background music is actually good as well so the production value is quite highThe plot to me is 10/10, mainly because of how it\'s portrayed but the story is also good and a believable one. The portrayal of the story is unique and it\'s also a big confusing which is why you shouldn\'t watch this anime on autopilot else you\'ll get angry cus you\'re a lil triggerlord. It does take a few episodes to ramp up and become a bit more clear on your first watch but if you pay attention perhaps you\'ll be surprised in a good way instead of confused little rage god divaCharacters? Well - 10/10 obviously. There are a ton of characters in this anime and most of them are awesome and the only \'downside\' is that we don\'t really get to know any of them that well but for the amount of time we see them they are clearly defined and good. I don\'t think the length of the anime is a downside as well because i think that the anime\'s story progression is perfect and doesn\'t feel slow or rushed and this may not be the best anime to get overly-attached to some of the characters but nonetheless they\'re still good.This is based on a visual novel but it doesn\'t really matter what its based on as we\'re only reviewing the anime and the only thing that matters is the anime and how good that was. I\'ve seen a lot of people complain over bad adaptations or manga being better and what not but this doesn\'t matter at all when you\'re talking about anime so i don\'t think the VN has anything to do to the anime and what i\'m judging and rating what i saw so i\'m not going to get biased over visual novel this visual novel that.Despite the overwhelming amount of fanservice the anime is actually grown up, the characters are grown up and they also swear and insult a lot plus they\'re members of a gang and there\'s actually some violence (well it\'s not that big of a deal) and i actually believe that the creators are grown up and reasonable as well, unlike most other animes where you\'re thinking ""wtf who made this character dude?"" I dont think the fanservice is triggering or anything like that, if you\'re getting triggered by small stuff like this you should re-think your internet life cus it doesn\'t sound very healthy. Just take it with a smile or something.

Yet, the thematic construction and unraveling of the narrative leads to one of the most unique psychological presentations I have witnessed within the medium. It is an adaptation of a visual novel of the same name by Navel and is notoriously impossible to translate due to the author’s complex and culturally unbridgeable prose, restricting the source material from those who do not speak or understand the nuances of the Japanese language.The plot follows three men and their connection to various women,...Haneda Takeshi, a feeble and chuuni high school student who escapes from bullying through the belief he is a knight from another dimension; Chitose Shuusuke, a lively and affable yet unsuccessful playboy who works multiple minimum wage jobs in order to sustain himself, and Narita Hayato, a brooding and edgy delinquent who roams the streets of Yanagihara city at night. While these men may initially seem disconnected on the surface, they share a substantial commonality connecting them intrinsically. Unfortunately, the girls lack substantial characterization and development, mostly existing to flesh out the male leads and provide often overwhelming and unnecessary fan service. That being said, each girl’s relationship with the corresponding male protagonists serves to highlight how each character’s shattered psyche indirectly affects others around them. In contrast, the male leads are fairly well-written, all representing different forms of psychological turmoil and mental illness, which leads to the construction of the unique narrative structure.Oretsuba’s narrative and story are analogous to a disharmonious band which plays entirely out of tune, yet within the deafening cacophony, a wholly new melody can be found, one which is beautiful in its unorganized discord. Equally parts perverse and chaotic, the anime is a mess of garbled comedic elements that seems too disconnected to amount to anything meaningful. Yet, given the psychological state of the main characters, the randomness makes sense through the lens of mentally ill individuals who cannot perceive reality in a cohesive or neurotypical manner, and the unique comedic elements create an absurdist outlook on the world where nothing makes sense and is enveloped within a veil of neurotic confusion. However, this extreme amalgamation of comedy, psychology, and ecchi is a double-edged sword, as Oretsuba can be perceived as disgusting, unfunny, and nonsensical depending on the viewer's perspective, which is understandably what makes the anime so unappealing to wider audiences as a whole.There isn’t much to say about Oretsuba’s music as it is unmemorable and stereotypical for a production of Oretsuba’s caliber, consisting of the typical J-pop tunes which dominate so heavily within the industry. The animation is crisp and luminous but not particularly special or atmospheric; it is reasonably visually appealing but not a memorable aspect of the anime in the slightest.Overall, We Without Wings - Under the Innocent Sky is an anime that is exceptionally unique yet difficult to recommend to others due to the confusing and perverted elements of the story, yet underneath the facade of a raunchy comedy, it creates and perpetuates an intriguingly complex perspective into the minds of disturbed and traumatized individuals who cannot view the world through the viewpoint of an average person.

Even that line didn\'t make sense. But got to say this series was a bit surprising I honestly thought this had a dark element to it, but actually it was pretty light, by the way this anime is superrr ecchi so for those who don\'t like gropping some tittay, white stuff on girls, or...girls accidently falling and revealing all their glory then I got news for you, you have a functioning brain... Not I kidded of course but seriously stay away if you\'re not an ecchi fan, and for those who are oh give this one a go. Anyways time for the review K ok lets gooo!Story: 7Not the first anime to implement Multiple Personality Disorder, but it\'s one of those that can take that kind of subject and make it laughable. The story is about a boy name Youji Haneda who basically can say locked himself away from the world, however to keep his little sister happy Kobato Haneda, three new personality kicks in to keep her happy or in this case to implement the phase ""may the world know peace"" they take the form of Takashi a submissive and sickly boy who escapes into a fantasy world, Shuusuke a what do you call those a one directioner impersonator? Nah he\'s just a charmer boy, and last but not least Hayato, so like a emo-ish dark fella kind of but not really... Oh by the way there is a fourth one Karura a king who is a little coo-coo if ya ask me. Anyways the story really revolves around those three more and each of them with their own little side-quest and a lovely lady to keep them company if ya know what I mean ;).Art: 7Pretty generic but at the same well-done, each character looked thoughfully made and not like they were thrown together like if they were frankenstein.. The animation was great easy on the eyes and kepted steady to keep the lightness of the show which was good then again the characters during the serious moment was also animated beautifully.Sound: 5I feel like I have heard half of those background music before but can\'t seem to remember from where, so as originality goes it was a thumps-down but then again it fit well with the anime, however the opening was good not great but it was good.. The voice acting, well since I listened to it in english dubbed I can just say it was well, characters and voices fit well with each other so no complain I should try and listen to japanese version see which one is better but for now emglish dub was good.Characters: 7Even though the real developement was Youji and it was focus on him I still felt that the characters around him we\'re very well developed to the point that there was no need for a character change for anyone because all the characters fight in so well, the only one that needed to knock some sense into was Youji, cause Takashi, Shuusuke, and Hayato were all great and olayed their roles well enough said.Enjoyment: 10Um hello fanservice! What else can I say even an almost H-scene not once but twice and I didn\'t felt weird about it hurray!! But seriously it was enjoyable, it was funny to watch it had me laughing in every episode. I could\'ve finished this series in one sitting but being busy and not wanting to finish it so fast I had to delay it but honestly I just want to watch more of it.Overall: 7It was a good series not gonna lie but like I said in the intro its very ecchi so if that\'s not your thing then you\'re not going to enjoy it unless you can tolerate it then good for you. But for those who don\'t care and you just want to watch something new or ecchi or funny or just don\'t care you just want to watch anything cause you\'re so damn bored!

Anyways here I’ll try reviewing this series in the best way I can think off.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai (or We Without Wings – Under the Innocent Sky) might fool everyone into thinking that this series is nothing but a generic harem theme show centered around three guys and their swarm of moe girls – true, and there is a lot of panty shots and even borderline hentai scenes and it didn’t help that the first episode is full of confusion with...the presentation of all three male characters each has his own story and harem and is seemingly completely unrelated to each other. Viewers with enough patience and tolerance though on the extremely high number of seemingly pointless fanservice shots every 3-5min will find the next couple of episodes still the same thing until around episode 4 when something is hinted at the final moments…all of the sudden the series began to make sense and became so much interesting to watch.For those viewers who have no idea but is interested in knowing what is happening on the main character Haneda Takashi, he is most likely suffering a psychiatric disorder that is keenly close to what is called “Dissociative Identity Disorder.” A major feature of this disorder is the existence of two or more personalities or identities that take control of the person’s behavior. The person, or “host,” is unaware of the other personalities, but the other personalities may be aware of each other in varying degrees. [1][2][3][4][5][6][see below for some notes]The series attempts with varying success to connect the different stories of the many different personalities inside of Haneda Takashi and made a fairly satisfying conclusion. It is sad that the ending is an open ended meaning the viewers wouldn’t see an official couple at the end, but I think it’s good in the sense that knowing how many girls are involved on the many different personalities, each a very strong candidate as the “worthy girl” it will surely a heartache to see them all cry.The animation of the series is not very sharp indicating that this series may be a small budgeted one. Motion fluidity isn’t that good either as character movements look very unnatural and somewhat suffering from poor frame rate. In addition, the environment is not detailed and the character designs look generic. The good thing about the animation though is the girls, they are very cute and sexy looking which looks really nice and is probably the main reason why the series has to many fanservice/panty shots, simply put it – the girls have great assets which they aren’t shy exposing to the camera.The music and the opening and ending are pretty decent to listen but not something that is worth listening too every episode. The series contains forgettable but decent BGMs to supplement the animation scenes. Voice acting is pretty unnatural with most of the girls but somehow it matches their character designs and personalities so kudos to the voice actresses for doing a very good job altering their voices to meet the desired voices of the characters they are portraying.The series has a fairly huge amount of characters, the viewers can see why: The many personalities of the main character each has his own story and adventure to tell and each of them has fairly unique meetings and interactions with a lot of people (ahem mostly girls!). Viewers looking for character development may be disappointed on this especially if they become attached to a particular character, it is a given, but the series made a very good job in giving this characters their very own brief moments that is worthwhile to watch.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a fairly unique find. Granted it has everything what a generic harem and fanservice focus anime has, still it did a good job incorporating a story that focuses on a particular psychiatric disorder that is quite believable and made it in such a way that is entertaining and fun to watch in some extent. Highly recommended for viewers who like fanservice/ecchi themed series that has a fair bit of romance, some intrigue, and of course large amount of panty shots.Additional notes:[1] The text is taken from the “Psychiatric Nursing, Mosby, Third Edition” by Keltner, Schwecke, and Bostrom[2] Additional reading can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder[3] A Hollywood movie with similar theme can be found here: Identity (2003) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309698/[4] An anime that exhibit an almost similar disorder found in this series is the character “Shiki” from “Kara no Kyoukai”.[5] Pls. note that I’m not really sure if Haneda is suffering from the said disorder. I’m a registered nurse (not a physician) but I’m not specialized in Pyschiatric Nursing (I’m practicing Medical Intensive Care), so whatever I wrote in this review may not be correct at all. In addition to Haneda, there are also some characters that may be suffering from psychiatric like-disorder: Ootori Kakeru is somewhat suffering the same disorder like Haneda but to a lesser extent;[6] Asuka Wataranai is hinted that at some point in her childhood she suffered a disorder but most likely just “imaginary friend” which occurs fairly normal to a developing child (but not her age in the scenes where she describes to Haneda about her past). Additional reading here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend the presentation of all three male characters each has his own story and harem and is seemingly completely unrelated to each other. Viewers with enough patience and tolerance though on the extremely high number of seemingly pointless fanservice shots every 3-5min will find the next couple of episodes still the same thing until around episode 4 when something is hinted at the final moments…all of the sudden the series began to make sense and became so much interesting to watch.For those viewers who have no idea but is interested in knowing what is happening on the main character Haneda Takashi, he is most likely suffering a psychiatric disorder that is keenly close to what is called “Dissociative Identity Disorder.” A major feature of this disorder is the existence of two or more personalities or identities that take control of the person’s behavior. The person, or “host,” is unaware of the other personalities, but the other personalities may be aware of each other in varying degrees. [1][2][3][4][5][6][see below for some notes]The series attempts with varying success to connect the different stories of the many different personalities inside of Haneda Takashi and made a fairly satisfying conclusion. It is sad that the ending is an open ended meaning the viewers wouldn’t see an official couple at the end, but I think it’s good in the sense that knowing how many girls are involved on the many different personalities, each a very strong candidate as the “worthy girl” it will surely a heartache to see them all cry.The animation of the series is not very sharp indicating that this series may be a small budgeted one. Motion fluidity isn’t that good either as character movements look very unnatural and somewhat suffering from poor frame rate. In addition, the environment is not detailed and the character designs look generic. The good thing about the animation though is the girls, they are very cute and sexy looking which looks really nice and is probably the main reason why the series has to many fanservice/panty shots, simply put it – the girls have great assets which they aren’t shy exposing to the camera.The music and the opening and ending are pretty decent to listen but not something that is worth listening too every episode. The series contains forgettable but decent BGMs to supplement the animation scenes. Voice acting is pretty unnatural with most of the girls but somehow it matches their character designs and personalities so kudos to the voice actresses for doing a very good job altering their voices to meet the desired voices of the characters they are portraying.The series has a fairly huge amount of characters, the viewers can see why: The many personalities of the main character each has his own story and adventure to tell and each of them has fairly unique meetings and interactions with a lot of people (ahem mostly girls!). Viewers looking for character development may be disappointed on this especially if they become attached to a particular character, it is a given, but the series made a very good job in giving this characters their very own brief moments that is worthwhile to watch.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a fairly unique find.

This series begins with three story lines about three different people that begin to mix at a certain point. First episodes require a lot of attention since it doesn't make any sense other than showing everyday life of some regular people, however if you patiently watch and gather the facts you will see how easy it is to put them together.This is what I like about this anime that it actually makes you do some brain work other than speculating on the plot...while enjoying its well made artwork. I believe it is necessary for a good anime to balance its plot with its artwork in order for it to be appealing. while enjoying its well made artwork. I believe it is necessary for a good anime to balance its plot with its artwork in order for it to be appealing."", ""Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a very ambitious anime. However, it also happens to be a harem comedy that really wants to pander to that otaku audience. The result? A total and utter mess that has a lot of good things about it.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai tells the tale of three young men and their life in the city and their connections to the people around them. That's more or less all I can say without spoiling this, as it takes until the very end of episode 4 for things to start making at least a little sense in this show.Before I...go into the plot, I just want to say that Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai has not just the best, the the second best harem protagonists of all time in it. Most harem protagonists are dull and have no personality, but for two of our three heroes, that is not the case. They have unique personalities and side characters in most anime are lucky to have the flair they do. Shuu, the first of the three heroes I will go into, is absolutely wonderful. He's slightly perverted, a fast talker, and really likes to tease the girls in his area of the story. He's basically what would happen if you took that perverted best friend seen in all harem anime and made them the protagonist. The second of our heroes is Hayato, who to put it plainly is rude. He seems like he doesn't care about the people in his side of the story, and speaks in a very deep, mumbling voice. Together, both of these protagonists are very unique and stand out the the sea of harem protagonists who look and act the same. And then there's Takashi, who's, well, the dullest of the bunch and has no personality besides being nice and a wimp, and he's supposed to be the mainest one, which is ironic given the fact he gets the least screen time of the three, but hey. I'll much rather see Hayato and Shuu.In another irony, most of the times in harem anime you don't care about the main character and only care about the girls, but here it is the exact opposite. Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai has perhaps the worst cast of girls in any harem anime. It's not like they're bad or annoying, it's just that they have no personality at all. Sure one's a little more moe, and the other two are a little more tsundere, but besides that they have little personality. They also add very little to the story also. You could remove two of them and nothing would've really changed. There's also a huge cast of side characters of which are completely useless in every way and serve no purpose besides comic relief.And well, that's really what Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is pulled down by, its uselessness. Only about one-fourht of this show serves a purpose. The other three-fourths is typically weird comic relief. And by weird comic relief, I mena weird. It was funny, but not in a “ha ha, that's hilarious” way, but in a “that's so stupid” way. One scene of this anime manages to make rubbing cream on a wound look sexual. You do not want to know.Due to the filler in the plot, that makes the actual story even more confusing than it actually is. It takes until literally the last minute of episode 4 for the major plot twist the drives the story to happen and it takes  like, nine for the show to really kick off and actually begin getting somewhere. Due to this, the ending is very rushed and doesn't make much sense at all. It has ambition, but not the right build-up to make an effort.And that's my main problem with this show, the fact it has no darn clue what it's supposed to be doing. I mean, there's not enough romance in it to be a romance. None of the characters get together with anyone. Only one of the three main characters even dates anyone. There's not enough drama for it to be a drama. All drama is filtered out by comedic moment. I mean, this show goes into a pretty heavy subject, but it never feels dark at all. Thus it cannot be a psychological anime, as it does not go into the characters enough to become one. Ideally then, it should be a lame harem comedy, but it tries too hard to become one of those. Shuu and Hayato do a flawless job pulling the show along, and the direction is decent also. It's just too light-hearted for what it wants to be.The art is, well, lame. Character designs look generic, and two of the characters look exactly the same almost. The animation isn't very fluid. The music is a little better. It's still very average, but the opening is very decent for what it is. I don't remember what the ending was, so don't ask on that. The background music has a few nice soundtracks in it. The voice actors tend to vary. Shuu and Hayato have great voice actors to match their great characters, while the girls have lame and generic voice actors to fit their lame and generic characters.Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is very bad, but in a way it's kind of fun. If it sounds like your type of show, then by all means watch it. But if it doesn't then don't watch it.

I give this anime 6 stars."", ""Before I begin my review I must give you some of my viewpoints about the anime.. One, do NOT form your impression of this anime on only the first 2-3 episodes or on someone's view who has only watched 2-3 episodes; Two, after you begin watching the anime try to remember exactly, if you can, the names and faces of characters in the first 2 episodes cause it will get complicated later on; Three, do not get confused by the random events as many of them don't have too much of a deep significance. Four, and this may seem weird initially but I strongly suggest...that you watch the anime till the end. It has a nice innovative approach towards developing a romance-ecchi-harem(?) scenario.It's winter in the big city of Yanagihara, and young people will meet and fall in love. Takashi is a boy who plans to escape to another world, but is held back by thoughts of his younger sister Kobato and girlfriend Asuka. Shusuke is a poor part-timer who has to work with student-author Hiyoko in spite of their initial dislike for each other. The antisocial Hayato makes his living as a handyman until he is visited by a girl name Naru. These young men begin to develop a sort of relationship with those girls even though, apparently, they can't become too serious and involved because their time is limited... Also, they have a mysterious link among themselves.The narration is random and weird, at least that's how it seems in the beginning. DJ condor narrates the tales as if they were being captured on camera of some reality show, they change channels to go to a different scene. There is random fan-service in the beginning and in between scenes and the plot does have a somewhat haphazard flow and confusing sequence of events.. So, for the first two episodes though you get something out of the individual events you'll hardly be able to link them to grasp the general flow or the bigger picture of events. But slowly as the plot progresses you will get accustomed to the weird narration style and grasp more of the theme.. the central theme is brilliant, its not something unbelievable but it is definitely creative and has been dealt with with unparalleled dexterity to maintain the mystery and slow plot exposition.There's good use of satire and comedy (Gretacalibur, weird statements, stupid assertions and whatever goes.. xD), particularly watch ep7. The plot uses multiple elements of slice of life, fantasy, romance, ecchi, urban culture, comedy -- the fusion of genres is nice to watch and also aids in developing a sense of ambiguity and mysterious atmosphere that is essential to the plot. This means that while for most part you'll see romantic encounters, daily life events, ecchi scenes and some classic romance-ecchi-comedy events you'll also get to see urban gangs and culture, fantasy battles, mysterious people and the like. What it gives you is a 'metaphorical' (or illusionary) sense of multiple worlds existing in the same city connected by unexpected means. This is important to the essence of the plot because it depicts what separates and connects the male protagonists.Though many may ridicule or dislike the narration style I think it adds a nice taste to the story, it is queer like sweet-and-spicy but its worth a taste. Plus if the story had been left as is, it would have become too plain or too formula-based to be anything special. I like the experimenting they did even if the results aren't spectacular. The plot in its core has a psychological basis. A theme that takes the developing romance an almost converts it into harem. But even though it basically hinges on a psychological concept its not something gore or deranged, its something simpler with interesting (if not stunning) consequences. The ending is good but it mellows the entire prospect on which the story was built and it'll also give to you all the answers you desire in three letters ???.[!!SPOILER!!What happens to a boy faced with great shock and guilt in childhood? Remorseful, but he cannot abandon his only sister.. takes refuge in an unending dark abyss so he doesn't face others, invents an altruistic personality to look after her sister.. and when even that fails? invent others to reside in the 'cockpit'? It is also impressive that one of the 'invented' personalities has his own delusions! a delusion within a delusion?!!  MPD?ISH?]Though not apparent, the story stunningly depicts how a child's experiences, surroundings and events around him come together to define his psychology; to create a dark refuge, a world of fantasy, ideals of peace and upholders of justice. This is one of the features which impressed me a lot.. how everything relating to the other world formed as a product of a child's mentality from something simple as his video games and his church visits.The art is great. There is a prevalent of CG, nice sketches with well-defined proportions ( bishoujo, some pronounced curves but most within acceptable range) , good backgrounds and sharp graphics with good sense of color. The coloring scheme is mostly bright but it sways to some darkened, shaded or dim-lighted scenes for instance during urban gang-wars, graffiti scenes etc. Fan-service scenes abound, they're random but not absurd, and use of yellow caution tapes gives a distinctive feel. Fighting scenes aren't serious but more humorous in depiction. The animation is fluid and smooth. The soundtracks are good enough though nothing special. The OP 'Spread Wings' is great and EDs are fine.The characters have been fleshed out well. Author has a strong understanding of the personalities he wants to depict and good insight.The male protagonists can swap personalities in the same body. The way male leads are introduced and developed each of them retains their individuality and defines his own behavior distinctly, despite being exchanged one after another. It is great (and also humorous). Their roles, their emotions and purpose is well defined, Takashi is a simple-shy-altruistic character, the usual hero kind but bound by some of his own troubles which he doesn't reveal. His coupling with the class beauty Asuka is so.. cliched. Hayato's cool delinquent appearance, arrogant attitude is not something new but his coupling with Naru sure is, its weird to go searching for a stupid bicycle witha girl every night. Chitose Shuusuke is the most lively male protagonist, he's the unpopular guy who gets involved with the weird Tamaizumi while lurking after many other girls. His actions, thoughts and developments seemed the most interesting. The random situations when he swaps personalities, his stupid conversations but skilled criticism and sudden outburst set him as among the best developed characters. The main attraction about the male protagonists is not about their characters but more abut how they exchange personalities and the situations they are in.In contrast the female cast scores mainly due to characterization. Leave Asuka out of this, because apart from the scene where she beats the shit out of the protagonist there isn't much interesting. Naru's seemingly air-headed but actually a little weird and assertive (a personal opinion), she's lively and well portrayed. Tamaizumi, shines brighter in my opinion, a tsundere but sometimes dangerous and sometimes perverted; she has a fresh touch to herself. The minor cast may not have much development but a lot of them are very well-depicted and used.For her anastrophe, also Alice I like.The anime provides sort of a roller-coaster ride: you get interested, confused, frustrated and finally hooked. I think it is fairly enjoyable and has some queer taste. I liked it more when I watched it a second time, cause many events were clearer.The initial impression may be fuzzy and queer but the final impression is great. The story is able to fulfill its purpose clearly in 12 episodes and hardly leaves many plot holes. Some events may be difficult to comprehend but the plot improves with each episode and has a good re-watch value (which is surprisingly due some of the confusion it creates).

The ecchi scenes are few and far between and just jump out of no where. The ecchi fanatic will be starved, had some meat dangled in front of him, and then have it repeat.If you want to watch a drama . . . . this isnt for you. It is not hard to make me cry in an anime. I cried during Angel Beats, Clannad, One piece (When Robbin says she doesnt want to die . . . . i watched it 5 times and made me cry every...time) but not once did this anime touch my heart or make me feel attached to the characters with the exception of Asuka who really should've been in the story more.Another thing this anime does wrong is it is too confusing for too long. I understand having some mystery in your show but when you don't know what in the world is going on until episode 8 of 12 . . . that is a bit much. without giving anything away, it will jump from and to different stories completely randomly and you will have absolutely no idea what they have to do with eachother, why certain things are happening, and what the point of anything is until 3/4 of the way through.WARNINGS BEFORE YOU WATCH THISEpisode 1 is the first nail in the confusion coffin. If you want to cut down on the confusion a bit, skip the first 3 minutes of episode 1. They have nothing to do with anything that is about to happen.The art is good except for 2 guys and 2 girls that look WAAAAAY too similar.This adds to the confusion. 2 of the girls have the same hairstyle except one has a bow and the other doesnt. And also 2 of the guys have the same hair color and similar hairstyle. Just a bit of warning when going in . .  . the guy at the restaurant and the guy in the city are NOT the same person. That had me confused for a while.There is one very over the top ecchi scene in episode 8. Like . . . incredibly out of place and way more intense than anything before or after it in terms of ecchi. Mute your computer for that part.This wont be your favorite anime but if anything, it will teach you what works and what doesnt in an anime. The only scenes i actually enjoyed were the ones with Asuka. She kept me watching but there just simply is not enough of her. Anyway, overall, i give this a 5/10. It is probably the worst anime ive ever seen (other than girls bravo. The only show i have ever dropped). But that isnt saying much since most i have watched were amazing. it has good points, but it has way more bad. time) but not once did this anime touch my heart or make me feel attached to the characters with the exception of Asuka who really should've been in the story more.Another thing this anime does wrong is it is too confusing for too long. I understand having some mystery in your show but when you don't know what in the world is going on until episode 8 of 12 . . . that is a bit much. without giving anything away, it will jump from and to different stories completely randomly and you will have absolutely no idea what they have to do with eachother, why certain things are happening, and what the point of anything is until 3/4 of the way through.WARNINGS BEFORE YOU WATCH THISEpisode 1 is the first nail in the confusion coffin. If you want to cut down on the confusion a bit, skip the first 3 minutes of episode 1. They have nothing to do with anything that is about to happen.The art is good except for 2 guys and 2 girls that look WAAAAAY too similar.This adds to the confusion. 2 of the girls have the same hairstyle except one has a bow and the other doesnt. And also 2 of the guys have the same hair color and similar hairstyle. Just a bit of warning when going in . .  . the guy at the restaurant and the guy in the city are NOT the same person. That had me confused for a while.There is one very over the top ecchi scene in episode 8. Like . . . incredibly out of place and way more intense than anything before or after it in terms of ecchi. Mute your computer for that part.This wont be your favorite anime but if anything, it will teach you what works and what doesnt in an anime. The only scenes i actually enjoyed were the ones with Asuka. She kept me watching but there just simply is not enough of her. Anyway, overall, i give this a 5/10. It is probably the worst anime ive ever seen (other than girls bravo. The only show i have ever dropped).

Which is it's main downfall, as well as some moments coming off cheesey, and a lot of what goes on just does not make sense.See the thing is, it's not supposed to.

This anime starts off very confusing, and I didn't truelly start to enjoy it until the 4th episode when the bits and pieces finally fit together. Once I got past the initial rough patch, it became more interesting beyond the ero jokes that it overflows with. As much as I enjoy ero humour in all its simplicity, this story added a much more unexpected flavour which had me laughing and gripping my seat at times. "", 'So a review... this will be my first review so bear with me on this one. This review is from the episodes 1-7. First of all when I was watching the 1st episode, it felt like the anime was going to be a bit dull besides the ecchi parts hehehe. But when I continued watching further episodes, I thought it would just be about the life of several characters or something like that, but still continuing to watch further episodes, It suddenly became more intriguing with that plot twist(not telling.just watch it).Story: 8Rated the story 8 because the story is unique and can be...very intriguing. First it felt it would be like those ""Slice of Life"" animes but when you continue watching, it gets more interesting but sometimes it would be ecchi, random and funny so I guess this anime wouldn\'t be so boring to watch. With the story getting more interesting, I just don\'t know what will happen next, because like I told you, sometimes it gets random. Most of the Episode\'s ending can make you want to know what happens next n thus also making it more interesting.Art: 9The Art of this anime is Great, I mean the characters, the clothes, the hair are very well made. Also, the environment is great too, lots of places were shown but all of them are greatly done and also with the background. The art is just great.. they have very nice shading, coloring etc, all perfect for each scene.Sound: 8Sounds of the anime are very good. The voices of each character fits them perfectly, voices of the Cute characters, Cool characters, Serious characters, Innocent chracters, etc etc etc. The sound effects are also very good, even with the prop sounds(e.g. the bongos, the radio thing, etc). The music too, this anime has good background music that goes well with the scenes, for the OP and ED song... I dunno what the lyrics mean yet but it feels like it goes well with the anime.Character: 9I love how each character is made, each and every character just have their different and unique personality, attitude, characteristics, style, likes, hates, etc. There are those Cool characters, Crazy characters, Cute characters, Innocent characters, Kind characters, Stupid-looking characters, 1 LOLI character(well.. there might be others), etc. There might be a character here you might love since there are lots of different kinds in the anime. All of them just have their style, their hair, their clothes, eyes, voices, etc, all of it fits them very well(well thats what i think). All very well made characters, I just love how different and unique each character is.Enjoyment: 9Besides the ecchi scenes, i enjoyed  most of the episodes. The anime could get Random, Funny, Serious, Shocking, Confusing, It just keeps getting interesting each passing episode. But i never knew i would enjoy this anime though since the first episode was kinda dull and that\'s why they put lots of ecchi scenes in the first few episodes. But... is the ecchi scenes getting lesser and lesser? eh.. I love intriguing stories anyways. So anyways, you might enjoy this anime because of the ecchi scenes, the characters, or the story.Overall: 9I\'m not really sure if I should rate the overall a 9 since I reviewed the anime from the episodes 1-7 so i dunno if the upcoming episodes will surprise me or just disappoint me. It should have been 8 though but since the score is 8,9,8,9,9. Anyways this anime very good so far but with this kind of story, I\'m not even sure how the anime will end AND isn\'t 12 episodes too short? I mean with this story it should have like maybe 20 or more episodes. Hmph... can\'t do anything about it. Soooo yeah... you might like the characters of the anime or the story or maybe you just want to see some ecchi scenes so just try to watch the anime, you might love it, like it or hate it. Eh..everyone has their taste of anime. I started liking the anime though.Since I made this review after watching episode 7, all i want to say about it is that... they sure had lots of cake!!!! Where..! let me say it again.. WHERE In the heck did they get all those cakes??? And worst part is.. they just wasted all of it TT^TT but since it was like WAR or like a Cake War then it\'s fine since i love war. Wanted to throw a cake or two hehe :D very intriguing.

So you try the second episode and you\'re probably ""ok..."" And it just seem like this anime is just about 3 guys who goes around and gets tons of girls, just the typical generic harem, and also a lot of fanservice. But as you keep on watching you find that there is  more to it.Story: Yes it looks like the generic harem except now it is about 3 guys surrounded by a bunch of cute girls. Also there are also bunch of funny moments and...yes the point of view keeps switching around and it just become quite confusing. The point of view keeps changing between the 3 main characters and it feels like what the hell is going on? Well this is a harem and fanservice filled anime, but I will throw in the word psychological too. Now while watching try to remember this little spoiler hint word: psychological.Art: Well since it is another harem/ecchi anime, the girls are all cute, beautiful, and those falls where you\'re just blast PANTYSHOTS PANTYSHOTS PANTYSHOTS! The fanservice is in every episode so don\'t be so surprised by it. But I have to admit that the characters are all well drawn and they look fabulous.Sound: The soundtrack is great. I love it, the OP starting with ""spread wings"" and other endings like ""Paranoia"" and ""neverland"" all of the songs are quite great and fun to listen to. I really loved all of the OP and ED songs so yeah the soundtrack was great. Also the voices are really helpful as they don\'t all sound alike.Character: Well...there is somewhat a character development surrounding all three male protagonist and their respective heroines. But overall there is not much character development. There is a large cast though, but those supporting characters are just here to spice things up, but not for plot or character development as much.Enjoyment: Well,I wasn\'t satisfied with this anime nor was I disappointed with it. So I guess I would feel something like in between. It is a pretty cute story overall though. BUT it may take awhile before you can actually get the big picture. This anime is really like a jigsaw puzzle, or a riddle. You have to watch a lot of it before you actually go AH! I know what is the answer. Well most of the early episodes will seem random and confusing but that ah moment will come soon. Also it is filled with a lot of funny moments of course so it is pretty fun to  watch as new surprises is practically around every corner of this anime series. If you\'re not patient enough with this anime, and not to determine to watch it through I would say that it would seem pretty dull because of the first few episodes, but I am telling to just endure it for awhile and watch it through and you\'ll feel pretty happy that you watched the whole series. Well hope you enjoy! yes the point of view keeps switching around and it just become quite confusing.

Well hope you enjoy!', ""Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai, or OreTsuba as it's known more commonly, is one of those bizarre anime which leaves you with a weird aftertaste. It's one of the most confusing series I've ever watched in television overall. What makes OreTsuba so interesting is its way of dealing with the subject of Multiple Personality Disorder, wrapped in your average harem ecchi show with comedy, drama, psychological and slice of life elements and more or less expected twists. That alone makes this series underrated when compared to more popular anime in the ecchi genre.OreTsuba doesn't follow the (average guy + special circumstances = harem of 3+...girls) pattern as much as a regular harem ecchi anime would. Now, of course, the male leads in the three vignettes do have the characteristics of stereotypical anime protagonists and the usual special circumstances used to build up the story plot. You have Takashi Haneda, who is the regular soft main character with chuunibyou tendencies who believes is a hero of a mythological world (later revealed to be created from a video game); Shusuke Chitose, the typical cheerful and good-natured protagonist who, being poor, mixes working part-time at a cafe bar with book reviewing and freelance reporting; and Hayato Narita, the typical anti-social and foul-mouthed main lead, a handyman with connections to (more or less) criminal street gangs in the city setting. What makes it so different from average ecchi harem shows is that the harem in the story is built in perfectly normal circumstances, such as the truth-emerged-from-a-lie relationship (in Haneda's case), bonding between co-workers and/or associates (in Chitose and Narita's cases, respectively).Rather than the special circumstances building the harem, these special circumstances, such as the actual connection between the three and the characters' backstories, surround the three young men, slowly building up the pace for the plot twist occurring in the last two episodes (which is both relieving and disappointing at the same time). In referring to the story, though, this doesn't help at all, due to the pacing this anime is taking, with poorly built crossovers of the three vignettes along the way (even if they provide a slight comic relief), and certain flaws, such as an actual character development. That being said, the anime is also remarkable for its rather large cast, something unusual for a 12 episodes series. The supporting characters are more or less ordinary, consisting in cafe maids, lolis, regular school girls, and a less significant split personality of the main character (who also happens to be extremely violent, yet innocent and hilarious, making me think he deserved more screen time than he actually got).OreTsuba is definitely an unique kind of anime, for mixing the psychological aspects into a comedy/drama packed harem show with fanservice, and doing it in a pretty decent and interesting way at that. Which makes it actually quite enjoyable, in my opinion, but the certain flaws in the plot keeps it from being outstanding. girls) pattern as much as a regular harem ecchi anime would.

Even if you try to deny who you are, you can\'t change exactly who you are. That being said, this anime came to me as a surprise. I first discovered it from an English-dubbed trailer released by Funimation, and because of it, I expected it to be a nonsensical ecchi. I came for the ecchi and ended up staying for the amazing story that blew my initial expectations right out of the window.Adapted from the visual novel created by Navel (the company that created Shuffle and Soul Link, two eroge that...also got anime adaptations), We Without Wings, known in Japanese as Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai: Under The Innocent Sky (or Oretsuba), is the anime which I will be reviewing today.We Without Wings centers around three young men. The first one is Takashi Haneda, a high school student who is known in another world (which he frequently ""escapes"" to) as a hero named Lord Hawk. The second is Shuusuke  Chitose, a freeloader who works several part-time jobs. The third is Hayato Narita, a man who only hangs around at night and is nicknamed ""Drac"" as a result. The anime focuses on the relationships between these three boys and the girls they respectively encounter..... and we find out later that they have a lot more in common than you would think.The story is probably the best part of the whole anime. I\'ll admit that the first few episodes don\'t make the best impression, but once you really get into the story, it really grips you and refuses to let go. Without trying to spoil anything, I\'ll just say that it\'s a wonderful story with a good amount of character development. Speaking of which, there is quite a variety of characters in this anime. While not all of them are completely likable, there are a lot of great characters that really make you feel like you want to know what happens to them.The animation, done by Nomad, was very solid. Although it wasn\'t anything too groundbreaking, it was very nice animation. I watched the English dub, and I can say that the voice actors did a pretty good job. What do you expect, though? After all, it WAS Funimation that dubbed it! The opening and ending themes, which respectively are ""Spread Wings"" by Aki Misato and ""NEVERLAND"" by Miyuki Hashimoto, were also quite nice to listen to.Overall, We Without Wings is a pretty good anime.

I can only hope this way that the world may know peace!', 'Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a rather odd anime, but it is probably one of the most under-appreciated series from the Spring 2011 season. I’m not saying it’s an amazing series by any means, but it was a surprisingly solid show as a whole. From my impressions from the awful first episode, this series starts off feeling extremely fanservice heavy. Well, to be more precise, it has a lot of ecchi jokes and gags, and is really difficult to tolerate. If you have high tolerance for perverted jokes, and can bear with all of the craziness for a bit, this series turns out to...be rather surprising in terms of characterization and story. The main characters for this series turn out to be quite a bit more complex than you would expect, and while the execution of the storytelling here is a bit convoluted and difficult to follow, the story itself is well written, and more importantly, rather intriguing. That being said, this anime adaptation felt a bit messy for some reason, kind of like an unpolished gemstone; there were a lot of minor issues with this series that could have been fixed up, and that would’ve made a world of difference.To be fair, this show’s initial few episodes was very underwhelming, with very little things to note or to catch interest. It’s probably because of how the story seemed so all over the place, which made those initial few episodes feel very “lost”. And not to mention the nauseating fanservice, ugh (=_=); .  After those first few episodes, though, things were straightened out rather quickly, and the story becomes surprisingly better. The fanservice was still there, but the plot itself starts to piece together slowly. In hindsight, a lot of the stuff that happened early on in the series makes so much more sense after seeing the major conflicts near the end. It really wasn’t until the revelation about the multiple personalities that the plot began to become much more compelling.What I did appreciate about this series is that it tried to maintain a sense of seriousness and light-hearted moments, and while it tried to do it in a very unconventional, perverted-joke focused manner, this series created an admirable balance between the two. It’s not quite as good as how other series have been going about this balance (such as Steins;Gate), but the series does know how to transition between the serious and not-so-serious moments.What I also liked about this series is how it didn’t spoonfeed everything to the viewers like a lot of modern anime do, and instead made you actually think a bit. The creators here followed the classic “show it, don’t tell it” dogma, and showed us the actual disconnect between reality and fantasy worlds via imagery and actual in-story events. It was really up to the viewer to piece together the puzzle, which actually made the series somewhat thought provoking at times. The series may have been confusing at times, but it’s probably because the writers didn’t make everything obvious, and actually required some thought to figure out the situation at hand. All in all, the story was strikingly well done (especially considering the harem-setup here), and the unique portrayal of the main character(s) added a real sense of reality and impact to the series as a whole.As for the huge (perhaps even fatal) weakness to this series, is that while I understood what the fanservice scenes actually meant by the end of the series, that still made all of the fanservice scenes extremely unnecessary. It’s really pointless to have “fanservice with significance” if everybody will drop the series before they even figure out why it makes sense in the first place…As for the other iffy issue about this series, it would definitely have to do with the main cast as a whole. While I enjoyed watching the interactions of the main cast for the most part, there were some characters that really, really, really needed more development. This series had a huge cast of characters, which led to some of them being very underdeveloped and in sore need of attention. Oh, and there were characters that I thought were really, really boring and generic (such as Takashi); that could have certainly used a bit of improvement. That, and the plot’s pacing was a bit too fast at times to let things really sink in.In the end, this series wasn’t the best out there, but it definitely is underrated after all things are considered. It’s really the fanservice that makes this series extremely iffy, but if you could get past that, the plot could actually surprise you quite a bit. Admittingly, it seems that 12 episodes was not enough time to fully develop a good chunk of the characters in this series, which with a bit more buildup and development, would have made this series much better. A lot of the characters were pretty fun guys when all is said and done, and while some of the scenes in this anime are on the ridiculous side, the story itself was definitely one of the more well written and unique ones for this season.Animation/Art: 6.5/10Music: 6.5/10Setting: 8.0/10Characters: 8.0/10Story: 8.0/10Overall Enjoyment: 7.4/10 (rounded down to a 7 on MAL) be rather surprising in terms of characterization and story.

It really wasn’t until the revelation about the multiple personalities that the plot began to become much more compelling.What I did appreciate about this series is that it tried to maintain a sense of seriousness and light-hearted moments, and while it tried to do it in a very unconventional, perverted-joke focused manner, this series created an admirable balance between the two. It’s not quite as good as how other series have been going about this balance (such as Steins;Gate), but the series does know how to transition between the serious and not-so-serious moments.What I also liked about this series is how it didn’t spoonfeed everything to the viewers like a lot of modern anime do, and instead made you actually think a bit. The creators here followed the classic “show it, don’t tell it” dogma, and showed us the actual disconnect between reality and fantasy worlds via imagery and actual in-story events. It was really up to the viewer to piece together the puzzle, which actually made the series somewhat thought provoking at times. The series may have been confusing at times, but it’s probably because the writers didn’t make everything obvious, and actually required some thought to figure out the situation at hand. All in all, the story was strikingly well done (especially considering the harem-setup here), and the unique portrayal of the main character(s) added a real sense of reality and impact to the series as a whole.As for the huge (perhaps even fatal) weakness to this series, is that while I understood what the fanservice scenes actually meant by the end of the series, that still made all of the fanservice scenes extremely unnecessary. It’s really pointless to have “fanservice with significance” if everybody will drop the series before they even figure out why it makes sense in the first place…As for the other iffy issue about this series, it would definitely have to do with the main cast as a whole. While I enjoyed watching the interactions of the main cast for the most part, there were some characters that really, really, really needed more development. This series had a huge cast of characters, which led to some of them being very underdeveloped and in sore need of attention. Oh, and there were characters that I thought were really, really boring and generic (such as Takashi); that could have certainly used a bit of improvement. That, and the plot’s pacing was a bit too fast at times to let things really sink in.In the end, this series wasn’t the best out there, but it definitely is underrated after all things are considered. It’s really the fanservice that makes this series extremely iffy, but if you could get past that, the plot could actually surprise you quite a bit. Admittingly, it seems that 12 episodes was not enough time to fully develop a good chunk of the characters in this series, which with a bit more buildup and development, would have made this series much better. A lot of the characters were pretty fun guys when all is said and done, and while some of the scenes in this anime are on the ridiculous side, the story itself was definitely one of the more well written and unique ones for this season.Animation/Art: 6.5/10Music: 6.5/10Setting: 8.0/10Characters: 8.0/10Story: 8.0/10Overall Enjoyment: 7.4/10 (rounded down to a 7 on MAL)', 'This is an experimental anime, specifically what kind of anime would you produce while under heavy influence of methamphetamine.

First we are introdused to three entirely different groups of people seemingly at random. And the next minute we are in a fantasy world who knows where. I felt overwhelmed. Like the series was trying to cram too much material in to a series.But I kept watching and everything started to find their places. Character started develop more and everyday stories became interesting including just enough drama and comedy. And the big mystery behind the scenes, how do these different lives connect to...one another kept me wondering. The generic fantasy world took backseat and it's genericity became pretty big point in the story. Everything just grew on me and I was enthralled throughout the series to its ending which to me felt very satisfying.One thing that might not fit whit some people is the overabundance of fanservice and panty shots. Some have argued it to be fitting with the storyline and it does give the series some character.Overall series gets a hearty recomendation and a thumbs up. one another kept me wondering.

Most of the episodes in Oretsuba is very funny, but also kinda of adult-ish. I really really liked it :D "", ""Living a double life is one thing and can be hard enough. But living three lives at once every day? Damn that either takes skill or the person has some serious issues.Under the Innocent Sky has the story line that lives the lives of three different people and not making any sense between them until a third of the way through the anime. Even then a lot of things are still unexplained. If you can work your mind around the constant ecchi/fan service with copious amounts of added humor, the actual story is hard to piece together of the three main character. Even with all...this running in circles the anime does with its story, in the final couple of episodes, it really does do a magnificent job of making sense of everything and why there are three main characters.Watching through this anime, it's art has something different about to to most anime that I cant quite pick out. it used tones and gradients as much as it possibly can on both non and animated objects that make them blend quite well. But even the colors when going about the difference lives of the three protagonists, you see a different light cast on the same town depending on the character that currently in focus.Music is fairly par with its play-though, not much throughout the anime however the few ones it does have add a nice touch to the scene regardless of how ecchi plagued it is. That being said, its ending and opening themes are quite upbeat and catchy. Sounds used for objects within the anime are actually sub standard as many can be picked out as easy to acquire stock, but this is rarely noticed if one is engrossed in the conversations that are had.Character development is painfully slow and almost non existent until the final 3 or 4 episodes of the anime where more things are revealed and make a lot more sense of what the story thus far has been. It's hard to comment about without making spoilers evident, but it isn't an anime for those that watch for a well explained character plot.Enjoyment factor is actually of incredibly great extent as the crude humor hits a new record height even with its copious amounts of nudity and one scene that borders so close to a sex scene it much as well be called one. It hold nothing back with ecchi elements from characters of all age and gender which adds an odd mix of both good and bad humor. this running in circles the anime does with its story, in the final couple of episodes, it really does do a magnificent job of making sense of everything and why there are three main characters.Watching through this anime, it's art has something different about to to most anime that I cant quite pick out. it used tones and gradients as much as it possibly can on both non and animated objects that make them blend quite well.

incredibly confused by the show itself,But after sticking though it and watching it twice I got what this show about,All though I am pretty sure that was because when I first got into the show I was still new to anime, But at the same time this is generally confusing at times.Story, 5/10...So we without wings is a story that about  the adventures of are 3 main characters,Which I am going to talk about them one at a time.The first one being about Takashi haneda a bata male high school student who claims  he a prince from another world and by another world I mean generic Japanese  RPG  fantasy world but stays in order to look after his little sister,one day he is asked out by a girl named Asuka watarai who only reason to date him so far is in order to stop other guys from hitting on her,So his story arc is manly focused on blacking out andGoing to fantasy land and being a bata male in the friend  zone while at school.This by far was probably one of the most boring story arcs I had ever had to sit through the entirety of this show and honestly it's only ether got interesting to me when the twist about him starts interfering with his life.Which doesn't happen intill the ending episodes.The second  being about Shusuke chitose a happy go  lucky Youthful Young man who visits a bar named Alexander and is also a freelance journalist and book reviewer, who one day meets a girl by the name of hiyoko tamaizumi an up and coming novelist which are main character confuses to be a porn star,Who starts working at the bar Alexdander in order to help with her income.Seeing that he made a mistake he decides to also work at Alexdander in order to change her opinion about him.This arc is manly focused on him luring the ropes of working at a bar and trying to get this girl to change her opinion on him,Which dose led to some funny things,So this arc was a bit more entertaining to me and it wasn't that boring,But  it's still nothing special.And my favorite out of the story arcs dum roll please................................Hayato narita a steet smart loner who works odd jobs and every now again gets involved in gang fights, one day while looking for a job he comes across  a girl named naru ohtori a local school girl and the little sister of a local gang leader,Who comes to him in order to help her find her missing bike.This arc is manly focused on what happens to the city around night time With the gangs and night life in full swing,Which is probably more interesting and entertaining for me at least to see gangs fighting each other and the overall atmosphere of the night life,While some school girl try's to get into the main character pants.So this arc nothing really that special but probably for me the best story arc to watch.Now it's time to get to that twist I mentioned,Now you're probably thinking by the sounds of this story it's pretty much about these 3 guys who only relation is that they all live in the same city,Well what If I told you that all the main characters are actually the same person,Well actually different people that share the same body,So this is actually about a day to days life of a person with the spilt personally disorder with each personally  taking over the body at different times,With Takashi  in control in school time , Shusuke in the afternoons and Hayato at night, who are basically there to protect the truePersonally yoji haneda.I am here watching this and thinking to myself that this is actually a pretty interesting idea I wonder where there going to go with it,This could make some very interesting drama if they handle it rightAnd what do with it Nothing much,Because for the most part the story pretty much focused on comedy which made me laugh at times,But they  only uses the spilt personally thing in order to make this show a little different from the crowd it's basically becomes nothing beyond a gimmickThe only time they actually used it for drama was at the end and a few other scenes which pretty Much frizzed out and didn't even matter in the grand scheme of things especially when you're trying to have a dramatic moment that had not built up  or had the tone to support such  a scene,But I still liked the ending even though it was kind of rushed.So we with without wings had good premise and interesting narrative set upBut sadly all of this was good on paper and it didn't use all those ingredients to its full potential.Characters, 5/10The first main character Takashi was pretty much a basic bata male,Who isn't that interesting at all,I do like him a bit more at the end when he came to turns with his problemBut it came to little to late for me to care.The second main character  Shusuke was very enjoyable for me to watch,His happy go lucky personally helped make this show a lot less boring than it should have been,Th third main character  Hayato was probably my favorite out of the three,I really like his loner take no shit personally he was  also fun to watch  as well.Another thing before I move on I really want to talk the relationship  that the three personality have with each other,That there all there to protect and care for each  other even if it results in one of them disappearing  for ever,It kind of this brotherly love kind of relationship.The supporting cast was ok for the most part,Some of them where quite fun to watch,But there not the deepest or the most  likable characters I have seen,Most of them are just bland character  archetypes,Which wasn't that bad because quite a few of them didn't feel like archetypes.But there just kind of there just to fill space a guess.Art, 6/10The animation was quite decent,Nothing mind blowing but looks alright.It's has the nice visual novel style to it.I quite like some of the character designs.Sound, 5/10I actually quite liked the op song,I found it nice to listen to,Nothing great but honestly.The ending song was kind of mah to me.The ost was alright to listen to,It was on point for when it was used,But sadly it's very forgettable at lest for me.Enjoyment, 6/10I quite enjoyed this anime dissipate it problems,Because a really did enjoy the comedy and the over all atmosphere and I found this a decent time passer.But what really hampered my enjoyment is that this could have been if it had focus a lot more on the spilt personally thing.Overall, 5/10So if you like V.n anime or basic rom-com drama then probably check this one out,You may not get the feels but you have an ok time passer,If you don't like this type of show then probably stay away,Because even though it's ok by the standards of what it is.It is still a mah show as a whole.

What I have taken from the story so far is that the main characters are really one, and that this person has a case of dissociative identity disorder which the person displays multiple personalities. The story follows each personality through each one of the stories, this is where the randomness comes from as seen in the show. Overall its a good comedy/ecchi mix but lacks any real story which deters quite a few people. I give this a 7 overall and hope to see some improvement otherwise it might just drop to a 6.

The version I watched had a lot of censorship, but I'm sure you can find uncensored versions somewhere (although I have a feeling that there's one particular scene where the censorship actually makes it more risque).It has cutaways to random meta scenes.

The reason I like this is because once I am familiar with the characters and how they react to things it makes every scene more meaningful! The other thing is that this has story (plot) twists! I...love them, and the one at the end of this is very surprising, but also make a lot a sense which is the requirement for any good story twist. All in all the storyline is far from boring or clichéd.Art 9/10The art is fantastic. All of the characters look great, and the eyes are never too big (something I hate about Clannad) and the backgrounds look strikingly real. Also, the animation is very smooth. All in all, no complaints, I am impressed.Sound 7.5/10The sound is fine, not annoying, and not attention drawing (that's bad for background music). It's not memorable, but it's fine.Characters 10/10As I stated in the Story section, the characters are very deep, which is surprising for a harem. The first three episodes let you figure out the characters really well. Here's an example from my experience. I tend to like background characters more than the main ones (especially when they are annoying main characters). The problem? The background characters fade away and have no development! Well, in this anime feel free to have a favourite character outside the main 6 or 7 because they tend to recur and remain interesting throughout.Enjoyment 9/10The anime is hilarious and interesting. It also is filled with fanservice that never seems out of place, even though it should. There is very little to damper anyone’s enjoyment so I give it a high rating. 9/10.Overall 9/10This is surprising. I hate harem and I tend to give ecchi low ratings, but this Ore ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a major exception. I like it because it is unique and interesting despite carrying these tags, and has one of my favourite plot twists (which is the whole reason it has the psychological tag). I recommend this to anyone who likes fanservice AND plot as well as well developed, relatable characters.

I like it because it is unique and interesting despite carrying these tags, and has one of my favourite plot twists (which is the whole reason it has the psychological tag). I recommend this to anyone who likes fanservice AND plot as well as well developed, relatable characters. I would not recommend this to anyone who is very young (service XD)"", ""This is a anime people will either hate or love. As a precaution, do not watch this thinking it will be ecchi with lots of panties, boobs, etc. Although you'll see some, they aren't the main thing.Story 9 - I give the story a 9 since it may seem boring at first but later on it gets interesting and there is even a twist that I was not expecting. Not to mention it feels fresh and different. And it also has hilarious moments that had me laughing.Art - 8 The art is great, its not stunning or anything special but good enough.Sound...- 7 Sound effects are alright and soundtrack mostly fits, not the best nor worst. I really liked the opening and ending themes though, they are a excellent match to the anime.Character 10 - Character is the best part of this anime. The personalities are wonderful, its very easy to tell each character apart. This next part may be a minor spoiler: later on you will start guessing which character is which since they do certain things.Enjoyment - 9 Truthfully I was bored by the beginning, thankfully I kept watching each episode even though it was taking a while. Towards the middle is when things became interesting and I really became interested.Overall - 8 It could've been better in some ways, but good enough with what it has. - 7 Sound effects are alright and soundtrack mostly fits, not the best nor worst.

I for one hate harem and ecchi. There are only a couple that I can tolerate. I saw a picture of Chitose and was like omg I have to watch this. First impression: this is ecchi isn't it, oh harem too great -_-. To be honest this anime has a terrible first episode that makes ZERO SENSE. It's one of those series you need to bear with the shit writing for a little bit...to see how good it is.Story: Loved it. How it played out, everything ties together, all of it. At first glance it looks like a harem ecchi comedy story about three guys. NO. It's more than that. Of course saying more would ruin it so that's it.Art: It's average but I could call some characters cute too so it's pretty good for 2011(?)Sound: Music was nice and catchy. Condor(?) I didn't look it up for sure but I'm pretty sure it's Gin-san's seiyuu so that was nice. The seiyuus all portrayed their characters very well it was really nice.Character: They were great! Except for Azusa which is really subjective because I hate tsunderes. I can't say they were very unique than normal but I did appreciate their personalities a lot. There's also plenty of character development too so it's all good.Overall: This is such an underground anime. I think the genre and turned some people off and not to mention the first episode is blehh but past all of that is a unique and beautiful story line. This anime only had it's five minutes or even less of fame when it came out but I think it deserves better than that. If you can bear with the forced underwear shots I think it is a wonderful anime you will enjoy.Thanks for reading ^~^ to see how good it is.Story: Loved it.

Can't really say it was my cup of tea, if you like Welcome to the N.H.K. type anime it may be a 7 or an 8.Story: 6   The story starts at episode 4, First few episodes were just mindless dribble.Art: 7   Fine...Sound: 6   FineCharacters:  7   Probably the only enjoyable part of the showEnjoyment:  6   If you can survive until episode 4 you may like the show if you like shows like Welcome to the N.H.K.Overall:  6 Sound: 6   FineCharacters:  7   Probably the only enjoyable part of the showEnjoyment:  6   If you can survive until episode 4 you may like the show if you like shows like Welcome to the N.H.K.Overall:  6"", ""This is one of those anime's that don't make much sense at first but it makes sense more and more as you watch it. The ending was kind of rushed. I didn't like it that much but I still love it.It holds one of my favorite things (not saying because it's a big spoiler) Overall it's a good past time anime that can make you laugh a lot. It's enjoyable and of course as many animes there is fan service. Sometimes more than what is called for. "", ""I recommend watching this anime. It wasn't the best anime ive watched but it has an interesting story which i enjoyed. The character development coulda been better but with only 12 episodes it was pretty decent.Overall score i give it a 7.  Woulda gave it a better score but in my opinion i didn't like the ending. If you enjoy animes where you have to pay attention to slight details that forshadows the story with a little comedy here and there, you should watch this one. ""]"
