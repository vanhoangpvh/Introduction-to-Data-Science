Lupin III: The Last Job,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8097/Lupin_III__The_Last_Job,"['The Last Job is enjoyable, I\'d say it\'s a decent special, with fun and zany Lupin action. However, it just doesn\'t seem as clever or well thought out as a lot of the other specials.One of the twists to this one is that a recurring character has an apparent death scene near the beginning. Oddly enough, this angle is barely played up, compared to numerous emotional or memorable ""death"" scenes throughout the years, this didn\'t really stack up.Anyways, aside from that bit which doesn\'t really get much screentime, this is just business as usual, the Lupin gang getting into constant action and one-on-one fights. Very...fast paced, pretty much nonstop action. However, its a bit lacking in memorable dialogue or cool character interaction. Pretty much, the legendary classic characters here aren\'t really well utilized.None the less, this is still a lot of fun, I was laughing and enjoying the absurdity of it. The plot is especially nonsensical this time around, the climax for example is just so awesomely random. I love how Zenigata is like ""Whats that do? What\'s his goal? Why is this happening? What is happening?"", because I\'m just as befuddled as he is.But hey, its fun, and the main villain is hilariously awesomely over-the-top, gotta love his indiscriminate grenade tossing. Andre the huge yo-yo henchman is memorable, and of course Jigen and Goemon come across as classy as ever. Lupin and Fujiko both have some funny and cool moments, but overall they don\'t get much substance here. The ninja guest girl is decent, there\'s a wacky dog who has it out for Lupin, and you\'ve gotta love Yuji Ohno\'s jazzy score.There are a lot of really fun parts throughout, such as a chase scene involving a great kittens gag, Lupin making some wacky drawings, plus I enjoyed a lot of the action sequences with the jetpacks and whatnot.So, long story short, I enjoyed this Lupin special, but at the same time it doesn\'t quite live up to its potential. Worth a watch for fans. fast paced, pretty much nonstop action. However, its a bit lacking in memorable dialogue or cool character interaction.

Koukou Tekken-den Tough,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2797/Koukou_Tekken-den_Tough,"[""For starters let me say besides watching this series over and over again. I have to be honest here. READ THE MANGA that's all I have to say first of the characters are pretty bland for the most part (read the manga to understand the characters more).The plot is very simple and bland for a martial arts series. Due to the budget the series fight scenes are pretty much terrible to the point the characters are just swinging their arms and legs around instead of detailed proper techniques. The soundtrack is forgettable besides some songs like get over the limit and rising emotion (forgot the...first part of the name of the ending song) by Lapiz Lazuil. the bright side is that it's a good way to get into the series if your a newcomer and want to skip the first 6 volumes (cuz those have HORRIBLE ARTWORK). I only recommend this work only for fans of marital arts series. first part of the name of the ending song) by Lapiz Lazuil. the bright side is that it's a good way to get into the series if your a newcomer and want to skip the first 6 volumes (cuz those have HORRIBLE ARTWORK).

It also tends to get silly and sometimes just plain weird. Many people look down on it, so it\'s up to passionate fans to stick up for why it\'s great!Enter Tetsuya Saruwatari! This is the man who wrote Dog Soldier and Riki Oh: The Story of Ricky. He is currently 61 years old and never once stopped being a teenager. This is a man who knows NOTHING about subtlety or pulling punches, and I love him for it!

I\'m proud to say though that I live only 30 minutes away from the shitty high school gym where professional psychopath New Jack decided to hospitalize his 70 year old opponent because... New Jack.In the world of Shoot-fighter Tekken, pro wrestlers pretend that wrestling is fake, but that\'s only a cover! When the cameras turn off, they participate in underground death matches and are the best fighters in the world! The only martial art that can stand up Pro-Wrestling? Ninjutsu! The heavyweight champion of a Japanese promotion fights a ninja to a draw and years later wants a rematch. However, the ninja wants his son Kiichi to fight and pass the torch to the next generation.In order to prove himself and take on the wrestling champ, Kiichi must get through 2 deadly opponents! The first is a wrestler who got in trouble for killing his opponents. The 2nd is a guy who practiced Jujitsu so much that he gained psychic powers. Yeah...in Shoot-fighter it\'s explained that all psychic powers are just the biproduct of intense jujitsu training. Did you think the government experiments gave Tetsuo his powers?! Nah dog! He just took jujitsu because he was tired of Kaneda\'s shit! Remember the psychic girl in the wheelchair from Elfen Lied? She\'s only in the wheelchair because her legs got tired from doing too much jujitsu!Kiichi\'s dad is a ninja that has techniques that rape the laws of physics, but this kid is unimpressed! Instead he decides to find an old wrestler to train him, who also happens to be the world\'s greatest assassin! Fuck Duke Togo! Fuck Kurosensei! The world\'s greatest assassin is Macho Man Randy Savage! OHHH YEEEEAAHH! Get in the garbage can Duke, because comparatively speaking to the Macho Man, you are nothing but garbage!(watches teleportation) Kiichi: ""Lame!""(watches shadow clone technique) Kiichi: ""Yawn""(watches the Bexploder) Kiishi: ""Is it possible to learn this power!?""I don\'t want to spoil the ending, because this is only 3 episodes and the stupidity is well worth checking out! I gave this a 5/10 because I didn\'t know whether to give it a 1/10 or a 10/10. Shootfighter Tekken belongs in the hall of fame for ""So bad it\'s good"" anime!

Koutetsushin Jeeg,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2157/Koutetsushin_Jeeg,"[""A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design.However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's...forms get more use would make it a lot better.It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire.JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there.Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths. forms get more use would make it a lot better.It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all.

Lupin III: Harimao no Zaihou wo Oe!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1434/Lupin_III__Harimao_no_Zaihou_wo_Oe,"['Agent 007. Part-Time Assassins. Cross Dressing Nazis. Over the top characters? Check.Three crazy statues. An eight-hundred BILLION dollar treasure. Lupin scores a date. Off the charts absurdity? Check.Fujiko? Jigen? Zenigata? Check, check and check.Alright, we got ourselves another Lupin special. Released in 1996, this is just another notch in the Lupin franchise with nothing too unique or defining about it. Unless, of course, you consider the bringing together of two literary icons ""unique"".James Bond, born on page in 1953, is one of the most charismatic and captivating characters ever seen to come out of the 20th century. He is an icon, the embodiment of espionage...and lady killing. A true master in his craft, an over-the-top personality that overcomes seemingly impossible odds time and time again...all in his best suit.Lupin the Third, born as we know him on page in 1967, is without a doubt heavily influenced by the cavalier English spy. The adventures, the women, the gadgets...just about anything seen in them Lupin franchise can be traced back to the original exploits of double-o seven.With all that said you\'re being led to believe that this story would be one epic tale of heroism, charm, and subterfuge. Well, it isn\'t. In fact, its rather disappointing all things considered. The two begin as enemies for only a brief while and become a tandem, yet their tandem is also brief and lackluster.Long story short, same ol Lupin as always. Only difference is we get the rather disappointing inclusion of 007. You\'ll see the same characters as always reprising their same roles pulling the same gags to the same soundtrack.I will admit though, I did get a chuckle out of Goemon being a ""part-timer"".Lupin fans will enjoy this for what it is. It carried the franchise along in 1996 and has its place. Other than that, I can\'t recommend this to most anyone else. If you\'re not a big Lupin fan then theres no reason to catch this specific special. If you\'re looking to try out Lupin, there are much better representations (Secret of Mamo, Missed By A Dollar, Cagliostro). and lady killing.

It\'s a bit overreaching, but actually addresses some issues that you don\'t see a whole lot in Lupin specials. One trend that IS in every special, though, is that they focus usually on one new female and disregard the group a bit. That becomes a little bit of an issue when there\'s literally 10 minutes of movie at a time without any of the main group in it.CHARACTER: Some of the character development is great. Like Fujiko, who is known as the female thief who depends on her beauty and intelligence to outwit men (and occasionally women), is captured...along with another female. One of the captors says, ""Bring one of his women!"" and another captor says, ""Ok, which one?"" To which the first one replies, ""The pretty one!"" The second captor then brings the other female. Fujiko is outraged and screams that ""I\'m the pretty one!"" On the other hand, we\'ve got what is becoming a staple in the Lupin franchise, the bad guy who is in drag or Nazi or a man-woman. The bad guy in this one is two of the above. I just finished watching a Lupin special in which Zenigata gets a lot of attention and is treated as a worthwhile detective, and not the buffoon. In this one, however, he\'s the hard working detective who is also a huge fool. All he cares about is his noodles, and goes so far as to use a precious treasure as a noodle lid (or something like that).ART: Well, this special/movie definitely fits in with every other mid-90s show out there. It looks like it could take place in the same universe as Cowboy Bebop or Trigun. The non-main characters are seriously nothing that belongs in the Lupin franchise, but rather in one of those two instead.SOUND: Another special from the 90s that completely disregards the fantastic voice work from the second series voice actors and canon name pronunciations. It physically hurts sometimes. The second series dub was, in my opinion, one of the best out there. Lupin\'s VA can\'t be topped as Lupin, especially that laugh! It\'s a shame they didn\'t stick with those VAs for much more than the Red Jacket series, Mamo, and a video game. The Japanese cast is, however, wonderful.ENJOYMENT: along with another female.

Doesnt take itself too seriously which is good.At one point Lupin is reading “Monkey Punch” 😂 great reference to the creator.Lupin’s rivals for the treasure are an old ex British Intelligence agent (so its French vs British), and his granddaughter who, shocker, Lupin has the hots for.Fugiko is undercover as always. This time playing an innocent glasses-wearing...assistant.Goemon doesn’t have much screen time. But his scenes are definitely funny.The scene cuts to Zenigata from time to time but he doesn’t play much of a role in the story.And Jigen doesn’t get to shoot much.Lupin gets punched and slapped so much in this movie its hilarious.Great movie. assistant.Goemon doesn’t have much screen time. But his scenes are definitely funny.The scene cuts to Zenigata from time to time but he doesn’t play much of a role in the story.And Jigen doesn’t get to shoot much.Lupin gets punched and slapped so much in this movie its hilarious.Great movie.', '[THIS WAS WRITTEN RIGHT AFTER WATCHING IT AND ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA ACC. KEEPING THIS HERE FOR AN ARCHIVE]watched it out of complete impulse and ITS ONE OF MY NEW FAVORITES I THINK. Mostly bc of the animation tbh. I don’t have a whole lot to say on this one bc it’s really similar to all the other lupin specials/movies I’ve seen thus far in terms of story structure and such. However it’s animation is unbelievably good. Like I’d compare it w some of the best this franchise has to offer easily. I Especially like all the fucking beautifully animated scenes of lupin getting...the fucking shit beat out of him! Very well done! Also the movie itself is really funny and I love the dub as usualOne thing I have to note is the strange ass villain of the movie?? I don’t feel like getting into that but… uh yeah. I know things were made in different times but their whole deal felt very mean spirited and malicious especially w the fact that they r an actual nazi. A lot to unpack there and I don’t wanna do that. Not a fan TMS!🤥🤥🤥IGNORING THE CONTROVERSIAL MAIN VILLAIN is say this movie gets a nice A rating! This is definitely another turn ur brain off and watch the nice moving pictures one the fucking shit beat out of him! Very well done!

Kyoukai no Rinne,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28423/Kyoukai_no_Rinne,"['When talking about any show, I often take extra precaution to avoid marginalizing the work by use of buzzwords. This isn\'t to say that the usage of certain words don\'t help others to understand where you\'re coming from, but rather, when a word is overused, it begins to lose value to many that have grown accustomed to it. After a while, it\'s desensitized to the point where people would write you off as just another ""pseudo-critic"" with nothing left to say, and understandably so. But sometimes, I find the aid of commonly used words to just be unavoidable. Sometimes, no other word works better to...describe the title at hand. And when it comes to Kyoukai no Rinne, no matter what angle I approach it from, no matter how much I try to better articulate what\'s the main issue at hand, the conclusion is always the same; the show is simply mediocre.Following the comedic misadventures of a Shinigami named Rinne Rokudou, we\'re introduced to a world where the afterlife and the physical world intertwines on a constant basis. Performing his job as a Shinigami eventually leads him to befriend a peculiar girl named Sakura Mamiya, and the rest of the show is dedicated to seeing the comedic mishaps that the pair find themselves getting in. The setup is decent enough but the perpetual state it places itself in just turns it into amnesia-inducing content. A purgatory where every episode repeats itself. And no, I\'m not joking, they quite literally repeat the same setup and comedic gags every time with only slight variations stuffed in:Rinne and Sakura are going through a typical day--> some supernatural occurrence disrupts everything--> Rinne attempts to solve the issue--> problem solved--> rinse and repeat.The show limits itself to the point where watching it feels like a massive case of groundhogs day, where nothing is moving forward, and you\'re simply stuck in a state of viewer\'s limbo. Everything that it tries to establish just goes nowhere. From the romantic subplot to even the character\'s issues. They\'re merely brought up, only to be left on the back burner, due to the show\'s overbearingly pronounced complacency.The humor of Rinne was all over the place, but more often than not, it was lackluster and had little to no comedic impact to speak of. It tried to use a more deadpan kind of approach when dealing with the ghosts and conflicts that arise in the show. And while it did have its moments of effectiveness, those were usually sparse and drowned out by the many times it dropped the ball. Whether this type of humor will resonate with you or not all depends on your taste in comedy. As for me, It wasn\'t consistent enough to keep me amused for long, as I often found most of it to be NyQuil levels of sleep-inducing.The characters themselves all felt like watered down versions of the ones found in InuYasha. Not surprising, though, given that Rumiko Takahashi, the creator of InuYasha, was also the one behind Kyoukai no Rinne. It almost feels like she\'s trying to ride off of the coattails of InuYasha to make Rinne relevant, and sadly the mark was missed by a long shot. It\'s hard not to look at Rokumon, Rinne\'s residential mascot, and not think about Shippo, a character with arguably more characterization and importance to the series he was a part of. Or to even look at Sakura and not feel like you\'re just looking at a more dull version of Kagome. This isn\'t to say that the characters of Rinne are an exact clone of Takahashi\'s prior works but that Rinne is engulfed by the shadow of its predecessor, both in terms of quality and relevance.Almost like an attempt to match the quality of the script with the presentation, the art and animation of Rinne were painfully average. There were no visible attempts to stand out nor was there any proper use of lighting, shading, color placement or any other technique that could have been used to heighten the visual experience. It was generic across all fronts. This was also the case with the sound mixing, with background music that felt overplayed and lacking in variation or drowned out to the point where you don\'t even recognize it at all. If there was an attempt to make the presentation better in the show, it was never made visible enough for me to take notice.And that\'s my experience with Rinne as a whole, too middling for me to ever take notice of anything it offered.I wasn\'t offended by Rinne, but at the same time, I wasn\'t impressed either. It\'s a title that\'s almost predestined to be forgotten. And looking at the small reception it got from viewers, it seems like that fate will happen sooner than later. It had decent moments every now and then but was entirely too aimless for its own good.Kyoukai no Rinne was a giant ball of ""meh"" that seemed to have set its bar low from the get-go. There was nothing here that I can say was satisfactory and with a setup that went nowhere, it\'s hard to recommend this title to anyone. It\'s a title that leaves no final impression and has taken its one-way ticket to obscurity before it could even plant its feet in the ground. describe the title at hand.

It had decent moments every now and then but was entirely too aimless for its own good.Kyoukai no Rinne was a giant ball of ""meh"" that seemed to have set its bar low from the get-go. There was nothing here that I can say was satisfactory and with a setup that went nowhere, it\'s hard to recommend this title to anyone. It\'s a title that leaves no final impression and has taken its one-way ticket to obscurity before it could even plant its feet in the ground.', 'The story is not really original or complex, it is another Rumiko Takahashi works, and that is the best and maybe the worst you can say about this anime.

It has the same kind of comedy, similar drawing style, similar kind of romance... this anime make me feel like watching a 90s anime, I mean the drawing style is old, characters as well give me a feel of old style (that  do not correspond to the typical cliches that we...find on 80% percent of current anime) and  besides it lacks of recurrent ecchi and fan service, (which is for me a good point but I think many people disagree about this). I personally find the characters very cool and funny, story is very slice of life so most of time every episode is a new story and general development is very slow.... but come on is a comedy, ¿what are you hoping for?. I am a bit old generation and I find Rumiko style very enjoyable, but maybe new generation are not fit for this old style and probably that explain why Rinne is so poorly rated by the community in MAL, but if you are not a Rumiko hater then you should give it a try, Rinne and Mamiya deserve it. find on 80% percent of current anime) and  besides it lacks of recurrent ecchi and fan service, (which is for me a good point but I think many people disagree about this).

Its an episodic comedy anime. And just from that you pretty much know exactly what to expect.As far as story, the series is....pretty mediocre. As I\'ve already said, the series is very episodic. This can be fine in shows like Mushishi or Death Parade where you have an overarching character story that shows the progression of each character throughout the series. However, no such story is present in Rin-Ne. Or at least its not all that prominent. Sure there is sort of a romance plot, but by the end of the first season...it\'s pretty much stayed in the exact same place as it has been for the entire series thus far. For the most part you could watch episodes out of order and get the exact same experience. The show  is episodic down to a formula at times. At first everything is normal, then someone puts in a request to the prayer box or a main character comes across a spirit or a character from the other world comes in and causes chaos, Rinne and Mamiya try to resolve said problem (or Rinne tries to do it on his own), while Juumonji and Ageha try to interfere because they don\'t want Rinne and Mamiya to get too close, and then at the end all is resolved and in the next episode we\'re right back in the same place. Now this isn\'t to say that this show doesn\'t have at least some continuous episodes, they\'re just few and far between.As for the comedy, it can be pretty hit or miss. The series has some decent jokes, particularly in its rare moments of slapstick. My favorite episodes have to be the ones with Masato because his reason for hating Rinne and the ways he tries to get back at him is hilarious! But unfortunately a lot of these jokes are often ruined with this narrator that always has to explain the joke, even going as far as to explain plot elements that we already know about (seriously how many times do you need to say that normal people can\'t see Rinne when he\'s wearing his jacket?). In the end this becomes really annoying and often feels like the narrator thinks the audience is stupid and can\'t figure things out on their own. There\'s also a runnng joke where Rinne\'s grandmother doesn\'t like being called a grandmother and does this ear thing to any character who calls her that or does something to remind her of her age. Moderately funny at first, but incredibly overdone by the end of the season.Apart from Rinne, characters are either 1 note or entirely bland. Although not perfect, Rinne has an alright amount of personality. The series does a deent job of capturing the duality of his life through his constant struggle to maintain a normal student life and how his job as a Shinigami is a constant deterrant to any form of normalcy and how this ""job"" is so demanding that he can barely afford to live. How he is affected by his relationships with others is handled fairly well as well. His resentment towards his father is more than understandable because he\'s a neglectful crook who steals from his own son at every chance he gets. His feelings towards Mamiya are totally reasonable because of how her mere existence plays off of his duality. It\'s easy to see how she can be attractive to him because he can relate to her as, due to the fact that she can see spirits, she (sort of-ish) is going through the same duality as him. Therefore she can both be an escape for him as well as a way of remaining connected to his life in the other world. Bottom line, he doesn\'t have to hide anything from her. He understandably wants to be connected to both his human and Shinigami side, as these are integral parts of his very being and Mamiya is his only option for retaining both connections simultaneously without alienating anyone.As for the other characters, the majority of them have ""personalities"" that are based solely on a few running jokes.edit later it\'s pretty much stayed in the exact same place as it has been for the entire series thus far.

Spoilers ahead!)Specters. The supernatural. Spirits, as they are most commonly called. For some, there is a staunch belief that beings from beyond still roam the Earth. The idea is that they physically cannot manifest as their corporeal selves. However, through their ghastly ways, it is possible to feel their presence or hear their meddling.Kyoukai no Rinne is an anime about these very spirits. Good spirits, bad spirits, spirit whisperers, spirit exorcists, and so on. The show is replete with spirits of all shapes and sizes, all backgrounds and creeds. While not necessarily spiritual, the amount of spirits...is undeniable.I cannot say for certain if I have ever seen a spirit roaming nearby. I actually do not believe that spirits exist. But there have been occasions where I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye or I felt like something was there that should not be. Those moments would pass quickly, so I would think nothing of them. Though thinking more about them now, perhaps that was people like Rokudou, Sakura, and the gang helping one more spirit pass on.STORYKyoukai no Rinne is plain in its approach. Focusing mostly on spirits, comedy, and romance, the show finds variable success in each category, resulting in a mixed offering.“Spirits” was mentioned first because that is the aspect that the anime uses first and foremost. More specifically, the anime spends a lot of time constructing parts of its world with spirits in mind. The Shinigami, the various spirit types, and the parts of the afterlife are not exactly intricate in terms of world-building but they manage to make the spirit motif a bit more tangible rather than waving them off as “spirits exist and nothing else has to be said”. Explaining all of the spirit-related content has the added benefit of demonstrating why a certain character acts the way he or she does – like Juumonji with his “Holy Ash” – or why the supernatural events are happening at all to begin with – like an evil octopus wiener arising from a cursed lunchbox. Again, the anime could have certainly just had the spirits exist as nothing more than a driving force for the arcs (they still do this) but by going into further detail on the world, the narrative builds itself a stronger foundation to stand on throughout the season.Speaking of the narrative, Kyoukai no Rinne takes a common approach to setting it up: multiple arcs rather than an overarching plan. Arcs generally last one, sometimes two, episodes. For the anime, this is a nice direction since having many arcs allows the show to explore its spirit motif as it sees fit. One encounter might involve spirits that make a soul-stealing pen while the next deals with a possessed house that prevents its inhabitants from leaving. The anime jumps from scenario to scenario, providing ample opportunities to show a wide variety spirits, their habits, and the ways of dealing with them adequately. As for the content of the arcs, the show never gets too serious despite the implication of death at every turn. Instead Kyoukai no Rinne tends to keep its mood lighthearted. Spirits are saved rather than exorcised to make sure this happy feel is achieved. One of the better examples is the arc where an idol, still lingering at the pool where she was supposed to make a visit, is angered that nobody can (understandably) notice her. To remedy the situation, Rokudou has all of the recently stolen spirits as well as the lonely culprit greet her to make her happy enough to pass on. As Sakura puts it, everything ends up “happily-ever-after”, applicable to every spirit-filled arc the anime has.Besides spirits, the anime also puts a lot of stock (pun intended) into the idea of money and economics. At the minimum, the show concerns itself with the notion of finance playing a large role in the life that Rokudou lives. It is nothing new to know that items have cost. Without the appropriate amount of bills or coinage, those items are impossible to get. This becomes the source of a lot of the comedy within Kyoukai no Rinne. For example, the characters at one point go to Hell where money is often scarce. Scarce to the point that there is an entire subsection entitled “Debt Hell”, where denizens slave away forever as they are unable to pay off their debts. But Rokudou, having spent most of his life poor as dirt, manages to do the job at light speed. The joke that follows – the director of the place delaying his payment a few months – also relies on the money shtick. The anime even sets time aside for the narrator to explain the cost of the spirit-useable items: “Spirit Duster”, “Separation Incense”, and more are silly, everyday devices with special, spirit-warding properties that, inconveniently and ironically, cannot be used on a regular basis. So no matter what Kyoukai no Rinne might be doing on-screen, money always underlies the festivities.Money as a crutch (technically no money) unfortunately lacks any thematic purpose. While this motif is a common thread throughout the entire season, because the anime does not do anything more than poke fun at Rokudou’s living conditions or showing yet another greedy move by his father, the show quickly devolves into repetition. The setting and the players involved might change slightly but the same jokes, the same outcomes, and the same ideas happen regardless. Money is not the only instance of repetition. Rokudou calling his grandmother “Grandma”, while correct, earns him a beating every single time, and Sakura’s two closest friends never stick around for too long since each spooky event scares them away. However these are a bit more understandable since they are deliberate, running gags. They exist either as a way to get a quick laugh (the former) or as a way to isolate the events (the latter). The same stream of jokes about money do not have these same luxuries, the end result being induced boredom caused by repetition.Crossing the spirit quality and the money quality gets at the third quality, romance. “Quality” is a bit of a stretch, however, since Kyoukai no Rinne barely brushes the surface of the genre. Romantic undertones are present between Rokudou and Sakura, but the louder characters – Juumonji and Ageha – are the most vocal about that special feeling. There are passing glances or minor monologues about how one character feels (or in Sakura’s case, might feel) towards another but the show never goes out of its way to put the romance on a pedestal. When romance finally emerges from its suppressed state, it either is ignored or misunderstood, meaning said “romance” is essentially worthless. To be fair, the romance is more akin to a dash of seasoning rather than the main course: it exists to add flavor to the spirits, comedy, and money motifs that run rampant. But given that the anime does little beyond mentioning potential romantic feelings now and again, the taste of the extra seasoning is lost. Other problems exist, such as the show forgetting about the first true antagonist Masato, the grudge-having demon. The presence of Sabato and, for a time, Kain makes him a moot point after his original entry. Other positives exist, too, such as the plot sometimes referencing the past to explain the motivations of the characters and therefore the specific set of events. Altogether Kyoukai no Rinne’s narrative is as average as they come.ANIMATIONKyoukai no Rinne adopts an older artistic look for its characters when compared to works of the modern age. Faces are wide, outfits are normal, hair-dos are not extravagant, and colors are bland, making the designs appear as if they come an earlier period of the medium. This is not a negative. In fact, the older appearances fit the spirit and magic setting that the anime so often uses.Investigating the characters more closely, some have nearly identical designs – specifically Rokudou, Juumonji, and Kain – that one could easily make the mistake that they are somehow related to one another. Looking specifically at Sakura’s design, her hair is a greenish-yellow, her eyes are a dull blue, and her attire consists mainly of a plain school outfit and the occasional casual look. Contrasted with today’s crazy hair-dos, intricate dresses, and detailed faces, she has an extremely boring design. Yet her boringness creates an aura of simplicity that fits with the mellowness of her character and indeed the artistic direction of the anime.This art does not have the same aged aspect as the character designs but that is worse because the anime’s backgrounds are as forgettable as possible. Rokudou’s apartment is literally filled with just a mattress. Their school is like any other. And the city, while traversed occasionally, has no notable locations. The art is more or less boring but that is sort of the point. Kyoukai no Rinne does not aim for lavish art because it has its spirit foundation in mind. By keeping everything very plain, the show inherently hits that calm, mellow target. Kyoukai, the quasi-world that the characters find themselves in regularly, is rainbow in color and bright in light, creating an atmosphere that contrasts nicely with the normal artistic direction. To put it differently, Kyoukai stands out a bit more than usual because of the plainness of its counterpart, cloaking the locale in a distinct, otherworldly mood.Still, can one consider the character designs and the art appealing despite how plain they both are? It is difficult to say. Rokudou’s fiery hair symbolizes his passion for spirit saving, as does his flame-embossed white shawl, but his design is otherwise so drab that it seems as if the bare minimum of effort was put into the design. The backgrounds are the same. They lack oomph. They lack impact. And when boring designs are placed on top of boring art, the visuals are tolerated not touted.All of this says nothing of the other nuances, like the camera and the lighting. Camera-wise the anime, once again, does the bare minimum. No extravagant shots, no unique perspectives, and no interesting takes. The camera is par for the course at best and completely underwhelming at worst. Lighting is often the same. Other than Kyoukai, the anime does not toy with lighting in any capacity except for a random sunset or a simple shadow. There is a nice moment where Ageha is clearly lighter than the rest of the gang on a dreary day to signify her position as a Damashigami (during episode eighteen, when Rokudou’s “Life Flame” is forcibly seized), but such a moment is the exception, not the rule. Thus, when both are taken together with the character designs and the art, the result is nothing short of dullness.As for the actual animation, Kyoukai no Rinne takes the same path. Surprisingly there is a lot of action in the show. Rokudou squaring off against multiple dolls, Rokumon slamming into a giant rat, and so on. However a lot of the action hides behind still frames and quick cuts that give the illusion of movement when none is being portrayed. When the action does die down, characters see mouth, hair, and limb movements to a moderate degree, though per usual nothing excessive is shown.CHARACTERSThe best (or at least the most fun) way to dissect the cast of Kyoukai no Rinne is to use an extended metaphor centered on money (and using U.S. denominations where appropriate).Starting with Rokudou, he is the almighty penny. Rokudou is poor, and in terms of worth the penny is the lowest on the scale. Rokudou is also the main (male) protagonist; he is the number one guy in the anime. Similarly pennies are denoted as one cent. Rokudou is necessary to the plot and to the other characters. Likewise the penny is necessary in the field of money exchange because pennies allow for numbers not divisible by five or ten to be distributed. Rokudou is known for saving, or contextually freeing, the spirits he encounters as opposed to handling them harshly. Coincidentally the penny features the (nonnegotiable) greatest President of all-time, Abraham Lincoln, who is known for, among many other things, emancipating or freeing the slaves. Rokudou goes invisible a lot. Similarly pennies tend to get lost in couches, the bottom of change jars, and out on the street, turning “invisible”. “Pick a penny, pick it up. Then all day you’ll have good luck” is a common phrase when the minute coinage is found, which coincides with Rokudou’s own luck at always finding success no matter how grim the odds. And as it were, Rokudou emphasizes the color red, as do pennies with their copper, reddish hue. Rokudou is a penny through and through.Negative quantities of money are technically less than the value of a penny, which is where Sabato, Rokudou’s father, comes in. Sabato represents the lack of money, otherwise known as debt. He is always spending, he is always asking for more, and he is always doing anything to get any kind of return. Sabato’s relationship to his son Rokudou is similar in that Rokudou’s poorness derives from his father’s existence; Sabato’s debt is Rokudou’s debt. For Sabato, Bijin, Ageha’s older sister, is his interest rate. She assists him in his money-stealing endeavors, acting as the secretary and the accomplice, allowing him to haul in bigger returns than he ever had by himself. For both Rokudou and Sabato, Kain, the Shirushigami, is (literally, not just figuratively) the debt collector, his job entailing the seizing of property and the handling of money. Kain later on becomes at the minimum acquaintances with Rokudou, and that makes logical sense since it is difficult becoming full-fledged friends with the person who is seeking the money he is due.Moving away from the lower end of the money spectrum, Ageha manages to mirror Rokudou in a variety of ways. Both are Shinigami; Rokudou and Ageha both deal with spirits daily. Both have a unique financial state, Rokudou being poor and Ageha being wealthy. Both have someone they love, for Rokudou that is Sakura and for Ageha that is Rokudou. But the most striking difference – perhaps the most obvious difference – is that Rokudou is a boy and Ageha is a girl. Collectively, Ageha is similar to Rokudou but not exactly the same. Given these traits, Ageha is the gold, one dollar coin featuring Sacagawea on its front. Gold is fought for, gold symbolizes wealth, and gold is loved by everyone. And of course, Sacagawea is female, all of which contrast the copper, Abraham Lincoln penny. Other aspects to Ageha make this interpretation even more logical such as Ageha and Sacagawea being natives of their respective lands and the penny and the gold coin representing one of their given unit.The other characters continue to follow this money metaphor. Rokumon is, given his small size and small importance, a dime. Juumonji is a nickel, his gray holy ash and his morally gray obsession with Sakura matching the grayness of the nickel itself. Plus, nobody really likes nickels, and given that Juumonji is a character that is around but not too appreciated, this description fits even more. Masato is a counterfeit check, deceptive and dastardly in his actions and motives, which in turn causes even more problems for the broke Rokudou. Rokudou’s Grandmother is a cash bond: she is there and could most certainly help but one has to wait a while before the bond can be turned in for monetary gain. But when that gain is gotten, there is no doubting how much help it brings.Everyone is related to money. But the most interesting and arguably the strongest character of the bunch has yet to be investigated. Sakura is a strange bird. She does not worry about money like Rokudou or Sabato. Sakura does not worry herself with romantic feelings like Ageha or Juumonji. She is especially prone to this kind of behavior; whenever Sakura is asked about who she is to Rokudou or when Juumonji is blatant in his advances, she is apparently oblivious to even the most obvious of social cues. Sakura does not worry about the afterlife or the quarreling of sisters or the past. In fact, Sakura hardly worries about anything. She is an immensely apathetic person. She sometimes raises her voice and occasionally has concern for another person. But for the most part her personality remains as flat as a five dollar bill (though that is not her metaphor).Sakura is content with who she is, where she is going, and why she finds herself thrown into her situation. Therefore, Sakura is a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) nets money for the future, bringing a feeling of security for the person who has such a plan. In other words, a 401(k) removes worries later on in life because extra reserves are present. Furthermore, Sakura is not a very impressive character. She breaks common stereotypes of main (female) protagonists by having absolutely no outstanding characteristics. She is a boring, dull, and wholly uninteresting person. 401(k) plans are similarly boring. Not much is done with them: they are created, money is put in them, and they are not accessed for years and years and years. Going forward one more step, Sakura does not get mad at others, and she is quite the respectful lady. Sakura is mature. 401(k) plans are similarly mature in the sense that having one signifies maturity, not just in age but also in wisdom.No matter how logical or insane this extended metaphor is, this does not say much about the development of these characters. In short, there is none. Rokudou, Sakura, and everyone else remains the same from their individual introductions until the end of the season. Juumonji does the same two actions throughout: throw holy ash and declare his love for Sakura. That is it. Like inflation does to economic values, he is consistent throughout the entire season. He does not change, and the same can be applied to everyone else. And for Kyoukai no Rinne, that is perfectly fine. The show does not want complex characters or unique relationships that are thematically special. Instead, the anime wants to have its quirky cast of characters mingle with one another, deal with spirits, and simply have a fun time. This might seem worthless – and for many it very well is – but as they say, “A penny saved is a penny earned”.SOUNDThe first opening theme in Kyouakai no Rinne is, initially, not the best piece. The track is mostly a pronounced guitar, with a vocalist using a nice singing voice but without demonstration of range. But the track grows on the listener. The clapping in the middle as well as the beat have a catchiness to them that is not immediate and only noted as the song is heard with each subsequent episode. The same can be said for the first ending theme. The instruments and singing are cute and quick, though not entirely inviting. The second half of the first ED, however, takes advantage of the build-up in the middle to bring about a catchy track that is as simple and as fun as the actual anime is.The same cannot be said for both the second opening and ending themes. Starting with the second OP, catchiness is hard to achieve mostly because of the grating instruments and the high-pitched vocalist. The vocalist for the first ED is the same one for this second OP, but here her voice is not as soft, leading to the disharmony the second OP provides. As for the second ED, the piece is almost too simple. It is devoid of any complexity, both the singer and the instruments going through the motions rather than trying to create a memorable piece. For both, the anime also strangely refuses to change the majority of their visuals for the OP and ED, making the second ones appear out of sync with what is shown as the songs are played.Out of all of the different parts that make up the sound-work for Kyoukai no Rinne, the original soundtrack is easily the best. And while Kyoukai no Rinne once again does not go out of its way to design tracks that are groundbreaking, what the OST does give is a large quantity of tracks influenced by its spirit motif. “Ningen…Mi Tai Na-Rin Ne no Theme” is Asian in origin, the wind instruments and dainty piano coinciding with the spiritual feel of Kyoukai, the spirit realm. One of the more iconic pieces is “Hyakuyoubako no Irai”, with its ambient effects and everyday yet spooky feel, the latter feeling once more matching the spirit motif. “Anoyo no Uta” cranks up this spookiness even further, the choir and chilling instruments creating a ghostly composition. “Uwasa Hanashi no Chi” goes for curiosity for those equally inquisitive moments whereas “Lay Michi Kaikou” goes completely otherworldly. And “Kakugo!” is one of the many flurry-filled tracks with lots of noise and triumph. Again, the OST is nothing too impressive, but at the minimum the OST is fitting and thematically relevant.Last but certainly not least is the voice acting. Performances are generally average in execution, the characters’ voices fitting nicely enough. Marina Inoue as Sakura delivers a monotone voice that captures the girl’s personality. Hitomi Nabatame as Rokumon uses a childish, boyish voice that is unfortunately hard to listen to for long periods of time. Kaito Ishikawa as Rokudou sounds slightly too old for his age, but Rie Murakawa as Ageha provides yet another wonderful performance, giving the love-struck Shinigami a girly and commanding way of speaking.ENJOYMENTThere was a stretch in this anime where I could not stand what was happening. When the new character Ageha was introduced, for about five or so episodes the plot decided to constantly have Sakura misunderstand what Rokudou did or what Rokudou was really feeling. This aggravated me. This aggravated me so much that it forced me to continue watching more in one sitting than I normally do because I had to see when the situation would clear up. But episode after episode, more misunderstandings piled up which in turn piled up my own anger. Eventually the misunderstandings stopped (and I was therefore able to cool down) but the damage was done.I also hated Sabato, Rokudou’s dad. I get it. He is a stingy, horrible, and evil father. But seeing him always get away with everything and him always mistreating the people around him grated my nerves. The show does at least make him suffer near the end with the ramen-making episode but that was not nearly enough for the amount of annoyance he caused me let alone Rokudou and the rest. And, his presence combined with the previous misunderstandings, only made my blood boil further.Infuriation was not the sole emotion I felt throughout the season. I also felt bored. The show dragged a bit since the repetitive jokes about Rokudou being poor were not the best from the get-go. The characters are likewise boring. Nothing about them is remotely worth remembering, a substantial problem for any anime. Sakura might have a case because her plainness is what makes her different from many other protagonists, but since she goes with the flow rather than actively participating in the events, even this weird inversion fails to stick.Still, I cannot say I hated watching the show. What little romance was given was enough to make me smile. Ageha getting embarrassed when she “holds hands” with Rokudou – and especially the narrator’s dialogue afterwards – was funny. I also strangely liked how Rokudou always called Sakura “Mamiya Sakura”. There is something innocent about doing so that was endearing to hear whenever Rokudou called for her. Also, for whatever reason, everyone does the rock-n-roll symbol with their hands – only the forefinger, pinky, and thumb extended – when they got hit. Seeing that was amusing if only because of how silly such a response was to being abused. And to its credit, I liked the Christmas episode. I love Christmas, but I also liked seeing the main four characters – Rokudou, Sakura, Juumonji, and Ageha – grow closer as friends. Interestingly, this episode had the least to do with spirits, though that probably says more about me than the anime.Kyoukai no Rinne loves spirits, loves money, and loves misunderstandings. Its narrative, while focused, is plain. Its characters, while symbolic, are uninteresting. And the art, while reminiscent, is dull. The OST might have something going for it but that something is difficult to see when the anime can be as frustrating as it is. Using some word play, this one is filled with spirits yet not exactly filled with spirit.SUMMARYStory: Fine, spirits and money galore, with repetition and halfhearted romantic subplots souring the experienceAnimation: Fine, plain character designs, dull artistic direction, and about average actual animationCharacters: Fine, pennies, debt, and 401(k) plansSound: Fine, okay first OP, bad second OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, okay OST, and about average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, cute and amusing but the misunderstandings irked me to the nth degreeFinal Score: 4/10 is undeniable.I cannot say for certain if I have ever seen a spirit roaming nearby. I actually do not believe that spirits exist. But there have been occasions where I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye or I felt like something was there that should not be. Those moments would pass quickly, so I would think nothing of them. Though thinking more about them now, perhaps that was people like Rokudou, Sakura, and the gang helping one more spirit pass on.STORYKyoukai no Rinne is plain in its approach. Focusing mostly on spirits, comedy, and romance, the show finds variable success in each category, resulting in a mixed offering.“Spirits” was mentioned first because that is the aspect that the anime uses first and foremost. More specifically, the anime spends a lot of time constructing parts of its world with spirits in mind. The Shinigami, the various spirit types, and the parts of the afterlife are not exactly intricate in terms of world-building but they manage to make the spirit motif a bit more tangible rather than waving them off as “spirits exist and nothing else has to be said”. Explaining all of the spirit-related content has the added benefit of demonstrating why a certain character acts the way he or she does – like Juumonji with his “Holy Ash” – or why the supernatural events are happening at all to begin with – like an evil octopus wiener arising from a cursed lunchbox. Again, the anime could have certainly just had the spirits exist as nothing more than a driving force for the arcs (they still do this) but by going into further detail on the world, the narrative builds itself a stronger foundation to stand on throughout the season.Speaking of the narrative, Kyoukai no Rinne takes a common approach to setting it up: multiple arcs rather than an overarching plan. Arcs generally last one, sometimes two, episodes. For the anime, this is a nice direction since having many arcs allows the show to explore its spirit motif as it sees fit. One encounter might involve spirits that make a soul-stealing pen while the next deals with a possessed house that prevents its inhabitants from leaving. The anime jumps from scenario to scenario, providing ample opportunities to show a wide variety spirits, their habits, and the ways of dealing with them adequately. As for the content of the arcs, the show never gets too serious despite the implication of death at every turn. Instead Kyoukai no Rinne tends to keep its mood lighthearted. Spirits are saved rather than exorcised to make sure this happy feel is achieved. One of the better examples is the arc where an idol, still lingering at the pool where she was supposed to make a visit, is angered that nobody can (understandably) notice her. To remedy the situation, Rokudou has all of the recently stolen spirits as well as the lonely culprit greet her to make her happy enough to pass on. As Sakura puts it, everything ends up “happily-ever-after”, applicable to every spirit-filled arc the anime has.Besides spirits, the anime also puts a lot of stock (pun intended) into the idea of money and economics. At the minimum, the show concerns itself with the notion of finance playing a large role in the life that Rokudou lives. It is nothing new to know that items have cost. Without the appropriate amount of bills or coinage, those items are impossible to get. This becomes the source of a lot of the comedy within Kyoukai no Rinne. For example, the characters at one point go to Hell where money is often scarce. Scarce to the point that there is an entire subsection entitled “Debt Hell”, where denizens slave away forever as they are unable to pay off their debts. But Rokudou, having spent most of his life poor as dirt, manages to do the job at light speed. The joke that follows – the director of the place delaying his payment a few months – also relies on the money shtick. The anime even sets time aside for the narrator to explain the cost of the spirit-useable items: “Spirit Duster”, “Separation Incense”, and more are silly, everyday devices with special, spirit-warding properties that, inconveniently and ironically, cannot be used on a regular basis. So no matter what Kyoukai no Rinne might be doing on-screen, money always underlies the festivities.Money as a crutch (technically no money) unfortunately lacks any thematic purpose. While this motif is a common thread throughout the entire season, because the anime does not do anything more than poke fun at Rokudou’s living conditions or showing yet another greedy move by his father, the show quickly devolves into repetition. The setting and the players involved might change slightly but the same jokes, the same outcomes, and the same ideas happen regardless. Money is not the only instance of repetition. Rokudou calling his grandmother “Grandma”, while correct, earns him a beating every single time, and Sakura’s two closest friends never stick around for too long since each spooky event scares them away. However these are a bit more understandable since they are deliberate, running gags. They exist either as a way to get a quick laugh (the former) or as a way to isolate the events (the latter). The same stream of jokes about money do not have these same luxuries, the end result being induced boredom caused by repetition.Crossing the spirit quality and the money quality gets at the third quality, romance. “Quality” is a bit of a stretch, however, since Kyoukai no Rinne barely brushes the surface of the genre. Romantic undertones are present between Rokudou and Sakura, but the louder characters – Juumonji and Ageha – are the most vocal about that special feeling. There are passing glances or minor monologues about how one character feels (or in Sakura’s case, might feel) towards another but the show never goes out of its way to put the romance on a pedestal. When romance finally emerges from its suppressed state, it either is ignored or misunderstood, meaning said “romance” is essentially worthless. To be fair, the romance is more akin to a dash of seasoning rather than the main course: it exists to add flavor to the spirits, comedy, and money motifs that run rampant. But given that the anime does little beyond mentioning potential romantic feelings now and again, the taste of the extra seasoning is lost. Other problems exist, such as the show forgetting about the first true antagonist Masato, the grudge-having demon. The presence of Sabato and, for a time, Kain makes him a moot point after his original entry. Other positives exist, too, such as the plot sometimes referencing the past to explain the motivations of the characters and therefore the specific set of events. Altogether Kyoukai no Rinne’s narrative is as average as they come.ANIMATIONKyoukai no Rinne adopts an older artistic look for its characters when compared to works of the modern age. Faces are wide, outfits are normal, hair-dos are not extravagant, and colors are bland, making the designs appear as if they come an earlier period of the medium. This is not a negative. In fact, the older appearances fit the spirit and magic setting that the anime so often uses.Investigating the characters more closely, some have nearly identical designs – specifically Rokudou, Juumonji, and Kain – that one could easily make the mistake that they are somehow related to one another. Looking specifically at Sakura’s design, her hair is a greenish-yellow, her eyes are a dull blue, and her attire consists mainly of a plain school outfit and the occasional casual look. Contrasted with today’s crazy hair-dos, intricate dresses, and detailed faces, she has an extremely boring design. Yet her boringness creates an aura of simplicity that fits with the mellowness of her character and indeed the artistic direction of the anime.This art does not have the same aged aspect as the character designs but that is worse because the anime’s backgrounds are as forgettable as possible. Rokudou’s apartment is literally filled with just a mattress. Their school is like any other. And the city, while traversed occasionally, has no notable locations. The art is more or less boring but that is sort of the point. Kyoukai no Rinne does not aim for lavish art because it has its spirit foundation in mind. By keeping everything very plain, the show inherently hits that calm, mellow target. Kyoukai, the quasi-world that the characters find themselves in regularly, is rainbow in color and bright in light, creating an atmosphere that contrasts nicely with the normal artistic direction. To put it differently, Kyoukai stands out a bit more than usual because of the plainness of its counterpart, cloaking the locale in a distinct, otherworldly mood.Still, can one consider the character designs and the art appealing despite how plain they both are? It is difficult to say. Rokudou’s fiery hair symbolizes his passion for spirit saving, as does his flame-embossed white shawl, but his design is otherwise so drab that it seems as if the bare minimum of effort was put into the design. The backgrounds are the same. They lack oomph. They lack impact. And when boring designs are placed on top of boring art, the visuals are tolerated not touted.All of this says nothing of the other nuances, like the camera and the lighting. Camera-wise the anime, once again, does the bare minimum. No extravagant shots, no unique perspectives, and no interesting takes. The camera is par for the course at best and completely underwhelming at worst. Lighting is often the same. Other than Kyoukai, the anime does not toy with lighting in any capacity except for a random sunset or a simple shadow. There is a nice moment where Ageha is clearly lighter than the rest of the gang on a dreary day to signify her position as a Damashigami (during episode eighteen, when Rokudou’s “Life Flame” is forcibly seized), but such a moment is the exception, not the rule. Thus, when both are taken together with the character designs and the art, the result is nothing short of dullness.As for the actual animation, Kyoukai no Rinne takes the same path. Surprisingly there is a lot of action in the show. Rokudou squaring off against multiple dolls, Rokumon slamming into a giant rat, and so on. However a lot of the action hides behind still frames and quick cuts that give the illusion of movement when none is being portrayed. When the action does die down, characters see mouth, hair, and limb movements to a moderate degree, though per usual nothing excessive is shown.CHARACTERSThe best (or at least the most fun) way to dissect the cast of Kyoukai no Rinne is to use an extended metaphor centered on money (and using U.S. denominations where appropriate).Starting with Rokudou, he is the almighty penny. Rokudou is poor, and in terms of worth the penny is the lowest on the scale. Rokudou is also the main (male) protagonist; he is the number one guy in the anime. Similarly pennies are denoted as one cent. Rokudou is necessary to the plot and to the other characters. Likewise the penny is necessary in the field of money exchange because pennies allow for numbers not divisible by five or ten to be distributed. Rokudou is known for saving, or contextually freeing, the spirits he encounters as opposed to handling them harshly. Coincidentally the penny features the (nonnegotiable) greatest President of all-time, Abraham Lincoln, who is known for, among many other things, emancipating or freeing the slaves. Rokudou goes invisible a lot. Similarly pennies tend to get lost in couches, the bottom of change jars, and out on the street, turning “invisible”. “Pick a penny, pick it up. Then all day you’ll have good luck” is a common phrase when the minute coinage is found, which coincides with Rokudou’s own luck at always finding success no matter how grim the odds. And as it were, Rokudou emphasizes the color red, as do pennies with their copper, reddish hue. Rokudou is a penny through and through.Negative quantities of money are technically less than the value of a penny, which is where Sabato, Rokudou’s father, comes in. Sabato represents the lack of money, otherwise known as debt. He is always spending, he is always asking for more, and he is always doing anything to get any kind of return. Sabato’s relationship to his son Rokudou is similar in that Rokudou’s poorness derives from his father’s existence; Sabato’s debt is Rokudou’s debt. For Sabato, Bijin, Ageha’s older sister, is his interest rate. She assists him in his money-stealing endeavors, acting as the secretary and the accomplice, allowing him to haul in bigger returns than he ever had by himself. For both Rokudou and Sabato, Kain, the Shirushigami, is (literally, not just figuratively) the debt collector, his job entailing the seizing of property and the handling of money. Kain later on becomes at the minimum acquaintances with Rokudou, and that makes logical sense since it is difficult becoming full-fledged friends with the person who is seeking the money he is due.Moving away from the lower end of the money spectrum, Ageha manages to mirror Rokudou in a variety of ways. Both are Shinigami; Rokudou and Ageha both deal with spirits daily. Both have a unique financial state, Rokudou being poor and Ageha being wealthy. Both have someone they love, for Rokudou that is Sakura and for Ageha that is Rokudou. But the most striking difference – perhaps the most obvious difference – is that Rokudou is a boy and Ageha is a girl. Collectively, Ageha is similar to Rokudou but not exactly the same. Given these traits, Ageha is the gold, one dollar coin featuring Sacagawea on its front. Gold is fought for, gold symbolizes wealth, and gold is loved by everyone. And of course, Sacagawea is female, all of which contrast the copper, Abraham Lincoln penny. Other aspects to Ageha make this interpretation even more logical such as Ageha and Sacagawea being natives of their respective lands and the penny and the gold coin representing one of their given unit.The other characters continue to follow this money metaphor. Rokumon is, given his small size and small importance, a dime. Juumonji is a nickel, his gray holy ash and his morally gray obsession with Sakura matching the grayness of the nickel itself. Plus, nobody really likes nickels, and given that Juumonji is a character that is around but not too appreciated, this description fits even more. Masato is a counterfeit check, deceptive and dastardly in his actions and motives, which in turn causes even more problems for the broke Rokudou. Rokudou’s Grandmother is a cash bond: she is there and could most certainly help but one has to wait a while before the bond can be turned in for monetary gain. But when that gain is gotten, there is no doubting how much help it brings.Everyone is related to money. But the most interesting and arguably the strongest character of the bunch has yet to be investigated. Sakura is a strange bird. She does not worry about money like Rokudou or Sabato. Sakura does not worry herself with romantic feelings like Ageha or Juumonji. She is especially prone to this kind of behavior; whenever Sakura is asked about who she is to Rokudou or when Juumonji is blatant in his advances, she is apparently oblivious to even the most obvious of social cues. Sakura does not worry about the afterlife or the quarreling of sisters or the past. In fact, Sakura hardly worries about anything. She is an immensely apathetic person. She sometimes raises her voice and occasionally has concern for another person. But for the most part her personality remains as flat as a five dollar bill (though that is not her metaphor).Sakura is content with who she is, where she is going, and why she finds herself thrown into her situation. Therefore, Sakura is a 401(k) plan. A 401(k) nets money for the future, bringing a feeling of security for the person who has such a plan. In other words, a 401(k) removes worries later on in life because extra reserves are present. Furthermore, Sakura is not a very impressive character. She breaks common stereotypes of main (female) protagonists by having absolutely no outstanding characteristics. She is a boring, dull, and wholly uninteresting person. 401(k) plans are similarly boring. Not much is done with them: they are created, money is put in them, and they are not accessed for years and years and years. Going forward one more step, Sakura does not get mad at others, and she is quite the respectful lady. Sakura is mature. 401(k) plans are similarly mature in the sense that having one signifies maturity, not just in age but also in wisdom.No matter how logical or insane this extended metaphor is, this does not say much about the development of these characters. In short, there is none. Rokudou, Sakura, and everyone else remains the same from their individual introductions until the end of the season. Juumonji does the same two actions throughout: throw holy ash and declare his love for Sakura. That is it. Like inflation does to economic values, he is consistent throughout the entire season. He does not change, and the same can be applied to everyone else. And for Kyoukai no Rinne, that is perfectly fine. The show does not want complex characters or unique relationships that are thematically special. Instead, the anime wants to have its quirky cast of characters mingle with one another, deal with spirits, and simply have a fun time. This might seem worthless – and for many it very well is – but as they say, “A penny saved is a penny earned”.SOUNDThe first opening theme in Kyouakai no Rinne is, initially, not the best piece. The track is mostly a pronounced guitar, with a vocalist using a nice singing voice but without demonstration of range. But the track grows on the listener. The clapping in the middle as well as the beat have a catchiness to them that is not immediate and only noted as the song is heard with each subsequent episode. The same can be said for the first ending theme. The instruments and singing are cute and quick, though not entirely inviting. The second half of the first ED, however, takes advantage of the build-up in the middle to bring about a catchy track that is as simple and as fun as the actual anime is.The same cannot be said for both the second opening and ending themes. Starting with the second OP, catchiness is hard to achieve mostly because of the grating instruments and the high-pitched vocalist. The vocalist for the first ED is the same one for this second OP, but here her voice is not as soft, leading to the disharmony the second OP provides. As for the second ED, the piece is almost too simple. It is devoid of any complexity, both the singer and the instruments going through the motions rather than trying to create a memorable piece. For both, the anime also strangely refuses to change the majority of their visuals for the OP and ED, making the second ones appear out of sync with what is shown as the songs are played.Out of all of the different parts that make up the sound-work for Kyoukai no Rinne, the original soundtrack is easily the best.

One of the more iconic pieces is “Hyakuyoubako no Irai”, with its ambient effects and everyday yet spooky feel, the latter feeling once more matching the spirit motif. “Anoyo no Uta” cranks up this spookiness even further, the choir and chilling instruments creating a ghostly composition. “Uwasa Hanashi no Chi” goes for curiosity for those equally inquisitive moments whereas “Lay Michi Kaikou” goes completely otherworldly. And “Kakugo!” is one of the many flurry-filled tracks with lots of noise and triumph. Again, the OST is nothing too impressive, but at the minimum the OST is fitting and thematically relevant.Last but certainly not least is the voice acting. Performances are generally average in execution, the characters’ voices fitting nicely enough. Marina Inoue as Sakura delivers a monotone voice that captures the girl’s personality. Hitomi Nabatame as Rokumon uses a childish, boyish voice that is unfortunately hard to listen to for long periods of time. Kaito Ishikawa as Rokudou sounds slightly too old for his age, but Rie Murakawa as Ageha provides yet another wonderful performance, giving the love-struck Shinigami a girly and commanding way of speaking.ENJOYMENTThere was a stretch in this anime where I could not stand what was happening.

I love Christmas, but I also liked seeing the main four characters – Rokudou, Sakura, Juumonji, and Ageha – grow closer as friends.

Sometimes they're about the more serious side of things where spirits are corrupted and wish for human destruction.  And other times they're...basically harmless.  Kyoukai no Rinne, hosts the latter of the two.Story: The story of Kyoukai no Rinne follows the story of Mamiya Sakura, a girl who has the remarkable power of being able to see spirits.  With this seer sight, she is able to see spirits day to day throughout her entire town.  One day in class, she finds a mysterious battle between a boy that looks vaguely familiar to...her classmate and an evil dog spirit.  After finding out that her classmate is a Shinigami (probably), the two set off on a wacky adventure dealing with spirits in their hometown.Kyoukai no Rinne is one of those series that really isn't one that is taken all that seriously for good reason.  To start, the series plays by a near episode by episode basis where every week, the cast of four merry shinigami and humans deal with a current situation that usually involves spirits, demons, or some otherwordly aspect.  The formula usually involves some occurence happening in some random place in town, Rinne and Co. go check it out, figure out what it is, then solve the problem; rinse and repeat.  In addition, the show is very comical in the sense that it doesn't take any of these situations very seriously, even though there are people who are getting their souls taken out or what have you.  As a result, this show gives off the vibe that it really shouldn't be taken seriously because every problem has a very nonchalant solution that apparently isn't all that hard to find out.In addition, the show utilizes the idea of poverty as a way of communicating comedy.  (I know, it's rather twisted laughing at a poor guy.)  Kyoukai no Rinne also heavily revolves around the idea of money, as well as Rinne, our main male protagonist, and his lack of it.  As such the idea of paying even 100 yen for something is too much for him, and the entire show dances around this idea very often as a main basis for how it conveys comedy.  Sometimes though, it gets tired, because it shoves the idea of Rinne being poor up your ass sometimes.In the end, while Kyoukai no Rinne had honestly no problems with what it wanted to do, there's just nothing substantial to it.  Because you expect the show to resolve itself, you can't really take it seriously and it becomes rather mediocre because you know whatever issue is occurring is going to solve itself in about ten or so minutes, leading to an incredibly easy amount of predictability.Overview:+/- Poverty and nonchalant comedy (this can be good or bad depending on your taste in anime.)-  Predictable plotline-  Kind of an anticlimactic endCharacters: The characters in Kyoukai no Rinne fall into two groups.  The main four characters, and everyone else.First, Roukudou Rinne, the main male protagonist of the series.  Rinne is the main Shinigami in the Kyoukai no Rinne series and serves as one of the main sources of the series’ comedy.  As the poor guy of the series, Rinne's main goal in the series is to help out the town he lives in as a Shinigami by reaping spirits, as well as getting any source of income that he can no matter what sum.  (Because according to Rinne, 100 yen is very pricy for an object.)  As a result, the running gag of this poor guy chasing after money becomes very well versed in the series and is a major part of how the series tries to entertain.Then we have Mamiya Sakura, the female protagonist of the series whose name you will NEVER forget because Rinne always keeps referring to her as “Mamiya Sakura” so it becomes difficult to try and let it slip your mind.  As a seer, Sakura is able to see spirits and other various things such as Shinigami and otherworldly beings and as such, is always by Rinne’s side whenever he has a case or something going on.  Sakura plays the sensible one out of the entire Kyoukai no Rinne cast.  Because of her very kuudere-like nature, nothing in the series really fazes her and she just brushes everything off without a second thought.  Between her and Rinne though, there really isn’t any character development whatsoever except for the highly inferred budding romance that the two are going through, (It’s really minute.) which is honestly a plot point that we really didn’t need.Then we have Rokumon, the black cat spirit that acts as Rinne’s helper during exorcisms and such.  Honestly…that’s pretty much it.  Rokumon as a character pretty much just acts like Rinne’s support for the entire series, and helps him through every task at hand through means like getting him gear, telling him useful tips, and adding in his little retorts to any and every situation.And finally, we have the last two characters of the main cast, Ageha and Jumonji, who are basically the exact same character just gender swapped.  What I mean is, they have very similar personalities and status in the show.  Both come from wealthy families, both are inherently stupid in a lot of various situations, and they both like the perspective main character opposite to their sex while also hating the other character that is the same sex.  (Ageha likes Rinne, Jumonji likes Sakura, Ageha hates Sakura, Jumonji hates Rinne; you get the idea.)  The issue I have with these two is the sheer fact that they are basically the same character with just their sex swapped.  As such, they don’t add an absurd amount of depth into the series since they really only serve to get in the way of everything, and are sometimes just really annoying.Side characters in Kyoukai no Rinne come in a variety of forms, ranging from Rinne’s moneysucking father, Rinne’s “Onee-san” (his grandmother in actuality, but likes to be called Onee-san to feel young), Kain, who is a right pain in the ass sometimes, and various villains throughout the series that are for the most part, one off spirits that you never care nor remember after their episode is over.  The good majority of these characters are the basis for each episode, with each evil spirit serving as the villain for the episode’s plotline before vanishing because they get reaped.  As a result, these side characters are only plot devices and don’t really serve much purpose beyond the given episode aside from the characters that I specifically mentioned above.  (Because those guys get more screentime.)Overview:+/- Decent main cast (I still don’t like how two of them are basically the same.)-  Little to no character development-  Side characters serve mostly as plot devices for the episodic format and really nothing elseArt: The art for Kyoukai no Rinne was bears a lot of resembalance to Inyusha, as the same author created it.  As such, the two have a very similar style to it with the way the characters are drawn.  In the anime, Kyoukai no Rinne has some pretty average animation.  Aside from the way the characters are drawn (due to the somewhat iconic style), there really isn’t anything to hit home about the animation.Admittedly, it is a decent style as it uses a nicely bright color palette that gives a little bit of whimsy to the series, as well as comedic moments which are coupled with exaggerated expressions and changes in background in additional to character retorts.  But really though, the animation is average, so there’s nothing really to write home about it.Overview:+ Decent animation (with somewhat iconic artstyle)-  Not a spectacular style of animationSound: The songs for Kyoukai no Rinne are average at best.  If I were to pick one, I would say that the first OP would be the most fitting for the series, as it has an upbeat rock tone to show off the atmosphere for the series that you will be watching.Aside from that though, the rest of the track is mediocre at best.  The first ED and second OP and ED are a little lower than average so there’s nothing really to write home about them.  (Didn’t help that they literally used the exact same visuals for the opening and ending themes.  And who thought it was a good idea to screech sing out the second OP?)  Background music is also average at best.  They really only serve to create the mood and don’t do anything besides say to you “This is the funnier part of the show.”Overview:+ Decent first OP  (I found this to be the better of the whole track.)-  Rest of the soundtrack was average at best-  None of the tracks were particularly memorablePersonal Enjoyment: When I first found Kyoukai no Rinne, I honestly didn’t know what to expect.  It was a show about Shinigami, and I thought “Hey, let’s give this a try.”  As it turns out, I suppose I enjoyed myself, though coming up with a satisfactory conclusion is a bit of a trial, I must say.Did I enjoy this anime?Honestly, I did enjoy watching parts of it.  There were sections of each episode that I genuinely liked because I found them entertaining, as well as a couple characters, (the main girls specifically) that I found to be my favorite of the series.  The entire main cast was admittedly, decent when they were all together, but I still didn’t like that Jumonji and Ageha were basically the same character.  (Also, that announcement for season two was admittedly pretty smart.)What didn’t I enjoy about this anime?Kyoukai no Rinne didn’t have anything that made the show really shine.  Because of its very formulaic and episodic format of storytelling, the show didn’t have much to make it interesting beyond what it offered.  It never stepped out of its boundaries and as such, never made an effort to make the story more interesting in any way since every episode was basically the same thing with a different monster.  In addition, the hint of love between the two main characters honestly, kind of unnecessary because it rose some “will they?  Or won’t they?” questions.  Also, I hate Rinne’s dad.  He is an honest to god, awful character.Would I recommend this anime?If you want something to relax to, I guess Rinne is good for that.  The show doesn’t really have much substance besides reaping a spirit then crying about having no money.  It’s not a deep story AT ALL and there isn’t really anything that should be taken seriously.  Everything in this show is considered as a joke in some form or another, and as such really doesn’t have any other quality besides cheap entertainment.  So, if you want something that doesn’t particularly make you think hard about what it is, then considering Kyoukai no Rinne is an option, I suppose. her classmate and an evil dog spirit.  After finding out that her classmate is a Shinigami (probably), the two set off on a wacky adventure dealing with spirits in their hometown.Kyoukai no Rinne is one of those series that really isn't one that is taken all that seriously for good reason.  To start, the series plays by a near episode by episode basis where every week, the cast of four merry shinigami and humans deal with a current situation that usually involves spirits, demons, or some otherwordly aspect.  The formula usually involves some occurence happening in some random place in town, Rinne and Co. go check it out, figure out what it is, then solve the problem; rinse and repeat.  In addition, the show is very comical in the sense that it doesn't take any of these situations very seriously, even though there are people who are getting their souls taken out or what have you.  As a result, this show gives off the vibe that it really shouldn't be taken seriously because every problem has a very nonchalant solution that apparently isn't all that hard to find out.In addition, the show utilizes the idea of poverty as a way of communicating comedy.  (I know, it's rather twisted laughing at a poor guy.)  Kyoukai no Rinne also heavily revolves around the idea of money, as well as Rinne, our main male protagonist, and his lack of it.  As such the idea of paying even 100 yen for something is too much for him, and the entire show dances around this idea very often as a main basis for how it conveys comedy.  Sometimes though, it gets tired, because it shoves the idea of Rinne being poor up your ass sometimes.In the end, while Kyoukai no Rinne had honestly no problems with what it wanted to do, there's just nothing substantial to it.  Because you expect the show to resolve itself, you can't really take it seriously and it becomes rather mediocre because you know whatever issue is occurring is going to solve itself in about ten or so minutes, leading to an incredibly easy amount of predictability.Overview:+/- Poverty and nonchalant comedy (this can be good or bad depending on your taste in anime.)-  Predictable plotline-  Kind of an anticlimactic endCharacters: The characters in Kyoukai no Rinne fall into two groups.  The main four characters, and everyone else.First, Roukudou Rinne, the main male protagonist of the series.  Rinne is the main Shinigami in the Kyoukai no Rinne series and serves as one of the main sources of the series’ comedy.  As the poor guy of the series, Rinne's main goal in the series is to help out the town he lives in as a Shinigami by reaping spirits, as well as getting any source of income that he can no matter what sum.  (Because according to Rinne, 100 yen is very pricy for an object.)  As a result, the running gag of this poor guy chasing after money becomes very well versed in the series and is a major part of how the series tries to entertain.Then we have Mamiya Sakura, the female protagonist of the series whose name you will NEVER forget because Rinne always keeps referring to her as “Mamiya Sakura” so it becomes difficult to try and let it slip your mind.  As a seer, Sakura is able to see spirits and other various things such as Shinigami and otherworldly beings and as such, is always by Rinne’s side whenever he has a case or something going on.  Sakura plays the sensible one out of the entire Kyoukai no Rinne cast.  Because of her very kuudere-like nature, nothing in the series really fazes her and she just brushes everything off without a second thought.  Between her and Rinne though, there really isn’t any character development whatsoever except for the highly inferred budding romance that the two are going through, (It’s really minute.) which is honestly a plot point that we really didn’t need.Then we have Rokumon, the black cat spirit that acts as Rinne’s helper during exorcisms and such.

Written by Rumiko Takahashi of Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha fame I think it's has exactly the similar light hearted romantic comedy kind of vibe more the former than latter.It never actually gets serious and as some have said episodic but there is interesting character backstory. The fighting is more comical in nature than life endangering and the character designs are quite nice.I love the first opening and its a completely light hearted show that never takes itself seriously so the viewer really shouldn't either....It's pretty funny at parts and parodies at times other animes which I found pretty hilarious, Sailor Moon, Ace Attorney, Shokugeki no Souma etc but still stays pretty true to its own rhythm.It never has a big climatic fight or anything so if you hold out for that you will be disappointed but there's a second season happening so maybe it gets darker then?The main girl character at times is pretty bland I find but not dislikeable. She's just a very non reactive sort of character. The other characters are also interesting in their own way and although my favourite is Rinne, his grandma probably comes second.If you're after something fun, cute, lighthearted with a bit of ghosts and slight romance then this is definitely worth watching.

So it will largely subjective whether you find this anime to be the following; funny, entertaining, or have any qualities in an anime you would enjoy. What I can do is tell you why I find this anime to be largely under rated, so this is not a review to diminish anyone\'s opinion, rather provide more insight why someone should reconsider. This review of mine, will not have any spoilers. Rather it will give out little clues in the show of why I think it is largely under rated.My...preface, and this has to be said, is that this anime is VERY Japanese. It mixes Shinto Buddhism with typical sociological theme\'s of Japanese culture. So studying Japanese tradition and culture would help out immensely. This anime does not compromise its Japanese roots, and does not jeopardize itself with western theme\'s, unlike most anime\'s have done in the past. Rather it parodies itself within its own culture. It could be said, that most people want drama and character development in anime. Not to mention, our western world likes things to spelled out, mean while Japanese culture would declare that would not be modest. I do not mean to impose, or come off too radical, but it is very easy for us to view anime through a western lenses. Another words, it is very easy to put our own expectations into something. Then it becomes easier to dismiss something and not give it a proper chance.The second thing, its very nice to see an anime that does not play on typical character tropes. Rather it concentrates, on its light hearted nature. With this, it oozes with charm with its off colored and sly little remarks. Like for example in episode one, with the spirit cracker, and the remark of commentator said, ""a real could have the same effect."" Its humor it uses is very settle sarcasm and also uses satire. This is what makes the manga artist more brilliant. Rather than being bombastic, and having huge battles and spelled out tension that is flung in one\'s face like her other work. Another great example of a very settle sense of humor, is having cats in a shot in the anime. Another example, is when Rinne said he does not do relationship advice. Its hinted that its his pride is in the way, and plays it off melodramatically he would rather die from starvation than to diminish his image, and to stoop to that level. Another words, Rinne is a very stubborn character. While he is caring and compassionate in some sense towards Sakura, this is where having a female character makes him reconsider his character. She also provides money for him but later he starts to feel guilty about it. Which is unlike his previous character. He would rather be poor and independent rather than depending on someone. But later he starts to rely on her emotionally and financially when gets over his guilt. This is character development in a nutshell. Here is a tip for seeing character development in general to see the settle nature of Japan culture, compare what they did in the past, to what they are doing. In contrast to what the characters say is less important. When the protagonist saves a character, because it is common in Japanese culture not to meddle with other peoples affair since they believe in karma. Nevertheless, their problems will become your problems. So misfortune could ensue. Since it is not common for people to meddle, it is hinting a hero would. Their version of a knight and shinning armor. Basically it is a form of counter culture. Coming back to how this relates to the review, Sakura supports Rinne. She is the true heroine rather than avoiding him. People forget that.The third thing, is the show is an oxymoron. So of course, how the shinogami world uses real world objects on spirits. So, How does tangible things have an impact on the ethereal plain? Well of course it couldn\'t but that what makes the world even more settle and funny. It also alludes to fact there is a form of a modern bureaucracy to this shinogami world. There is quota\'s, licensing, directors of this world, industry, markets in a world that appears to be in the edo period of japan. This also not only applies to the shinogami world, but the underworld as well. It takes jabs at the underworld like one of the directors of the underworld is some sort wealthy Japanese business man that throws money at his problems. Another great example, is how does yen currency in modern japan be the same in both the shinogami world and the underworld? One would think that materialism would not be an issue, or perhaps have some other form of currency. This only gives more credence that trying to be an oxymoron. Furthermore, one would think these worlds would be more communist or socialist rather than capitalistic. Since you are dealing with death money and commerce should matter less but it doesn\'t.Edit; I forgot to mention the music in this anime. Just like any anime, music really sets the mood. Whether it is Naruto, Noragami, or Akame Ga kill. So, I cannot stress how beautiful it is; how mysterious, eternal, magical, haunting, ethereal, and ancient it makes you feel. It takes you to a place where Edo period, where nature and the gods have clashed to keep the harmony of the universe. If you really want to understand YouTube ""あの世のテーマ"" meaning; ""The Theme of the world."" Or 地縛解放 ""To the liberation of the liberation"" Your welcome! :-)The last thing is my critiques on the show, because it does have flaws. Even though I find them to be minor other people would disagree. As I have seen in other reviews. Yes it is true that the manga creator and artist does tend to recycle characters from previous works. There are other reviews here that did this well, but here is another the forgot. One of the Shinogami\'s that is infatuated by Rinne, reminds me a lot of Kodachi the Black Rose from Ranma 1/2. But yet again, these types of character and cookie cutter tropes tend to be very popular in Japan. She does this within her own work, so it could be said, that could create conversations within the Otaku culture and her fans. Like for example, best girl in a harem is a very popular past time in otaku culture. So its not a stretch that her dedicated fans would have similar conversations. Similarities is bad within American culture but in Japanese thinking it is familiar and comforting. Another point, the story has very little depth. Which is true. It does not dealing with dark theme\'s or any real human element that any person could relate to. But yet again, this story was never meant to. But it wouldn\'t of hurt to do that. The manga creator has done that in the past very well, but she some how didn\'t do it in this series. So I cannot blame a person for feeling a bit disappointed by this.P.S. If you disagree with me, by all means please do so. You can talk to me and we can have a conversation further if you like. But there is one request I would make, please no hate (But yet again this is the internet) If you do, it will be ignored. :-) preface, and this has to be said, is that this anime is VERY Japanese.

But later he starts to rely on her emotionally and financially when gets over his guilt. This is character development in a nutshell. Here is a tip for seeing character development in general to see the settle nature of Japan culture, compare what they did in the past, to what they are doing. In contrast to what the characters say is less important. When the protagonist saves a character, because it is common in Japanese culture not to meddle with other peoples affair since they believe in karma. Nevertheless, their problems will become your problems. So misfortune could ensue. Since it is not common for people to meddle, it is hinting a hero would. Their version of a knight and shinning armor. Basically it is a form of counter culture. Coming back to how this relates to the review, Sakura supports Rinne. She is the true heroine rather than avoiding him. People forget that.The third thing, is the show is an oxymoron. So of course, how the shinogami world uses real world objects on spirits. So, How does tangible things have an impact on the ethereal plain? Well of course it couldn\'t but that what makes the world even more settle and funny. It also alludes to fact there is a form of a modern bureaucracy to this shinogami world. There is quota\'s, licensing, directors of this world, industry, markets in a world that appears to be in the edo period of japan. This also not only applies to the shinogami world, but the underworld as well. It takes jabs at the underworld like one of the directors of the underworld is some sort wealthy Japanese business man that throws money at his problems. Another great example, is how does yen currency in modern japan be the same in both the shinogami world and the underworld? One would think that materialism would not be an issue, or perhaps have some other form of currency. This only gives more credence that trying to be an oxymoron. Furthermore, one would think these worlds would be more communist or socialist rather than capitalistic. Since you are dealing with death money and commerce should matter less but it doesn\'t.Edit; I forgot to mention the music in this anime. Just like any anime, music really sets the mood. Whether it is Naruto, Noragami, or Akame Ga kill. So, I cannot stress how beautiful it is; how mysterious, eternal, magical, haunting, ethereal, and ancient it makes you feel. It takes you to a place where Edo period, where nature and the gods have clashed to keep the harmony of the universe. If you really want to understand YouTube ""あの世のテーマ"" meaning; ""The Theme of the world."" Or 地縛解放 ""To the liberation of the liberation"" Your welcome! :-)The last thing is my critiques on the show, because it does have flaws. Even though I find them to be minor other people would disagree. As I have seen in other reviews. Yes it is true that the manga creator and artist does tend to recycle characters from previous works. There are other reviews here that did this well, but here is another the forgot. One of the Shinogami\'s that is infatuated by Rinne, reminds me a lot of Kodachi the Black Rose from Ranma 1/2. But yet again, these types of character and cookie cutter tropes tend to be very popular in Japan. She does this within her own work, so it could be said, that could create conversations within the Otaku culture and her fans. Like for example, best girl in a harem is a very popular past time in otaku culture. So its not a stretch that her dedicated fans would have similar conversations. Similarities is bad within American culture but in Japanese thinking it is familiar and comforting. Another point, the story has very little depth. Which is true. It does not dealing with dark theme\'s or any real human element that any person could relate to. But yet again, this story was never meant to. But it wouldn\'t of hurt to do that. The manga creator has done that in the past very well, but she some how didn\'t do it in this series. So I cannot blame a person for feeling a bit disappointed by this.P.S. If you disagree with me, by all means please do so. You can talk to me and we can have a conversation further if you like. But there is one request I would make, please no hate (But yet again this is the internet) If you do, it will be ignored. :-)', ""Takahashi, Rumiko if you are new to her then you will most likely enjoy it but if you are not then this review is for you.Story:6It is all been there done that. Nothing new here..For Takahashi, Rumiko.. The writer of Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha... It is a spin-off of her previous art work..The anime is supposed to be lighthearted Rom-Com supernatural.. If you are looking for a bit of drama/love triangle/unrequited love then this is not an anime for you. Again it's either a hit or a miss depending upon your taste.Similarities with InuyashaIf you haven't got the hint of where I am going then,...the anime adapts the setting of Inuyasha where the pair travel to the other world to solve the problems ..In this case supernatural occurrences. The boy is a well practiced Shinigami with little to no cash at all and the girl gradually learning about her abilities. The boy doesn't want to put the lady in danger but has no choice because as powerful as he maybe, he is pretty much useless without her.Similarities with Ranma 1/2As the character and love development is extremely low to none at all for the source material nearly boasting about 200 chapters . The anime does not have a clear ambitious goal or any note worthy antagonist. It can work for you as it is mainly light humor with a bonus of slight hints of romance. With some light heart-ed random jokes and mischief with the MC trying to be humorous in a serious tone or pitying his dilemma.Art:7Nothing note worthy and is not the prospect of the anime that attracts you.Well compared to its ancestors the art work is graphically better but rest of the setting is the same. If you set Fate/Zero or other recent anime as your benchmark then you will be left disappointed. If you love combination of bright and multi-colored abstract background[[Like No game No life]] then you will find it note worthy but apart from that it leaves you tasteless..Sound:8A combination of traditional Chinese and modern music it. It is listenable but nothing extra ordinary that leaves you with chills or even gets you motivated. The Music is contemporary and constant with a random buzz and fizz in funny moments.CharacterWell the MC is not your stubborn obnoxious muscle brain character but your dependable but a bit jealous and sometimes childish.In the recent trend of Tsundere/Moe/Kawaii MC heroine it was a pretty bold move to create a unfathomable character with little detail.. A dialed down personality who has little expression and a constant voice tone.Enjoyment:7I was left disappointed because all the author did was combine her previous works but if you are new to her then you will may well enjoy it.. Its a classic shonen where you complete your quest and in the meanwhile help your damsel in distress..Overall:7The story is well paced and the concept is easy to grasp and easy to follow but brings nothing new to the table. It has its ups and down, it can be your anime to watch when nothing is on your plan but not your daily cup of tea which you would wait around for its next release...Though it is fun to watch for a while and a joy ride, but with a lack of clear plot if dragged to long can be a big hit or a miss but no middle. It seems unlikely to get 100+ episodes with its intended 25 as was the case in Ranma 1/2 which could have been crowned epic, but the same jokes get tasteless and hence was left off incomplete compared to its source at episode 161 and some ova.The anime combines her previous work so maybe its not all dim and dark if they add something new to it as well..Some people do find its humor intriguing but fear of it being left off in the middle as the same loop gets repeated and ultimately start losing their interest. the anime adapts the setting of Inuyasha where the pair travel to the other world to solve the problems ..In this case supernatural occurrences.

Is this memes?! - Kyoukai no Rinne reviewRinne is an anime adaption of the same author who wrote and illustrated the classic manga Inuyasha. However, Rinne quickly becomes a parody of itself and lacks the passionate writing of its fore sibling. It is completely undermined by lackluster characters, mediocre plot, and repetitive gags that quickly loses its substance. While I did have personal enjoyments throughout the show, it is far from redeemable.The premise of Rinne is quite simple. Our heroine, Mamiya Sakura, wanders into the spirit world and after coming back to the real world she can see ghosts. One...day in highschool, a mysterious boy, Rokudou Rinne, shows up and their wacky adventures begin. Quite the opposite as it is usually the mysterious girl, but it doesn’t innovate anything. For the first few episodes they proved to hold potential. I genuinely giggled and enjoyed the type of gags it was going for. Throughout the show we’re introduced to some non immersive episodic episodes, especially when the character development is nonexistent and most of which are 1-2 dimensional characters. I’ll elaborate on characters later. Furthermore, one of the most essential/annoying plot lines in the story concerns Rinne’s dad, Rokudou Sabato, that doesn’t give any deeper insight to the linear story we’re given that ultimately concludes in disappointment each time there’s a new plot line that centers him as the antagonist. The money gag in the show is quickly overused and utilized way too much and forced. There isn’t one episode that does not focus on money at some point. Especially since it’s always shoved into your face trying to be funny and garner unwarranted laughs and giggles. There are quick lived moments that’ll reassure you and then demolish your mentality of any enjoyment you would like to have while an episode is still playing. I will give credit to the narrator for making the shinigami tools at least interesting enough to sit through the show. Yes, it uses the money gag, but it’s one element highly underutilized where many of its potential lies. And then it is quickly shoved as a money issue rather than focus more on how funny the actual tools can be used in circumstantial situations that the cast is in.I have to give credit where credit is due. The art and animation in this show is good and well done. It’s highly consistent and far better than its story counterpart. Some criticisms though is that the fight scenes are a little bit usually just weapon clashes and then it slows the motion down for a bit. That is not very interesting. I mean c'mon, Rinne is a shinigami. Let us see him fight with the powers and fighting capabilities of a spirit exorciser, then it will bring a balance to comedy and the action sequences it clearly failed  to do so. The voice acting offers quality as good as the art and animation. Music in Rinne I didn’t really notice too much, it doesn’t stand out as something I’d download myself. The first opening was good and represented the series faithfully, and then the second opening happened. It wasn’t the song but the animation were just ripped from the first opening and it felt lazy. It was unsynced and awkward that they did not match at all. Lazy. Endings are good as it is.Wow, now onto characters. Like gameplay is important in games, characters are the stronghold of a show. They are not at all great. Mamiya Sakura’s nonchalant nature at times are on point and others it is used in scenes unbalanced with the current moments. It quickly turns many scenes into bland oceans filled with dead Sea Bass. When she does show her sincerity and compassion, it’s always a short fuse that is quickly outlived killing the buildup of actual character development shown in our faces. Rinne had potential. I felt like a little tweaking to his character or at least not make him focus so much on his money problems, then maybe he may have been a much better protagonist. He doesn’t show much range in his character. For someone who has so much potential, for instance, being a shinigami, in debt, and issues with his dad, it is all proven to waver in weakness of the rest of the weak cast. Another main cast member, Juumonji, never changes at all. Or at least have a higher understanding of his friends. Nope he’s your everyday ‘holy ash’ character. Additionally as to being very in love with Sakura, not even that helps his overall character design. Ageha has it the worst of all. Being so obsessed with Rinne, Ageha so pathetically tries to attract his attention in comedy that clearly is one forceful, two generic as fuck, and three annoying as fuck. That’s all there is, and Rokumon is just Rokumon.The episodes with Kain and Masato are completely lacking in the seriousness they try to convey, specifically concerning Kain with Sabato. Rokudou Sabato is the main antagonist of the series, but all he is there is to be a fuck boy. That’s it. A fuck boy. And Ageha’s sister, Bijin, to simplify it, she basically falls in love with Sabato and that’s it. She ends up just an ignorant and stupid character. That’s as far as those guys gone in the first season. And I hope for Buddha’s sake, they eventually do more than the one dimensional crap that they are and do.There are too many key elements in Rinne that falls apart deeply into the pits of Hades’ underworld. The beginning episodes moved on strong, it displayed what we were getting, but never improving itself. Gintama is an anime that proves to evolve itself even if it brings up old jokes from time to time like justaway and Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, is because it’s utilized uniquely and in appropriate story bits. But that all rarely happens. I sorry to Gintama for even making that comparison. This show earns a little respect for not pissing me off so much. And that is why Kyoukai no Rinne earns a 5/10, it’s mediocre. The writing of the story, characters, and overall development disappoints highly, but still holds intricate moments at times as well as the beginning episodes that holds it very strongly. This isn’t something I can recommend because of its repetitiveness and what I’ve stated above. I’d say you check it out only if you’re a huge fan of Takahashi Rumiko, but even still you’re going to be have a terrible time. day in highschool, a mysterious boy, Rokudou Rinne, shows up and their wacky adventures begin.

However, when I watched 1st episode of Rinne, I got attached to this anime immediately.This is exactly what you can watch after InuYasha, same good in quality anime, more modern times story.If you want positive feel good entertaining, watch this anime.  Great quality, great story and characters are so well described, almost like they have soul of their own (become alive).  Same thing was in InuYasha - the anime characters as if became alive - same thing is with Rinne.  Great work of...great artist.  Imagination of artist does not stop to surprise.  This is not your usual robots or zombies that are everywhere today but totally different new characters!  Pure joy to watch!  Very relaxing, no stress, mind surprising, educational of culture and based on modern day life.  Lots of interesting ideas about after-life.  Great imagination.  The best anime out there.  I wish it had more seasons. great artist.  Imagination of artist does not stop to surprise.  This is not your usual robots or zombies that are everywhere today but totally different new characters!

The best anime out there.  I wish it had more seasons.', ""TL;DR: I really loved Kyoukai no Rinne, but I agree that it isn't for everyone. However, it is a fun, light, comedy that I use for a pick-me-up when I need it. (And I've needed it quite a bit, lol)L;DRAm I biased about Kyoukai no Rinne? Hmm, yes, yes I am. I'm a fan of Rumiko Takahashi, so I don't think I could ever truly hate one of her works. I also went into the anime after reading the entirety of the manga, so there's that, too. And yes, I've kept this show in my favorites list, because I really truly love it- it's one...I find myself always coming back to.I do disagree a bit with the low rating on the show's page. Something about expectations- this isn't a serious shonen. If you've come here looking for the next Inuyasha, you're not going to get it. This is an episodic comedy show set in a high school with light romance. It's character and situation driven, and the plot is more or less ignored. If this type of show doesn't appeal to you, that's totally okay- I'd just say, don't watch it.To me, Kyoukai no Rinne is a well-executed comedy- and nothing more than that. There's not really any 'arcs' in the show, you could likely isolate each episode and that would really be fine. And several times you'll have multiple scenarios within a single episode, although this happens more often in the later seasons.The characters, while typical Takahashi archetypes, are still interesting to watch. Sakura is honestly the perfect candidate for a main character with her unbothered nature. Her relationship with Rinne is unproblematic and feels good to watch- the romance in this show is conventional yet sweet, the cherry on top if you will.The animation could be hit or miss at times, but for the most part I was in love with the art and the way it brought everything to life. Again, I am a Rumiko Takahashi fan, so I've grown used to having most of her work animated less-modernly (starting back in the 80's for Urusei Yatsura, and 90s and early 200s for her other major works). For me personally, I loved seeing her characters and art style translated for a new, modern television presence. And the art itself didn't seem as 'flat' as other animation I've seen from recent years, so I consider it well-done. I'm not sure what else this studio has worked on, but they did a good job here.Talking soundtrack: I ADORE Keytalk's songs and I think that the music is perfectly fitting for the show's vibe. Listening to the first OP always puts me in an excellent mood. For the background music in the show, I feel it can sometimes work well, sometimes not as much. But generally it gives the show a nice, light feeling to watch. Again, I must impress how much I love the first opening. If you're unsure about watching this show or not, go ahead and take a look at the first OP, because that gives you a pretty good idea about the kind of show this is, from the pure vibes alone.What happens in the show?There's a sort of formula to each episode, but I don't think I ever had a moment watching where I was bored. The stories are often quick, and there's no filler, so even despite the enormous amount of episodes (3 seasons of 25 eps each) I didn't feel like I was watching something unnecessary. Rumiko Takahashi's characters aren't exactly known for their outstanding development (Except in the case of Maison Ikkoku which is spectacular) and Kyoukai no Rinne takes a similar stance. Sakura in episode one is sort of the same Sakura in episode 75. Same goes for everyone else. But I found the characters themselves to be extremely endearing, especially Rinne and Tsubasa. At the end of the day, I liked them all, and the way each character flowed together was nice to watch.The stories themselves are generally entertaining. Sometimes, there will be references that fly over my head due to being very Japanese- as in, based off of some myths or urban legends common in Japan that don't exactly perfectly translate to my American background. However, I never found this to be a problem, and these episodes were often even more interesting because I felt I was learning a bit about cultural differences.Is Kyoukai no Rinne the best show in the world? No, not in the slightest. Are there areas it could have been executed better? Obviously. But for my personal tastes, this was the perfect show for me, and it might also be a good show for you.~Thank you for reading this far~ I find myself always coming back to.I do disagree a bit with the low rating on the show's page.

I\'ve seen a lot of animes, and the comedy in this one is great. I\'ve seen Inuyasha and Ranma 1/2, so the comedy in Rinne is a bit different than the ""Osuwari/Sit boy"" or...""so uncute"" comedy from Rumiko\'s older works.Mamiya Sakura is a bit bland at first, but she does develop later on in the episodes. The difference in her character from first episode to the last episode is pretty astonishing.Characters:The main characters, Sakura and Rinne, are very different than the main characters from Inuyasha and Ranma 1/2. Therefore, don\'t watch the show with expectations like of Inuyasha or Ranma.Overall, this is the kind of show that you can watch leisurely and for enjoyment.Don\'t let the ratings fool you. The reason for the low ratings is because people expected some massive plot like Inuyasha and didn\'t know that Kyoukai no Rinne is supposed to be composed of short stories.Don\'t forget there\'s 75 episodes! :D ""so uncute"" comedy from Rumiko\'s older works.Mamiya Sakura is a bit bland at first, but she does develop later on in the episodes.

The reason for the low ratings is because people expected some massive plot like Inuyasha and didn\'t know that Kyoukai no Rinne is supposed to be composed of short stories.Don\'t forget there\'s 75 episodes! :D', 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryIn a sense an old school Anime, something that has a vibe of ""Inuyasha"". So basically we get adventure of characters in a world of onmyouji powers. Classic Japan heave/hell thematic and characteristics. With a small twist of how various abilities and tools cost offering money. I do love onmyouji topics and such Anime, they classy and fun. But this one felt really underwhelming. Is it as  it had great ideas and light-hearted entertainment, but I fell as story was irrelevant in this Anime or simply...so weak that couldn\'t get pulled into it. It\'s fair enough story\'wise, has some plot and development, but I couldn\'t be bothered with it. Got bored and preferred to move on.So in short, story has old school feel, but has really weak punch to it.✦Art & SoundBlander ""inuyasha"" basically. It was colorful and clear and quite satisfying to be honest. So I cannot really say much bad regarding the Art. Not extremely impressive nor bad, it felt fitting and had great feel to it. Animation was average for the most part.As for music, I cannot say much as there weren\'t that many noteworthy tracks. But some songs and OST had great classy feel. So in short ""sound"" department felt something in between of ""good enough"" and ""enjoyable"", but I like praising Anime, so I gave it ""good"".✦CharacterI like the main girl, she has oddly satisfying personality. As for the rest of the cast, they were either boring, bland or comedy relief. In another words, characters were just fine.✦Enjoyment & OverallAs mentioned in story section, I found the idea interesting, as I have weak spot for such style. Onmyouji is fun. But the whole ""punch""  was really weak and underwhelming. Couldn\'t get into this anime. so weak that couldn\'t get pulled into it.

Couldn\'t get into this anime.', 'First of all I’m a big fan of Rumiko’s works like Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha (one of my first ever anime that also make me love anime) so her art style is one of my favorite. After a very long time without anime or manga due to my busy life, I beggin getting back to my anime hobby and there’s no surprise one of my favorite mangaka’s work will be on the list.But man, the whole show a big disappointment for me, some of the episodes are decent (they make me laugh for the jokes) and anything else is a mess. The story line is...poor, very poor compared to the legendary Inuyasha. There is almost no character development, the chemistry between Rinne and Mamiya is really odds. Rinne’s dad Sobato should be the main antagonist but all the time he appeared make me really really feel annoying, OMG.This show is a big no no to me, with my love to Rumiko sensei I tried to finish the first season but man I have to drop it, because I found there’s no enjoyment anymore. poor, very poor compared to the legendary Inuyasha.

Then like me you may find a ton of enjoyment in the series that the average anime fan may not get or even like.Now having said that I should say that personally, I would say it's arguably the weakest of Rumiko's stories, but also just as unique and fun-filled as the others.Now on MAL unlike on IMDB, the thing about an Anime being in the 6 out of 10 range is seen as quite bland or bad, unlike...how many films on IMDB in the 6, 5, or even 4 range could be seen a classics or even cult hits. But for Anime it's pretty much saying that this Anime wasn't even good enough to be a 7 in a world where perfection is not really asked for, just entertainment value is all that is needed to get a score of 7.The thing that Rin-ne doe that is most likely the most frustrating aspect of the series is the same thing that almost all of Rumiko's stories do, which is that instead of the story progression the story ops for a more episodic sitcom-like approach. Which at this point I've come to love about Rumiko's works but will say it's a crutch for many fans that don't feel like spending their time on something more than 5 episodes unless there's a hook.But Rin-ne's hook is, unfortunately, the fact that you want to just spend time in another Rumiko world. Which for us dedicated fans would be like serving ice cream, but for the unknowing fan of hers that just happen to watch the series out of nowhere, they may not find a lot to like about the show unless they find it to be a fun-filled experience that doesn't mind episodic shows and just like to kick back and feel a real sense of escapism, which is what every Rumiko story has done unlike any other anime or manga.Overall Rin-ne is a highly enjoyable time for those who love Rumiko Takahashi's works and for the avrage anime viewer it could be a hit or miss. Personally I think it's a fun series that keeps the same vein as it's other shows and keeps the magic while also being it's own thing. how many films on IMDB in the 6, 5, or even 4 range could be seen a classics or even cult hits.

Koisuru Asteroid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39388/Koisuru_Asteroid,"['""Koisuru Asteroid"" is one of those anime than unless you\'re interested on its subject matter you won\'t be liking it as much as you\'d want to. What if I told you that\'s not always the case. What if I told you that the characters could make the story rather the aforementioned ""subject matter""? ""Koisuru Asteroid"" is certainly one of those anime, and I\'ll prove it to you.Yes, because the characters are so likable it makes me ignore the fact i\'ve never been interested in astronomy. It\'s fascinating because throughout the anime I learned so much about something that it never mattered to me and all...this thanks to its characters interaction, which I have to say, it\'s actually hilarious. They somehow make it possible to be hilarious and at the same time, explain further the astronomy. I actually did some research and whoever wrote the script did a good job of explaining things in the best way possible. It\'s not confusing to say the least and the comedy makes it better. I\'ll be honest, if it was a serious show i would have probably dropped it long time ago, and while I like it when something is serious, some things have to be hilarious, otherwise it wouldn\'t work as it should.The story is also nice even though sometimes it feels like most of it is filler and does not progress the story. This has mainly to do with the amount of characters and the fact it\'s set at school. Considering the amount of characters, lets very little to development but I don\'t think it wouldn\'t matter that much since the story is plot-triven rather than character-driven. The main point of the anime was explained extremely well and that\'s what matters in the most. Everything else irrelevant.""Koisuru Asteroid"" is clearly not for everyone... in fact I dare to say it\'s just for a group of people but if you ever wondering if it\'s worth watching then my answer would be... thoroughly.

You all manipulated the score, as if you forbid anyone else to watch this. I say this is a good anime, why because there are several factors that influence why this anime can be good.

The background image is no less extraordinary.  Maybe this is what is called realistic art.  But even though the character\'s illustration and background are somewhat extraordinary, this is not followed by the expression of each character.

Your astrological chart says that you\'ll read spoilers, so you\'re warned.When a little girl called Mira Konohata meets little boy Ao Manaka, they promised each other to discover a new asteroid when older. In the present, teenage Mira joints the Astronomy Club, where she meets teenage Ao, who is actually a girl, and along with Mai Inose,...Mikage Sakurai and Mari Morino, they start their adventures exploring the wonders of the Earth and the Universe.Story (9/10):Mira Konohata is a passionate girl on the universe, astronomy, and specially, asteroids; such is her fanatism on asteroids that she made a promise in a camp with a young person with short hair called Ao Manaka that they\'ll do anything to discover together a new asteroid in a foreseeable future. A few years later, Mira enters high school and wants to join the Astronomy Club, but it was merged with the Geology Club to form the Earth Sciences Club, there she meets a purple haired girl named Ao Manaka, much to the surprise of the asteroid.We can\'t also forget our ample cast of girls, the calm Mai Inose, or Ino-senpai; the elegant president Mari Morino, or Monroe-senpai; and the playful vicepres Mikage Sakurai, Sakura-senpai. Since their specialties are varied and their clubs forced merging put them into a difficult position to get funds, the chemistry between the girls help them overcome it.Maintaining the traditional structure of Doga Kobo cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime like beach episodes, school festivals, the most remarkable aspect of Asteroid in Love is the soft talk to explain very complicated themes like the parts of a telescope, the celestial sphere, identification of planets by the naked eye, and sometimes the types of rocks, boring, core sampling, strata analysis, ironically, one of the themes that I majored.This is in contrast of the hard-hitting content of RikeKoi, whose themes are much more complicated and are explained very technically that can repel the less educated, while Science-Types fell in love with extreme theoretical jargon. Asteroid is in love with a much more forgiving detail telling to our minds.Later in the show, new girls appear after the graduation of Monroe and Sakura, Mikage\'s sister Chikage, or Chika-chan, who shares her geology love with her sister, but also can read the fortunes of the girls with rocks, called geomancy; and the rough second year Yuu Nanami, or Nana-chan, whose theme is not astronomy nor geology, rather meteorology, a science that is rarely interesting for the normal people, but she\'s not normal, so she likes it.Mira and Ao\'s relationship began normally and started evolving so much that Manaka, after a deep-searching discussion with her family, went to live with her fellow asteroid lover in order to fulfill their dream together. Their common dream made them write an essay about asteroids in order to qualify to an event to actually watch asteroids, in which only Mira qualifies to the final course. Of course Doga Kobo, using all its vast experience on inserting yuri subtext on CGDCT anime, tell us that Ao is indeed in love with the Asteroid girl.The Shining Star Challenge consisted in analyzing live-time the asteroids in Okinawa as in the actual proceeding in actual telescopes, Ao found a way to covertly accompany her darling to the event. Both girls get to experiment how the technical aspects on how to watch asteroids, which they knew a couple of, are the key to fulfill their dream, and while not getting to the promised land at the end, Ao and Mira get even more determined to discover a new asteroid.Art (10/10):Doga Kobo\'s sweet and very colourful art is always a pleasure to the eyes, the girls are extremely cute and adorable, and especially the design of Monroe-senpai is the finest out there. No weird animations were showed, there\'s a lot of fluid animation on the movements.The backgrounds and especially the ones with starry skies are a luxury to watch, since I don\'t know much more about astronomy nor the astronomical sky, I\'ll say that most of the better known northern sky constellations are spot on (I can just watch the Cruz del Sur rather than the Ursa Major), also the strata of the core samplings and the rocks were very well drawn and actually made me smile because of the correct details.Sound (8/10):The ""least"" noticeable aspect that goes hiding is the sound; as in many Doga Kobo animes, relatively new seiyuus get the main characters, with Megumi Yamaguchi (Hifumi Takimoto in New Game!) doing Ao, and Tomoyo Takayanagi (Hana Shirosaki in Wataten) as Mira. The more established Nao Touyama (Karen Kujou in Kiniro Mosaic) and Sumire Uesaka (Sanae Dekomori in Chuunibyou) get to voice Sakura-senpai and Monroe-senpai, respectively.The opening is pretty average for someone of the stature of Touyama, and the ending is also very average, but both can be very serviceable due to the extremely mild ambiance of Asteroid. The background sounds give small touches to the relaxing nature of the anime, nothing too loud or too opaque, just there to support the show.Characters (9/10):In Doga Kobo animes, the characters are the stars that shine the most. Each one of the girls has a defined personality and never gets overly aggressive or raunchy, which gives a sweeter calm for the viewer, their relationships are pure and cute, sometimes yuri-esque. I’ll only talk about the Earth Science Club members.Mira Konohata is an energetic girl who has a fascination on astronomy, principally in asteroids, she’ll do anything to help her friends, be it in the astronomy section or not. Her close relationship with Ao is the driving force of the plot.Ao Manaka is a very serious girl, who rarely expresses emotion, acting rationally while investigating the intricate details of the universe, but hides her deep crush on Mira that it wasn’t born the day they reencountered, rather from the very first time they meet. However, in contrast to the more hostile silent girls of other anime, Ao is very friendly with her colleagues.Mai Inose is the least visible girl out there, but her presence is fundamental to maintain the order of the things in the Earth Science Club after the graduation of Monroe and Sakura. Geology and cartography are her specialties, which makes her a little distant toward Ao and Mira.President Mari Morino is elegant and graceful, but has a very playful side that appears in the most critical situations; Monroe-senpai is well versed on astronomy and wants to be an astronaut. Vice-president Mikage Sakurai is rough, but never violent, rather playful, always willing to explore the wonders of the lithosphere; Sakura-senpai is always available to help the club.Chikage Sakurai, like her sister, is literate on geology, but also on geomancy, only differing with Mikage in being energetic. Yuu Nanami is a sullen short haired girl which has a somber past due to natural disasters, so she now studies meteorology to help people take correct decisions concerning weather catastrophes.Enjoyment (10/10):When I was a student quite a few years ago, learning about the outer space, the stars and the celestial bodies bored me to death, ironically, Asteroid in Love made me feel some love for the universe that is mostly based on the surgical combination of something more close to my major, which is geology. The girls and the very digestible theoretical explanations of the secrets of the asteroids and the lithosphere gave me a weekly dose of educational science cuteness.In the common denominator of modern cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime, the yuri subtext has become a staple in the plot, which in many cases, had become the central aspect of many recent shows, Koisuru Asteroid is not the exception. Stories about finding love when sharing a common hobby have existed since the beginning of history (or possibly prehistory), Ao’s repressed feelings for Mina because they want to discover an asteroid together forced the former to live with the latter, and that’s the absolute demonstration of passionate love.Moreover, the outer space subjects the lithosphere and the atmosphere to being second fiddle in size and importance, and despite the sometimes unreachable universe to the human technological progress, Asteroid in Love bridges the gap between the hard theory and the average mind of an anime fan, between the coldness of the space vacuum and the warmth of the cute girls, and between the distance of asteroids and the sweet girls enjoying their school life studying them.Final score: 9/10. Mikage Sakurai and Mari Morino, they start their adventures exploring the wonders of the Earth and the Universe.Story (9/10):Mira Konohata is a passionate girl on the universe, astronomy, and specially, asteroids; such is her fanatism on asteroids that she made a promise in a camp with a young person with short hair called Ao Manaka that they\'ll do anything to discover together a new asteroid in a foreseeable future.

Stories about finding love when sharing a common hobby have existed since the beginning of history (or possibly prehistory), Ao’s repressed feelings for Mina because they want to discover an asteroid together forced the former to live with the latter, and that’s the absolute demonstration of passionate love.Moreover, the outer space subjects the lithosphere and the atmosphere to being second fiddle in size and importance, and despite the sometimes unreachable universe to the human technological progress, Asteroid in Love bridges the gap between the hard theory and the average mind of an anime fan, between the coldness of the space vacuum and the warmth of the cute girls, and between the distance of asteroids and the sweet girls enjoying their school life studying them.Final score: 9/10.', ""This is honestly really nice. It's one of those all girl cast animes, filled with such cute moments, but also following a clear and interesting story with it's theme being based around space, rocks, maps and all sorts of things related to those. I dunno about you, but rocks and space just really interest me lol. I'd collect them myself, but you're here for the review.What helps the anime is it's story of childhood friends, reuniting years later, and really becoming best friends. Along with the relationships with the other club members, and that they have with each other. It's cute, and it's honestly relaxing...too. Sometimes a peaceful and calm anime like this is just what you need.The art style I adore too. It's really colourful, and that is what makes it beautiful in my eyes. Really well done. No matter it be the characters themselves, or colours of the sky, or scenery. It's well done all round.The music and sounds in general is also fitting for purpose, and really good.Honestly a fine anime for this season, you should check it out while it's still going! too.

This time it\'s centered around a schools natural science club, and follows a group of friends - including two girls that have reconnected years later, after a chance meeting where they have made a promise to discover and name an asteroid together.The art style is nice, the characters are cute and the episodes are pretty chill, as is par for the course for this type of anime.What else is there to say though... Well, for people who enjoy this kind of anime it\'s serviceable enough and fans of K-On! or...Non Non Biyori for example, might find more enjoyment here than I did. In my own experience though I found it lacking. It covers a lot of the same ground that shows like those did, but lacks the dry humor of Non Non Biyori, or the character depth and musical hook of K-On to keep me interested. It\'s talked about, but there\'s not a lot of emphasis on exploring the science side of things, nor the romantic undertones that are hinted at early on.The show is just kind of...forgettable. And even now I\'m finding it hard to remember any of the character names or anything that happened in the episodes. Not the worst thing I\'ve ever watched, but could have used an injection of comedy, romance or more in-depth use of the natural science plot to make it stand out a little more.

When it comes to Doga Kobo shows we know what we’ll get. Cute girls doing cute things, occasional yuri ships and wholesome content that makes you want to go out and find your own niche group of friends. Koisuru delivered on those expectations and more.Not only were we treated to wholesome interactions between the cast on their adventures to discover and name an asteroid,...but we actually were treated to extremely accurate information regarding astronomy. Entire segments of episodes are seemingly love letters to the field, including useful tutorials and other tidbits for amateurs wishing to gaze upon the cosmos.In usual Doga Kobo form, we get gorgeous bright colour palettes throughout the series with consistent character models and quality animation. There’s not much to speak of from a technical perspective with these types of shows as they mainly revolve around character interactions and dialogue.The blend of the usual cute girls doing cute things with the educational aspect really made Koisuru standout and resonate with me. I believe that if you have any interest at all in learning about space, astronomy or science in general, this is a great show for you. It’s a really fun, wholesome and educational journey of friendship and discovery.

In the past, I’ve gone on record being fairly lenient towards most low-effort moe anime. With “Koisuru Asteroid”, most of my convictions about cute girl anime have been gravely perturbed.The term “CGDCT” or “Cute girls doing cute things” is one I’ve never been a fan of, if not for the sole reason that I grew up in the era that encapsulated its inception and persistence. I get the appeal...because I lived through the majority of this genre’s golden age. I understand why certain fans will come to the defense of even the most niche entries in this genre.There’s a reason why the term “CGDCT” is used as a pejorative, and that’s because shows like this will rise to the surface every once in a while. Let’s cut to the chase, this show is mind-numbingly boring. Let’s stop kidding ourselves with this shit. Is this show REALLY worth defending? The core audience for this show is insomniacs, frankly, that’s the only type of person I’d ever recommend this show to. Someone so out of sync with their body-clock that conventional methods of conking out just don’t do it anymore.I’ve been seeing this show unfairly defended as an “iyashikei” anime, but the whole point of iyashikei anime is to heal you, not put you to sleep by the time the opening theme is finished. To me, this show has carved the path towards an entirely new genre of anime, anime so boring and full of grey-matter that it melts your consciousness into a sleep-inducing lull.What can I say about Koisuru besides the fact that watching it was a blur? None of the characters track. Not a single one of them had new or interesting traits we haven’t seen recycled dozens of times already. The protagonist is your typical bubbly energetic moe-blob joined at the hip with her reserved best-friend, what a genius contrast, you couldn’t make this shit up. There wasn’t a single believable or compelling storyline and most of the side-characters were just there to pad the runtime. The character designs are plain/simple which is an honest rarity for Doga Kobo.Unless you’ve already cultivated an active interest in the topic at hand (not that it can't be framed in an interesting way) you’d need the goddamn Ludovico Technique to stay awake watching this show. It is utterly bereft of anything worthwhile in a half-decent cute girl anime.Let’s just end it here, because at the very least I can credit this show with fixing my sleep schedule, thank fuck.

To begin with, I cannot say I didn't enjoy the anime but there's a lot of things lacking. As astronomy lover, I expected a lot of nice landscapes and space scenes, something like Kimi no Na wa, but that was not the case with this anime.The plot is interesting, but the story development is obviously not that good.  I would say that sound was okay, whereas I was not in love with the art style. I don't know,...but the art style was very strange to me, they had dark purple strokes and some colors were uncommon(I believe I am not used to different stroke colors because black ones are mostly used).In conclusion, I would recommend this anime, especially to Astronomy lovers! Even though I didn't enjoy the anime at all, it doesn't mean you won't. This is my first review of an anime, so please have a bit of mercy. :) but the art style was very strange to me, they had dark purple strokes and some colors were uncommon(I believe I am not used to different stroke colors because black ones are mostly used).In conclusion, I would recommend this anime, especially to Astronomy lovers! Even though I didn't enjoy the anime at all, it doesn't mean you won't. This is my first review of an anime, so please have a bit of mercy. :)"", ""This is a review of the anime and manga series, Koisuru Asteroid (KoiAsu). I will principally focus on the anime, and do note that there will be spoilers for this series.Now what is KoiAsu about? To put it simply, it covers the Earth Sciences club, and the members as they carry out activities about geology and astronomy. We have Morino (Monroe-senpai), Mira, and Ao on the astronomy team, and Inose and Sakura on the geology team, with Chikage and Nanami (interested in meteorology) joining the team later on in the anime. For both Mira and Ao, they have a common purpose for joining this club:...Years ago, when both were young, they had made a promise to each other to find an asteroid and name it Ao, as a result of Mira sharing a name with the variable star Mira (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira), but Ao not sharing a name with anything.Story: Now KoiAsu the manga is a 4-koma, and as such, the anime has a lot of original stuff not seen in the manga.  The anime does this very well, with the general plotlines of the story and characters generally remaining the same, but however there are a lot of mini details added to it that really make the series pop, like for example Inose’s rather slow sidestepping or after Inose’s first event as club president, showing how Inose’s blur photos were due to her nervousness. Now, the studio for this anime is Doga Kobo. Doga Kobo is known for adding a bit of yuri to the CGDCT animes they watch (but obviously not converting it into a yuri anime). Suzuya is the main driver of the yuri in the anime, with a lot of implied yuri scenes being instigated by her, like ”confessing her feelings” to Misa, or getting Mira to tell Ao a pickup line when they visit her because she’s sick, on top of the fact that Mira mistook Ao for a boy when they were younger, which was already in the manga. The manga name might be “Koisuru Asteroid”, but the characters go beyond just sticking to their own respective fields, with the geology team learning more about asteroids, and vice versa. This shows when Inose, during the Earth Science Olympiad, is able to answer the astronomy questions easily. On top of just the club itself, the anime also shows ||Inose’s interest in geology, and Suzuya working at the bakery, and how she is inspired by those in the Earth Sciences club, helping them during the cultural festival.The manga also expands on the anime. The anime contains and usually focuses on directing the story in a way that made you feel emotional. There were many moments where things got more interesting, such as Ao's moving away, or before that, we have the end of the cultural festival where Ino got promoted to club president, and the anime attempted to cut out a few jokes just to make these moments at the end feel genuine, and worth watching. Unlike many other CGDCTs where many girls felt slightly shocked and surprised, and at the same time they were like 'yeah it's just a joke and the end and we're not serious about any of these after all', the method of flowing a story's tension and the like in KoiAsu anime overall left a lasting impression on me. The manga is where more jokes (especially ones that are omitted from the anime) work better - it's a normal 4-koma read after all, and also the place for latest update of most of the parts getting adapted and animated.Characters: The characters undergo good character development throughout the anime itself. For example, Ao goes from being a nervous person when speaking due to a past mistake, to someone who has the courage to attempt to join the Shining Star challenge despite not meeting the requirements and asking her parents to let her stay with Mira so they can continue to find an asteroid together. Inose gradually becomes more confident after being made club president, from someone who was unconfident about taking the role, to being able to take on the Earth Science Olympiad.Art: Now, I’m not a great judge of art. However, 2 scenes stand out in my mind: The ED, which shows the different characters at home, then young Ao and Mira together, then the characters observing the night sky. Fun fact: The storyboard for the animation in the ED was created by the same storyboard artist who worked the Chika dance in Kaguya-sama, Naoya Nakayama.Another scene which stands out for me is where after Inose finds out why she took bad pictures, she gradually turns and puts her head on the table.Sound: Again, I’m not the greatest judge of VAs, but I can tell you that the ED (Yozora) is an absolute masterpiece and one of my favourite anime EDs, especially when paired with the outro mentioned above.Enjoyment: Overall, I really loved the anime, it really makes topics like astronomy and geology (which can be highly technical) enjoyable to the average watcher. The anime is one of the 3 animes (the other being K-On and Takagi) to make me feel sad at its ending, and that’s one of the reasons I love it.

It\'s my first impression that I have about Koisuru Asteroid. Storys that talk about characters united by same thing like a hobbie of a familiar event, likes as Kimi No Na Wa, always attract me, and was that happen with this anime. The art color are, impressionaly, vivid and bright and are extremaçy rare on anime series art tecnics, because this type of art is more used in anime movies. If you watch Koisuru Asteroid in a dark room, you...can have headache due of bright and vivid colores.We know the work is about two childrens in a camp that do a promisses of ""found his own star"" and after found each other on college. Therefore, exist a manner in artistic production to reproduce fells like nostalgia, tranquily and chilbourhood when it mix the vivid colores of animation with the light and childlike traits of the characters. In other words, they try to pass the anime mensage in animation. The characters are adolescents but they are similiar to childrens due draws style that, in mangá, is used to make kids, like short stature and small breasts (in girls).

I might be biased mainly because I adore cutesy animes, am interested in space exploration, and am a lesbian. But, I think it's a great production nonetheless. It's perfect if you're ever bored during summer or if you don't know what to watch. The plot itself isn't hard to follow and is more of a leisurely watch, the art style is perfect for the overall vibe, the characters are very adorable and have admirable personalities, and it overall just made me very happy to watch. I think if you're looking for light, comedic, and uplifting animes, you'd most certainly enjoy...this one. Thank you for the outstanding show! this one. Thank you for the outstanding show!"", ""The show telling me how cute girls doing their cute thing. Its funny, how two different club become one. Like sky and the earth? A big challenge there, but they manage to put all the problem together so fast. How cute with what they are doing, i can't stop smiling, i can't stop tearing my eyes. Maybe i dont have any interest about the concept to the astronomical thing, or even the geology one. However, with just looking to their activity, i just feel refreshed, a nostalgic memories to bring back by this show. I had the same feeling to Suzu-chan at some scene though...their activity together. Yet, repetitive moment got blown up sometimes, another cute character show on to fill the blank. A bit sad with Mira and Ao can not find their dreams. But no problem girls, just enjoy your time at your big family, and be fun with your life. Then, your dream abour asteroid can coming as a bonus. Yes, had a fun, like Sensei there.Dang, a bit rushed, but i can't do anything to change the duration of the episode. And i can't really ask about the other season, i will be realistic about the trafic watch through this show. Some souls may judge this whole series as a boredom. And some devils shall call this as a cringy thingy. I can't help, but wish other anime should follow these concept, i like this. I like how cute girls doing cute things. LolI may add some critics about some points. First, their repetitive and cliche way through their club activities. Second, their end not much ended as my standard too. Its somehow feel blank in to my heart. I can called it as an open ending one, thats not good to stop the show in that way. I know the studio might planning to get other season, or make this anime into a cliche cliffhanger show. But, i dont feel thats the strength point over these, and can not make any improvement toward the whole series. Its good to show how two senpai get their graduate, its my strongest plot in this show, some melodrama dont be too hard to put, right? So, maybe the end can put it too, even get the ssteroid one as an ending. I know, thats shall be impossible. But, its a fun, why not bring more fun to end this series?Okay, enough, thats my thought. Gladly i found this before move on to other season. This show prove me to never judge the book by its cover. Well done, you get my 9. With that, i may put up other section as an average 8 point, because i can't take any other words. Yes, 8 as an Overall, plus one point for my respect to make such a lovely series.Well, its time for me to move on. their activity together. Yet, repetitive moment got blown up sometimes, another cute character show on to fill the blank. A bit sad with Mira and Ao can not find their dreams. But no problem girls, just enjoy your time at your big family, and be fun with your life. Then, your dream abour asteroid can coming as a bonus. Yes, had a fun, like Sensei there.Dang, a bit rushed, but i can't do anything to change the duration of the episode. And i can't really ask about the other season, i will be realistic about the trafic watch through this show. Some souls may judge this whole series as a boredom. And some devils shall call this as a cringy thingy. I can't help, but wish other anime should follow these concept, i like this. I like how cute girls doing cute things. LolI may add some critics about some points. First, their repetitive and cliche way through their club activities. Second, their end not much ended as my standard too. Its somehow feel blank in to my heart. I can called it as an open ending one, thats not good to stop the show in that way. I know the studio might planning to get other season, or make this anime into a cliche cliffhanger show. But, i dont feel thats the strength point over these, and can not make any improvement toward the whole series.

May gush on about some things as well. The review really only starts in the 3rd paragraph.Koisuru Asteroid is a fairly typical CGDCT anime. But it is a typical CGDCT anime that dreams. It dreams to help others discover, wonder, and pursue. Whether it be knowledge, human connections, introspectiveness - this anime was made with a clear goal of allowing its audience to appreciate these aspects while providing an extremely relaxing, heartwarming, and endearing little tale about people who have aspirations in their lives....I love this anime. I went into it only because it had a slight whiff of geology involved (which is the field I am studying and is a subject hardly seen in anime outside of disaster anime which in itself is rare) as well as being a CGDCT anime - a genre I believe is probably one of the safest choices and has a wide variety of stuff to offer. I had the expectations that it would only have the earth sciences club as a contrived gimmick to get them together that would be shoved to the back room and only be used as a setting for wacky high-school girl shenanigans that you see so often in anime. Colour me surprised when they not only didn\'t drop their gimmick - but they made it the focal point with the sciences becoming the major theme of this show. In addition they also cut down on the wackiness that is prevalent in most anime of its ilk. I feel like this anime was honestly made just for me. I haven\'t felt this connected to an anime since Yuru Camp almost 2 years ago.Getting my personal adoration for this anime out of the way, lets start with the actual review. Ao and Mira are the main characters of this show. Having previously met when they were younger - making a promise to each other to find a new asteroid in a flash of impetus - they reunite in highschool in the Earth Sciences Club - still holding on to their promises made years before. The Earth Sciences Club was formed from a merging of the old Astronomy and Geology Clubs thus delineating the main fields of natural science that will be explored throughout the show. The story itself is quite normal for a character-driven CGDCT show as well. Most of the episodes have the Earth Sciences club members do fairly typical slice-of-life stuff like a club barbecue, a beach episode, a school-festival episode etc. but with an added mix of science-related activities in line with their club. From here on the anime gets pretty schizophrenic with its pacing. The pacing never settles down on one thing and sometimes there are up to six different things happening each episode. This was adapted from a 4-koma manga so its not particularly surprising but this anime seriously never knows when to stop throwing us around the different stuff the various characters do - either together or as individuals. As much as I like each individual story, it just isn\'t very well put-together.The problems from this become apparent as the story feels extremely broken up with some character development as well as some sub-plots (yes there are those) being lost in the mess and never really gets expanded upon. Suzu and Misa as well as the relationship they had (as well as the one we yuri-baiters wished they have) were pretty hard casualties of the horrible jumping-around. Most of the other characters get away with it due to the sheer screentime they occupy but I really would have liked the anime to have more structure and actually remember to resolve and look into some of its plot-threads. This is the primary gripe I have with this show and one which would definitely turn off people from watching it because, through the wacky pacing, it never looks like anything is getting done by the characters.The characters are, however, the aspect of this show that carries it far and beyond what I expect from a CGDCT show. They\'re all your fairly typical CGDCT character tropes and you really shouldn\'t expect this anime to be breaking any new ground in characterisation but I\'ll do my best to describe them. This anime gives them something special though- introspective thought. Because they have the ability to reflect on themselves they become vessel that carries the central themes of the show. They become far more human than almost every other CGDCT cast of characters. It turns the anime from a quick-paced, rapid-fire comedy with plenty of gags into a grounded, down to earth (hehe see what I did there?) slice-of-life that cares about how it handles its characters. How this impacts the anime is subtle but it is noticed in the plethora of emotional build-ups and the actions the characters do after making a profound discovery. They create new goals for themselves, they become curious about others as well as open up to others about themselves in a very natural way.This anime perfectly illustrates each character\'s own unique personality, motivations, and trials they have to overcome. Each one of them (well, Ao and Mira make a pair but whatever) have their own field of science they want to get into. The anime not only shows why they want to do so but also how it affects their daily lives in that they can apply what they learned to create their own allegories and lessons. Even through the anime\'s blinding pacing, it gives us great little stories and encounters of each character and what lessons they take away from it. For the sake of structure on this already-long review I\'ll split the individual analysis of characters into Geology Side and Astronomy SideGEOLOGYSakurai Mikage and Inose Mai are on the geology side of the club. Obviously my favourite 2 characters because of geology. This anime perfectly demonstrates how their interest are weaved into their lives. If you watched the anime thinking they were caricaturing geologist with their weird actions, you\'re wrong. Of course Mikage has an extensive rock collection because I and many of my classmates have. Of course they would observe the smooth rock while they\'re relaxing in the hot-springs because I would do that to to any rock on the side of the road that interest me. The generally stoic and careful Mikage has always viewed geology as a hobby but never had any clear goals in life. Her tsundere tendencies are very typical of her character type but she makes it hers alone due to having a well-applied personality. Throughout the show we see her interest in geology evolve by seeing the passion of the other club members. Having never seen her geology knowledge applied outside of her own closed world view, she begins to appreciate what her ability to conduct research can do. In episode 5, with Mira as the impetus, she slowly breaks out of her initially-closed-off self and starts to appreciate what she does for others as well as what others did for her. Its a slow but significant piece of development for her as she also starts consciously guiding others both as a normal highschool girl and as someone dabbling with the earth sciences. She\'s a great baseline for the anime of being a normal person who wants to be a scientist. Always being careful - she is initially scared to expose her hobby to others - always thinking it ""isn\'t good enough"". This is a feeling that doesn\'t just apply to sciences but to anything you can think of. It makes her relatable.For Inose, science was a way for her to discover her confidence. She grabs a good amount of time in early eps and almost the entirety of episode 8. She is easily one of the most endearing characters because of her design and quiet, worry-wart disposition. She also can\'t handle a camera well which is very cute. Her interest comes from geological mapping and she uses science as a way to improve herself by gaining confidence. The anime perfectly shows how she grows from her experience. The quote ""Sometimes it\'s better to do something familiar than to force yourself to try something new"" that stuck with her was something I genuinely appreciated. Too many stories tell us that its not good to stick to something and that it\'s good to go out to get new experiences. Whilst this is sound advice this isn\'t the reality for most people. For some situations you find yourself in its safe to stick to what you know. Not only was it shown in an offhand manner in that she can\'t take good photographs no matter how hard she tries, but she strives to use her earth sciences knowledge she gathered from being with the club to improve herself as a new club president and as a person. It\'s a wonderful development from what she also essentially viewed as a hobby.ASTRONOMYMorino Mari is the basic club-president trope you can see in many other shows with clubs. She aspires to be an astronaut which is an incredibly tough job to become and the anime shows her diligence well. Initially she was fairly emotionally-detached from the club only seeing it as a stepping stone to her future. However, her interactions in the club and meeting new people as well as learning their motivations allows her to open up and relax more. Her character shows how knowledge doesn\'t have to be sterile and single-minded. Her story shows the human side of science in that it is, not just possible, but necessary to make connections with others. Its a shame she isn\'t given much screentime since she has to lend it to the main characters but her development never felt incomplete.Mira and Ao are basically a red-oni, blue-oni pair. They seek to discover a new asteroid and it is this passion that drives much of the series. Plenty of the other characters come to their own realizations because of the dynamic the duo put up. Individually, they both make pretty great characters as well. Mira is the typical genki girl whose genki-ness fires up the club members and becomes the heart of the club. The anime, however, provides her with a lot of subtle characterisation that prevents her being an out-and-out trope. She has situational awareness unlike most other characters of her type (looking at Yui as much as I like K-On!) which allows her to take control of the flow of any situation. She has a keen learning mind which allows her to also appreciate learning things outside her (extremely passionate) field of science unlike many other single-minded tropes. Ao is much more calm and is driven by Mira\'s passion. Without Mira you get the feeling she would probably end up like how Morino was before the club was formed - only seeing things as a means to an end. She becomes much more impulsive thanks to Mira which almost gets her into trouble near the end. It\'s great seeing the 2 really want to learn knew things and somewhat makes me reminisce on how I was in highschool - which is probably the point of this show. I would have liked to see more of them. The anime somehow doesn\'t give them much time to do new things so the rest of the club members somehow get more impactful development than them. The final few episodes focus almost exclusively on Mira and Ao but it would have been nice to spread it out a bit. Still, they\'re great characters that provide a good baseline for the others.Suzu is the best supporting character just because of: ""That\'s because she\'s a girl and she\'s cute. It it\'s a girl, I\'m A-OK!"" - Suzuya Moe, 2020But seriously she has so much personality that I\'m really sad she doesn\'t get more scenes nor a resolution except for a ""rejection haircut"" T__T We need more of her.2 other characters are introduced very late into the show and I can\'t really talk much about them. They\'re not bad characters just more victims of the shot pacing. I would love to see them in a second season but Doga Kobo is never gonna do that because if we can\'t get a season 2 of Gekkan Shoujo but we do for Umaru it just meas we\'re living in the darkest timeline.The anime\'s knack for science was perfectly weaved into their lives. There\'s plenty of scientific explanations that actually go into a fair bit of detail. It probably would put some people off but it\'s just interesting stuff and puts into context the way science has shaped our characters. It adds to the curiosity factor the anime brings out in people. This anime also has comedy that has so many layers and Venn diagrams to understand. Was I the only person who laughed at episode 4\'s joke of Mira stacking cakes while making a ""columnar jointing"" joke? (Columnar jointing is when basalt lava cools quickly and contracts forming hexagonal-shaped cracks when it solidifies with the most famous example being the Giant\'s Causeway in Northern Ireland). This is actually realistic. I know people who make lame science jokes like this. It just makes the anime feel so much more human because you know the creator payed attention to these sort of things.The animation was pretty consistent as expected from Doga Kobo. There are a few scenes of off-model though especially in long shots. They used a very simple art style and colour palate similar to the manga and other DOga Kobo shows which isn\'t bad or anything but I would really like to see them put in more detail like in their previous works like Wataten (how does that have the most detailed backgrounds in all DOga Kobo anime?). The character designs are simple and cute and its easy to know exactly what personality each character has. Character animation is pretty top notch too but there unfortunately isn\'t too much of it since the directing was quite safe. Music was great though. The OP and especially ED are sublime to listen to with the great visuals. That ED perfectly encapsulates the grounded feel of the anime and isn\'t a showy, energetic track like plenty of other shows. The BGM tracks are nice to listen to and fit each scene well though it could do with more variety with different moods. Overall its a pretty solid production that I could expect from a production which people liked to work on.I hold this anime dear to me because it shows that science isn\'t just a bunch of sterile, emotionless white coats. Science is pursued by people who have dreams, who have a goal they strive to achieve. They all have different motivations. Some pursue knowledge to know everything there is to know, some want to expand on the field they love, some want to know more about themselves, and some want to help others with the knowledge they gain. There\'s plenty of emotions in science and its all because people are passionate about it. This anime is about discovering that passion and applying it to connect with others and becoming a more rounded person.Koisuru Asteroid was a surprise for me for various reasons. It has great characters and an endearing tale of discovery. I hate how people skipped over this just because they thought it was another shallow CGDCT show. I may be biased towards this anime as a researcher (wannabe) but there\'s plenty to take away from this anime if you look in the right places. If you look closer at the characters and their motivations and actions, you might find something relatable.Thanks for reading! I love this anime.

And to be honest, this is one of that kind of anime. Maybe my review little bit of bias cuz my preference, but I will tell you what.What I like about this anime is the journey stuffed with 'life soup'. And Lot of humor inserted make it more enjoyable rather than complex story. And of course some cute stuff (yea, I like cute stuff).The journey is about some high school girl want to achieve their passion. Like most of them have  different passion, but they still support each other to get in there. I realize...that we cannot achieve something big without support from who our treasure the most. How their character develop with the problem, well, some time is good and some time is soso.This, really related to my condition right now, make it more and more connected to me. And yes, there is lot of 'life soup' in the story can make you feel warm. I really recommend this anime when you need some motivation to achieve some thing, or go further to reach your dream, or maybe just because you have some bad day and want to relax.The romance it self, from my opinion is good enough, but not to much spice. Like you cannot tell how the ship must be, or some time you can tell (?). I'm little bit airhead when it comes to romance, but when I still love the surprise element from romance. A little bit spoiler but this is a warning too, the romance is between girl x girl (yuri). that we cannot achieve something big without support from who our treasure the most.

It has a twist in that all the girls are giant nerds, only they still manage to make that part of cute.Aside from the genre stalwarts like hot springs and the beach we got locations like precious stone and space museums, as well as warm summer nights out spent staring though a telescope. The characters make a lively bunch, and it doesn't feel like any one in particular hogs the spotlight, which is good. It's typical lackadaisical anime where nothing is overly dramatized and there isn't some enemy the characters are united against,...nor some kind of supreme hurdle they must overcome. They're together because it's nice to have friends. Their interests aside (nerd!), I'd say they manage to hold interest, and it's an easy watch whether you're half asleep or half awake while so. nor some kind of supreme hurdle they must overcome.

I used to be neutral with astronomy. That is, before I took college level courses on it. I know MUCH more than this anime had ever touched upon, (I really wish I hadn\'t, honestly). Like, the fact that I crammed hours learning about Cepheid variable stars, parallax technique, fundamental theorem of the universe, dark matter/energy, etc etc and having to take a final on it definitely made me absolutely hate astronomy. The fact that the introductory episode opens up with Mira being a popular variable star made me cringe.I learned absolutely nothing new...in the few episodes I watched, and I really doubt it goes very in depth into astronomy (I mean, it\'s an anime, come on now). I am absolutely no expert on astronomy, but I know how most things work, so the ""learning"" aspect of this show was a disaster.But enough of the negative/extremely biased views. What makes this show terrible, barring my complaints and venomous hate towards astronomy? As for actual characters go, it\'s your very orthodox CGDCT show. I thought it was going to have some comedy, but no, it\'s just slice of life CGDCT. Not that this slice of life was terrible or anything, but it certainly isn\'t worth watching. At all. It\'s not animated beautifully, the dialogue isn\'t quite meaningful, the character\'s are pretty typical, and the story is just what you\'d expect from an anime about a school club: club activities and the festival, and some summer camp adventures.All in all, look somewhere else in the few episodes I watched, and I really doubt it goes very in depth into astronomy (I mean, it\'s an anime, come on now).

It's a wholesome show about friends learning about the stars and earth together! And it's not even poorly done at all! I think slice of life gets a bad rep just because it isn't action packed, and lower stakes and less dramatic slice of life like non non biyori, is the order a rabbit, yuru yuri, and yuru camp gets an even worse rep because people think it's boring. And if you are a shounen fanboy, you probably won't like this, but I really enjoyed it. For some reason, I just can't...resist moe slice of life, even if it's bad (this show is not bad though).This show was fun, sometimes funny, wholesome, heartwarming, educational, relaxing, and just a genuinely good time. The music, visuals, story and characters aren't the best you'll ever see, but there isn't one aspect of this show that is bad in any way. This isn't close to being on par with a superstar moe slice of life show show like k-on (which is my favorite anime period), but in my opinion there is nothing wrong with it and I think that you should give it a try. resist moe slice of life, even if it's bad (this show is not bad though).This show was fun, sometimes funny, wholesome, heartwarming, educational, relaxing, and just a genuinely good time.

Now, I went back to this anime with more nuanced eyes and decided to give it a second try. So, was Asteroid in Love any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryAt first glance, Asteroid in Love might seem like one of those TV shows you wouldn't be able to enjoy if you weren't into the subject matter, in this case, astronomy. Luckily, if you give it a chance and...stay beyond the first episode, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. Yes, astronomoy and other sciences do play an important part in the story, but the show's main element is the bonds of friendship between the characters. It's the characters' interest in different sciences, rather than the sciences themselves, what push the show forward. True, you might yourself unable to understand some of the scientific themes, but then again, this show isn't mean to be a documentary, but rather a story about how the girls appreciate these themes and how they use those lessons to improve themselves as human beings. (7/10)CharactersI've always believed that characters are the lifeblood of the story and Asteroid in Love follows this principle very closely. Like I said before, the characters move the story forward, not the sciences.I'm just gonna put this out there: every character is a shining paragon of goodness. No, seriously, every character in this show is friendly, gentle and unfailingly polite with one another. Whenever the characters have a misunderstanding or a conflict, it's resolved almost immediately and, in the end, there aren't any characters that can be considered anatagonists. That's perfectly fine, though. If there were any antagonists, Asteroid in Love would have a been a completely different story.Anyway, most of the important characters are girls that aren't afraid to show affection to one another and it would have been easy for the show to immediately label them as lesbians. Fortunately, the show takes the road less travelled and merely keeps the focus on the show's bonds of friendship rather than any romantic love.If I had to pick a favorite character, I'd choose Mikage. Don't get me wrong, protagonist Mira's bonds with other characters (especially Ao) make her a compelling character, it's just that I found it easier to relate to Mikage's struggle to find a dream and desire to keep the Earth Sciences Club active. She wants to protect something that gives her joy and validation and that's something that many people, myself included, can understand.All in all, the character writing is the show's strongest aspect. (9/10)ArtEverything about this show is just so bright and sparkly, and I'm not talking just about the stars and the stones. Everything, from the characters' eyes to the waters, looks pleasantly bright and sparkly and you could hours upon hours watching the show's beautiful lighting. (8/10)SoundsAsteroid in Love boasts a soothing and heartwarming soundtrack, especially for the character moments and the stargazing. The opening song by Nao Touyama (who voices Mikage in the Japanese version) is suitably beautiful and relaxing for an appropriately positive show.That said, I did watch the English version and I was impressed by the vocal performances of Lindsay Seidel (Mira), Terri Doty (Mikage) and Apphia Yu (Chikage). I hope they get more work because of this show. (9/10)ConclusionWhile the lessons in astronomy, geology and meteorology are enjoyable in their own right, what truly makes Asteroid in Love is the character writing. Asteroid in Love is heartwarming and life-affirming experience that celebrates friendship and dream-chasing and I highly recommend it.

What this means is they are either some of the best anime I have ever watched (K-On, Yuru Camp, Hidamari Sketch), or incredibly mediocre with nothing better to offer (many many other shows). Koisuru Asteroid is, unfortunately, as boring as they come when it comes to CGDCT. I've had similar experiences with Rifle is Beautiful last season and normally I would have done the sensible thing and stopped watching after a few episodes. And yet somehow I kept pushing myself to watch this, because, similar to Rifle Is Beautiful, this is made by a renowned...studio that I do so love, and by a team whose previous work I did enjoy immensely (being Wataten). Which made this whole endeavor extra disappointing.The series does begin with a pretty good first impression, with the soothing yet slightly ethereal main theme playing in the background in Mira and Ao's flashbacks punctuating the mood and atmosphere brilliantly. Having read the manga and having been thoroughly unimpressed with how boring the source material was, I was initially pleasantly surprised at the change in tone and direction when it comes to portraying scenes from the manga. Everything has been given a more dramatic tone to it and the jokes were noticeably muted (the original jokes weren't funny anyway so nothing of value was lost).However, you can really only go so far with good animation and a decent soundtrack. The plot and character interactions are just incredibly boring. Ostensibly it's a show about Mira and Ao wanting to find an asteroid with a budding romance promised in the title. While they do sort of go about addressing the main arc throughout the series, the writing simply isn't good enough to hook the viewer into caring about the two. I'll be honest, my favourite characters have been Sakura-sempai and DUCE (now running a newspaper club) because they have been the funniest and are at least dispensing jokes and making the show feel somewhat alive. The show even wasted the initial premise of Mira thinking Ao used to be a boy in their first encounter, never to be brought up again except in very rare one-off moments that don't lead anywhere. The geology vs astronomy club rivalry thing does get brought up sparingly, but it not getting developed further again squandered any potential it might have had.It's a lot of wasted potential and I've spent most of my time just admiring some of the direction choices and editing in this instead of focusing on the actual character drama or moment-to-moment setpieces offered by the show. Ultimately, it's just a mediocre show with some nice moments here and there. As with Rifle is Beautiful, it's a textbook CGDCT show that offers nothing special and brings nothing new to the table beyond being themed slightly differently from the many other CGDCT shows based off of Kirara.5/10 studio that I do so love, and by a team whose previous work I did enjoy immensely (being Wataten).

I wouldn't go so far as to say I went in with high expectations, because I didn't. However, I still expected... something. Anything at all.

They don't have too much personality outside of regular tropes you can see from any other...show. Meaning, they don't offer anything creative or new here. They also just dump random characters in, for whatever reason, making it even harder to care about the original group they offered in the first place.The show has a slow pace and is packed to the brim with information. Which is fine and good, but when there's little else going on with the story, it becomes redundant and uninteresting, unfortunately.

The passion element and aesthetics are what stand out the most in Koisuru Asteroid. So unless you're into anime about passions, and unless you care much about immersion from aesthetics, you'll find it pretty boring since the story is rather slow and the characters aren't loveable by their traits alone. But if you do, you'll enjoy it very much.TL;DR:Koisuru Asteroid isn't a slice of life anime that will make you laugh so hard as other CGDCT anime do. It never intends to be. However, Koisuru...Asteroid is an anime that will make you fall in love with each character's passion, and dream.Koisuru Asteroid is a relatively slow-paced slice of life anime with characters that may look generic and boring at first sight. As the story progresses, we slowly learn about their dreams and get deeply attached to their passions. Unlike most CDGCT anime where we normally quickly fall in love with cute girls for doing cute funny things, in Koisuru Asteroid, we fall in love with the girls not merely for their characteristics or traits, but for their passions and continuing journeys.Aesthetics of Koisuru Asteroid is also something that has to be mentioned. The nature of this anime isn't to give you excitement, but to immerse you with the beauty of the girls' dreams and discoveries. And to do that, the creators of Koisuru Asteroid give you an excellent vibe using calm colour tones, relaxing art style, sceneries, and beautiful music.Koisuru Asteroid isn't an anime that you'd expect from an ordinary slice of life anime.

A spoiler, hehe.I'm going to start off by saying this is not the best series I have watched during this season, to be fair it's actually the lowest-scoring one out the 5 I've watched, but I must say it's the most consistent and it even surprised me a tee bit. While this show does not have the most incredible scores, I did enjoy my watch the whole way through. To sum the...whole show in a sentence, it probably be that it does not impress but yet does not disappoint. Truth be told there was not much to disappoint anyway hence the show's consistency and it's slight improvements. So if you had not known it's about a group of girls, more especially two girls, dreams of discovering an asteroid. The show takes this simple concept and just does a decent job of making the show a Slice of Life one while still keeping to the main point. All the characters and story I must say is very mediocre, as in both category is just following the 'Slice of Life' formula of a show with cute characters and just some funny moments here and there, but most importantly just making everything easy-going.I can't lie, while I saw all of these while watching, I did enjoy my time watching despite me knowing that it's mediocre. I guess the most important thing is that the show just manages to keep its pace very consistent, introducing new characters when times are getting kind of uninteresting and coming up with wholesome activities the girls just enjoy doing. What impressed me the most was the show's sudden progression towards the 'discovering an asteroid' goal, for a while, all the episodes didn't really hint to how the girls are going to pull it off. But by episode 9-ish or maybe 10, everything sort of clicked and there was a clear path to how the girls can reach their goals. While some scenarios are kind of bizarre and kinda unrealistic, the show still does quite an impressive job of making everything easy-going and not be too serious on things. I guess in this case, while other shows can learn from this series not to be too serious at times, this show is somewhat too easy-going. But I still didn't mind.While I might be slightly too generous to give this show a 6, factors like other shows disappointing me might have just made me enjoy this watch more as, once again, this show is just so easy-going and just enjoyable to watch overall. It might not be innovative or in any way super genre-defining, it's just a fine watch altogether.-SCORES-Character- 6/10: Can't say much as to that they are all cutesy and just your typical Slice of Life kind of girls, just without any forms of drama. The teacher, Endou, is the best, in my opinion, she's just a mood and it's kinda nice to watch.Art- 6/10: Pretty when pretty, alright when alright, fine when fine. Their faces aren't fucked which is a good thing, generally, the show just did a good job of maintaining the quality throughout. It kinda scared me when there was a refresher episode but it was fine either way. One thing I'll complain of is their hair, there is this shine to everyone's hair and it just makes it seems like all their head is covered with slime or rubber.Writing- 5/10: Super meh, but I did like it when they did not just get their goal easily. Kinda makes it more realistic for them to fail which that I like.Sound- 5/10: Intro's meh and outro's meh as well, OST just there to give atmosphere. But still pretty meh overall.Overall, while in some areas it's bare and plain, I must say I enjoyed it more than I would have expected.

This review contains spoilers.When I came to know of this series, I was expecting something decent, given that studio Doga Kobo’s previous production included Monthly Girl’s Nozaki Kun and Himouto Umaru Chan. I even would have accepted if this series was generic as frankly in my opinion, those who are into CGDCT expects a certain degree of genericity.However, I can’t quite seems to define Koisuru Asteriod. Is it generic? Is it decent? Is it bad? let me explain.There are other CGDCT series such as Yuru Camp which introduce viewers to camping. That was a great...series (one of my favourites actually) as it stuck to the theme of camping throughout.Now let’s talk about Koisuru Asteriod. This series is about two childhood friends who join their high school’s astronomy club (albeit the club merging with the geology club). At first I was expecting a CGDCT series about astronomy as that is the title, however although there is introduction to astronomy, there are a few other different themes that were included. There is geology (I could accept as the plot dictates that they merge with the geology club), however there was also topography of maps, meteorology and bakery (what has bakery have in common with the rest?!!).They should have stuck to solely astronomy or change the title to Koisuru Earth Science club.The next thing that caught my attention is that this series feels like it has run out of story to tell but wanted to have a complete 12 episode season.The reason I felt this way is that I would have been fine if they ended the series at episode 9 whereby it was decided that Ao would be staying with Mira’s family, add scenes of them discovering a new asteroid while at Mira’s house during the end credits. In a way, the series could come to a nice conclusion.Instead, they decided to introduce new characters in episode 10 (new club members) and episode 11 and 12 (Shining Star contest).There is no time for character building or allowing the viewers to get invested in the new characters, instead it feels like they included the shining Star contest arc as a means to have more cute girls introduced into the series.I felt that instead of have the shining Star contest arc, they should have focus on further character building of the existing casts for the last three episodes to the series. They could also have done an event where the whole club can participate, I am not into astronomy but I can think of events like an eclipse perhaps or Metroid shower. However instead we got an arc whereby the two MC got to meet pointless new friends, ignoring the potential of further bonding with their fellow new club member.My verdict is that astronomy is so boring that there is not much interesting material to use for in a 12 series episode, hence the use of the other themes.If it would have ended at episode 9, I would have give it a 7/10.For the whole 12 episode series, 4/10.Yes, they made astronomy boring. series (one of my favourites actually) as it stuck to the theme of camping throughout.Now let’s talk about Koisuru Asteriod.

No the Earth Sciences club is kinda unique, in which there are two factions that works in tandem with one another (what with this club focused on Earth and Space), the Astronomy section that consists of the ditzy Ao Manaka voiced by Megumi Yamaguchi and the stoic shy Mira Kinohata voiced by Tomoyo Takayanagi wanting to find a name an asteroid after finding out that Mira finds out that Ao was the forgotten friend Mira encountered and...promising that she\'ll name an asteroid after Ao. The Gelogoical section consists of tsundere Mikage Sakurai voiced by Nao Touyama and shy helpful Mai Inose voiced by Maria Sashide, where Mikage just loves geology but looking for a reason to continue her passion while Mai likes Mikage and follows her every step of the way. Of course there is Yuki Endouv voiced by Lynn the advisor of the club and has ties to Earth Sciences on way or another giving the club chances and experiences for them that Yuki wasn\'t able to as well as Mari Morino voiced by Sumire Uesaka the president of the astronomy club and wanting to be an astronaut and finally the supporter of the entire club and friend of Mira, Moe Suzuya voiced by Reina Ueda a camera yuri fiend and slightly clingy to Mira because they are best friends before Mira joined the Earth Sciences club.Due to the nature of looking and moving to the future with these characters and the developments that happens with the majority of the core cast we also get two new characters latter down the line in the form of Chikage voiced by Konomi Kohara and Yuu Nanami voiced by Sumire Morohoshi and like it\'s core cast have interests in  earth sciences or astronomy.  These two new characters are a welcome change as they sub in characters latter down the line and they fit in well (as well as new interactions with the reformed new core cast).Koisuru Asteroid\'s strengths lies in the core cast wanting to achieve their dreams along with the character interactions working for the anime both plot-wise and comedy wise. LA does say this as Koisuru Asteroid at the start was just wandering around with it\'s plot but it\'s not until ONE episode where the majority of the character\'s dreams are brought into focus was when LA became invested in them, from Mikage trying to find a reason, to Mari wanting to be an astronaut to Mira and Ao wanting to name an asteroid. Koisuru Asteroid though being a slice of life comedy anime, is pretty focused on it\'s characters and developing them.The animation done by Doga Kobo was pretty moe, expected from a Manga Time Kirara anime adaptation, from the beautiful backgrounds to the typically moe character designs of the core cast. Now this might of just been LA, but LA for some reason sometimes confused Mari with Moe at times, just LA?. Nonetheless Koisuru Asteroid\'s animation was expectedly moe...expected from Manga Time Kirara.The voice cast was pretty moe as well and yes...LA liked Nao Touyama who voiced Mikage and once again, Nao Touyama was ONE of the reasons why LA watched Koisuru Asteroid. Nao Touyama this time did her tsundere cadence and she was more deredere than tsun, so nice job Nao Touyama!. Other than her, Megumi Yamaguchi and Tomoyo Takayanagi and Maria Sashide as Ao, Mira and Mai all did pretty well as well as Sumire Uesaka and Reina Ueda as Mari and Moe also did well in their moe sometimes genki cadences. Moe cast, from a moe anime, what else?Koisuru Asteroid from what LA can say reminds LA of Comic Girls, just change the subject matter from mangaka\'s to earth sciences and astronomy. BUT the bigger reason why LA makes the comparison is as much of a slice of life comedy anime centered around certain subject matters is that ""big"" changes to the core cast and again ""looking to the future"" which it STILL makes it a calming fun slice of life anime and informative in certain subject matter BUT in the character development department, makes the characters someone you want to root for and in Koisuru Asteroid, one step forward to their goals and ALL of these characters have goals they want to achieve.

Minor spoilers.6 - I liked it. Didn\'t regret watching, but probably wouldn\'t watch a 2nd time if nostalgia bias didn\'t exist. Probably had a good message or a guilty pleasure.This anime is your run-of-the-mill CGDCD type of anime, but this group of friends is legitimately genuine. I believe that makes this stand out. They look generic, and are color coded by their hair. I really couldn\'t tell them apart since I didn\'t pay attention...that much to names, and what not. However, what stood out to me is the fact that they all have something they\'re reaching for. Even though they are members of the Earth Science Club which is a mixture of geology and astronomy (with meteorology in the end) they all have different goals.What is nice is that they all support these different goals. What is nice is that these students seem mature, thoughtful, and kind. They solve problems with ease, such as in episode 8 when Ao has her big problem of the story. The issue was pretty big, but resolved in a matter of minutes as as the students figured out out Ao can fight for her future.This anime does give you a feel good vibe. It makes you feel good about yourself, and it delivers a good message which is always welcomed. Sure, in the middle of the season it feels like random events are happening over the course of the school year, but it is still nice to see these students go through life as they try to figure stuff out. As they do things they love to do with friends that will support them.I\'m not completely sure who is actually a part of the club since this anime introduces so many characters in rapid succession, but each character is nice. There was a particular scene that made me laugh with one character picking up Ao and running away with her to elope. It was funny and kind hearted. I don\'t think I\'ll ever watch this again. The last episode was definitely nice, and the last scene had a sorta quick recap of the events of the show.But what it did do was make me want to buy books on astronomy and geology. Even maybe meteorology just because I feel about for the meteorology girl and what happened to her aunt. It also made me wish I had a group of friends like them. Made me wish I was more social. It\'s a fine anime. Low tier six. I hope Ao and Mira accomplish their dream of finding an asteroid.""Everyone has their own things they love and their own special talents,their own unique world.If you\'re all by yourself, you only have your own world,but when it connects to others,the possibilities spread out endlessly before you.Just like the vast, unknowncosmos.""-Mira that much to names, and what not.

I’ve developed a good few interests over the years, various hobbies that I enjoy spending my time with. One of which, I’m doing right now. I think they’re a very important part of life, and I’m sure most of you would agree with that. A lucky few may even turn these passions into careers or turn them into something more viable in their everyday life, but for many, that won’t happen. However, they are still incredibly rewarding experiences and life would certainly be far worse without them. I was never a very passionate person when...I was younger. I didn’t have all that much I liked. I was stuck in my own incredibly small world and never tried to get out of it, partly because I didn’t know how but I also just didn’t want to. I pretty much liked video games and that was it. The only thing that really got me through. And for a long time, I was ok with that world. The problem is, and this is something I wish I could tell my younger self, is that that world is small. It’s a shallow, tiny, unimaginative world, and that I shouldn’t have confined myself to it. I should have tried to branch out into the rest of the immeasurably huge world there is. I would have told myself about all the amazing things that my idiotic self was missing out on. Eventually, my thick skull understood, I started to experience various different hobbies, and soon the small world I knew seemed to be just that, “small.” I remember when I first read a book, like an actual novel, and liked it. I appreciated what it was. I understood it. It made me discover this whole new world that I never knew existed. It was eye-opening. And as a byproduct of that love for literature, I now have a passion for writing. Something, believe me, I never thought I’d have. I was about the farthest thing from a writer in my mind, but when I stopped to really think about it, it kind of started to make sense to me. My point is, these various passions you can discover in life can not only be fun or rewarding, but they can also broaden your horizons, they can change the way you think. I bring this up because I have a recent passion I’ve found in the past year, and I honestly can’t believe it took me this long to realize it, because the objects of that passion I see, quite literally, every single day...or night, I suppose. I have a newfound appreciation for stargazing and really the universe we live in altogether. I never really looked up, or at least I don’t feel like I ever did. When I looked up earlier this year and spotted Orion, it was like I actually saw something up there. It was no longer just nothingness like I assumed. Something that used to look so empty to me suddenly lit up with life. I no longer saw glowing dots, I saw Taurus, Auriga, Canis Major, I even saw a shooting star! I didn’t see dots, I saw life made up by those dots. I then started to read up on some of them. Now when I look up, I see animals, heroes, gods, and monsters, stories about those characters, various epic legends about them. I went from seeing an empty sky, to a beautiful sea of stars, stars that built constellations, that bring epic stories to life. I saw life up there, and from that, I understood how incredibly small I really am. Most clear nights, if I can, I go outside for about 40 minutes, weather a storm of bugs, grab a chair, and kick back under the stars. I just stare up at them mindlessly and I feel content. I understand how small this world really is and it makes me feel at peace like nothing can bother me. I don’t have a care in the world (or any other!), even if something is bothering me that day. It erases everything. It’s almost like a reset. It is the most relaxing experience I have ever had in my life and it has been right above me the entire time. It was like my eyes were truly open for the very first time to the wonders of the universe that we are in. If you never have, please just go out one night and look, really, really look. I know not everyone will have the same experience I did, but I know some will, and for them, it will make a world of difference.“I don’t care about some space rocks?” I hear you, very angry random person, saying. Why do I give you my life story? Well, because that’s how I make it personal and all. Ahem! Besides that, you like anime, don’t you? Why are you reading this if you aren’t? Maybe you’re the real space cadet here, not me. Asteroid in Love was a 2017 slice of life, comedy, romance(?) yonkoma series (four-panel manga) written by Quro, which as of now is their only work. As time went on the various shorts were compiled into three separate volumes, before, in 2020, an anime was made. It was produced by Doga Kobo, known for YuriYuri, Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-Kun, Plastic Memories, Himouto! Umaru-chan, and various other moe and non-moe series you’ve likely heard of. They even did 11 Eyes, apparently. That was a trip. It also had a really stupid name. It was directed by Daisuke Hiramaki, who has worked on various anime in regards to animation and even directed an episode here or there, but this is the first time being a director for the entirety of an anime. Before we get started, I wanted to bring up my brief history with Asteroid in Love, because I do have one. I had actually started watching Asteroid in Love earlier this year when it aired, but at the start of the third episode, I dropped it. Why? I’ll talk about that later. Still, I wouldn’t have done that now. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day? I think I just had a lot of current anime I was watching at the time and I needed an excuse to drop something. I absolutely hate doing that. I’d rather suffer through something just so I can put it on my watched list.  I mean, that’s why I watched Girlfriend Beta. If you enjoyed that series, more power to you, I wish I did the same. I wanted to drop it immediately. Anyway, expect more of my dropped series to show up in the future. They’re worth checking out. Sometimes your opinions may even change. Will this be one of them? Who knows? I sure do.One night on a crowded group camping trip, ditzy, cheerful young Mira sees a boy sneaking off into the forest alone. Curious, Mira follows only to find out the boy’s name is Ao and learns he left the campsite to get away from all the noise and enjoy the stars. Not knowing much about the universe, Mira starts asking question upon question, all of which Ao answers with ease. An already astonished Mira is even more amazed when she learns of a star named after her. This makes Mira wonder: “Ao, is there a star with your name?” Disappointed to hear that’s not the case, Mira wants to name a star after him. Ao says that’s nearly impossible, the only real possibility would be to name, not a star, but an asteroid instead, although the chances are slim to none, especially for such young children. But if there’s one thing Mira’s good at, it’s not thinking, it’s taking action. “We’ll discover a new asteroid together and name it Ao.” And after that night, Mira never ran into Ao again. Since then, Mira has always had a fascination with stars, and during her first year of high school, she decided to act on it and join the astronomy club. Unfortunately, that club is gone. But all hope isn’t lost. It merged with the geology club, to become the “Earth Sciences club.” Neither club wanted to do this, causing some friction between the club’s members. Regardless, Mira joins only to find out that Ao is a member as well. Finally reunited, the two are resolved to fulfill their dream of discovering an asteroid, and take part in various astronomy and geology activities along the way.Asteroid in Love is a slice of life anime with an almost all-girl cast, bar a few characters, many of them old men for some inexplicable reason. This should be enough for you to guess how the plot plays out. It’s the characters just living their lives, occasionally with astronomy or geology involved in it. Originally, why I dropped Asteroid in Love was because I thought it was all over the place, storywise. I thought it had no focus and was like most other slice of life anime I’ve seen, which isn’t my favorite genre, to begin with. I don’t entirely agree with that anymore, but much of what I thought before is true. The plot is absolutely everywhere. I mean, in one episode, we get a resolution to a pretty major cliffhanger from the previous episode, we fast forward to two characters graduating, there’s a fight between Mira and Ao, and that fight gets resolved all in 20 minutes. Other episodes it looks like one thing will be the main focus, just to have it fast forward to a Christmas party, next Mira’s in her second year. It’s fast-paced, which I actually quite like, but it’s unfocused. Another big reason I dropped it before was that I thought I was lied to. As of episode 3, I didn’t feel like it was about the stars at all. I mean, we were having a barbecue and looking at rocks. Next Mira’s in a maid outfit working at a bakery, like what? I feel like the main point isn’t about astronomy. It’s not about geology really either. It’s more a combination of both, like the club, but that’s not quite it either. The plot is more about hobbies in general and how by sharing those hobbies with others, you may be able to find new interests yourself or maybe even discover something new about your own hobby. The characters gain interest in other things as a result of the Earth Sciences club. Mira learns about various aspects of the earth and how things are formed and even takes interest in their clubmate Inose’s love of cartography. It’s unrelated to astronomy and somewhat distant from geology, yet the character can take interest in it all the same. Sakurai, the vice president of the Earth Sciences club and ex-president of the geology club even starts to take an interest in the stars and even learns some planets and constellations by the end of the series. A character who would sooner marry a rock than a human if it were legal, begins to broaden her horizons and gain new friends as a result. This is something you would expect from an anime about asteroids and space in general. One issue is, however, that’s only a portion of what it’s actually about. It’s more, I’d say, 40% astronomy, 40% geology, and 20% other hobbies. None of this is a problem, but it makes the title a bit misleading. I quite like the whole geology versus astronomy thing going on. I think it’s clever, considering an asteroid is somewhat of common ground between the two fields, and how the characters realize the only real difference between them is one looks down to find knowledge and the other looks up. It’s cute, I like it. My problem was that I didn’t expect that going into it. But even with the knowledge that it’s less about astronomy, but more astronomy along with geology, it makes the other stuff seem more jarring. This anime likes to be educational, which I love. The best way to learn is when it’s easy to digest and interesting to the person learning it. Sneaking information about various subjects into something the learner is already interested in, I think, is a pretty good way to teach. However, it starts to feel like too much when it feels the need to stop and explain to me the various types of hot springs, or how riptides in water works. “Teacher, is this going to be on the test?” It feels a bit like that at times. It’s not a problem, per se, but it’s a little too much when it’s unrelated from the main topics of the series. That’s why I say it's less so about astronomy and geology, and more about sharing your hobbies in general. It’s the main lesson, I guess you could say, of the anime. It’s about how two seemingly unrelated things can share similarities with each other. How you might not think your passion shares anything with this other person’s passion, but when you stop and discuss them, you realize you were wrong. It’s how anyone can find common ground with each other if they just try. I like the message a lot, but it’s not what I think people will expect. If you are like me and hear it’s about two people trying to find an asteroid, you’d expect a bit more of the “finding an asteroid part.” Not just the last episode and a half centering around it. You’d expect a bit more learning about constellations and such, and less how to make Valentine chocolate, or obligatory beach episodes. The best way to describe it is what I said before, it’s all over the place. It bounces from plot point to plot point like a yo-yo gone rogue, and the things it does focus on are often lacking. I would rather have an episode about searching for different stones in a cave or something, rather than one where the cast explores a geology museum. Maybe an episode about artificial satellites, and not one about seeing one in a museum. There are one or two episodes that honestly feels like the creators just got back from a vacation, sat at a table, and were like:“That was fun, guys, but you know what it needed?”“What?”“Anime.”“I agree completely.”“But we all need to be anime girls--”“--You needn’t say another word.”That’s what you focus on? I know slice of life is often just about character’s often boring day to day lives, which is my main problem with them but watching the characters go to two separate museums? Is that interesting to watch? Sure there’s some good humor, which Asteroid in Love has a good bit of, but it can hardly save an animated field trip. However, I can’t hold it entirely against the anime because some of the reasons it’s the way it is, I'm sure, is from the source material. I don’t know how to-the-panel the anime follows it, but I imagine it’s difficult to make a complex, coherent plot out of a bunch of random gag stories in a four-panel manga. I’m sure the manga follows some kind of plot progression, but I imagine it’s still quite hard to tie those into anime. Still, this doesn’t take away from the fact that it often feels like a jumbled mess. A fairly entertaining mess, what with its comedy, but a mess nonetheless.I give Asteroid in Love a lot of credit for, on paper, having a concept I don’t see depicted in anime all that much. Sadly, I was disappointed when the series didn’t follow through with its full potential. However, one area I was pleasantly surprised, even if they were lacking at times, were the characters. Unfortunately, though, they fall into generic tropes: Mira; the ditz; Sakura; the tsundere; Monroe; the big sister type; Ao; the quiet, intelligent one, etc. The characters themselves, for the most part, don’t go too far outside their respective tropes, but they do grow as the series goes on. Whether it’s Sakurai finally gaining interest in other hobbies besides geology and learning to appreciate her friends more. Or Morino who, despite the difficulties, follows her dream of becoming an astronaut. They all learn a thing or two by the end. My favorite of the characters and this was a giant surprise to me, was Mira, I think she’s a great main character and by far the deepest. She comes off as literally one of the dumber creatures on planet Earth at first, but you realize as the series progresses that she isn’t. She’s not dumb, barely even an airhead, she’s more than that. An airhead wouldn’t be able to give a perfect, intricate, well-thought-out gift to her friend after being confided in. An airhead wouldn’t get upset with themselves and reflect on their inconsiderate actions to become a better friend. She’s a surprisingly mature character. Her cheerful personality is just that, her personality. Yes, she’s a ditz, but that doesn’t define her. Even at the ending of the show, though it may not be what you’d expect, both Mira and Ao show their maturity. They’ve grown a lot over the year and odd months, or so, the series takes place across. That goes for all the characters really but is most prominent with Mira. If you’re anything like me, she’ll surprise you. But that’s probably the only way the characters will surprise you. Because regardless of some of the conflicts in the story, if you have seen more or less any slice of life anime about a group of (often girl) friends hanging out with each other, you know what you’re getting into. Even though they grow, when they aren’t going through many struggles, you’ve likely seen about a thousand characters like them. I know Asteroid in Love is only 12 episodes long, and a very odd 6.5 recap episode, but I believe the time could have been used better. First of all, make the conflicts in the story last longer. I mentioned it earlier, but there is a big conflict in the story that threatens the character’s very lives together, something that dares to rip them apart, something that is hinted at for two episodes, is resolved in a whole 4 minutes. The characters get together the previous episode, make a plan, then put that plan into action, which takes no time at all. The tension builds, and builds, and builds, making you think a rainstorm of emotions and struggles are coming, only to see it result in a pitiful raindrop. Give the character’s more time to grow, and less time watching them frolic in a museum. I want more of Mira struggling with her own personality, maybe the other characters as well. But I understand that super deep characters are not always the goal of a series. Asteroid in Love sets out to have cute and funny characters that make the audience laugh, and I’d say they serve that purpose quite well. The chemistry between all the characters makes for many good laughs. One of my favorite being when Ao tries to explain to this child about our solar system, only to overwhelm the poor girl to tears, and have Mira step in and act like a buffoon to cheer her up. The characters overall work for the purpose they were made for. Sometimes that's all you really need. And again, coming from a yonkoma, I believe they were made fairly deep for the anime adaptation.I’ve only watched four series produced by Doga Kobo, Asteroid in Love being one with GJ Club, Nozaki-Kun, and 11Eyes being the other three. From what I’ve seen in both Nozaki-Kun and GJ Club, I’m quite happy with the artwork we’re normally given by them. And for a lot of the other series they’ve made, I continue to think that. Asteroid in Love is, thankfully, no different. I adore the art, it’s right up my alley. Whenever I think about my favorite art style in anime, my mind immediately goes to Chuunibyou. It has such an inviting art style. The animation itself is downright gorgeous and the art is soft and bubbly. The colors are beautifully vivid and it’s just a pleasure to look at. Your eyeballs should be thankful to be graced with its existence. I don’t get the exact same feeling, but I get a similar one when I see the art in Asteroid in Love. I like it for many of the same reasons I love Chuunibyou, with the exception that it isn’t quite as good, nor is the animation as fluid. However, I was so drawn to it, and it stood out enough in my mind, that the art was one of the reasons I even watched Asteroid in Love in the first place. And during my time watching the series, I wasn’t disappointed. It’s unique in my mind. In a world where a lot of anime being produced looks pretty samey, seeing one look like this is welcomed. I was also happy that, from what I could tell, they got their starry skies looking accurate. It was fun to see one of the characters look up, contemplating something, and I go: “I know what that is.” It’s to be expected that an anime about space to be accurate with, well, space, but It’s still nice to see. It feels like there was actual care put into the subject matter. A level of care that isn’t always taken. I don’t have very much to say in regards to the music. It’s fine. The opening and ending are both pretty nice. I prefer the latter, I think it’s really good. They’re both pretty cheerful along with the animation, as one would expect for a series like this. There’s a nice tune here and there that may make you tap your foot or give the occasional head bob, but overall pretty standard. I will say one thing I did quite like though. As the episode is about to end, the ending theme will kick up while the characters are talking and often transition to the actual ending animation really smoothly. It’s nothing too special, but it gives the show some identity and even gets me a little excited to watch the next one. At least more than the ending just popping on to tell me the episode is over and being done with it. It puts a little more emphasis, not only on the ending of the episode but what will happen at the start of the next one. It hits me in a weird spot where I want to praise it. I think I just have a thing for smooth transitions in scenes. If only I could be that smooth in my transitions! Curse you, Asteroid in Love. Teach me your secrets!Now I know the question you, still probably anger reader, are thinking: did my opinion change? Sure. It changed in the way that I dropped it three episodes into it before from a lack of enjoyment to watching all twelve episodes, writing about it, and having fairly positive thoughts walking away. So, yes, in that way, they did change. However, 9 months ago me got some things right. Is Asteroid in Love a series about space or even asteroids? Uh-uh. Not really. Sure the main characters have a dream that they follow, but that dream is more a plot device for the antics in the show than anything else. Every now and then there will actually be scenes focused on gazing at the stars or about space, and when there are, the series is easily at it’s best. There’s no competition. My favorite scenes in the series are in episode 7 where the Earth Science club hosts an event to get children interesting in space. There’s even this one little girl who acts like a brat, but they eventually help. It’s cute. Not only is it about space, we learn various interesting facts on that front, we still see the characters all interacting with each other in their normal comedic ways. We get an episode about stars and space, where nothing suffers because of it. If the entire series was similar to that, it would have been out of this world, pun fully intended. But unfortunately, priorities are a thing and people have different ones. I don’t dislike what we got at all, but I am disappointed in what it could have been. It has a goofy, lovable cast, that used in a more focused story, would have complimented each other very well. There was a chance to make something truly unique here, but instead, we got a fairly good slice of life series that ends up being similar to many others. *cough* At least I enjoyed this one though *cough* As always this was just my opinion and isn’t any more or less valid than yours or that angry guy from earlier. As is my one about most slice of life series. Am I a little hard on them? Probably. I do believe they serve a purpose. It's nice to watch them in between other stuff, for example. Hey, Toradora! is one of my favorite stories ever, so maybe I’m just a hypocrite. Who knows? That I don’t know.  If you have a problem with that -- the opinion part, not the hypocrisy thing, nobody likes them --  then I will get Ao to force you to tears with knowledge as well! Knowledge is power and power is scary, and I don’t know about you but scary things make me cry. I highly recommend that you don’t listen to this crybaby space cadet and watch the series for yourself and form your own opinions, not form your own opioids, despite what my autocorrect may be trying to tell you. I hear forming lots of them makes you cry less. So maybe form them in moderation, a few tears don’t hurt every once in a while. It’s healthy for you.Thank you very much for reading ~I wanted to mention something kind of neat at the end here. My interest in stargazing is because of Asteroid in Love, at least in part. I wanted to learn about space and the stars, as I never took an interest in it when I was younger. I found Asteroid in Love and thought: “Wow! I can watch this cute series and learn!” And then I got angry from the lack of actual knowledge and went outside one morning and decided I was going to learn from the source. Yeah, that’s how it happened. My oddly quick temper at the time is what gave me this new interest. So, thank you for making me mad Asteroid in Love, I’m glad I gave you a second chance after all.Happy stargazing! And remember kids, stay off drugs, they’re bad for you. I’ll have to have a word with Google Docs about the radical propaganda it’s trying to make me promote.I’ll see you next month, likely with less drug paraphernalia. I was younger. I didn’t have all that much I liked. I was stuck in my own incredibly small world and never tried to get out of it, partly because I didn’t know how but I also just didn’t want to. I pretty much liked video games and that was it. The only thing that really got me through. And for a long time, I was ok with that world. The problem is, and this is something I wish I could tell my younger self, is that that world is small. It’s a shallow, tiny, unimaginative world, and that I shouldn’t have confined myself to it. I should have tried to branch out into the rest of the immeasurably huge world there is. I would have told myself about all the amazing things that my idiotic self was missing out on. Eventually, my thick skull understood, I started to experience various different hobbies, and soon the small world I knew seemed to be just that, “small.” I remember when I first read a book, like an actual novel, and liked it. I appreciated what it was. I understood it. It made me discover this whole new world that I never knew existed. It was eye-opening. And as a byproduct of that love for literature, I now have a passion for writing. Something, believe me, I never thought I’d have. I was about the farthest thing from a writer in my mind, but when I stopped to really think about it, it kind of started to make sense to me. My point is, these various passions you can discover in life can not only be fun or rewarding, but they can also broaden your horizons, they can change the way you think. I bring this up because I have a recent passion I’ve found in the past year, and I honestly can’t believe it took me this long to realize it, because the objects of that passion I see, quite literally, every single day...or night, I suppose. I have a newfound appreciation for stargazing and really the universe we live in altogether. I never really looked up, or at least I don’t feel like I ever did. When I looked up earlier this year and spotted Orion, it was like I actually saw something up there. It was no longer just nothingness like I assumed. Something that used to look so empty to me suddenly lit up with life. I no longer saw glowing dots, I saw Taurus, Auriga, Canis Major, I even saw a shooting star! I didn’t see dots, I saw life made up by those dots. I then started to read up on some of them. Now when I look up, I see animals, heroes, gods, and monsters, stories about those characters, various epic legends about them. I went from seeing an empty sky, to a beautiful sea of stars, stars that built constellations, that bring epic stories to life. I saw life up there, and from that, I understood how incredibly small I really am. Most clear nights, if I can, I go outside for about 40 minutes, weather a storm of bugs, grab a chair, and kick back under the stars. I just stare up at them mindlessly and I feel content. I understand how small this world really is and it makes me feel at peace like nothing can bother me. I don’t have a care in the world (or any other!), even if something is bothering me that day. It erases everything. It’s almost like a reset. It is the most relaxing experience I have ever had in my life and it has been right above me the entire time. It was like my eyes were truly open for the very first time to the wonders of the universe that we are in. If you never have, please just go out one night and look, really, really look. I know not everyone will have the same experience I did, but I know some will, and for them, it will make a world of difference.“I don’t care about some space rocks?” I hear you, very angry random person, saying. Why do I give you my life story? Well, because that’s how I make it personal and all. Ahem! Besides that, you like anime, don’t you? Why are you reading this if you aren’t? Maybe you’re the real space cadet here, not me. Asteroid in Love was a 2017 slice of life, comedy, romance(?) yonkoma series (four-panel manga) written by Quro, which as of now is their only work. As time went on the various shorts were compiled into three separate volumes, before, in 2020, an anime was made. It was produced by Doga Kobo, known for YuriYuri, Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-Kun, Plastic Memories, Himouto! Umaru-chan, and various other moe and non-moe series you’ve likely heard of. They even did 11 Eyes, apparently. That was a trip. It also had a really stupid name. It was directed by Daisuke Hiramaki, who has worked on various anime in regards to animation and even directed an episode here or there, but this is the first time being a director for the entirety of an anime. Before we get started, I wanted to bring up my brief history with Asteroid in Love, because I do have one. I had actually started watching Asteroid in Love earlier this year when it aired, but at the start of the third episode, I dropped it. Why? I’ll talk about that later. Still, I wouldn’t have done that now. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day? I think I just had a lot of current anime I was watching at the time and I needed an excuse to drop something. I absolutely hate doing that. I’d rather suffer through something just so I can put it on my watched list.  I mean, that’s why I watched Girlfriend Beta. If you enjoyed that series, more power to you, I wish I did the same. I wanted to drop it immediately. Anyway, expect more of my dropped series to show up in the future. They’re worth checking out. Sometimes your opinions may even change. Will this be one of them? Who knows? I sure do.One night on a crowded group camping trip, ditzy, cheerful young Mira sees a boy sneaking off into the forest alone. Curious, Mira follows only to find out the boy’s name is Ao and learns he left the campsite to get away from all the noise and enjoy the stars. Not knowing much about the universe, Mira starts asking question upon question, all of which Ao answers with ease. An already astonished Mira is even more amazed when she learns of a star named after her. This makes Mira wonder: “Ao, is there a star with your name?” Disappointed to hear that’s not the case, Mira wants to name a star after him. Ao says that’s nearly impossible, the only real possibility would be to name, not a star, but an asteroid instead, although the chances are slim to none, especially for such young children. But if there’s one thing Mira’s good at, it’s not thinking, it’s taking action. “We’ll discover a new asteroid together and name it Ao.” And after that night, Mira never ran into Ao again. Since then, Mira has always had a fascination with stars, and during her first year of high school, she decided to act on it and join the astronomy club. Unfortunately, that club is gone. But all hope isn’t lost. It merged with the geology club, to become the “Earth Sciences club.” Neither club wanted to do this, causing some friction between the club’s members. Regardless, Mira joins only to find out that Ao is a member as well. Finally reunited, the two are resolved to fulfill their dream of discovering an asteroid, and take part in various astronomy and geology activities along the way.Asteroid in Love is a slice of life anime with an almost all-girl cast, bar a few characters, many of them old men for some inexplicable reason. This should be enough for you to guess how the plot plays out. It’s the characters just living their lives, occasionally with astronomy or geology involved in it. Originally, why I dropped Asteroid in Love was because I thought it was all over the place, storywise. I thought it had no focus and was like most other slice of life anime I’ve seen, which isn’t my favorite genre, to begin with. I don’t entirely agree with that anymore, but much of what I thought before is true. The plot is absolutely everywhere. I mean, in one episode, we get a resolution to a pretty major cliffhanger from the previous episode, we fast forward to two characters graduating, there’s a fight between Mira and Ao, and that fight gets resolved all in 20 minutes. Other episodes it looks like one thing will be the main focus, just to have it fast forward to a Christmas party, next Mira’s in her second year. It’s fast-paced, which I actually quite like, but it’s unfocused. Another big reason I dropped it before was that I thought I was lied to. As of episode 3, I didn’t feel like it was about the stars at all. I mean, we were having a barbecue and looking at rocks. Next Mira’s in a maid outfit working at a bakery, like what? I feel like the main point isn’t about astronomy. It’s not about geology really either. It’s more a combination of both, like the club, but that’s not quite it either. The plot is more about hobbies in general and how by sharing those hobbies with others, you may be able to find new interests yourself or maybe even discover something new about your own hobby. The characters gain interest in other things as a result of the Earth Sciences club. Mira learns about various aspects of the earth and how things are formed and even takes interest in their clubmate Inose’s love of cartography. It’s unrelated to astronomy and somewhat distant from geology, yet the character can take interest in it all the same. Sakurai, the vice president of the Earth Sciences club and ex-president of the geology club even starts to take an interest in the stars and even learns some planets and constellations by the end of the series. A character who would sooner marry a rock than a human if it were legal, begins to broaden her horizons and gain new friends as a result. This is something you would expect from an anime about asteroids and space in general. One issue is, however, that’s only a portion of what it’s actually about. It’s more, I’d say, 40% astronomy, 40% geology, and 20% other hobbies. None of this is a problem, but it makes the title a bit misleading. I quite like the whole geology versus astronomy thing going on. I think it’s clever, considering an asteroid is somewhat of common ground between the two fields, and how the characters realize the only real difference between them is one looks down to find knowledge and the other looks up. It’s cute, I like it. My problem was that I didn’t expect that going into it. But even with the knowledge that it’s less about astronomy, but more astronomy along with geology, it makes the other stuff seem more jarring. This anime likes to be educational, which I love. The best way to learn is when it’s easy to digest and interesting to the person learning it. Sneaking information about various subjects into something the learner is already interested in, I think, is a pretty good way to teach. However, it starts to feel like too much when it feels the need to stop and explain to me the various types of hot springs, or how riptides in water works. “Teacher, is this going to be on the test?” It feels a bit like that at times. It’s not a problem, per se, but it’s a little too much when it’s unrelated from the main topics of the series. That’s why I say it's less so about astronomy and geology, and more about sharing your hobbies in general. It’s the main lesson, I guess you could say, of the anime. It’s about how two seemingly unrelated things can share similarities with each other. How you might not think your passion shares anything with this other person’s passion, but when you stop and discuss them, you realize you were wrong. It’s how anyone can find common ground with each other if they just try. I like the message a lot, but it’s not what I think people will expect. If you are like me and hear it’s about two people trying to find an asteroid, you’d expect a bit more of the “finding an asteroid part.” Not just the last episode and a half centering around it. You’d expect a bit more learning about constellations and such, and less how to make Valentine chocolate, or obligatory beach episodes. The best way to describe it is what I said before, it’s all over the place. It bounces from plot point to plot point like a yo-yo gone rogue, and the things it does focus on are often lacking. I would rather have an episode about searching for different stones in a cave or something, rather than one where the cast explores a geology museum. Maybe an episode about artificial satellites, and not one about seeing one in a museum. There are one or two episodes that honestly feels like the creators just got back from a vacation, sat at a table, and were like:“That was fun, guys, but you know what it needed?”“What?”“Anime.”“I agree completely.”“But we all need to be anime girls--”“--You needn’t say another word.”That’s what you focus on? I know slice of life is often just about character’s often boring day to day lives, which is my main problem with them but watching the characters go to two separate museums? Is that interesting to watch? Sure there’s some good humor, which Asteroid in Love has a good bit of, but it can hardly save an animated field trip. However, I can’t hold it entirely against the anime because some of the reasons it’s the way it is, I'm sure, is from the source material. I don’t know how to-the-panel the anime follows it, but I imagine it’s difficult to make a complex, coherent plot out of a bunch of random gag stories in a four-panel manga. I’m sure the manga follows some kind of plot progression, but I imagine it’s still quite hard to tie those into anime. Still, this doesn’t take away from the fact that it often feels like a jumbled mess. A fairly entertaining mess, what with its comedy, but a mess nonetheless.I give Asteroid in Love a lot of credit for, on paper, having a concept I don’t see depicted in anime all that much. Sadly, I was disappointed when the series didn’t follow through with its full potential. However, one area I was pleasantly surprised, even if they were lacking at times, were the characters. Unfortunately, though, they fall into generic tropes: Mira; the ditz; Sakura; the tsundere; Monroe; the big sister type; Ao; the quiet, intelligent one, etc. The characters themselves, for the most part, don’t go too far outside their respective tropes, but they do grow as the series goes on. Whether it’s Sakurai finally gaining interest in other hobbies besides geology and learning to appreciate her friends more. Or Morino who, despite the difficulties, follows her dream of becoming an astronaut. They all learn a thing or two by the end. My favorite of the characters and this was a giant surprise to me, was Mira, I think she’s a great main character and by far the deepest. She comes off as literally one of the dumber creatures on planet Earth at first, but you realize as the series progresses that she isn’t. She’s not dumb, barely even an airhead, she’s more than that. An airhead wouldn’t be able to give a perfect, intricate, well-thought-out gift to her friend after being confided in. An airhead wouldn’t get upset with themselves and reflect on their inconsiderate actions to become a better friend. She’s a surprisingly mature character. Her cheerful personality is just that, her personality. Yes, she’s a ditz, but that doesn’t define her. Even at the ending of the show, though it may not be what you’d expect, both Mira and Ao show their maturity. They’ve grown a lot over the year and odd months, or so, the series takes place across. That goes for all the characters really but is most prominent with Mira. If you’re anything like me, she’ll surprise you. But that’s probably the only way the characters will surprise you.

I wanted to learn about space and the stars, as I never took an interest in it when I was younger. I found Asteroid in Love and thought: “Wow! I can watch this cute series and learn!” And then I got angry from the lack of actual knowledge and went outside one morning and decided I was going to learn from the source. Yeah, that’s how it happened. My oddly quick temper at the time is what gave me this new interest. So, thank you for making me mad Asteroid in Love, I’m glad I gave you a second chance after all.Happy stargazing! And remember kids, stay off drugs, they’re bad for you. I’ll have to have a word with Google Docs about the radical propaganda it’s trying to make me promote.I’ll see you next month, likely with less drug paraphernalia."", 'Before I start, I\'d like to note that according to my My Anime List account, this is the 375th anime I\'ve watched/completed. Man, time sure does go by fast, doesn\'t it?Shows about cute girls doing cute things have been done to death at this point, with many of them being rather poor in quality and don\'t try to really stand out in any way. But in recent years, some studios have actually been making an effort to put out genuinely good CGDCT shows such as A Place Further Than The Universe, Natsuiro Kiseki, Non Non Biyori, Kemono Friends, and Laid Back Camp. Koisuru Asteroid, or...Asteroid In Love, is another one of the good ones, though it may not seem that way right off. The show itself is about girls in an astronomy/geology club that got merged, and two of them, Mira and Ao, want to discover an asteroid. Most slice of life anime tend to focus on the school antics rather than try to be more ambitious, and while Asteroid does start off rather cliche, seemingly another run-of-the-mill cute girls anime, after episode 4, it actually does start to be really good.For one, the animation is fairly nice. The character designs, while a little stereotypically moe, are decent enough, and the movements are fluid and smooth, without any shortcuts, though I do have to wonder why they made Mira\'s eyes two different colors. I do admit, I really like the eyecatches that show constellations and the various club members being displayed in constellation form. I thought those were really cute and funny. The music is nice as well, though not very memorable. But both the opening and ending theme songs are well sung, easy on the ears, and completely fit the kind of feel the show is going for.But the characters either make or break a show like this, and if the characters stay the same throughout the show, they run the risk of being static, boring, dull, and stale. Thankfully, after episode 4, Asteroid actually tries to flesh them out and have them break away from their established archetypes. Mira\'s actually not a ditz who\'s dumber than a sack of bricks, Ao makes an effort to be less shy and more bold, at one point Inose winds up in a higher position in the club and has to learn how to be a leader, so on and so forth. The status quo actually changes halfway through the series, and the characters are forced to change along with it. The slow pacing helps as well, with the show taking care not to rush its storyline and bring the best out of its characters, especially in the later episodes. Trust me when I say the show gets much better after episode four. That said, not every character was great, as the two newspaper club members were kind of annoying, especially the green haired girl and her annoying high pitched voice.Now, this show isn\'t for everyone, and some people are just plain tired of shows about girls having fun, and that\'s perfectly fine. I personally like several similar shows better than Asteroid that did more with their premises and fleshed out the characters even more (Cases in point, Figure 17 and Place Further Than The Universe). Plus, Suzu\'s ""I\'m gonna obsess over every girl I see for funsies"" antics got old really fast, and one subplot near the end of the series really baffled me in how easily it was resolved. One character is revealed to be moving, and the girls try to find ways to allow her to stay with the club. The solution they come up with manages to make things easy for anyone, but I question whether that sort of thing would actually be able to happen. I mean, I know my parents would never let me do what one of the characters did here just to be able to stay with her friends. Revealing the character in question is a spoiler, so I won\'t, but I wanted to point that out, as I found myself unable to let go of my suspension of disbelief for that particular scenario.So is Koisuru Asteroid one of the best shows ever? Not really. But it\'s a cute little time killer for when you want to kick back and relax. Asteroid In Love, is another one of the good ones, though it may not seem that way right off.

I am a big fan of stars, so to see these two worlds (cute girls and astronomy) connected in one show really snatched my attention.And I was not disappointed.The art style was pretty, the characters were interesting,...the music was perfect (I never skipped the opening which is rare for me), and it seemed so calming and simple... I think any fan of anime with an all female cast should give this a go. the music was perfect (I never skipped the opening which is rare for me), and it seemed so calming and simple...

They only last for one to two minutes a piece, but are quite entertaining! And for you echhi fans out there, they...really put on the fan service with these things. The animation and music, like the series itself, is sharp and well detailed. The scenes they show range from dark and moody, to totally off the wall and wacky, to sweet and sincere.Bottom line: 8/10If your a fan of the Mai-Hime series, (I linked you to the series itself on top of this review) then you should check them out! They are quite short and brief, but do help fill in the grey areas from the show! I would recommend watching them along side each episode they come after (because more often than not, they base a scene or character that was spotlighted in that particular episode). Just make sure you don't watch them on their own, as its based on knowledge of the series. really put on the fan service with these things.

He can beat ordinary people with the sound of his heartbeats and can even compete with gods. However, this wipes away suspense as you start thinking about how he\'s going to do what he wants rather than how he\'s going to win. This has its own appeal and charm that I\'m not into, but even so, this anime is still mid-tier.Story:To be honest, I can\'t stand the story,...It\'s not even hilariously bad. This anime doesn\'t bother explaining the rules of its universe and doesn\'t respect the curiosity of its viewers to know more about it. It touches on some politics, but I wished it went deeper as it barely had any impact. The twists this show has don\'t make any sense, like how characters get killed just to then be revived by the main character, Anos Voldigoad. The lead-up to every twist feels made up on the spot and poorly thought out. The story goes in whatever direction it wants, not to speak of how this show is speedrunning tropes in the first season or how most events affect no more than five episodes. At least these issues are a little less pronounced in Season 2 Part 2, but something that isn\'t gone, however, is how nothing is getting its much-needed time. The problem isn\'t with the premise itself, which is mostly okay, but rather with the way it is delivered and the details. For me, at least, the magic in this show is more disappointing than the breathing techniques in Demon Slayer. In this world, sources are concepts of the existence of all living things that cannot be touched with normal attacks like magic that have seven types. I don\'t want to start reading from the wiki, but there are a lot of magic spells that are only explained on a surface level. There is Ingall, a spell that resurrects the dead, but where does its source and flesh come from? That is never explained. It\'s not just this spell that isn\'t explained, but it would take too long for me to bring the long list of spells in this anime that have been used once or twice and never seen again.Characters:The character interactions are abnormal, even in anime standards. If you didn\'t notice from the long title, this anime is a light novel adaptation. As light novels can\'t show you how characters feel, they present their feelings with dialogue that is boring and uninteresting if delivered in the same way this show does. Characters always tell you what they are thinking and how they are feeling. They didn\'t even try to express any of that in any other way. Let\'s take some noteworthy characters, such as the sarcastic main character, who can do anything he wants like changing the personality of others and changing his appearance to that of a kid, his parents who are obsessed with him so much that they mention everything he does, and his harem who show their obsession in other ways like singing and dying for him if they can. At least the characters in this anime are more intelligent and coherent than the average NPC.Art:If you are looking for good animation, you will be very disappointed as this anime relies heavily on effects. The CG dragons are disgusting in this season. It doesn\'t bother to make magic look cool as it uses particles, fade, waves, smoke, and some other effects. The camera angles are basic as to not bother with perspective, actions are not given more than four frames, and the color composition is mediocre. At least the first season had better art direction than this. The OST is mostly mediocre, and the voice acting is fine, it is clear that the voice actors are giving their best.In the end, this is nothing more than a generic power fantasy that is a little bit different than any fantasy anime with mediocre production value, flat world-building, and mixing a compelling story with cute girls while failing at both. I don\'t know why they are adding a second season. In my opinion, they should have concluded the story in season one. I am pretty sure that if I watched this season without any context, I would have had the same experience as watching it normally.

Miyori no Mori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2751/Miyori_no_Mori,"['When one looks back one the history of anime in the West, it\'s easy to see the progression from the initial ""cartoons are for kids"" perception to it\'s current position as a viable storytelling medium. It\'s only natural then that both anime and manga have begun to creep in to our everyday lives, from modern ""cartoons"" for children, to games, advertising, even quiz show questions. The influence of anime and manga is literally all around us, every day. However, like anything in life, both anime and manga are also susceptible to influences as well, and Miyori no Mori is one of the few titles that...has not only utilised this influence, but has openly embraced it.What am I talking about? Well, the movie is based on the manga of the same name by Oda Hideji, and while the style of both the manga and the movie is very much Japanese, there are overtones of European comic styles, in particular those from France. This is because Oda is one of the growing number of mangaka to be associated with ""La Nouvelle Manga"", a movement which gathers French, Belgian and Japanese comic creators together, and the influence of this is telling in the designs of the characters and settings in both the manga and anime.Miyori no Mori is about 11 year old Miyori, who has been sent to live with her grandparents in a remote mountain village due to her parents divorce. At first she is unnerved by the sudden upheaval in her life, however as events settle into a much calmer pace, she begins to appreciate her life in the country, until she begins to see the spirits that live in the forest that is.One of the biggest problems with Miyori no Mori is simply that it has a distinctly sanitised feel about it. The plot, which proceeds at a decent rate, lacks a certain punch that could have made the movie great. Most of this is due to the fact that the movie places a great deal of emphasis on cooperation between the spirits of the forest and humans, however the actions and feelings of the spirits have been heavily doctored so that the movie will appeal to younger audiences. That\'s not to say that the movie would have been better with people being ripped to pieces, no, it\'s simply that the spirits feel like something out of a children s book instead of a folk tale.However, the story is still enjoyable in it\'s own right, and while there is a distinctly environmentally friendly theme to the movie, this is balanced in some measure by the fact that the tale is also about a girl coming to terms with the ""loss"" of her family.In terms of art and design the movie feels very ""Ghibli-esque"", which is not surprising as even though the movie is Yamamoto Nizo\'s directorial debut, his previous work includes art directionon several well known movies, including Mononoke Hime, Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo and Grave of the Fireflies. Probably the most pleasing thing about this though, is that Yamamoto\'s and Oda\'s styles seem to mesh rather well within the movie. Oda\'s designs for Miyori, the forest, the spirits, and the other humans have been carefully transferred to anime, and while there has been some minor alterations here and there, the end result is pleasing, if a little quirky at times.Animation-wise the movie is very good. There is a smooth, sometimes fluid, feel to the movie, especially in it\'s depiction of more ephemeral beings. The characters move in a very relaxed and natural manner, and while the movie features very little in the way of ""action"", the more hectic sequences are very nicely realised. The background art is also very well rendered, and is the main reason why many people initially believe the movie to have been made by Ghibli. This is no surprise though, as the director is also responsible for the background art and, like most directors, he has found a way to stamp his mark on the movie.As far as the music goes, the movie is well served with the various scores used throughout, many of which have a distinctly pastoral feel to reflect the environmental message of the film, an atmosphere which even extends to the more dramatic pieces. The nice thing about this is that the music doesn\'t have that ""mish-mash"" feel that can sometimes appear in anime, giving the film a more ""continuous"" atmosphere than it may have otherwise had. The effects are also very good, and are clear and distinct even when there are several effects occuring at once. However, the movie does suffer a little from the inevitable clash that occurs between sound effects, music and speech, something which can lead to re-watching the scene in order to decipher what is being said (hurray for subtitles!).The voice acting is of a very good standard, especially for what is effectively a fringe movie (i.e. not based on a popular manga, game, etc - yes, it had a large budget for a TV movie, but that doesn\'t mean it was well known to begin with). Yuu Aoi plays the role of Miyori extremely well, imbuing the character with all the feelings, fantasies and frustrations of an 11 year old girl with a chip on her shoulder. Although Yuu is relatively unknown as a seiyuu (her only other role is in Tekkon Kinkreet), her performance in this movie makes her one to watch out for in the future. The rest of the cast are also relatively unknown for the most part, yet they manage to portray their characters with aplomb and, especially with the older characters, grace.One of the things I liked about the movie was the degree to which Miyori is developed. At the beginning of the story she is understandably depressed, upset, and more than a tad angry about the events in her life, and it was nice to see that the reason for her emotional distress was rooted firmly in reality. Granted the supernatural element helps her to come to terms with her new life, yet this should not be used to diminish the growth in her character come the end of the film.That said, where the movie suffers most is in the fact that Miyori is the only character to receive any continuous development. While there are sme sparing nods at developing certain other characters, these are simply token gestures that don\'t really go anywhere. The upshot of this is that Miyori actually stands out too much in the film, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing until you reach the point where nothing can happen in the story unless she\'s around, and it\'s unfortunate that this is exactly what happens on several occasions.This is a rather quirky and charming story on the whole. The animation and sound make this pleasing to watch, and the designs of the characters and creatures, as well as the lush backdrops, give the movie a nice, relaxed feel. The plot is well laid out, with understandable reasons and goals for the characters, however the strong environmental message is reinforced somewhat by the supernatural element, and can become annoying for some people as the movie progresses. Also, while this is very much a Japanese production there are distinct European tones present throughout, something which adds an air of surrealness to both the plot and the characters, and some viewers may be put off by the slightly ""alien"" feel inherent in the film.Miyori no Mori is surprisingly enjoyable in many respects, especially if one likes certain Ghibli movies (or others of that ilk). It may even be the case that fans of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Mokke, Mushishi and Ghost Hound may find themselves warming to the film because of the numerous similarites, not the least of which is the fact that they all have rural settings and involve the supernatural.As far as directorial debuts go, this is a pretty good showing for Yamamoto, and one hopes this movie will be the start of better things for him and Yuu Aoi, as well as the other cast members. has not only utilised this influence, but has openly embraced it.What am I talking about? Well, the movie is based on the manga of the same name by Oda Hideji, and while the style of both the manga and the movie is very much Japanese, there are overtones of European comic styles, in particular those from France. This is because Oda is one of the growing number of mangaka to be associated with ""La Nouvelle Manga"", a movement which gathers French, Belgian and Japanese comic creators together, and the influence of this is telling in the designs of the characters and settings in both the manga and anime.Miyori no Mori is about 11 year old Miyori, who has been sent to live with her grandparents in a remote mountain village due to her parents divorce. At first she is unnerved by the sudden upheaval in her life, however as events settle into a much calmer pace, she begins to appreciate her life in the country, until she begins to see the spirits that live in the forest that is.One of the biggest problems with Miyori no Mori is simply that it has a distinctly sanitised feel about it. The plot, which proceeds at a decent rate, lacks a certain punch that could have made the movie great. Most of this is due to the fact that the movie places a great deal of emphasis on cooperation between the spirits of the forest and humans, however the actions and feelings of the spirits have been heavily doctored so that the movie will appeal to younger audiences.

The story takes place in a countryside village and the forest right next to it. And throughout the story, Miyori matures quite a lot as she realizes that she is not alone at all.The soundtrack is enthralling and suits there really well. It drags you even deeper into the story and makes it more believable.The animation is also a success and all the environments are really beautiful. Each character is very unique.I enjoyed every last second of this anime. It is touching and gives a good feeling. ', ""Miyori no Mori is a rather straight forward story about a girl accepting her place in the world and saving the forest she's grown to love. There's a strong environmental message that reminds me of Ghibli films like Pom Poko and Mononoke Hime. While the spirits and demons bring to mind things like Tonari no Totoro or Natsume Yuujinchou. It really succeeds with its' imagery - classic scenes of thatched houses or dragons or witches are used to evoke a nostalgia and wonder.In short, if you enjoy Ghibli films or relaxing stories about demons and spirits in Japan, than you'll like this film. The...art is lovely.  Miyori ends up being a lot more three dimensional than, say,  your average Ghibli protagonist, and her issues with her parents add a realism to the movie, I didn't expect to find. art is lovely.

Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/936/Naruto_Movie_2__Dai_Gekitotsu_Maboroshi_no_Chiteiiseki_Dattebayo,"[""By definition, “Utopia” is simple in context, but every individual has their own take on what their Promised Land truly is. How far must we reach to obtain tranquility, and what must we sacrifice to reach that goal?In a land where despair and hope are in constant conflict, Naruto, along with Sakura and Shikamaru, are thrown into a power struggle between a hypocritical faction creating their own path to peace and the world around them. By showcasing pleasing animation and a handful of new, plausible characters, we are once again served a modest helping of a series that has marked its place in anime history.Complexity...in a plot can have its problems, especially when the writers are restricted to a movie’s worth of time to draw out the intricacies in the story. What starts as a straightforward mission to catch and deliver a ferret soon turns into a, well, complicated mess. With little time to focus on the development of the characters, we are left with just a fluky plot and a handful of neatly animated battles that, most of the time, weren’t all that impressive.Naruto, Sakura, and Shikamaru shine as three stand out characters from the main series, and luckily, their audacity carries over to the film to slightly make up for the poorly executed new characters. We’re introduced to an organization owned by Haido, a deceptive man wishing to create a world without war by using the Vein of Gelel, an ancient source of ultimate power. A quickly detestable character who's role can be easily pinned from the start, Haido offers nothing unique to the story other than the cliches that follow his position.Temujin, one of Haido’s henchmen and also a main protagonist of the story, is one of the only redeeming aspects of the movie. As one of the only (somewhat) developed characters in the film, we learn of his troubled past and his own concept of what it takes to achieve “Utopia”. The other henchwomen include Fugai, Kamina, and Ranke, who serve no purpose other than to show off some interesting animation quirks during the fight sequences.What can be said in a positive light is that the art and sound of Naruto’s second movie is very nice to look at and hear. While staying true to the series, the art and sound are a step up from what we see on the big screen every weekend. Overall, it’s nothing overly spectacular or out of the box, but the time put in paid off. You’ll especially see the great production values in the handful of fights where a lot of attention was given to details.It is hard to say whether Naruto: Legend of the Stone of Gelel actually answered the questions lingering in our heads, but we do get to experience an interesting character study, to some degree. The story is nothing worth mentioning, but philosophically we are left with a treat, whether or not a “Utopia” can ever exist or if a “necessary sacrifice” is something acceptable is left to the viewer. in a plot can have its problems, especially when the writers are restricted to a movie’s worth of time to draw out the intricacies in the story.

Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo! starts out better than the first movie. In fact, I thought the beginning really showed promise. Narutos first encounter with Temujin was really exciting and a really cool idea. That\'s really where the fun ended for me, and then the choice of story and characters lost me through the middle of the movie. I found this particular movie had a lot of potential compared to the first one, but I feel it fell flat and was a little bit of a let down. Even though I went in expecting a bad movie, it found a way...to get my hopes up and then smash them again.Like the other movies, this one doesn\'t fit in with the original story very well. It is a mediocre story, but I liked it a little more than the first movie. It was lacking in a lot of areas, but it did have a really interesting premise. I loved the fact that there was an armored fighter from another land (I mean that\'s the whole reason I gave this movie a try), and his first encounter with Naruto was pretty fun to watch. Though from there I found the story to be a little dry, and I was quite frankly bored at times. It\'s art and sound were ok, and I was a big fan of Gaara at that time so I was curious what they would do with him, but all in all it wasn\'t what I had hoped for. Thanks to this movie I ended up skipping the third from the original ""Naruto"" series.Let me be clear in that this is 100% a filler/side story and it\'s not for everyone. My advice is to look at the list of characters in this movie and decide if they are characters you can watch no matter what. Keep in mind that like the last few seasons of the original series, this is mediocre at best compared to the canon story that everyone loves. I advise passing, but again, it depends on how tolerable you are to side stories. to get my hopes up and then smash them again.Like the other movies, this one doesn\'t fit in with the original story very well.

That doesn\'t mean the story is anything that special but it worked and i was somewhat interested and overall i enjoyed watching it. The plot is nothing crazy, it didn\'t have any plot twists or unexpected events but it was a thorough and solid story without any plot holes.The animation looked better this time around...too, obviously because technology improves every year but like I said it was better. The characters moved alot more fluently and the action scenes looked smoother, the environments stood out to me as looking alot more detailed and lush as well. The soundtrack wasn\'t anything good, quite forgettable actually but i\'m not expecting much from a movie after all...Still i can\'t tell if it was simply underused or just not good. The overall sounds were good, all of the overall sound effects sounded crisp and clear and it was pleasant to listen to in headphones.The characters were good, some of my favorite scenes had to do with Gaara and Kankuro who acted as guests. I like both of these characters so it was nice to see them in the movie and not underused, watching Gaara and Kankuro fight was very cool to see considering Gaara has some of the strongest jutsu in the original series. Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru acted as the main characters and it worked as always. Shikamaru didn\'t do much but he had his moments and he\'s a nice presence. The Antagonists this time around impressed me more than the last, even though i knew ultimately Naruto was going to win. This time though, it did feel more intense and the villians gave Naruto and the others much more of a struggle. The end fight especially stood out as being the best part of the movie, Naruto did something that i won\'t spoil with his Rasengan that was actually really cool. The one thing that bothered me though was the whole ""utopia"" idea that acted as the bad guys plan. In short, they wanted to make the world a peaceful utopia by using this ""thing"" that the plot revolved around. The peace aspect is nothing new, but the utopia idea felt kinda out of place. Even the antagonists armor and technology felt out of place, however it had a nice aesthetic to it and it looked cool so i will give it that.Overall it was a solid plot, nothing left unanswered and no plot holes. The characters were good as usual, Gaara and Kankuro were nice editions and the new characters were cool and did what they needed to do. The animation was very good and it sounded great despite the mediocre soundtrack. The story wasn\'t anything incredible but it wasn\'t predictable and i was entertained throughout. The action scenes were all very well executed, they were unique and didn\'t drag on and didn\'t feel too short. There were some nice light hearted moments as always that made for a good touch. In all, I enjoyed it. If you\'re a fan of Naruto you\'ll enjoy it, if you don\'t like the anime then this isn\'t gonna change your mind. Nevertheless, fans of the show you would enjoy yourselves just as i did as long as you don\'t expect anything extraordinary.7/10Hope this helped (: too, obviously because technology improves every year but like I said it was better.

Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo! with low expectations due to how much the first movie sucked but it turned out a little better than I have expected.Story: (4/10)The story of Naruto movie 2 begins with a big battle with Gaara, Kankuro, and the sand village people fighting against mysterious armored soldiers. It then cuts to Naruto, Shikamaru, and Sakura on a mission to catch a ferret but are soon interrupted by the mysterious armored soldiers. In terms of story, this movie beats the first movie\'s story but not by much. I found...the story to be boring and predictable at many moments but it does attempt to keep the viewer in it by making battles happen left and right. The movie still keeps the trend of the first movie by incorporating modern things in it even though the anime\'s setting says otherwise and examples of this is a giant moving fortress made out of metal that has a gigantic drill in the front of it, small containment capsules, and a machine that are able to track things down. The story introduces a new things called gegel stones that supposedly can make a utopia even though the origin of the gegel stone clearly explains that people who used it went insane with power and killed each other which doesn\'t make any sense for Temujin to think that it will make a utopia and surprise, surprise, what do you think happens?Art and Animation: (6/10)The art in this movie was good and the character designs managed to stay consistent much more than the first movie. There were some interesting visual scenes during Kankuro\'s battle with one of the villains of the movie. The animation for this movie was definitely a step up from the last movie and the anime.Sound: (5/10)The soundtrack in this movie was very forgettable with the best song being the ending song. For some reason the movie used a song that sounds very similar to ""The Raising Fighting Spirit"" which is Naruto\'s main theme in the anime and it makes me question why they didn\'t use that one instead of this new version.Characters: (4/10)The characters definitely aren\'t the best part of the movie. First off, like always, we have Naruto who is always being an idiot with his shenanigans and is fueled with nakama power to beat any foe that comes his way. Next we have Shikamaru new to group which I\'m thinking is because the movie takes place during the time in the anime when Sasuke goes with Orochimaru. Shikimaru does contribute to the plot somewhat but is mostly used for whenever the team needs to fight. Sakura is still the character that doesn\'t contribute anything to the plot and is used when the team needs to fight. Then we have other newcomers which are Gaara and Kankuro. Their whole role in the movie is to be more allies for Naruto so they can fight off the other villains and are usually put standing around in the background so the creators could remind us that they are still in the movie. Then we have the main character of the movie who is named Temujin. For the most part he is a pretty well developed character with how much backstory we are given about him but my main problem with him is how much he is an idiot. Examples of this is how he follows the people who think that the gegel stones will lead to a utopia even though the whole origin of the stone is explained to him and near the end of the movie he starts to realize all the destruction he has done when in the past we are told that him and the group he is in had destroyed an entire village and even then he still didn\'t realize how much destruction he has caused? I mean, c\'mon. Finally, we have the villains which there isn\'t really much to say other than that they are very underdeveloped.Enjoyment: (4/10)The action scenes were cool to look at and there was some amount of character development.Overall: (4/10)Naruto Movie 2: Dai Gekitotsu! Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo! is an clear improvement on the previous movie but it still lacks many things for itself to be good. the story to be boring and predictable at many moments but it does attempt to keep the viewer in it by making battles happen left and right. The movie still keeps the trend of the first movie by incorporating modern things in it even though the anime\'s setting says otherwise and examples of this is a giant moving fortress made out of metal that has a gigantic drill in the front of it, small containment capsules, and a machine that are able to track things down. The story introduces a new things called gegel stones that supposedly can make a utopia even though the origin of the gegel stone clearly explains that people who used it went insane with power and killed each other which doesn\'t make any sense for Temujin to think that it will make a utopia and surprise, surprise, what do you think happens?Art and Animation: (6/10)The art in this movie was good and the character designs managed to stay consistent much more than the first movie. There were some interesting visual scenes during Kankuro\'s battle with one of the villains of the movie. The animation for this movie was definitely a step up from the last movie and the anime.Sound: (5/10)The soundtrack in this movie was very forgettable with the best song being the ending song. For some reason the movie used a song that sounds very similar to ""The Raising Fighting Spirit"" which is Naruto\'s main theme in the anime and it makes me question why they didn\'t use that one instead of this new version.Characters: (4/10)The characters definitely aren\'t the best part of the movie. First off, like always, we have Naruto who is always being an idiot with his shenanigans and is fueled with nakama power to beat any foe that comes his way. Next we have Shikamaru new to group which I\'m thinking is because the movie takes place during the time in the anime when Sasuke goes with Orochimaru. Shikimaru does contribute to the plot somewhat but is mostly used for whenever the team needs to fight. Sakura is still the character that doesn\'t contribute anything to the plot and is used when the team needs to fight. Then we have other newcomers which are Gaara and Kankuro. Their whole role in the movie is to be more allies for Naruto so they can fight off the other villains and are usually put standing around in the background so the creators could remind us that they are still in the movie. Then we have the main character of the movie who is named Temujin. For the most part he is a pretty well developed character with how much backstory we are given about him but my main problem with him is how much he is an idiot. Examples of this is how he follows the people who think that the gegel stones will lead to a utopia even though the whole origin of the stone is explained to him and near the end of the movie he starts to realize all the destruction he has done when in the past we are told that him and the group he is in had destroyed an entire village and even then he still didn\'t realize how much destruction he has caused? I mean, c\'mon. Finally, we have the villains which there isn\'t really much to say other than that they are very underdeveloped.Enjoyment: (4/10)The action scenes were cool to look at and there was some amount of character development.Overall: (4/10)Naruto Movie 2: Dai Gekitotsu! Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo! is an clear improvement on the previous movie but it still lacks many things for itself to be good.', 'The only problem I had with this movie were the characters and the plotline. I\'ll try to explain without any spoilers. (Keep in mind that a review is the reviewer\'s opinion and that you should make your own decision.)While the new characters ones were okay, there were a few times in the movie when their actions either didn\'t make much sense or were at odds with what was happening around them.However, most of the strange behavior seemed to be intertwined the plot holes. By plot holes, I refer to the numerable questions raised by the actions of the characters and the environment around them. Particularly...the end scene with all of the deaths, the unexplained non-deaths, ""where the hell did all that paper come from"", as well as the odd(and in my opinion) unreasonable reactions of quite a few characters.(I get that they\'re ninja, but Naruto is still a kid and a very empathetic one at that. Why did he not react when he saw all those bodies? Then again, that may mainly be the fault of the artists.)ALSO, there are lots of unanswered questions( some relate to the plot holes). A few examples of those are:- How did ******* live after he was mortally wounded?- What is the Stone of Gelel? I get that it\'s powerful, but what is it?- How did ******* suddenly understand his heritage despite the truth of it never being directly stated?- Why don\'t the newcomers know about chakra?- Why did they have ***** ****** inside of them?There are a ton more questions that, if answered, would of prevented some major confusion and fixed a few plot holes. But, you will have no idea what I\'m talking about since you haven\'t watched the movie...So, overall, I liked this. (I giggled almost constantly due to my twisted sense of humor.) But, the confusion and plot holes lowered the enjoyment drastically. I am rating this a 6 because, despite its flaws, it was decent. The plot was acceptable, the fight scenes were awesome, and both Gaara and Kankuro were there.P.S. As a hopeless fan, Gaara and Kankuro(mostly Gaara) are the main reasons that I rated this movie as ""fair""(6) and not ""mediocre""(5).

The art was definetely better than the anime but... it wasn\'t as good as the first movie, at least that\'s the way I feel like. I liked the soundtrack more than the first movie, that I can say. It\'s still not as good as the anime but then again, the anime\'s soundtrack is just amazing. The action is decent.Now we get to the story. Mediocre. It has some interesting philosophical thought but it fails to deliver it properly. The story\'s pacing is...a bit meh and it feels kind of... out of place. It is explained well enough, I suppose. It is just rather boring and painfully cliched. Characters are made to look mostly one-dimensional and that kid with the armor and stuff is actually quite boring. I find his character not very well executed. The ending is just ridiculous. I really want to explain why but there shouldn\'t be any spoilers. Look, it\'s just... you get the drill. Bad. I didn\'t really care much about the story as the character development was bad and it was just overall ""Cool shit. :/"".Considering all of the above, Naruto Movie 2: Dai Gekitotsu! Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo! is mediocre. It was mostly a drag, the beginning was alright but it didn\'t get better, only worse. It\'s not a bad movie, just average. a bit meh and it feels kind of... out of place. It is explained well enough, I suppose. It is just rather boring and painfully cliched.

"", ""I really enjoy these first three Naruto films. In many ways, they encapsulate what I personally wish the series was and emphasize the qualities of Naruto that I enjoy while downplaying that which turned me away from the series in the end. The way these films expand the universe while giving side characters a lot to do is just great!The plot is fairly similar to the other two Naruto films - Naruto, Sakura, and a third team member (Shikamaru in this case) find themselves ensnared in a conflict that existed before they came along, and now Naruto must address this conflict due to his heroic/idealistic...nature. This time, the plot also brings in the Sand Siblings, very welcome additions. Gaara vs that one lightning girl was particularly great.Temujin is a fairly bland character on his own merits, basically being a stand-in for Sasuke, who is not in this film. However, I enjoyed him nonetheless mainly because I enjoy the aesthetics of knights, and his fighting style made him seem unique in this world of ninjas and trickery. The antagonists are also fairly unremarkable, apart from the fact that they have transformations based off of classic monsters (werewolf, vampire, and some kind of ogre thing?). The big bad in particular is very lame in my opinion. The fight pacing and coreography was so good though. It's very fast-paced and kinetic, and the characters don't spend ten minutes plus on talking in between blows, nothing like the actual series. Plus, the movies don't bother going into maudlin backstories for the villains, and the heroes actually kill their enemies, as you would expect ninja to. Even Sakura gets a good fight!To me, these movies are great, and I recommend them to all fans of Naruto. This one is my favorite due to my bias for knights and whatnot, but the first and third Naruto films are similar in quality to this one. I never watched any of the Shippuden films so idk how those are. But to me, these films really capture an great sense of adventure and worldbuilding without getting caught up in the melodramatic quagmire that Shippuden later sinks into. nature.

However as the film continued it did begin to attract my attention. The story has some meaning, suprisingly so, it's about utopia and if war/sacrifices are necessary to achieve it, which is a quite a philosophical theme. It actually made me think on my own thoughts about good and bad which is something I never expected in a Naruto film would make me do! I thought it was good this topic was addressed, especially considering a large majority of the audience are...quite young and the film sets a good example.As for the art, I would say some scenes really excelled over the anime series, however overall it was very fair and nothing to get excited about. I would say the same for sound.In terms of characterisation, the film doesn't really develope the series characters and the new character Temujin had a kind of Sasuke feel to him, saying this he was quite likeable and I found myself rooting him on but he just lacked originality.Oddly, I found myself enjoying the film but I guess that's because I've been watching Naruto for a long time and I know how deal with fillerish moments.

They have tough encounters along the way and are faced against a man named Temujin who believes and trusts in Master Haido, a man who aims for a Utopia, a world with peace and no wars at all. However, this is nothing but to lure Temujin into his plans of catching the Stones of Gelel and using them for evil. Once he realizes this, he teams up with Naruto and defeats...Haido.

Later on in the movie, there was CGI and I hated it! The character designs later in the movie was alright, but it was still really weird for the first like 20-30 minutes of the movie. The story was alright and there wasn't really anything wrong with it. It was pretty mediocre I will say but it was enjoyable enough. The characters personalities didn't really change and that was good. But with that really weird CGI early on...and the mediocre at best plot I'd give it a 4/10. This definitely wouldn't be the first Naruto movie I would recommend to someone. It was basic and the art/animation threw me off hella. ;-; and the mediocre at best plot I'd give it a 4/10. This definitely wouldn't be the first Naruto movie I would recommend to someone. It was basic and the art/animation threw me off hella. ;-;"", 'This is the second Naruto movie, made around the time the dreaded fillers began. You can clearly see how the franchise is starting to saturate by now and just rehashes the same old stuff just for the sake of making them and keeping up with a dying trend. As far as movies go, you can of course expect far better production values and flashier battles than the main series, along with much less effort to tell a story or have interesting characters. Other than that, it is just another passable filler mission.The basic plot is about our heroes trying to stop the members of a...mechanical ship from getting their hands on some magic stones of immerse power that will help them rule the world. So in a way it is like a rehash of what the Akatsuki want in the main series, although in a much cheaper and boring way. Later on you get some Nausicaa vibes, as if they are trying to pass a anti-war, pro-ecology message regarding the power of the stones but it is all completely dried up.I guess the makers received complaints about the first movie having too much plot and not enough action and as such sacrificed everything for an 80% action flick with cheesy drama. “The kids who watch this don’t care about dramatic princesses, they just want to see action” is what they told them. Thus they replace a character with some basic interest such as a frail girl like Yukihime with an emo fighter boy named Temujin. They also try to have as less twists as possible that will eat up precious screen time from the action, and thus you get this cheesefest. I liked the part with the filming in the first movie for offering something slightly smart in the otherwise straightforward story. But this “in your face” plot is just boring and on top of that one of the same as always when it comes to the themes of Naruto. Emo kids with tragic childhoods fighting for a better future is something you get all the time in the main series so there is no innovation here; unlike what they did with the first movie and apparently were scolded for it. Some of course may say there is some innovation because there is a blending of other civilizations and technology. Seriously, the villains appear to be European knights who transform to European monsters, their weaponry appears to be steampunk, and the village near the ruins has murals that resemble those of the Aztecs. Well I was not convinced all these fit in the setting. I got the part how the mechanical ship is supposed to symbolize the westerners invading Japan but it wasn’t relevant to the plot. And what the devil are Aztecs doing in a Japanese-like world?Anyways, Temujin is a very boring character and just a slight variation of practically half the other moody characters in the show. The other 3 villains are shallow as hell and you just don’t care about them either. As for the good guys, aside from Naruto they are all there just because the movie is supposed to be mostly action and needed more people to fill in the fights. Furthermore, the scriptwriter didn’t care much for the canon teams and picked the characters based on popularity and not on proper team structure. So we get Shikamaru without the others of his team and Gaara with Kanguro without the girl of their team. Sadly, the real protagonist of the show, Gaysuke, is now gone from the main team and could not be present, and even Kakashi is no longer their leader to be present with his coolness. And even sadder than that, there is absolutely no attempt to somehow bridge what is going in the story with some canon character. Remember how Kakashi had ties with Snow Country and was giving off a feeling of familiarity? Well forget that, over here we get this ancient civilization nobody knew anything about and some village nobody had ties to. Plus they threw in Europe and South America for kicks. Basically, they didn’t even try, because trying means adding some context which makes the target audience (10 year old kids) to have to think and makes them bored. Unless of course telling them once again how the monstrous westerners invaded the super cool ninja country that is Japan counts as educational. Anyways, they are there for the action and not for the story.As far as the action goes it is spectacular for the year it was made. There is so much of it, and it is all pretty dynamic and cool for a shonen anime. Definitely much more exciting than the first film and basically the only thing it did better than it. It still ends the usual way though (Rasengan on the villain’s face and Naruto giving his motivational monologue to the emo kid that makes everything feel right).

A very passable and forgettable chapter in the franchise.', ""Here I am, writing another review for another Naruto movie after over a decade since it has been released because why not. Anyways, back to the review, this movie was a step down from the first movie in my opinion because of it's poor writing and even as someone who doesn't care about how plot are planned and executed as long as I enjoy it, this movie sticks out like a sore thumb and even I can say I wasn't really intrigued by it.[Story 3/10]Ah, this is the worst writing rating I'll give on any anime I have watched for now. As I said,...even for someone who doesn't really care about the writing as long as it's enjoyable, this movie still blew the bad barrier on how it was written. The thing that sticks out the most was the chain of very predictable events that I got bored of and it's very, very thick plot armor to the point where even if you know it's an anime, it still breaks the 'how' barrier. There is also a multitude of plot holes that just ruins the viewing experience for someone who likes some clarity and logic. The story is just bad in general and nothing memorable came out of this for me.[Animation 8/10]The only good point in this movie in my opinion. Just like my review on the previous Naruto movie, considering this was released over a decade ago, the art is a step up from the main series and looks appealing to the eyes. The only problem is... anything that goes with the art in the movie was 'meh' level at best and is not appealing to the eyes nor ears.[Sound 5/10]It's not bad, it's just that nothing memorable came out of this as the music was really bland when it is trying to hype up the fights or trying to solidify emotional moments. The voice acting was good though and isn't clear of any inconsistency.[Characters 4/10]Again, they are really bland in this department too. First we have the already well known characters as in Naruto, Shikamaru, Sakura, etc. and we have the new characters which are just really boring in their own way. They aren't that bad but they really didn't help with my enjoyment towards them nor make anything memorable for themselves. It's just that they aren't interesting and that didn't help with the character ratings.[Enjoyment 4/10]Ah, what could I say? I was kind of disappointed in this movie because I really did enjoy the first movie but what can I do I guess. I even took a quick nap mid way through the movie due to how slow the pacing was and the fights was very 'meh' in general. Can't say I think the movie was something made from the stuff of nightmare because the story was still viewable for me but really, nothing memorable nor interesting came out of this and the word 'disappointed' sums up how I feel about this movie. even for someone who doesn't really care about the writing as long as it's enjoyable, this movie still blew the bad barrier on how it was written.

Though other characters such as Temujin had some development.The animation was very good and with great drawing.

I won\'t lie, the second film has some really fun moments and cool aspects like starring Shikamaru, the design of Temujin, an antagonist who...makes use of probably the most underutilized, but useful jutsus, Genjutsu and appearances from the Sand Village, Gaara and Kankuro. However, it\'s just not very strong with a predictable story, forgettable original characters, one moment that feels very out of left field, and I\'m pretty sure it breaks the rules of Genjutsu to add false tension. It also introduces a concept that feels too important to be as throwaway as it ultimately ends up being, the movie being non-cannon and all.

These films have some good moments, but overall they're mediocre at best. In this one especially, there was hardly any set up and the story just rushed forward with hardly anything to ground or invest you in what was going on. There were multiple characters, Gaara and Kankuro especially, who were drastically underused and really had no purpose in being in this movie. I really love those characters, so it was disappointing to see them not do much. Also, a bunch of the fight scenes took place in dark or dimly lit settings which sort of made it difficult...to see what was going on.Again, like the previous movie, its pretty much three or four episodes combined to make one continuous story.

Because of this, the story plays out very predictably and at no point was I surprised. But the movie does have its moments. It was fun seeing the team dynamics of Naruto, Shikamaru, and Sakura, and I always love seeing what new team combinations the anime gives us. It also includes one of my favorite characters, Gaara, and Kankuro, and these two give us what I think are the best fight scenes in the movie.Overall, while there’s nothing particularly engaging about the film, it does have...a few redeeming qualities that keep it from being a chore to watch. a few redeeming qualities that keep it from being a chore to watch.', ""This is my personal favorite of the first 4 movies, the music they use in the battles meshes perfectly and the battles are awesome throughout the movie. It is cool that Shikamaru is in this movie he as always beings his cool head and sharp battle skills also Gaara but this is one of my gripes with the movie I feel that he should have had a some more lines and a bigger role since they open the movie with him and his brother same goes for his brother too both could have had better roles in the movie.

It doesn\'t bring anything new to the table that we haven\'t already seen from the series before, and it follows the typical anime movie formula of go to a new place with new characters all of which will never be seen or heard from again.

Ninin ga Shinobuden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/229/Ninin_ga_Shinobuden,"[""Upon seeing the cover for this series, you may think to yourself: This anime seems like a wacky take on the whole ninja plot. Honestly.....you wouldn't be far off.Its not perfect, but does have a lot to offer in its short 12 episode run, which come in the form of two 15 minute shorts. This series banks on nothing more than laugh value, and honestly, it doesn't disappoint.Story: 7/10While this series is by no means going anywhere with its story, the comedy bits seem to arrive in the right place at the right time, enough to keep you entertained, yet not too frequent to where...the story relies solely on it alone. All the episode plots conclude at the end, whether it be spring cleaning at the dojo, to watching the gang going mushroom picking. So yeah, you kinda have to take it episode by episode. Sadly none of them will end on any sort of cliffhanger, which doesn't make it the most exciting series out there. To its credit it does do different thing for most of the series, even if some start to feel recycled towards the end.It should be noted that this series contains a bit of Yuri references, viewers might also find it offensive that the male characters tend to treat the females merely as objects. And I must stress that this &quot;male oriented series&quot; is made only for the laughs, and not the story. So if that isn't your bag, then you probably won't dig this anime.Artwork: 8/10The animation is sharp and clear, with bright colorful effects. It truly is nice to look at in the eye candy department. Though I found the backgrounds to be a bit on the bland side (this could be because the animators want you to pay more attention to the characters themselves, and not on the backgrounds), and some of the character's attire come off as more plain than anything else. Certainly not the most well detailed series, but it does have a distinct character design and is bright and colorful!Sound: 9/10The opening and closing theme are as you would expect, a party style j-pop song with the cast members doing random activities, high up on the laugh meter. The background beat as well,  they have this certain style of circus beat that works good for the theme in the background! My only complaint was the lack in variety with it, that one BG track I mentioned is really the only good track you'll hear, as most others are generic style samurai beats. Overall the music it does have are all catchy and memorable for the most part, and should please the ears.Characters: 8/10Each member of this series is well animated and has his/her own different personalities, none of which you will find annoying. Its pretty funny to see Sasuke (head ninja) switch to different ninjas on the fly, whether this was done intentionally is left up for debated. Although there is a good number of cast members, overall you will only get to really know the 5 main characters which you see on the above cover, so its not the most varied cast line up you would otherwise see. Which will be a turn off for some.Bottom Line: 8/10If you love comedy with fan service in your anime, then this title was made for you! If you don't, then you will most likely find Ninja Nonsense pointless, as its heart is not with any kind of involving story or deep character development, but simply with its laugh value.

Like in a sitcom, whatever is happening pretty much resolves itself within one episode. This series has 12 episodes split into two parts each; so it's kind of like watching an anime with 24 mini episodes.As far as the comedy comedy goes, all I can say is, you will laugh. And you will laugh hard. (Which is why I gave it the score I did.) Keep in mind however that most of the humour is ecchi in some way and that this show, despite its cute demeanor, is definitely...NOT for kids. :DI recommend watching this anime with subsitles enabled.

A lot of stills and exaggerated facial expressions are used for the comedic effect.Sound:The opening and ending theme song are both cute and catchy, though nothing exceptional. I cannot comment on the Japanese dub; however, the English voices sounded pretty natural and were fitting for the characters.Character:The main character, Shinobu, is lovable - she's cute and clumsy and completely innocent. I happened to like her friend, Kaede, a lot better, considering she exercises reason in healthy amounts and frequently stands up for herself and Shinobu. Onsakamaru, the flying yellow ball, is more annoying than anything, but you often see him get pummeled by Kaede or Shinobu's sister so it's all good.Technically, you could say that this anime has a lot of side characters. There are hundreds of faceless ninja present in every episode. They act less like individuals and more like one character, and are incredibly hilarious all by themselves.Enjoyment:I had lots of fun watching Ninja Nonsense. I mean - it's ninjas. It's gags galore. It's a cute main character! &quot;Wheee!~&quot; Yeah. The key is not to take it too seriously, as the anime isn't trying to be serious in the very least.Overall:If you don't like ecchi humour, you should just give this one a pass.

Well, if you did, look no further because Ninja Nonsense is exactly what you’re looking for.Following the lives of Shinobu, our female ninja in training, Kaede, the girl who just happened to get her house raided for panties by Shinobu, and Onsokumaru, the crazy yellow blob that can change forms whenever he wills it, we’re thrown into a story that makes about as...much sense as…. well nothing.Being a huge slice of life fan, I’m used to watching anime that is very episodic and has no true story, just watching girls do their thing in cute ways, but Ninja Nonsense takes it to another level. I’d honestly say it’s impossible to make sense of every episode, heck, it’s impossible to make sense of the actions of the characters; they just do things because of “reasons”. Onsokumaru is crazy, wild and perverted, always trying to get with Kaede or Shinobu. The ninjas are just as crazy as Onsokumaru. We also have one named ninja who shows up often, Sasuke, but he’s just like every other ninja. There is also Shinobu’s imouto Miyabi who’s super cute and a super strong ninja/mage crossover; of course there are more characters too like the talking and tamed alligator who can walk if he wants, or the ogres who just want to play baseball. Yes, Ninja Nonsense is very much impossible to understand.So let’s get to the real reason you want to watch this; it’s incredibly funny. Each episode is split into 11-12 minute episodes, so you get two for one! Each short episode is self-contained and full of some the most ridiculous stories ever. Don’t except real ninja action, heck don’t even expect a lot of ninja fights either; I’m still having a hard time decoding what I just watched, all I know is I was incredibly happy and laughed a lot at this anime, it’s really actually a lot of fun, if you want to laugh at jokes and some funny scenes, give this a watch.The art style and animation, for most of the episodes, great stuff. Ninja Nonsense has one of the most unique and absolutely squeeful art styles in existence, the way everything is drawn just looks so different to any type of anime I’ve ever seen. It’s not that rustic 90’s look, but it’s not the late 2000’s extra smooth shiny look either, it’s also not in-between the art styles, it’s 100% unique to Ninja Nonsense and I think it looks unbelievably fantastic. Animation is also really nice, but towards the end of the series it seems to take a drop in quality, same with the art, it seemed rushed or something, but it’s not that bad, I promise.Sound and Music in Ninja Nonsense is really fun. We have all the fun and wild ninja types of sounds and the music is always ready to pump you up and make you squee in delight or laugh out loud. I’d say the combination of BGM and the art style with the ridiculous episodes works so well, it’s a must watch for it alone. The OP and ED are addictive and will be stuck in your head for hours, they’re happy, cheerful and full of energy; I was definitely absorbed in it, even bouncing up and down as I watched the anime; so great stuff.Shinobu and Keade, Onsokumaru, Sasuke, Miyabi, the entire cast of ninjas and then-some, it’s all fantastic and Ninja Nonsense as a whole is without a doubt worth watching. Watch it for its art style, watch it for the really funny comedy, watch it for the interactions between the girls and the ninjas, it’s just a lot of good fun. much sense as…. well nothing.Being a huge slice of life fan, I’m used to watching anime that is very episodic and has no true story, just watching girls do their thing in cute ways, but Ninja Nonsense takes it to another level.

Despite this minor alteration, the series remains one of the best of its genre. The series focuses on the world of Shinobu, which is done through comedic snippets revolving around the protagonist. Despite not having an actual plot, the series does well to please its...viewers through facetious plot lines. In the world of Shinobu, mysteries events unfold and our heroin is faced with physically and morally questionable tasks that are concocted by her devious and lechers instructor, Onsokumaru. Absolutely absurd Assignments such as stealing underwear, abolishing taxes, pinching a marchman and making him cry, stum wrestling a bear, drying a river of tears, hitting a home run while holding the bat between your legs, to crossing the Pacific Ocean on a rubber raft. The comedic aspect of this show is incredible, and viewers are sure to get kick out of this series.Characters:Shinobu:Voiced by: Nana Mizuki (Japanese), Emily Blau (English)Shinobu is the focal star of the series. She is affectionate, and painstakingly devoted to her work. But her credulous behaviors sometimes conflict with her duty, making the simplest of tasks appear complicated. Despite these minor defects in her design, she is able to maintain an honest and caring relationship with Kaede through out the entire series, albeit sometimes their relationship escalates to a level that far exceeds the normalcy of companionship, which makes it insurmountable for the viewer to correctly assume the nature of their relationship. Shinobu’s state of simplicity is her strongest charm, which is wonderfully depicted through out the entire series.Kaede Shiranui:Voiced by: Ayako Kawasumi (Japanese), Zoe Martin (English)Normally one would associate blonde with deaden, but Kaede is the opposite image of that notion. She’s intuitive, more self-aware (despite being the same age as our heroin), and the most rational character in the series. However, her lack of knowledge of the zany world of ninjas is the reason why she is the most victimized in the series, but this certainly doesn’t diminish any of her established merits, as she remains astute through the series.Onsokumaru:Voiced by: Nario Wakamoto (Japanese), Sean Schemmel (English)Onsokumaru’s an enigmatic figure, and a very distinguished character in the series. He’s portrayed as a yellow spherical creature with a face, which is capable of metamorphism, and can freely change the shape of his physical being. One of his most notable transfigures is the muscular human body he takes when he reaches the emotional precipice. Onsokumaru is pervert that transcends the normal level of perversion. He constantly fantasizes about sexual situations to satisfy his sexual urges. He’s also the leader of the Sasuke army. Despite these foul exterior traits, Onsokumaru does have a decent side to him.Summation:For the die hard fans of the comedic art, this series will definitely shed a new perspective on comedy as a whole. Ninja Nonsense immerses the viewer into the world of the ninjas and Shinobu, through a series of incredible sketches filled with witty humor. The standard of comedy depicted in this series is above precision, and the zany world of shinobu reinforces this point beautifully. With a dash of comedy, and perversion, this series is sure to appeal to the mass audience of the craft.Theme:Ninja Nonsense as a comedic anime and manga solely intended for mature audiences is filled with sarcasm used to blemish other anime works. The standpoint of the series focuses more on the sex-related aspects of the show. These range from Onsokumaru’s perversion, which is at times illustrated with incredible measures, to Shinobu’s innocent care for Kaede, which is often misinterpreted by Onsokumaru as something sinister and sexually appetizing. The use of the fourth wall is a crucial element in the show, as it’s used as a mean to keep the viewer’s appetite riveted. The series heavily relies on this to invoke laughter from its audience.Media related:The character design used in this series is more soft and playful, which is certainly favored in comedic animes. This is surely to appeal to the viewers, and is definitely and excellent way to present the atmospheric nature of the show. The Voice acting was superb, both the subbed and dubbed version were terrific. The audio quality and animation are wonderful and are an immense asset to the show. viewers through facetious plot lines. In the world of Shinobu, mysteries events unfold and our heroin is faced with physically and morally questionable tasks that are concocted by her devious and lechers instructor, Onsokumaru. Absolutely absurd Assignments such as stealing underwear, abolishing taxes, pinching a marchman and making him cry, stum wrestling a bear, drying a river of tears, hitting a home run while holding the bat between your legs, to crossing the Pacific Ocean on a rubber raft. The comedic aspect of this show is incredible, and viewers are sure to get kick out of this series.Characters:Shinobu:Voiced by: Nana Mizuki (Japanese), Emily Blau (English)Shinobu is the focal star of the series. She is affectionate, and painstakingly devoted to her work. But her credulous behaviors sometimes conflict with her duty, making the simplest of tasks appear complicated. Despite these minor defects in her design, she is able to maintain an honest and caring relationship with Kaede through out the entire series, albeit sometimes their relationship escalates to a level that far exceeds the normalcy of companionship, which makes it insurmountable for the viewer to correctly assume the nature of their relationship. Shinobu’s state of simplicity is her strongest charm, which is wonderfully depicted through out the entire series.Kaede Shiranui:Voiced by: Ayako Kawasumi (Japanese), Zoe Martin (English)Normally one would associate blonde with deaden, but Kaede is the opposite image of that notion. She’s intuitive, more self-aware (despite being the same age as our heroin), and the most rational character in the series. However, her lack of knowledge of the zany world of ninjas is the reason why she is the most victimized in the series, but this certainly doesn’t diminish any of her established merits, as she remains astute through the series.Onsokumaru:Voiced by: Nario Wakamoto (Japanese), Sean Schemmel (English)Onsokumaru’s an enigmatic figure, and a very distinguished character in the series. He’s portrayed as a yellow spherical creature with a face, which is capable of metamorphism, and can freely change the shape of his physical being. One of his most notable transfigures is the muscular human body he takes when he reaches the emotional precipice. Onsokumaru is pervert that transcends the normal level of perversion. He constantly fantasizes about sexual situations to satisfy his sexual urges. He’s also the leader of the Sasuke army. Despite these foul exterior traits, Onsokumaru does have a decent side to him.Summation:For the die hard fans of the comedic art, this series will definitely shed a new perspective on comedy as a whole.

At least, there is no over arching plot to the whole series. Instead, throughout all 12 episodes, you simply get a specific situation or activity which involves all the members of the group, which is always resolved by the end of the episode.All of the episodes are actually split into two stories, each one lasting about 12 minutes, so there is not a whole lot of depth to them. However as the series progresses you learn a little bit about each of the main characters, so there is some progression.Art:The art is fine. No real flaws, everything is animated smoothly,...and it looks good. But it isn't spectacular, and there will be nothing that you see that ever makes you stop and think 'wow'. But it works for the series, no complaints.Sound:The op and ed are very typical of the genre, two short and catchy j-pop tunes. The background music is there, not always noticeable, but it generally fits into whatever is happening on screen, and adds to the comedy in some places.The sound effects are very good, always hitting right on the mark, usually to greatly enhance the comedy.The characters are also voiced quite well, all the voices fit the characters, and the seiyu seem to be having a fun time with it.Character:This is one area where this series really shines. Whilst none of the characters are very deep, the personalities that they do have are defined very well. Each character has a specific trope that they adhere too, and it is this clashing of personalities that makes the comedy work so well. Onsokuramu's obsession with all things ecchi, and the lengths to which he will go to put the female leads in embarrassing situations is hilarious on its own, but when coupled with Shinobu's innocence and Kaede's straight, no-nonsense personality, it really takes the laughs to another level.Overall:2x2 Shinobuden is a light hearted comedy, and anyone looking for an anime they can watch without having to think too much should give it a chance. The laughs start almost immediately in the first episode, and they won't stop coming until the final credits of the last episode. Sure, most of the humor is ecchi humor, but funny is still funny, and if there is one thing this anime is good at, it's being very, very funny. and it looks good.

', ""When I first saw this anime on TV, my mind was blown with laughter! I mean this is the best comedy anime I ever seen! I know that fans of Naruto would be pissed if they saw this anime! I mean it is a parody. So you got a normal school girl who gets involved with a ninja dojo when a ninja girl enters her house to try to steal a pair of panties. Then she decides that having a ninja for a friend is not so bad.My favorite character is Onsakamaru. The perverted leader of the dojo who sometimes acts like a spoiled...child and trys to get Shinobou's love.I got to say if you never seen this anime, you got to watch it. Best anime comedy I've seen. child and trys to get Shinobou's love.I got to say if you never seen this anime, you got to watch it. Best anime comedy I've seen."", 'Ninja Nonsense was something of a surprise to me. Most of the synopsis talks about the first episode as if this were going to be an ecchi type series but it really is not. There’s much to be had in this series, but apparent from episode it might not be for everybody.Story: 6Shinobu is a ninja in training so to speak (Although that is questionable), and the series opens with her on a mission to steal the panties of a high school girl for her sensei, Onsokumaru who is a pervert in every respect of the word. This encounter brings her to the bedroom of...Kaede where she attempts to steal them unnoticed. Inevitable she is spotted by Kaede, which leads them into an unexpected friendship.Over the course of the show they get into many hilarious situations together, and the only actual story development doesn’t even occur until the last episode. The rest I guess can be considered as “training”, but it felt like there was a large portion missing from the show in this respect. Even the climax of the last episode is very short and otherwise forgettable.Where NN really shines though is the comedy. Most of which to me is on a comparable level to Baka to Test. The show takes itself lightly and because of this it is open to the craziness that creates some hilarious moments (Like a talking ninja alligator for instance.) that will leave a lasting impression in your hearts.Character: 6There is close to no character development in NN, but that is not bad considering it is a comedy. The small amount that there is does not even appear until the very later parts of the show, and unless you love the characters to death will give little in the way of satisfaction. However like I said since this is a comedy firstly the characters I find are pretty well done for the situations they provide.As Kaede grows closer to Shinobu she gets more involved in the world of ninjas, and is often there when Shinobu gets into strange situations. During most of these encounters are the group of faceless ninjas under the beck and call of Onsokumaru, one of which is known as Sasuke. Like the others though you never see his face, and it’s unknown if Sasuke is actually one ninja using some sort of Naruto inspired ability like Shadow Clone or is in fact an individual amongst all of them.Onsokumaru has to be one of the most memorable characters in any show I’ve seen. He is the definition of a pervert who constantly puts the moves on Shinobu, all while looking like Pac-man. He tends to grow or maybe transform a body at certain times (A very muscular one) and flaunts around calling himself the “Master of Ninjas”. Many times he has “Soft-core” fantasies of Shinobu and Kaede that he uses to coerce the band of faceless ninjas into his pervy schemes. As far as odd characters go, I’d say he would be at the top of my list.There’s one more character I’d like to mention which is Shinobu’s younger sister, Miyabi. She is rather absent from the show, but she has her moments. Unlike her sister she follows a path of “Magical Summoning” instead of traditional ninjitsu, and is actually more skilled than Onsokumaru. She openly dislikes Onsokumaru in most cases. I feel that she should have had more screen time, because she was a good character and added balance to Onsokumaru’s perverted antics.Art: 8This is one of the better aspects of the show. I really appreciate the art style and feel it has a very pleasing look to it. All the characters have unique looks to them and their designs remain consistent throughout all the episodes. The backgrounds are simple, yet unique. The whole show has very soft feel to it as well. Simply put especially considering when this show was aired it looks good, and is fun to watch.Sound: 7The sound in this show is nothing truly special, but what I do like is the dub. None of the characters have annoying voices, and I think the cast is pretty much perfect. The OP and ED are both very well chosen too. Each has a different feel in tone; however they both reflect the attitude of Ninja Nonsense very accurately. The OP is a more upbeat and catchy song and shows the cast in the same respect. Then the ED is a more mellow song with Onsokumaru being mischievous as that tends to be the center of the shows plot.Enjoyment: 9In terms of enjoyment it’s hard for someone like me to not like it. There are tons of moments that are plain funny, others that have some fanservice, and all the while being completely unserious. This show reminds me much of Disgaea, and FLCL in the terms of feel, and that is something I enjoy very much. Most shows fail to keep me interested to the point I literally watch the entire show in one sitting, but NN does this while keeping a high re-watch value.Overall: 7In the end Ninja Nonsense is much like any comedy. High re-watch value coupled with a cast of entertaining characters that are both loveable and hate-able (Onsokumaru mainly for me). It looks really good for its time of release with a nice atmosphere and fluid animation. Even better yet this is one of the few a far in between series that delivers a good English dub, that allows those who wish; to get even more involved with the characters. Unfortunately it has its pitfalls too. Mainly due to it being short with almost no character development, and a weak; virtually non-existent story. That said Ninja Nonsense has much to offer to those who are fans of comedy, and it is hard to find out if you will like it otherwise. Your best bet is to just try it out and watch an episode.

This was certainly a quirky anime, I think it's best watched in the original japanese version, with hints as to what the jokes are about. This anime is very much a comedy, and as far as a plot... Well, other than Shinobu and Kaede's friendship there isn't really much as far as storyline. Good ecchi comedic series, overall. "", 'If you wnat to see something to relax and laugh, to have fun watching, this is the right choice.Nothing inovative or very different, but just plain fun to watch. Art is cute and decently done, and characters are cute.The humor is well applyed and I laughed every single episode.I do recomend it to have a good laughing time ^^ ', ""2x2=Shinobuden is a 2004 ufotable anime based off of a Koga Ryoichi manga. Yes, the studio behind the Fate anime, Kara no Kyoukai and Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight was responsible for this. Let's have a look and see how they handled it.Story:Shinobu is studying at a Ninja school to become a kunoichi. One night she's sent on a surprise exam to steal panties. During the mission she meets Shiranui Kaede who takes pity on her and decides to help her. From there they become friends and Shinobu introduces Kaede to her wacky world of ninja hijinks.There are two issues with the comedy...in this series. First of all, some of the punchlines are way too obvious and you can tell exactly where the joke is going far in advance. Though those are in the minority and most of the time the jokes have a pretty strong surprise factor. Another issue is that some of the gags come across as more of an excuse for fan-service than actual jokes.With that out of the way, there are a lot of things this series does well. Its very good at making its zany humour work well. It also generally knows how far to go with its dirtier jokes so that they aren't overly crass while still providing that variety of humour. The series is also pretty strong with setting up cutesy moments betwixt Kaede and Shinobu.Characters:By far the worst character in the series is Onsokumaru. He's just another dirty old sensei character and, while it can be satisfying to see him get his comeuppance, he's also very much the type of character we've seen in many, many other gag anime.Overall, the characters do work pretty well for a comedic work. They don't have the complexity to carry a more serious work but they have the strong comedic quirks and dynamics to make this kind of series work. And I do quite like Kaede and Shinobu as comedic characters. I think Kaede works really well as the straight man type character while also being capable of getting some good gags off while Shinobu functions very well as a shounen action character parody. She's basically the very determined and eager type of character but put into an absurd scenario.Art:The biggest issue with the artwork is that it delves into overly fan-service territory at times. There are a lot of risque sequences in this series. On a more positive note, the character designs are pretty good and the series features a lot of really strong visual gags.Sound:There are a lot of strong actors in this series. Mizuki Nana, Kawasumi Ayak, Kugimiya Rie, Wakamoto Norio & Seki Tomokazu all deliver strong performances. The only issue with the acting is that it can be overly exaggerated during certain segments. Because this is one of those comedies that feels the need to go into over the top territory for its gags. The music is really good. It's upbeat and hectic which matches the show's tone perfectly.Ho-yay:There's quite a bit. It's clearly shown that Shinobu has romantic feelings towards Kaede and it's also implied that Kaede reciprocates those feelings.Areas of Improvement:1. The series would benefit from more zany humour and less fan-service. Ultimately, the zany humour is what it excels at while whereas the fan-service comes across as overly crass.2. The acting could use more subtlety. I get it, zany humour frequently comes with over the top performances but it also generally works better when the delivery errs more on the nuanced side.3. The pervy old man character is just over-used. We really didn't need another extreme example.Final Thoughts:2x2=Shinobuden is a pretty good anime. It has its issues. It can be overly pervy and there are some obvious gags with performances that are far too over the top but it also has a lot of strong zany humour. It has some nicely done character interactions and the relationship between Shinobu and Kaede is pretty cute. Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. in this series.

Ninin ga Shunobuden certainly has some random scenarios, but they don't chain naturally into another joke or scenario that's hilarious like what Bobobo has perfected.Plus, while this show isn't exactly stale or reuses gags too often, half of the show is ecchi humor which isn't really funny, and the other half is just slapstick which also just gets...old. Again, onsakumaru feels like don-patch from Bobobo sometimes when the gag comes together, but usually, it just feels you're watching something random for the sake of being random.

Both quickly won me over as cute and likeable characters, and thus began the fun ride, or so I thought.The moment Onsokumaru appears, he immediately came across as an annoying character, the kind who might be okay to a point for comic relief and to provide some antics for the more likeable characters to play off of. Unfortunately it wasn't just a little; he was in nearly every scene, and possibly got more total screen time than either of the above mentioned girls. That such an annoying character was a...non-stop presence pretty much ruined this anime series for me.Kaede, Shinobu, and the third main girl Miyabi could have made for a cute, funny and entertaining show, with the support of other characters such as Kaede's mom and dad, rival clan leader Izumi, and others. I could have given the show a 6 or 7 rating if only Onsokumaru had been relegated to a less frequent supporting character, or even left out entirely.

Those who thought ""I could enjoy a show like this"" when reading this review most likely will.', 'Oh no, Radiant isn’t a perfect adaptation! What has the world come to?!We get it. This isn’t one of those anime that will meet our expectations by adaptation standards. From the beginning, I’ve heard of comments about how the anime changed the tone of the story and even the way the main protagonist has been adapted into it. For the sake of this review, it will be based from an anime viewer’s perspective. I’m not going to go into the French series to look and compare every episode to see what was wrong with it.Now with that mushy stuff out of the way, you may...be wondering what exactly is Radiant. As a French comic, there’s actually not much difference to tell between this and Japanese manga. Artwork resembles shounen style characters with a fantasy world setting and even the speech patterns. Not to be judgmental but I think it’s pretty clear that Radiant is aimed for a wider audience. The story takes place in a fictional world where monsters exists. Known as “Nemesis”, they are creatures with catastrophic powers that fell into the world of humanity and causing devastating damage. A young man named Seth survived the catastrophe and vows to hunt down the Nemesis as a Sorcerer and one day hope to bring peace in their world. So begins his quest to find the legendary Radiant, the origins of the Nemesis.I’m not going to lie, the first few episodes had me bite my lips a few times. Essentially, I see Seth as a brat who may be easily be the type to die young. His recklessness and daredevil personality from the start makes him hard to follow. Not to mention, he isn’t very talented in the art of magic as demonstrated by his flying skills. The only move in the boy’s arsenal that makes a difference is his signature “Titan Punch”. But if you look just a bit carefully, it’s pretty much a shounen-style punch powered up with a signature pose and name shout. That’s damn disappointing. To make matters worse, Seth isn’t exactly a Brainiac either. The boy is so eager to prove himself that he puts an entire town in danger just so he can show the world what he can do. Looking back now, I can easily say that Seth is nothing short of a dumbass.Now, don’t worry. This show isn’t just about Seth as the adventure begins to take off after around 5 episodes. After all, it’s his quest and we follow him on his journey find this “Radiant”. On his quest, Seth encounters new allies named Melie and Doc. Now, both of these characters made a different impression to me. For instance, Melie is a bit naïve and too friendly as a girl. Sometimes, I could easily say she’s inattentive. A plot device also reveals that her personality can change into a much fierier badass when under distress. With this type of character, it’s not hard to make us wonder about the importance of her split personality. However, the anime plays it out more of a comic relief and after you’ve seen it a dozen times, it quickly becomes stale. On the other hand, Melie does make a valuable asset for the team as she seems to be a skilled Sorcerer with defensive abilities. This is a contrast to Doc, the researcher who comes off as absolutely useless in their adventure. Driven as an anti-fighter, Doc tries to avoid danger whenever possible while trying to woo Miss Melba, a café waitress that he seems to be in love with. With this oddball group of adventurers together, what could possibly go wrong?Actually, there’s a lot of wrong things about Radiant that could have been executed much better as a story. At its very baseline, I feel like the story took way too long to get us to care about it. Most of the first few episodes made me dislike the main protagonist for his childish personality. It’s very easy to find Seth irritating along with his questionable logic. Think about some of his actions and it’s not far from those of an underage teenager. Additionally, the story itself seems to be running around in circles without getting the viewers emotionally attached to it. I’m not going to lie, before I even began watching this show, I thought there would be at least some emotional value. The premise almost made the show sounded like a tragic story but instead, we get a cartoony version of a fantasy quest. It took far too long to get the show moving and by the time the gears really started kicking, it’s too late to turn back. Believe me, a story like this really needed a likable protagonist but Seth is about as one dimensional as he can get. He’s far from a larger than life character and an incredibly difficult to tolerate with his personality. The other two on his journey are hardly any better. Melie is too nice as a girl and hard to really talk about besides her split personality. Doc is pretty much the butt monkey in the show where it’s easy to point fingers at how useless he is. However, there are some supporting cast that I want to address as discarding them would be unfair.To start with, Alma is a character that I grew interest in after seeing her wisdom. She is not only a Nemesis Hunter but also a skilled Sorcerer while serving as a parental figure for Seth. The show could have taken the opportunity to build more between their relationship but instead, she is pretty much left over after the first episodes. Then, there’s Grim, the mysterious figure that our adventurous trio encounters. I was intrigued by his debut but over time, I didn’t find his character to be appealing at all. The fact is, we don’t know his true agenda in the show besides lending in some occasional help to the protagonists. Now, what about the Inquisition? Every fantasy anime like this needs a military group and government to control their world, right? To be honest, I feel like there’s little creativity put in for such an organization. They seem to have a prejudice against infected people and made up of ranks among its staff to carry out their goals. If you’re familiar with military organizations, then it’s easy to recognize some of their ranks such as general, colonel, commander, cadet, etc. Unfortunately, the show falls short on investing into the higher ranked characters. Guys like Dart Dragunov and Konrad are easily forgettable. The latter even seems to play the role of a stereotypical commander who abides with its organization’s goals. At some point in the show, I question if the Inquisition were hiding something beyond what they seem to be. For a 2-cour show, that didn’t really seem possible with such pacing. Now that brings back to my original point. This series suffers not just pacing problems but the way it made its characters. None of them are worth investing into and in the long run, they are too damaged to be repaired.Adapted by studio Lerche, their resume is a bit questionable when people talk about their fantasy projects. Anime like Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut and the more recent Shichisei no Subaru were mediocre at best in terms of production quality. Judging on Radiant by itself, there’s hardly anything eye catchy about the visual quality either. The character designs gives off a blend feel between shounen and fantasy. Meanwhile, the Sorcerers themselves are decorated with some degree of distinction. (see Melie) Then, there’s Seth, our reckless protagonist who possesses inhuman characteristics such as his horns. The battle choreography in the show remains fluid on some levels although it’s nothing spectacular. Trust me, once you’ve seen the first fight, it almost feels like you’ve seen them all. On the other hand, I do praise the world fiction of the show. It’s not only crafted with a decent amount of fantasy elements but also reinforces the importance of its setting through storytelling.Let me just say that Radiant could have been a big hitter or at least make a strong impression for a foreign project outside of Japan. It should have at least tried to get the audience’s attention. The key word here is “tried”. Because the reality is, Radiant didn’t manage to capitalize on what it advertised. Instead, it’s a show that threw away its chances and made itself look like a fool. be wondering what exactly is Radiant.

However it is still something worth watching.The whole premise of the show is for Seth to find Radiant to destroy it and save the world. Sounds fun let's go and save the world, but why. One thing I like about this anime is how they deal with the discrimination against sorcerers.  In the arc were the go to Rumble Town Seth is forced to really understand what he is trying to do and who is he trying to save. I very much like this because even...though his answer is something anyone would guess he would say he does struggle trying to understand why he is doing all of this and for who.Most of the episodes is just slice of life stuff. A lot of the episodes are just Seth, Melie, and Doc doing shit in the Sorcery city. Even though now much of anything happens they are still fun episodes which fans of the show can enjoy. As well as helps us see more of the city they stay in.One of the main strengths is the animation. The animation is very strong from start to finish. The fight scenes are so fucking beautiful which makes the show even more of a blast to watch.In conclusion the ending left on a bit of a cliff hanger but seems like shit will go down in the next season which I am excited for. Can't wait to see what the next season will do. though his answer is something anyone would guess he would say he does struggle trying to understand why he is doing all of this and for who.Most of the episodes is just slice of life stuff.

I say this because the same strengths/issues I have with that series are present here.Story (5/10):The story is about a cursed boy named Seth who becomes a sorcerer and goes out on a quest to find Radiant in order to defeat the Nemesis which inhabit this world. It’s pretty much your typical shounen premise where Seth yells he’s going to find Radiant and become the Wizard King/Hokage!You know how important first impressions are? Well the first 10 episodes leave a lot to be desired considering they’re more or less filler content. Radiant only starts to get...good during its first arc- Rumble Town at ep.11.Characters (5/10):Seth is like Asta’s twin brother. Seth is dense, dumb as bricks, reckless, childish, loud and annoying. Pretty much your typical shounen protagonist. His constant screaming isn’t as annoying as Asta, but it’s still obnoxious. Admittedly, he does get some character development later on this season e.g. he questions whether nemesis are really bad, which is good.Melie is probably my favourite out of the main cast. I like her design and her split personality caused by her curse. If she weren’t so ditzy, going along with Seth’s shenanigans and got more focus on her then i’d say she has potential to be a great character.Doc is arguably the worst character in the series. He’s a annoying, one dimensional comedic relief character. Literally the only things to come out of his mouth is about debt or him fantasising about being with Ms Melba. We get it, you like Ms Melba, now change it up!When I first saw Grimm I thought he’d be more than a cool, mysterious character. Turns out i was wrong. He doesn’t have much going for him character wise. It may change in he future.The Inquistion are the military faction in this series, and I have to say they’re pretty bland compared to others I’ve seen in shounen. The writer didn’t put in any effort to creating them and it shows:The newbie- no depth, bland design. The boy doesn’t even have a name.The vice captain- Same issue.The only character that stands out is Captain Dragunov. He’s cool, badass and seems to care about his men.The villains are generic and poorly written. For example, Konrad is pretty much a mustache twirling, shallow racist.Animation (5/10):The animation is pretty medicore, however I despise how bland all the spells look like green sparkles.Sound (4/10):The opening song is pretty enjoyable, but some of the osts are forgettable. Osts play a big part in the appeal for battle shounens, so that’s disappointing.Overall (3/10):I didn’t enjoy Radiant for the longest time. I often questioned why I continued watching it. I do believe the show gets better once you get to Rumble Town arc, so I reccomend watching up to there before making your decision whether to continue.If you’re looking for another battle shounen where you can kick back and relax then you may enjoy Radiant.

These Sorcerers being the only people who can fight back against the nemesis are feared,shunned and persecuted by the rest of the humanity.Enters our...Young Hero Seth who is another survivor of Nemesis raised by his mother figure and master, a sorceress named Alma. Seth has a resolve and goal of eradicating all nemesis and bringing peace and resolve between sorcerers and Humanity with his allies, Melie and Doc.The setting is of a historical and modern era with background and environment made for a world with all kinds of  people, sorcerers, mysterious creatures mainly the nemesis and other kinds  of magical elements which might remind you a bit of Harry Potter.Art is really well made by Lerche studios, detail drawings of character, magic particles and other creatures, bright and vibrant colours with a good finish. quality stuff.Being a French adaptation, i am really interested in this.Story is still yet developing and it will give you the feeling of a general shonen anime like naruto, bleach, fairy tail etc. But it has a unique element to it as well which is good. Also lots of mysteries and plot is getting revealed in a really slow but good and interesting manner so please be a bit patient and do give it some time while watching the series.

Nothing really unique there. A good chunk of the show is spent dabbling in miscellaneous adventures that don't add anything to the...story, this is where most people dropped the show and why Radiant is rated so lowly. I would say Radiant doesn't actually get to be pretty good until the second arc and the climax of the second arc (which is basically a quarter of the show.) If Radiant had pushed out content as heart-racing and emotionally moving as the second arc did but for the entire show instead of wasting screen-time, then the show would have easily been an 8 or a 9. Radiant very much makes me think of Black Clover in this way, an extremely mediocre and unoriginal start of the show, the setting, and an unneeded time waster of an opening explaining the show to us every episode LOL. But with patience and time you'll see that there is something more to this show.Unfortunately I can really only commend Radiant on a job well done for about 5 episodes but I still enjoyed this show and am looking forward to the season 2 since it was announced at the end of the last episode. I hope season 2 will continue with the level of content that the second arc ended with. story, this is where most people dropped the show and why Radiant is rated so lowly.

That being said, this is pretty much almost trash. The one caveat is that if you are very new to shounen and aren\'t tired of all the tropes and can tolerate this show\'s lazy writing then I suppose it\'s alright.It\'s for kids to young people (15 and below) the trope of consequences not being solid enough (kid destroys a ranch and sets off a rampage of cows) and his punishment is cleaning the wall of their residence. Even if...the other sorcerer was the one to take the brunt of the blame, the tone of it just screams ""for kids"". How they keep smiling in between shots like idiots, or posing in between dire situations, I particularly remember the cows falling on top of each other in neat rows. This show is not meant to be taken seriously but then the protagonist goes serious and says ""I want to protect everyone"", how am I supposed to take that seriously if the show by its tone is NOT meant to be taken seriously. In just comes off as ""Naruto-ish"" but I think this is a fair statement.Naruto doesn NOT have monopoly on ""I want to protect everyone"" but the thing is, when Naruto said it, you believed him. When this dude says it, I\'m just bored. Everyone laughs like an idiot, no sense of urgency, then suddenly we\'re supposed to take this kid seriously? Yeah, no, doesn\'t work like that.So if this is your kind of trash, I think that\'s great and I\'m excited because you are most likely new(ish) to anime and you have a lot to look forward to, to most people tho, this won\'t be your kind of trash.TL;DRThe show doesn\'t take itself seriously at all, but wants us to take the protagonist seriously.

Nothing really interesting about them yet, quite surprisingly the new characters introduced in the Rumble Town arc are able to carry the show better than Seth and Mélie.Probably the reason this anime will get a low score, dropped by many viewers and not garner any attention...due to the self cucked boring intros, fillers from the starting 10 eps.Overall it's a not bad shounen anime if you can survive past the boring intros and fillers. due to the self cucked boring intros, fillers from the starting 10 eps.Overall it's a not bad shounen anime if you can survive past the boring intros and fillers."", 'Radiant is a first for me and the anime community in that it is a french manga (yes, apparently they do exist) turned into an anime. This alone compelled me to check out the anime as it was something different. At least, that\'s what I initially thought.Story - 5I thought that with a french manga we would get an original story with a different perspective on the medium we know and love. Instead, I got just another cliche ridden shounen. Which if executed well can turn out pretty good. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times. From the beginning I could tell this...was going to be a disappointment as the first episode was probably the most boring first episode of any anime I had seen in recent memory. Now, I\'m not one to make knee jerk reactions after one episode so I stuck around to see how the story would play out. As expected they kept the same style at the same sluggish pace. The story for the most part was slow, boring, and what felt like filler even though this is a decently sized series at 21 episodes. Even when the story gets to its ""hype"" moments later on they still feel underwhelming just because of how the show was handled. So the story was lacking, but there are ways around this.Characters - 5That way is compelling characters which this story has very few of. Off the bat we are introduced to our main character Seth, a sorcerer, who acts very much like your standard shounen protagonist. His power isn\'t very creative either so its not like he stands out from the crowd very much. The side kicks that go alongside our main character have nice designs but personality is lacking. As the series progresses we are introduced to a few more from the cast who in my opinion are far more interesting then our main group. Yet, they don\'t stick around for very long but I\'m hopeful they will play a more vital role in the future.Animation - 7I was surprised that a foreign property like Radiant would have some nice animation and art so it was a pleasant surprise. The animation stays consistent for the most part and its easy on the eyes. The characters themselves do not look cookie cutter which I like. They look like they actually have some personality even if that is sadly not the case. Action scenes are decently handled as well. Overall, for a non Japanese manga turned anime the animation was quite good.Sound - 8By far and away this is the main reason why you should watch Radiant. The opening song alone is straight fire and instantly gets me hyped for the coming episode. Even if you don\'t end up watching the anime, at least watch the opening. The ending song is decent and the voice acting is fine as far as I can tell, but the opening is something else.Enjoyment - 6The show started off slow and most of the filler episodes which took up a good bit were  boring, but the content towards the end was decent enough. The characters outside of a couple later on were not very compelling nor was I interested in their motivations or journey. I liked the music and the animation though so maybe I\'m just a sucker for a good OP, but overall it was a decent enough watch. I am curious to see where the story will go next as of the time of writing this a season 2 was announced. Here\'s hoping for some more compelling story lines.

But I got up to date with the manga translations and the characters actually gain quite a bit of depth rather quickly. Seth is what you'd expect from a kid with a big dream, he's really basic at first. However, with the way journeys go, he starts to act like he's seen some things slowly as the story progresses. Melie starts out really annoying too, but once she grows in confidence from hanging around Seth for a bit, she gets...a good amount less annoying. I feel like it started out weak, but definitely got stronger over the course of a few episodes. By the current release of episode 14, the story is starting to hit its stride.

Recently upon making this review, this I believe is one of the only anime adaptations where the source material does not come from JapanRadiant is an adaptation of a French manga (manfra) which already is a rare occurrence in anime. Radiant has fantastic world building and storytelling with interesting characters and is one hell of a slow burner anime. Right off the bat, it has a lighthearted tone with its major strong point being comedy and it feels as if it's a slice of life anime at times. The problem with that is it isn't attractive, it's...not too interesting but it's bearable to watch. The first half though is overshadowed by the series' intense second half, which practically changes almost everything you knew about this show.This story is not as generic in the first half as you may think, it's simply just too lighthearted and not as intense as you want from a Shonen. Seth doesn't aim to be the best sorcerer unlike many claim, but his motivation is more comparable to the likes of Luffy from One Piece, where in Seth's case he searches for Radiant. He's unlikable to a degree, but to an understandable point. He's been discriminated his entire life due to being an infected person and always on the run with Alma. Seth lacked the proper interaction with other people since he was always feared. The story's strongest points in the first half though is practically hiding how intense the story is with how lighthearted it goes about things.For the first ten episodes of Radiant, do not expect much. It's a slice of life comedy mixed in with action and world building which becomes every important in the second half of Radiant. The Rumble Town Arc is what makes Radiant good, and the mood completely changes, and it may even shock you a bit. It goes in depth into the injustice for the infected and how they are discriminated. This whole arc is filled to the brim with amazing character development and action. The second half alone makes Radiant a 9/10 story, even if it feels slow in the beginning, I assure you the second half sure as hell makes up for what it lacked.Radiant does not have the best animation, it's average at best. The animation lacks the intensity and fluidity that you want in a fight scene in anime. The art remains consistent throughout the series, and the animation does as well. The best fight in this season has to be Seth vs Konrad, the choreography was very well done, but it lacked the fluidity it needed to truly shine. not too interesting but it's bearable to watch.

Fantasy magical battle trash, something mindless I could just enjoy. And at first it did seem just like that with some of its lamer episodes and bizarre idea of character design. But once the show moved into its second half, something else reared it's head and revealed this show understood more than it was letting on.Story is pretty simple, nothing incredible but it's mostly competent at what it does....The story is slow during the first half of the show, mostly focusing on Seth's growing as a mage and learning something about the world. The second half however starts greying the morality of the characters, opens up new possible ideas and peaks with a monstrous villain and a tragic villain. It's got potential to continue improving but as it stands, it feels like the jumping off point for something far better. The actual writing is up and down, a lot of the comedic elements tend to fall flat, but there are some standout running gags that continue to be amusing. The story is easily the biggest bar to entry as i'm sure it'll turn off the more discerning viewer and that is a shame because there is more to unpack than you initially see.Art is pretty decent. The spell effects are nice and clear, the animation during fight scenes is pretty good, there's not too many flubs I could spot but it's nothing spectacular. It serves the purpose it's needed for.Sound is pretty forgettable. I can't remember any distinct tracks from it, the voice acting is just fine. I've not got a lot to say on it and even the intro i'm already forgetting and getting mixed up with other shows.The characters are easily the best part of this show. This anime was adapted from a French manga, (or manfra, idk) and it definitely shows in some of the odder designs but there's some real standouts among the cast. Whilst at first some of the characters are irritating and simple, they do develop as the story goes, Seth especially becomes a far more endearing character during the second half and whilst he's definitely not Asta levels of annoying, there's a lot to be desired. The supporting cast are pretty decent, Doc serves to be a consistent source of good humour and even the villains get larger personalities than i'd expect from a show like this, Black Clover again being a good point of comparison as to how villains usually are in shows like this.I didn't expect to enjoy this show as much as I did. I must admit I put it off for a good couple weeks due to the nature of the show but when I did get back into it, I was hooked for each week it was on. If you can get through it's first half and find yourself enjoying the characters and the writing, you're in for a treat in the second half.Radiant is definitely screaming for a second season to really expand it and show off everything it has to offer. I can't help but feel doubtful it will get one though due to its popularity and that big barrier to entry which is a real shame. If you have any interest in a show with this kind of premise, you'll enjoy it. If you don't, you probably won't be able to push through to when it really starts to shine, so just go at your own pace.In the end, Radiant really brought to light with a generic looking fantasy battle anime can do once it spreads its wings and starts to fly.

The tone of the series is way more childish, for example in one of Seth flashback we see other children beating him which trigger his power, in the manga, it's because they were taking a knife to torture him). That alone it wouldn't have been much of a problem but combined with the fact that they made every character stupid, add more moral and remove the part which show why people have reasons to fear sorcerers, when you combine all of that it just feels like a version for stupid (or children, it's kind of the same thing).The characters really being the worst part, Meli is a different person and Seth now doesn’t develop at all and stay the morron that he is at the begining.

This time I will tackle the anime Radiant.To start with, Radiant originates from a French manga so it should already be different than Japanese manga, right? Actually, have you not told me it\'s originally a French story I would have branded it as just another Japanese adaptation. There is nothing that sets itself apart from Japanese manga. So what is Radiant? Radiant is an anime done by studio Lerche and consists of 21 episodes. (That\'s rare, 21 episodes.) Lerche has been and still is a studio that can and has produced very good anime and it is a studio you...should know.Plot/Story: The story is set in a fantasy-esque world that is threatened by giant zerba-like striped creatures called Nemesis. The only way to successfully kill them is either by the government-like Inquisition or by sorcerers. Sorcerers however are called \'infected\' because they survived contacts with the Nemesis. They are branded as impure, evil, and contagious. They bring diseases and are all around not really people to begin with. That\'s how the regular human views sorcerers, such as our protagonist Seth. The story follows Seth as he sets out on a journey to find the mysterious island Radiant (title giver) where it is said to be the birthplace of all Nemesis. He hopes to destroy Radiant and to eradicate the Nemesis at the root and by doing that that the people stop dehumanizing and hunting down sorcerers like himself. On his journey he meets a few companions and ends up on the sorcerer haven Artemis where sorcerers are not discriminated.For a story out of a French feather you would expect more than this. What we have here is a fairly typical shōnen plot trope of the Main Character wanting to go place X or become X. While such a thing is not bad in itself, those tropes are story structures you can use as a blueprint and build your story up on that or around it, Radiant does not do such a thing. Party goes to place X to do this and that, arc ends with a potential end villain who has to be defeated. Such  formula is nice and all but it does not hold up on its own. \'Go to place X / become X\' is a very simplistic formula. Like with other shōnen who use that build they cannot solely rely on that alone and judt let the story happen as they go on that journey. Such stories live off of the character\'s story and the sub-plots that may even revolve around the end goal. While I must admit that with only 21 episodes the amount of Story building for a shōnen is limited but you still have to catch the viewer\'s attention in order to get them to watch more than that. Radiant fails in that regard. But to that later.Art: Even though Lerche can get very pretty this is jot their best work in that regard. The whole anime has some sort of milky film over all colors and it makes it look too soft. For romance or comedy such tactic may be their strength but not for a shōnen. The best animated part is towards the end of the last arc, and I hate to break it to you Radiant, but that\'s way to late. Most viewers already turned off and great animation at the end does not bring more viewers, it just pleases those who are still watching (or doing compilations).Sound: Sound, huh. Standard all up to the last part of the last arc. Yet again like in the art department they increase the great SFX for those 1 or 2 episodes but that\'s it. I\'m sure the sound was there, I just didn\'t realize it. Such a thing can be a strength but only if used on specific occasions to increase the tension or similar things. If the sound effects and music aren\'t recognizable for the most part then I also can\'t point out anything positive. One thing tho stands out like a fire in the dark. The opening of Radiant, ""Utopia"". A very hype and bombastic opening full of adrenaline, all around a great song but wasted on this anime. If for anything at all this show\'s OP might get remembered.Characters: Okay, since I don\'t want to go into major spoilers, let me out down the later episode characters, primarily the villains. Bland and underdeveloped. That pretty much sums it up. Although I am not going through the characters specifically, I have to say that a certain group at the end lacks charisma and anticipation, which is the fault of them only then appearing. We just dont know anything at all. I know that the story is not over but I have to judge with what I have, and it ain\'t look pretty. As for 2 other characters, one of them is heavily cardboard Ed and just evil for the sake of being evil. Sorry, but with such a one dimensional personality you won\'t go far (unless you\'re MHA and you are mainstream). As for the other one, meh. Too weak. Now for the more centered characters:Starting of with the least important, Alma. Alma is the foster parent of Seth. To put her in the easiest light, she exists. That\'s pretty much it. Nothing of her screams ""badass"" or ""great character"". One of many character you will forget.Next up is Doc, a researcher of who studies the Nemesis (I think). He\'s annoying and that\'s all there is to him. His interactions with Miss Melba, a coffee shop owner who he is in love with are equally as annoying to watch as him being alone. All he does is complain to Seth, worry about debts and talking about how great it would be if he marries Miss Melba. I don\'t know why he was written this way but it was not a wise idea.Before going to the next one I\'d like to skip that person and switch their places with the first one, meaing now comes the main protagonist Seth. While Seth is similar to goofy and simple-minded shōnen characters he does have some potential to become more aggressive, especially after the last arc that gave him a significant character development, even though that development was a bit iffy in terms of writing. Other than that, the attacks he are countable on one hand and I\'m not sure that\'s something good or bad. Okay, it\'s bad. Why? Because his attacks and moves get very repetitive very fast. Big weak point. And if you know typical shōnen main characters then you also know Seth.Now onto the last main character that I skipped for Seth, Mélie. I\'m gonna say it right now, Mélie is the best character of the entire show, period. The Gimmick she has is that she can switch from her shy and playful nature to a sadistic and aggressive one. So a split personality of some sort. That\'s also the best she has going for her, apart from her chest. A change in personality, especially into an aggressive one is always a fun aspect of a character. A lot of development is also not present. Seth is the who get the most development of all of them and that is sad.Enjoyment and verdict: So, was it an enjoyable series. Not. Really. Radiant is a pretty avarage anime with a terrible start and first half, and such a thing can very easily kill an anime, and that\'s what happened here. I actually have no excuse for actually finishing this anime, but now that i have I can close this anime and not touch it again. Sorry, Mélie. Do I recommend it? You an certainly enjoy it but there is far better out there and you are almost as happy as before if you have not watched the series or if you have. And with that cryptic line I\'m done with this review. See you in the next one. should know.Plot/Story: The story is set in a fantasy-esque world that is threatened by giant zerba-like striped creatures called Nemesis. The only way to successfully kill them is either by the government-like Inquisition or by sorcerers. Sorcerers however are called \'infected\' because they survived contacts with the Nemesis. They are branded as impure, evil, and contagious. They bring diseases and are all around not really people to begin with. That\'s how the regular human views sorcerers, such as our protagonist Seth. The story follows Seth as he sets out on a journey to find the mysterious island Radiant (title giver) where it is said to be the birthplace of all Nemesis. He hopes to destroy Radiant and to eradicate the Nemesis at the root and by doing that that the people stop dehumanizing and hunting down sorcerers like himself. On his journey he meets a few companions and ends up on the sorcerer haven Artemis where sorcerers are not discriminated.For a story out of a French feather you would expect more than this.

Demons called Nemesis cause havoc, survivors are cursed, and a lucky bunch can wield Fantasia as sorcerers. While this setup echoes the Shonen formula, Radiant tries to put its own spin on things, even if it takes a while to uncover.In the midst of Radiant's well-trodden foundations—complete with a youthful and naive protagonist, extravagant battles, and an impossible mission—there are some elements that appear to set it apart. The series introduces the notion of sorcerers as an oppressed...minority, a refreshing twist, and their plight under the scrutiny of the Inquisition adds intrigue. As Seth, Mélie, and Doc take center stage and embark on their mission in Rumble Town, the scope of the world's complexity becomes evident.While Radiant's first season allocates much of its time to character introductions and world-building, there's a sense of inconsistency as certain moments might feel less impactful. As the story unfolds, the narrative starts to find its footing, leading to a more pronounced conflict in the latter half that concludes in an engaging manner, leaving room for anticipation.Radiant's maiden voyage might not be a resounding triumph, yet it does manage to capture some attention—particularly from those with a passing interest in anime. For enthusiasts of the Shonen genre, it enters the scene with a degree of promise, treading familiar ground while attempting to infuse it with a different perspective. The show's visuals boast a lively quality, and its core characters are well-rounded, lending it a semblance of uniqueness. What stands out is Radiant's subtle exploration of real-world themes, coupled with a focus on character evolution that slightly distinguishes it from the typical Shonen blueprint. minority, a refreshing twist, and their plight under the scrutiny of the Inquisition adds intrigue.

I can't enjoy itI mean I would have dropped the anime at episode three or four out of boredom had I not read the original material.I don't blame people who still enjoyed the anime, while being stripped from almost everything that truly made its success, but I've watched here and there a few episodes depending on the particular scenes I wanted to see animated and it just hurts to watch.So if people were wondering why they find the adaptation kind of boring or bland, I'll explain, while avoiding spoilers as much as possible.The anime is slow. Like, Naruto-level slow. And I forgave that...15 years ago, but I can't do that past 2017. Especially since the original material is quite quick-paced and always seems to know where it's going.Second, the characters are off? Like, all of them? I mean, even Mélie, whose character is so tied to the storyline, somehow looks like a weaker, less capable version of herself ? It's a shame since the author is so attached to giving his feminine characters space to develop and stand their ground... And why is Seth so bland? He's actually supposed to be a thoughtful, genuine, witty character you know ? (at least after his origin-story arc)Then, while I know it's so tied to the language it was written in, but the lines were supposed to be so direct, precise, and full of jokes and puns... I can actually guess the adaptation is not that far from the japanese-translated material... Because culture is tied to language. And, well, those characters were supposed to be French. (I'll miss you Dragunov...)I've seen people praise the coloring, but I'm so used to the author amazing color-spread and beautiful color palettes, I just wish they had someone like that to adjust the lighting. The anime scenes look bland in comparison...The animation is barely passable. On today's standards I would say it's awful. The characters lack expressiveness, the way they move barely gives any emotion...In a nutshell, this version is both sexist and disrespectful of the manga. If you can, learn French and get the original material. The English translation is decent too. But then, if you enjoy this version somehow, I'm glad, for real ! I just want people to know that it could have been even better 15 years ago, but I can't do that past 2017.

It is a shame that the first volume of the even better french comic was stretched out to the first 10 episodes. A lot of bland filler content makes the beginning of the anime a rather boring and only mildly funny watch - but it's worth it when the real adventure begins at episode 11.The basic story is that sorceres hunt beings that fall from the sky called the Nemesis. However, it takes depths that other shonen anime with similar premisses do not have: The sorcerers are considered tainted outcasts, barely better...than the monsters they hunt. Acceptance, finding one's place in the world and human error are only a fraction of what themes this anime coveres. However, because of the rather slow pacing and it's toning down the intensity of the comic the first 10 episodes just scratch the surface - the real story begins ep 11 with the main arc - and it's good.The sound and art direction is alright. It's design doesn't stand out too much compared to other shonen - it's strength is definitely the colorful character design and the world design itself. It has a solid magic system and, what I personally always enjoy, a political hierarchy with a couple plot twists here and there.Other than that the anime has not the best fighting scenes but it's doing enough to make it look interesting and flashy, if not always polished.Sadly the main character is the most bland of the cast. He has a generic goal and is more on the annoying side at the beginning of the story but as he powers up even he gets more interesting. The rest of the group is totally different and actually has interesting personalities. Friends and foes alike have funny quirks and great designs.There are a couple characters who are on the grey side, either with political or personal interests. It's a bliss to watch them interact with each other and see layers of depth revealed as backgrounds get explained and the story continues.The target audience is younger kids but as the story grows it starts to talk about more mature themes as well. The original comic handles this better with a faster pacing and adding more mature jokes that the anime looses for most parts.However: If you can get past a slow beginning I recommend checking this out. There is always the option to skip the filler (and only watch ep 1-3, maybe 9 and then 11+) but I actually enjoyed the funny parts and the character interactions.Overall  it's a good watch and has a lot more depth than the beginning of the series shows.At the time I've written this review the anime is not quite at it's end (at ep 19/21) but the main arc is finished. This  leaves the last 2 eps with a bit of epilogue filler that won't change this rating. than the monsters they hunt.

Since this story was originally written by a French person; it could be a misunderstood culture.  They constantly switch between serious and over the top unbelievable comedy.  It\'s too bad the serious scenes come off as boring because there is no sense of risk.  The comedy ruins the pacing of the show when used in serious situations, and they do it often.  Also, the jokes are on the level of cringy, puny dad jokes.  A giant kracken just took our friend and will eat him soon.  Lets spend the next few episodes...joking about how funny it is.  The training is completely out of place, badly paced, and the power ups are awkward boring.  He literally had his seven tails power take over his body to rampage.Decisions made by the people don\'t make sense (For example: Season 2, episode 1; The leader of the army believes his own soldier is the enemy disguise and orders his underlings to fire cannons at it.  Then the not smart guy says, lets wait and see if he can talk.  Turns out he was just a soldier.  The joke falls very flat)  Ex machina nonsense solves problems more than common sense.  This dude uses his My Hero Academy Detroit Smash attack far too much.  His mana gives him God powers randomly and it doesn\'t even make sense.  The explanation isn\'t satisfying.  He should be able to use his God powers all the time; but plot dictates when he can or cannot use them.  The commoners are either dumber than monkeys, or 99.99% of the world population are racist bigots.  I could go on and on.Art: 8I have low standards, and there are no complaints here.Sound:  6The English voice actors are fairly bad, but not pure trash.  The translation from French to English may not come out as well.Character:  2Totally bad.  Not one of the main characters has common sense.  A extremely high proportion of all the characters are complete morons or bigoted racists.  You are better off living with a gorilla than with one of these characters.Enjoyment:  6I had more questions about this show afterwards, then I did while watching it.  Why don\'t they show how someone gets cursed?  Why wasn\'t the mucus cursed kid contagious and how did he know it was safe?  In reality, 99.9999999% of humans would know mucus, snot, bodily fluids spread disease.  Why isn\'t anyone worried about disease in this show?  or is the main character just a complete idiot?  Why does the imperial army employ sorcerers, but simultaneously executes proven good ones without a second thought?  Why would immigrants take a airship to Artimus ""trash land"" instead of the other 99% better villages around the world?  How could soldiers murder each other with swords and get away with blaming it on non-sword wielding children?  oh, in every episode something moronic happens and the answer is:  NOTHING HAS ANY MEANING AT ALL.Overall:  3Ya, I watched the entire first season.

The story is really what carries this show, everything else is only slightly above average.The show is a little bit like black clover in a few ways but it does everything that it had in common a thousand times better.The animation was pretty good in everything besides when the action picks up. they do this stupid animation technique where they blink past and forward frames really...fast to try and make it look like something is moving fast. it just end up looking lazy and bad.The characters are interesting and none of them are too annoying, but they butchered my boy g's character later in the show.Overall a solid show and is for sure worth the watch. fast to try and make it look like something is moving fast. it just end up looking lazy and bad.The characters are interesting and none of them are too annoying, but they butchered my boy g's character later in the show.Overall a solid show and is for sure worth the watch."", 'I have to be honest, MyAL is getting a lot more negative over the past few years that I have been using it. This anime is definitely above a 7 and less than an 8, which is why I gave it an 8 (because the reviews were just so negative).There is a lot to like about the series. It introduces you to a world that is quite different from what you\'d typically see in a shounen anime. Furthermore, there are a lot of themes that this anime explores that are never explored in other anime; the content of its first season is surprisingly relevant to...modern political problems.The story starts off as showing the the world divided between Magicians and the ""Inquisition"". The theme is very reminiscent of One Piece, in the sense that you are rooting for the Magicians who are _against_ the law in a certain sense.We are introduced to ""Seth"" a burgeoning young magician who has a mysterious past, and uses is power in a different way to most magicians. Seth sets off on a journey to find a way to defeat the ""monsters"" that attack people once and for all. Little does he know that his resolve is going to be altered significantly; everything is not what it seems.Radiant is an anime that reminds me a lot of how Naruto, Fairy Tail and other greats started off - small and with a growing cost of characters.The only problem with this particular season is that it has a lot of filler episodes that make things a little annoying. I think that this will be remedied in the next season, so I hope you can bear with this season for the next one.I enjoyed this season, and I strongly look forward to the next season that the anime has in store. So please, don\'t give into the haters, and give this anime a chance.

Little does he know that his resolve is going to be altered significantly; everything is not what it seems.Radiant is an anime that reminds me a lot of how Naruto, Fairy Tail and other greats started off - small and with a growing cost of characters.The only problem with this particular season is that it has a lot of filler episodes that make things a little annoying. I think that this will be remedied in the next season, so I hope you can bear with this season for the next one.I enjoyed this season, and I strongly look forward to the next season that the anime has in store. So please, don\'t give into the haters, and give this anime a chance. Its interesting, funny, slightly insightful and something that you can definitely relax to.', ""This is an underrated anime.Screenplay - 9/10The story is simple on surface yet it touches so many deep dark crevices of the society - Racism, Hate speeches, Riots, Fear, PTSD, self doubt and are depicted in a way that do justice to those arcs.

The animation quality was good.Direction - 6/10This is where the series hits a nail on its leg. Uneven pace - Slow character introduction arcs yet deep impactful scenes are handled faster.

A fantasy world, magic systems - and a pretty cool magic system at that. And I think of shonen anime/manga as a comfy and safe genera that I'm always happy to just lose myself in.That being said, every time I find myself getting into this story. Getting into the world setup and the plot starting to move along. A character (usually the main, or doc) has to open their mouth and ruin it for me.Right now, my only real complaint that's keeping me from being less...harsh on this show is. The main character is just too dumb. At first I thought he was regular level shonen hero dumb. Which is fine, you learn to love the dimwitted hero with a heart of gold. Or at least I do. But Seth is really pushing the boundary of 'naive if not a little slow' to 'how does he know to dress himself?' almost to 'if he feels hunger pains, does someone still have to tell him to eat?'Case in point, it's season 2 and other characters have to remind Seth what his goal in life is. You know the main plot, his 'I'm going to find the one piece/become hokage/catch them all?At this point I've got 2 or 3 more episodes left in me before I'll need to take a step back, and if I can't restart it after a few weeks, I'll have to mark this as did not finish. harsh on this show is.

He is a sorcerer, one who has survived an encounter with a “Nemesis” - monsters that attack humans.  Although these people with magic or fantasia are able to use their powers to protect people from the Nemesis, sorcerers are usually stigmatized or feared by normies. The young warlock brings it upon himself to end the hate and discrimination; he hears the the legend of the origin of all Nemesis, Radiant, and decides...destroy it.A similar set up is seen over and over again, like with Saiyuki, Blood +, Claymore (made a review for that), even X-Men, etc.: those same people who have the ""evil""  are the ones who are protecting the ""normal humans."" It all depends on the writing, character and plot development that will differentiate an anime from this somewhat basic storyline.At the beginning, Radiant just felt like a kid’s show.  Seth goes about his journey to this mythical place and meets strange characters, such as an equally naive chick with a split personality disorder, and others that seem flat, as they only react and don’t seem to think for themselves. So many random things were happening that didn’t contribute to the build-up of the story, which was so frustrating.The first ten episodes felt like fillers. Usually, fillers come after the audience has been able to “bond” or become invested in the characters, but not with Radiant. Right off the bat, silly mini-plots were presented with characters that seemed empty-headed. There were too many coincidences that were too close for comfort. I actually almost stopped watching because every episode Seth would announce how determined he was to go to Radiant. YES, OKAY, so stop dilly-dallying. It made me feel like I just wanted it over with, or I was wasting my time on such a childish/superficial plot. It was for viewers who just wanted to enjoy in-the-moment entertainment, without there needing to be any progression, which is usually appropriate for children.Come the second half of the season, the much needed plot development finally arrived. From what I’ve researched, this is where the show comes to terms with the manga. No explicit spoilers will be disclosed, but it was quite a jump from inane mundanities to great growth, excellent dialogue, and deep reflections of current realities. Though it lacked shelling out or explaining some phenomena, there was good enough alignment in its story elements that really propelled the narration forward, and even pushed the seemingly shallow characters.Radiant became a story on the rawness and innocence of a child who just wanted to make things better for the world, but has yet to face nor succumb to its harshness. It became a tale on how he’s growing up and really just learning about life. His innocent beliefs, values, and convictions - on kindness, discrimination - come to face with the “real world,” and how the dialogue executed that was beautiful. It’s precisely his adamant childlike spirit that pulls the audience. Sometimes, even if the plot can be predictable, with good writing and screenplay chemistry, it will definitely draw you in.If it weren’t for the feeble first half of the show, some loopholes, and “convenient” storytelling, this anime would have definitely had a higher rating.

Unfortunately, getting much better means ham-fisting vapid social commentary using the vocabulary and mindset of a four year old. I probably skipped half the show, jumping ten seconds at a time, to avoid the cringe worthy repetitive dialogue and time wasting kindergarten jokes.Radiant is supposedly adapted from a French manga. I don\'t know how that\'s supposed to work. Isn\'t that just a comic book? It doesn\'t really matter since the whole show is no different than your typical Japanese fantasy shounen with an overpowered MC, magic, monsters, and flying ships. Except...it is one of the worst around, with highly simplistic plot threads and storytelling aimed at a grade school audience, cheap animation, cheap fight scenes, bland art and sound, and an utterly detestable and braindead protagonist that blindly runs around and screams nonstop like a crying toddler that didn\'t get his way. If he\'s not screaming and yelling and acting like a loud simpleton, he\'s running headfirst into things and destroying everything within sight, repeating some tired childish mantra about being the best or saving the world every five seconds, or being a complete dufus in conversations so the writers can stretch the runtime and explain the premise for the umpteenth time. It\'s the worst of Fairy Tail, One Piece, Naruto, and Black Clover with none of the charm. He is so bad, I spent most of my time skipping any and all scenes with him in it. And the one or two other characters in his party are either just convenient tools for plot armor, or just for some grating juvenile humor, and have dimensionless otherwise. Most of the villains end up being far more interesting. Speaking of Fairy Tail, the art style is basically a dumbed down version of it, with some characters, like the inquisitor general, being just a ripped off version of Gajeel. The MC in particular looks like a deformed version of that useless black haired kid in the Fairy Tail guild. I always have to look askew whenever the MC\'s face is prominently in a scene because it\'s so repulsive. The proportions are all wrong, and it\'s like that 100% of the time, meaning it\'s intentional and not some bad outsourced work.The attempt at social commentary starts from the very first second, with the MC constantly complaining and bitching about being ostracized and hated for being a sorceror and possessing magic, without even an ounce of thought to his own actions. He\'s literally bringing death, destruction, and famine with his antics and utter recklessness, running around blowing things up for fun, destroying crops, buildings, water sources, and people\'s livelihoods. He continues this trend all along his journey, any loss of life, limb, or property can be smiled away, never learning. It completely undermines any arguments over equality, acceptance, bigotry, etc. that he frequently spouts. He is the living embodiment of everything people fear him to be. It becomes quite meta as the adults are frequently scolding him for his simplemindedness and stupidity, and yet he never changes and most consequences are brushed off as trivial in the story. The author is basically making a mockery of himself in which he secretly criticizes his own work. During the second half, the social commentary shifts over to larger scale xenophobia as an inquisitor in a factory town attempts to purge the ""dirty and impure"" immigrant population within. Like everything else in the show, it\'s poorly supported with zero nuance and dumbed down for a grade school audience and drawn with the simplest lines. It\'s basically a parody of a serious situation. A really bad disney movie with a cartoon villain. Not once did I care for their plight. There are no real consequences after all. There\'s even a magic coffin that can hide people during the whole ordeal. There is a last ditch effort at the end of the season to convey angst, introspection, and SOME character development in the MC, but it\'s ulimately meaningless and he goes back to being the same buffoon he\'s always been. it is one of the worst around, with highly simplistic plot threads and storytelling aimed at a grade school audience, cheap animation, cheap fight scenes, bland art and sound, and an utterly detestable and braindead protagonist that blindly runs around and screams nonstop like a crying toddler that didn\'t get his way.

Apparently, Radiant spawns monsters called nemesis that wreck havoc and sorcerers are the only ones that stand a chance. Radiant is also notable because as far as I know, it's the first French anime to be produced. That said, how does it fare as a story? This could easily he seen as a generic Shonen title and in many ways it is, however, it really impressed me with its strong anti-racism themes. Sorcerers are hated simply because they have powers others don't and are thereby discriminated against.Seth's...plan is to destroy Radiant in the hopes of stopping said discrimination. Speaking of Seth, in the pantheon of Shonen protagonists, he'd probably place somewhere in the middle: better than Natsu, not as cool as Tanjiro. Also, there were some logical inconsistencies that plagued this show that I found hard to look past. For instance, sorcerers are hated for the powers they possess, however, the inquisitors (the team that hunts them) also have weird powers, but aren't feared by the people... That's odd.Also of note is the world mechanics. I think the world of Radiant can be pretty intriguing, but I think it'll need more building in the second season, so I'll probably withhold judgment on that. Finally, it had some decent animation and music and the opening theme song is by a band I've recently started to enjoy, so there's that. If you are a Shonen fan, this is certainly one you'd appreciate and enjoy. plan is to destroy Radiant in the hopes of stopping said discrimination.

It serves the anime when it needs to but never exceeds its’ station, so to speak.Animation - 7/10SPOILERSCharacters - 9/10 interesting, pass the silhouette test (makes sense coming from the French, a culture that so highly values fashion), the curses are unique and inventive, the voice acting (dubbed) is pretty good on a whole except when it comes to Seth....His voice actor portrays him as way too pathetic and fails to make him cool outside of fights. He shines brightest when giving potency to moments of pathos but is grating in most other scenes. As a protagonist Seth is fairly generic with his can do attitude and Naruto style rejection by society (replace the swing with being burned at the stake and replace the orange jumpsuit with a dudebro sleeveless hoodie) he doesn’t get much development until the second half where he learns that there are decent inquisition members and that the Nemesis aren’t always evil monsters. I’m interested to see how his “save all the good people” works in the long run.Melie’s defense and offense bipolarity acts as an excellent compliment to Seth’s bullheaded brawler style. Her curse of split-personality swap reminds me a lot of Launch from Dragonball but with more depth. I’m looking forward to seeing her flashbacks in season two that explain the backstory hinted at in this season.Doc acts as the reluctant voice of reason that frequently gets the comedic relief treatment as well (a little too often IMO) but he has the kids best interests at heart and generally knows what he’s doing. I can tell that his curse of xenomorph-style resurrecting himself will be highly valuable in later seasons. It’s actually refreshing to see the older-than-they-look character be shota instead of loli.Grimm has excellent style, a cool aesthetic and badass combat abilities. It’s clear that he’s after some specific Domitors and am curious to see where his character is going.Alma is the wise, rough, one-armed (Shanks) and badass mentor to Seth. While Grimm is the too cool for school mysterious badass, Alma is the no nonsense matriarch with memory loss.Plot - 7/10 pacing is not great, it has its proper generic shonen setup but then the pacing slows too much when developing the world building and training Seth (would have liked to see more traditional training) the Rumble town was excellent with proper escalation climax and deescalation of conflict over a satisfying 6 episodes. The amount of deescalation does seem a little excessive however since the climax was 2 episodes long (16-17) and then the deescalation of 5 episodes after sort of morphs into the next arc that doesn’t even really start until the next season.Summary: Radiant is a fantastic start for French shonen with distinct vibes of both Fairy Tail (combat punchy magic) and especially One Piece (traveling from island to island in search of the Radiant=the One Piece, three factions of navy=inquisition, pirates=sorcerers, and the common folk caught in the middle, the MC’s family are revolutionary badasses) the wild card that mixes things up, however, is the Nemesis. They act as both the central mystery (are they mindless monsters? Where is the radiant? What is it and why do Nemesis come from there?) and the third faction in the showP.S. whether or not you enjoyed Radiant (and the second season is looking leagues better than the first) y'all should check out Ankama's other animated works! Wakfu is amazing and the 4th and final season just got crowd-funded on kickstarter, meeting its goal in half a day and becoming the most funded animated show ever on Kickstarter!

This is honestly a great anime with amazing artwork and good story with actually decent comedy moments mixed with heart felt betrayal and great fighting scenes.Coming across this anime for the first time and seeing a rating of 6.9 completely put...me off, but I am so grateful I gave this show a go.

Rinne no Lagrange,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11227/Rinne_no_Lagrange,"['First attempt at a longer review, let\'s see how it goes. It\'s only been 2 episodes, so this review probably won\'t matter all that much later on. Will try to update! So here\'s my 2 cents...As of Episode [2]-The Story [8]:Kyouno Madoka is a high-spirited and confident High School girl who enjoys helping those who are in need. One day, she meets a strange girl named Lan, and is then asked to pilot a Robot (yes, the mecha in this show are called \'Robot\') in order to protect her home town from invading aliens who have come to attack Earth. This is a somewhat generic...mech-related anime plotline, but it has lots of potential to become something greater than what it seems.The Visuals [9]:Not much to say here, it\'s Production I.G. after all. In short, the animation in this show has been great so far. The movements of the characters flows along naturally, and their expressions are done flawlessly, and it\'s a joy to watch the characters interact. The mechas are designed by none other than Nissan, and sports some very interesting ideas. They are very reminiscent of the LFOs\' designs in Eureka 7, due to the curves and colouring over the main body, its ability to transform from a vehicle form to a more humanoid form, and the green particle-like light that flows behind them when surfing/flying. The designs for the characters and the mecha has been mixed among the audience, but overall I loved them.The Sound [9]:The Voice Actors for this show has been doing a really good job so far. They fit the character\'s image and you can really feel the mood and emotion in the character\'s interaction. The Soundtrack has been the most memorable part of this show for me. With Nakajima Megumi doing both the OP (a strange catchy tone that gets you all pumped up) and ED (a cheerful J-Pop that take away all your tensions upon finishing the episode), you can get into and leave this show satisfied. The BGM that plays throughout the show also brings out the atmosphere of the situation, as well as makes every single scene in the show a joy to sit through.The Characters [9]:Rinne no Lagrange did what I believe most other anime of its genre failed at with its characters. They gave us a confident character who is very fun to watch, yet doesn\'t annoy the audience with her personality and pride. This is thanks to a big sister type of character who is there to keep her in her place, and a young girl, who may appear emotionless at first, but actually has a personality that helps her moderate the lead\'s behaviour. This is just one example of how the character interactions help make the characters more interesting to watch in this show, as through the characters conversations and actions, we can get a more in-depth view on the personality underneath what first appears to be a generic character.Enjoyment [10]:This show is just a joy to watch. From the etheral dream-like opening sequence at the beginning, to the wonderful character chemistry that we are presented with throughout the show, to the high tension mecha battle that flows about flawlessly. It never misses a beat, and I just love every single minute of it. As long as Production I.G. doesn\'t end up pulling another Guilty Crown on me again, I will without a doubt give this great anime a ""maru!""Overall [9] mech-related anime plotline, but it has lots of potential to become something greater than what it seems.The Visuals [9]:Not much to say here, it\'s Production I.G. after all. In short, the animation in this show has been great so far. The movements of the characters flows along naturally, and their expressions are done flawlessly, and it\'s a joy to watch the characters interact. The mechas are designed by none other than Nissan, and sports some very interesting ideas. They are very reminiscent of the LFOs\' designs in Eureka 7, due to the curves and colouring over the main body, its ability to transform from a vehicle form to a more humanoid form, and the green particle-like light that flows behind them when surfing/flying. The designs for the characters and the mecha has been mixed among the audience, but overall I loved them.The Sound [9]:The Voice Actors for this show has been doing a really good job so far. They fit the character\'s image and you can really feel the mood and emotion in the character\'s interaction. The Soundtrack has been the most memorable part of this show for me. With Nakajima Megumi doing both the OP (a strange catchy tone that gets you all pumped up) and ED (a cheerful J-Pop that take away all your tensions upon finishing the episode), you can get into and leave this show satisfied. The BGM that plays throughout the show also brings out the atmosphere of the situation, as well as makes every single scene in the show a joy to sit through.The Characters [9]:Rinne no Lagrange did what I believe most other anime of its genre failed at with its characters. They gave us a confident character who is very fun to watch, yet doesn\'t annoy the audience with her personality and pride. This is thanks to a big sister type of character who is there to keep her in her place, and a young girl, who may appear emotionless at first, but actually has a personality that helps her moderate the lead\'s behaviour. This is just one example of how the character interactions help make the characters more interesting to watch in this show, as through the characters conversations and actions, we can get a more in-depth view on the personality underneath what first appears to be a generic character.Enjoyment [10]:This show is just a joy to watch. From the etheral dream-like opening sequence at the beginning, to the wonderful character chemistry that we are presented with throughout the show, to the high tension mecha battle that flows about flawlessly. It never misses a beat, and I just love every single minute of it. As long as Production I.G. doesn\'t end up pulling another Guilty Crown on me again, I will without a doubt give this great anime a ""maru!""Overall [9]', 'Most people did not enjoy this show. However, I did. Maybe my opinions are highly flawed. I doubt I\'m the pinnacle of good taste, so you shouldn\'t take my review as the word of God. But the fact remains that I liked Rinne no Lagrange while many others did not, so here\'s me telling you why.Story: 7/10The plot of Rinne no Lagrange is not very complicated to begin with, at least not to me. A lot of people found it a bit confusing and the back stories not fleshed out enough, but keep in mind that this is a two-season anime. I expect, with the...ending presented in season 1, the reasons behind what happened in these 12 episodes will be further explained. But overall, I found the story to be quite interesting. Basically, a girl named Madoka is chosen to pilot a mecha along with two other young girls. And stuff happens.It\'s not unique at all, but I felt that the way it was presented was rather refreshing. Rinne is a show that has serious undertones and darker elements, without actually taking itself too seriously. It\'s a precarious balance between light-hearted and the somber, and I\'ll admit that this doesn\'t always work out so well. But while Rinne\'s story is far from perfect, I honestly did like it.Art: 8/10When I first started watching this show, I had to watch the early release version streaming. I honestly thought the art sucked. But once I began downloading episodes in higher quality, I realized that the art in this is actually very good. The special effects are all done beautifully, and while some of the daily life scenes aren\'t animated as well, overall I thought the animation was quite good. The character designs were all very interesting as well, and I liked the idea of giving the aliens multicolored ""anime hair"" while giving regular earthlings normal colored Japanese hair.Sound: 7/10The music in Rinne didn\'t actually start getting good until the later half. The first few episodes had alright music, but in some of the battle scenes later on the soundtrack was just lovely. I liked the voice acting as well, so no problems there. There were times in the series when the uplifting string music gave the rather bleak images an eerie tone, but that was very minor and not often. Overall, the music was nice when there was music, and the acting was fine.Character: 7/10Depending on how you feel about moe, the character section will vary greatly for everyone. Madoka, Lan, and Muginami, the three young female protagonists, are clearly there to attract the older male otaku audience. They each have their own cute little quirks, and each of them have their ""cute girls doing cute things"" moments. However, unlike actual moeblob shows, the three girls in Rinne actually go through a lot of hardship and emotional suffering as the series progresses. There are moments where you know for sure they will be fine as long as they have each other, but there are many other scenes where you question whether or not anything would be the same again. It\'s not a ""tear them up from the inside out"" kind of show like another famous series with a protagonist named Madoka is, but the characters do go through enough development to make you laugh and cry with them.Enjoyment: 8/10I suppose this show doesn\'t appeal to everyone. It\'s not a universally likable show. It has tons of moe fan service (though very little of it is sexual), and seems to attract the older male otaku population rather than everyone. However, as a teenage girl, I can say that I highly enjoyed Rinne. I liked that it started out light and happy, with only a few glimpses at the underlying darkness, and just when you think it\'s all going to go downhill, it returns to being the same kind of cheery again. This type of emotional setup is not for everyone, and it will confuse a lot of people. But I liked it, and I found it to be rather clever.Overall: 7/10If you are looking for a mecha show with badass little girls piloting giant robots and fighting aliens, then this is not the show for you. If you are looking for something more nuanced; something character driven; something that confuses your emotions but still leaves you wanting to know more, then by all means, watch Rinne no Lagrange. It\'s not perfect or amazing by any standard, but it\'s good. I can\'t quite explain in words how I felt overall about Rinne. But I suppose...it was good. Sometimes, it was just fine, and at other times, it was great. So...good would be the right way to express it. ending presented in season 1, the reasons behind what happened in these 12 episodes will be further explained.

Mind you, I am paying a lot of attention to the creation of the world itself as well as plot and characters. I found myself rolling eyes a lot when watching the series - the tropes are a plenty here - and what makes it worse is the mediocre executionWhat I liked:* The ""stick to what you decided"" theme* The older cousin character* Art was goodWhat I disliked:* Holes in the plot* Incomplete world (examples: mecha get damaged, how do they become functional again? What really happened in the past between the main character and the mecha? Staff...conveniently out of the way when they would be restraining main characters.)* The Loli, even if she is older than she looks, or maybe that\'s what makes it worse* ""PEEERFECT"" and ""ROOOGER THAT!"" - significant contributors to ""eyeroll factor"" conveniently out of the way when they would be restraining main characters.)* The Loli, even if she is older than she looks, or maybe that\'s what makes it worse* ""PEEERFECT"" and ""ROOOGER THAT!"" - significant contributors to ""eyeroll factor""', 'Oddly enough, while it appears to be a typical show about mecha, it has much less to do with the mecha themselves than you would think. It actually focuses more on the characters and their interactions with each other. This is not necessarily a bad thing even if you were looking into this series for the mecha, because they do have some visually stunning battle scenes. Lagrange did a steller job keeping a good balance between the sci-fi mecha, high school life, and character drama.The pacing is back and forth. A...few episodes seemed a bit sluggish at times, while others felt flew by like nothing. At least those instances were few and far between. The main character, Madoka, is probably the most likeable character in the entire show. Her companions, Lan and Muginami, are also incredible and the three girls compliment each other quite wellWith a strong opening and more than fitting ending, this overall is a fun and enjoyable show for any audience. The story is not fully explained and there are some issues with it,I did feel that the Yuri undertones throughout this series came off a bit strong and hold a little too much presence.

If THAT impresses enough to write a review, then it must be an anime worth closer attention.This anime is good, just good, in each and every component - art, sound, characters, story. The story may be an exception, though. The first episode created lots of possible roads the story may travel - into the past, future, deep space, or even into a very earthly conspiracy.Characters are always another suspect for an exception, what can prevent them from some fascinating developing, anyway? Maybe the anime just not being about characters, like this one? My impression...is that this anime is neither about characters nor anything else. It is about the general mood of the show, and the mood looks light, playful, and vivid.To make this mood happen, this anime quotes everything, mostly other anime, it is full of light humor and self irony, and, possibly above all, perfectly maintains the rhythm - image, sound, events, dialogs - all that goes in perfect match and timing. If after the first 90 seconds you are not in completely, it is just not your anime. But if you are, the enjoyment is guaranteed, and that enjoyment will be great.Overall, this episode strongly reminds me of two things - the Tarot Trump 0, among other things the symbol of careless creativity, and James Bond movies, which are not very realistic, not philosophically deep, but amazingly enjoyable. is that this anime is neither about characters nor anything else.

Considering that, during the Winter 2012 season there were two other \'scifi-girls\' shows, I wondered how this particular anime would stand out. And how did it? By being as much of a character piece as it was a mecha show.Story (7/10): With our lead heroine Madoka and the two friends that she acquires in aliens Lan and Muginami, you get a sense that the story wouldn\'t have worked nearly as well without the dynamic that they build up over the course of 12 episodes. We have an alien war going after the Vox mechs and...the town of Kamogawa is stuck right in the middle. It\'s interesting in how much of the first half of this series is built just around the back stories of everything, and when you see a good chunk of the plot just there, it means that we can expect good things from the second season. It has it\'s funny moments, it\'s sad and heartwarming moments, and it\'s dramatic and action scenes, and it does handle them all pretty solidly and fluidly. There also seems to be a theme of showing both sides of the conflict and making you connect with them. It\'s definitely interesting and I\'m excited to see how much farther they take it in S2.The story does have it\'s faults, though. It takes a while for the plot to really kick in (probably around episode 4 or so would be my best guess, with episodes 1-3 acting as a really long pilot episode), so you may or may not lose a slight bit of interest in the mean time. It also has the distinct problem in not knowing how much of the high school life of our 3 girls to put into the show (I honestly feel bad for their classmates, since it feels like they just pop out randomly), along with strange time jumps here and there that can distract you from whats going on.Art (9/10): Those mechs are pretty as all hell. Well, the whole show is pretty, but there has to be some props to Nissan for the great designs for the Vox mechs (in both robot and plane mode). The main Ovids are also interesting looking, though I\'m not a big fan of the purple that they\'re mainly designed with. Also, I\'m glad to see that Xebec has gotten out of there rom-com style here and helped make the show look nice (not saying they still don\'t do that, but for a mecha anime, they did a good job with the help of Production I.G.), though you can still see their distinct character designs here and there. Really, the show just looks good. Plain and simple.Sound (7/10): The only piece that stood out for me, as it usually does, is the opening ""Try Unite!"". It does a good job of capturing the scifi quality of the show, while still being a nice song to listen to (also, it becomes pretty haunting in the slower version that plays during episode 12). The ending wasn\'t bad, but nothing really interesting. Otherwise, the show sounded nice.Character (9/10): Where Rinne shines is it\'s characters. Madoka get\'s a metric ton of development, changing from just the spunky, jack of all trades that we\'re introduced to over the course of the season. Lan breaks out of her shell, into a sweet girl that would do anything for friends. Muginami learns that others are more than willing to be with her, and that she doesn\'t need her \'brother\' alone to feel like she has people that love her. The 3 pilots Array, Izo, and Kirius change from what we think are typical bad guys into noble people...What I\'m trying to say is that all the characters in this show are great and I\'m hyped to see how they change further in S2.Enjoyment (8/10): I\'ll be honest here- at first, I really wasn\'t that interested in anything that was going on. The first three episodes went on too long for me and I was just waiting for something cool to happen. But I\'m glad that I stuck it out. I got to see wonderful characters, interesting dilemmas, really cool action...basically everything that I was hoping that this show would provide. By the end of episode 12, I was pumped and completely interested in what would happen next that I was sad to realize that I would have to start watching the second season.Rinne separates itself from the pack by being a mecha show with a little more just waiting for you underneath. Definitely worth a watch and a total recommendation for all. Off to season two!Maru! the town of Kamogawa is stuck right in the middle.

Off to season two!Maru!', ""Rinne no Lagrange is a sci-fi series written by Suga Shotaro, known for working on several really strong titles such as Stand Alone Complex, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Brotherhood and some others. It sounds promising so let's take a look.Kyouno Madoka is a young high school student and the only member of the Jersey Club, a group that aids other student organisations. One day she's approached by a strange girl and taken to a battleship to pilot a giant robot called a Vox that everyone seems to want to possess or destroy. To make things more complicated, there's a disturbing legend about the Vox. That's the...basic story, it seems like there's a lot of material, especially for a relatively short anime, but all the material gets covered really well. There's a lot of intrigue and the mixture of occasional serious moments with mostly light-hearted fun is well executed. The only real story issue is the pacing. Everything does get covered, but some parts have a really hectic pace, especially at the very beginning and end, while others are more relaxed and it makes the story seem like it's moving far too fast at those points which is a bit disorienting.The anime focuses more on the characters than it does the story, which does make things interesting. The main cast is well developed and they get a lot of great interactions. The major interactions revolve around Madoka, Lan and Muginami (who can't seem to figure out when things between Madoka and Lan are getting intense and polite people would leave the room). The three of them are spectacular characters. Even the supporting characters and antagonists feel fleshed out and interesting.The art is good. It's nice and vibrant, which suits the content well. The backgrounds are lively. My one issue is that there's quite a bit of pointless fan-service and it gets pretty facepalm worthy at some moments. That being said, at least it's equal opportunity fan-service.The voice acting is well done. Seto Asami, Ishihara Kaori, and Kayano Ai especially do well with their roles. The music is upbeat, catchy and really well done.The yuri factor is a 6.5/10. You can probably guess this from the characters paragraph, the relationship between Madoka and Lan is extremely homoerotic, and Muginami gets a few moments with them, so maybe it's not that she can't read the mood maybe she just wants to be involved. Youko and Machiko also get a couple moments, but the main les-yay focus is on Madoka and Lan, the last episode especially.My final rating for Rinne no Lagrange is a 7.5/10. It has some awkward pacing and far too much fan-service, but overall it's a delightful series with lots of fun moments and wonderful characters. If you're a fan of Sky Girls or Canaan you'll probably like this as well and the best part is that a sequel is set to start airing in July. Here's hoping that it's even better and that Madoka and Lan get to officially become a couple instead of just being really homoerotic. basic story, it seems like there's a lot of material, especially for a relatively short anime, but all the material gets covered really well.

But that was soon changed.While the show didn\'t turn amazing, it did pick itself up later in the show.Story: 6The main character is Kyouno Madoka, who teams up with a girl named Lan, to fight aliens that attack her hometown with their robots called Vox. Not a very exciting story, but for what they have to work...with...it is executed well.Art: 8The art is actually really nice, I like the character designs as well as the mecha designs. It varies greatly from the normal Gundam type designs, and has a flight mode for each robot.Sound: 7The voice actors were well picked, and the opening theme isn\'t bad, not much to say here.Character: 8As a main character, Madoka is a very good one. She is entertaining to watch and is one of those characters that make you laugh and break the tension in a bad situation. She is one of the characters that bring everyone together and easially cheer up people. She is also quite the airhead XDAs for the rest, Lan is a character you can\'t say much about, she is strong and independent, but I think needs Madoka to keep moving forward. Also, Muginamai is a really fun character. The characters are pretty well made.Enjoyment: 7The show is actually really enjoyable. It just creates a light and cheery mood with all the friendship and everything, and even some light yuri undertones XDOverall: 7This show is one of the prime examples of ""do not judge a book by its cover"". After you get over the first impressions and the first couple of episodes, it actually gets better. All and all the show is pretty good, can\'t wait for the end and season 2 in summer XD with...it is executed well.Art: 8The art is actually really nice, I like the character designs as well as the mecha designs.

If you are looking for an intriguing story, this show won't deliver. This show has more appeal to those who enjoy slice-of-life, as what really carries this show is the art and characters.We have 3 main heroines in this story; Kyouno Madoka - the lead, an energetic, cheerful girl with natural leadership talent; Lan - the mysterious klutz, with tsundere elements; and Muginami, a mischevious, carefree girl, though the most perceptive of the others' emotions.The story of is simple. In short, waves of mechas attack earth, and only...defense is 3 teenage girls. Some basic politics takes place internally, and bilaterally, but no grandiose strategies, atleast, none that are cared to be explained. There is backstory to the characters, and revelations are, though few, usually explained well enough, if explanation is necessary. The show is more talking than action, though the amount isn't oversaturating, but some of the dialogue is profoundly uninteresting.As for a more indepth view of the characters, only the 3 main characters are really blessed with a good degree of depth. That said, all 3 of them have a good backstory, which not only serves to explain their motives, but doesn't drag out so much to take precedence over the present events.Kyouno is very much an opposite of NGE's Shinji or other similar teenage boy lead protagonists who could be described as 'pathetic'. Kyouno is eager to get on with what she needs to do, which makes her enjoyable to watch, certainly not overly frustrating. She drives the story forwards well, without the story becoming too centred around her. Her biggest flaw, if anything, is that she is too... 'nice'. Whilst she won't pull punches to set people straight, her personality can at times be overly bland.Lan on the other hand, differs from Kyouno quite significantly, she is quiet and to begin with, it is difficult quite understanding her actions, not due to their complexity, but due to a modest level of strangeness. Lan is my favourite out of the 3, as she interacts with the other 2 main characters in ways very entertaining to watch, but usually at the expense of her dignity. Lan just about covers enough various minor elements from other stereotypes to avoid falling into a set rigid one, which serves to make her character relatively unique.Muginami joins the main cast a little later. At first, I was worried her generous endowments would make her simply the fanservice character, but once it delved into her backstory, I was satisfied that she is certainly much more than that, she has real personality. Generally more cheerful than Lan, who she often finds herself at odds with, she is often seen reacting to the other 2's moods and responding in trolling ways. Muginami's motives, reasoning and loyalty is often all too wishywashy though, so it would have been good to see a bit more consistency in her personality.The villains of the show, however, rarely have, or at least show clear motive, asides from control. They are generally lacking in depth in their personality, and often don't even appear to be antagonistic at all. This would be a factor that'd add depth, if their actions were overly coherent enough to even form a gray area, certainly, the main antagonist - Villagiulio - lacks good presence, and even more so for his subordinates, who are perhaps the blandest of the them all. The protagonist supporting characters vary from some of the major ones doing nothing asides from issuing orders, to those with mixed motives, to those that are there to set Kyouno straight and give her support when she needs it.On the art front, this show is brilliantly animated. From the character designs to the backgrounds, everything looks good, moreso than that infact, its visuals often left me in awe, something relatively unusual in anime - ironic, for something that many people may have started the show, by watching the low-quality preair. The scenery is colourful - very vivid colours, especially with the sky and lighting make for fantastic eyecandy. Even better when the 'Flower declaration of of your heart' becomes more literal.As for the character designs, we have the sleek looking Voxs - the mecha piloted by our 3 saviours of earth. Somewhat based on modern fighter jets in their default form, these are very sleek beasts, looking something akin to the Arwings from the Star Fox video games, albeit with more curves. The antagonists' mecha aren't nearly as good looking, a more generic affair, but still, they are fitting.For the people, the designs vary a fair bit for the characters. Many will look, as expected, generic, but clear - there is a certain simple refinement to all the characters, everything is crisp. As for our main characters, Kyouno is relatively normal looking, but her given colour, (Each of the 3 main characters represent a colour, which is also their mecha's colour) a nice shade of green looks good when in her pilot's suit, and her token jersey gives her an appearance that does help her stand out, without breaking what would be expected for a schoolgirl to wear.Lan and Muginami though, show the strongest designs. Lan's sleek blue is represented in both her light blue hair (which doesn't come across as obnoxiously unnatural) and her usual attire, which looks good without being too skimpy. Muginami's orange theme is also represented in her hair, though her outfit also is fortunately reserved, but not quite so much as Lan's, as she could have very easily been a pure fanservice character with a more revealing outfit. Though Muginami's bust isn't really 'exploited' as such, disapointing those who'd want more ecchi elements to the show, she comes across as strong and sexy, which is what I'd prefer.As for the villains, these guys have pretty plain designs, making them quite forgettable. This can also be said for some of the supporting protagonists, however, but it is a shame to have no distinctively cool looking villain.As for music, the OP is again, a delight for the eyes with visuals, with a fitting song, though the jpop/dance isn't to my preference, it is still worth not skipping it, simply to see the rich colours in motion. The ED  goes for a more laid-back jpop song, with simpler visuals, but simple in the sense that it discards the unnecessary, which makes it an interesting contrast to the OP. The BGM is for the most part, well fitting, but somewhat bland - whilst this doesn't come across as overpowering, it rarely invokes much emotion either.Rinne no Lagrange on the whole, is a show that proves to be mostly balanced, but lacking in terms of story. I say again, this show is likely to appeal to those of slice-of-life, because, for a good portion of the show, it is one, certainly once all 3 main characters are brought together. It is the subtle nuances of the characters, their interactions and development that is what should appeal most, along with the fantastic art, that doesn't so much follow a niché style, but is wonderful regardless. This is a fun show, that is somewhat serious, but intertwines this with good mellow sections in a way that works but can leave some wanting more of one aspect and less of the other. It wouldn't hurt to try this show, don't expect big things, but you're likely to be pleasantly surprised if the current MAL rating is a little off-putting.Worth noting is that there is a second cour coming 3 months from now, though this didn't result in this season having a bad ending, it was acceptably satisfying for now. defense is 3 teenage girls.

I found it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief, not because the show got any worse, but because it pretty much stayed the same. It doesn't get any easier to take as it goes along.If some of the characters annoy you, it's time to stop watching.  Otherwise, you'll end up pausing it repeatedly to look for reviews that aren't praising it; reviews with useful information.  Take my word for it.  You aren't going to like this any more seven episodes in than you did at the start.The seagull attack was pretty...fun though. fun though."", 'As a huge mecha fan, Rinne no Lagrange seemed like a frilly majou shoujo in heavy battle armour. in short, it is. the title mecha doesn\'t describe this anime accurately to me.Rinne no Langrage takes the events of three girls and, from what i\'ve seen, shows the power of kindness and friendship (with lesbian subtext, of course!)no seriously, it\'s hilarious, these girls are revved up for each other, but i love how the story doesn\'t ""focus"" on it, like a shoujo-ai.so far, it\'s cute, it\'s funny, it\'s enjoyable. just don\'t go in thinking you\'ll be seeing awesome fight scenes and heavy action, because you won\'t. ', 'Wonderful art, the music is ok, the characters still have time to develop but as of the first three episodes there isn\'t much there. Just on the colors, and the mechs alone does the enjoyment make a 7. I feel like Madoka didn\'t hesitate enough when her responsibility of piloting the ""Vox"" or the robotic/aircraft that she pilots was heaped upon her. Now i\'m not saying she has to pull a Shinji Ikari from Eva or a Renton Thirston from Eureka 7 but she hardly hesitates at all making me think ""ok that\'s a little unrealistic"". I think why I was put off a little...is because going into this anime I was expecting it to be partly a drama and there was very little in regard to her and the Mecha. So where is the drama going to come from. The most drama for me came when Lan overcame her disability to go into warrior mode in her Vox, but that only lasted for like two episodes. Anyway my complaints may  come from expectations, in that case maybe I need to expect ""different"" not necessarily ""less"". I still think it\'s worth watching as long as they turn up either the action or the drama and give the viewer a since of suspense comes nd conflict. is because going into this anime I was expecting it to be partly a drama and there was very little in regard to her and the Mecha.

The positive feelings I had towards the show were probably contextual.It was really painful to watch. It might have been because I stick to dubs, but the English translation was really irritating. The lines sounded like they had been run through a translation program, nothing like what an actual person might say. Soundtrack was good though; I think the singer also sang as Ranka from Macross F.The story sucked, there\'s no other way to phrase...it. They\'d hint at something important then make it seem inconsequential the minute after, but part of that could be attributed to how badly the characters, especially main character was written. There\'s no way to take the plot seriously with how oddly Madoka acts. The other two girls weren\'t as bad, they could have fared better in another show. Lan was the biggest reason I was able to get through the latter episodes.Hopefully the second season is better.6.2/10.0 it.

Lan was the biggest reason I was able to get through the latter episodes.Hopefully the second season is better.6.2/10.0', 'This is a mecha show planned by Studio I.G. which is very good at sci-fi shows, but is otherwise animated by Xebec, a studio notorious for its bad anime. It is directed by Satou Tatsuo, who has made lots of mecha shows, most of which are unorthodox but otherwise slow and usually anti-climactic (Martian Successor Nadesico, Gekiganger 3, Shingu, Stellvia). He also has Suzuki Toshimasa as an assistant, who in the past directed Heroic Age and the second season of Polyphonica. So ok, he isn’t much of a talent. Thus we have a project based on antithesis, decent director and planner but also bad assistant...and animator. So the overall feeling was expected to be mediocre. And yup, I was right.It starts right away with establishing every character through sexual stereotypes, something which is sacrificing a lot from personality in favour of shallow appeal. There is the usual variety of uniform eye candy, such as school uniforms, swimsuits, maid suits, nude scenes, and even combat suits that fit better for erotic foreplay than… well, combat. Also, every single girl in the anime dresses, acts, and thinks like a retard (exactly how the male audience likes them), thus you get that fuzzy feeling of dumb fun out of them, but nothing amazing in the longrun.CHARACTERS- Madoka is the lead heroine, who always acts on impulse and rarely thinks what the devil she is doing. She is following the energetic/positive bimbo stereotype and in a way she feels like a parody of Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis. Where he would constantly try not to run away, she just storms in and then asks forgiveness for messing it all up. She also wears her swimsuit underneath her school uniform because ""you never know if it comes in handy."" It is also a joke on having two fetishes at the same time. But as I said, since every girl in the show is dumb, she is not smart enough to change after she swims and walks all around the city while still wet and risking pneumonia, even when she is carrying her jym clothes. Oh yes, there is also the issue with the jersey, a third fetish. She is the leader of the jersey club, where girls run around in them doing good deeds and feeling all happy about it. She even has her own signature pose (Maru!), hairstyle, and impractically lifted sleeves that are supposed to be giving her an identity or something. But it’s nothing much.- Lan is the second heroine, and is following the cooldere stereotype. She acts like a puppy, as she constantly replies by barking and feels neglected (like one) when left alone. She also seems to lack common sense, but is excused because she is apparently an alien. So she doesn’t mind how she walks around in a military uniform that conveniently leaves her half-naked. She cares very much for Madoka and that is why she gave her a robot to go fight some aliens she has no idea what they are all about. But it’s ok, Madoka is so stupid that agrees right away because she wants to help people. In fact, she rushes to it so fast, she never asks anyone to explain what the hell are aliens like Lan want in the first place and just continues her life with her as a friend.- And then we have Muginami who dresses like a street whore and is so stupid she even talks slowly. She also seems to have a brother complex and get all emo and crazy when not being exploited by him.And that is all you need to know about the main characters of this show. A dumb energetic one, a dumb dog, and a dumb whore, playing around with robots for some weird alien conspiracy. There are a few others but surely you will remember them for even less that that. Such as the director of the institution always smirking with his eyes closed, the president being a loli who loves molesting underraged girls, and a male alien soldier who loves to cross dress. So as you can tell, the cast is just silly people doing silly things.STORYSo what is this conspiracy in the story anyway? Well, there are these human-looking aliens on a far away planet who are in the middle of a civil war, and there are three ancient robots that can destroy everything, and the rebels look for them, and they came to Earth, and they… Ok, screw that, nobody cares about the plot, ok? It is mostly silly moments with dumb girls undressing, doing school activities where they are molested by eels, going to the beach where they bathe in the nude, being debriefed by their loli superior before she fondles their breasts, and stopping an alien armada before filming a yuri movie. There are some heavy emo moments too, regarding the alien war but it is completely disregarded in a few minutes. Hell, even the war just ends out of the blue and they all go back to do more silly stuff. Yeah, ok, nothing to see here, moving along to the robot action.ART/ANIMATIONThe robot battles are very cool in choreography and the only good thing I find in the whole series; everything else is just dumb fun. Of course I’ll be damned if I didn’t get Neon Genesis deza vu out of them. It appears to be one big tribute to Hideaki Anno works and it’s not like this can’t work, since one of my favoured retro mecha is Gunbuster, which was also girls and robots fighting aliens. The thing is, both Gunbuster and NGE were directed by Hideaki and animated by Gainax, a combo that beats this show’s team ten times over. Oh well…So anyways, the overall production values ain’t bad but surely far from amazing. The robots are battling in extremely interesting ways, like pulling out energy swords, creating barriers, transforming to airships, and even using martial arts like German suplex and strangling grabs… although the last one is just Madoka trying to do cool stuff even when they are not necessary. I mean she keeps trying to play wrestling with the enemy robots as if they are humans, yet trying to strangle a mecha that doesn’t breathe is just dumb. Or she keeps trying not to cause too much damage in the city, yet she never thinks about just moving away from it in order to fight. Yes, she is dumb, just like we like them.Oh, and there are boob/pantsu jokes too in case you are not into robot action. Nothing amazing about them; they are presented in a perky/non-slutty way but we can get a thousand anime like that.MUSICThe soundtrack didn’t feel interesting; some j-pop trash I wouldn’t care less about. And voice acting was ok, meaning everybody sounded as retarded as they needed to be. I bet that “Lagrange” word in the title comes from how everybody’s brains “lag” in all “ranges”.ENJOYMENTSo, basically you get a completely stupid show which can easily be labelled dumb fun. If you can switch off your brain then you may enjoy it for what it is but for me this is a completely passable title. Even when it tries to be a social drama at points, it does it in such a light way before throwing in fan service and school comedy that it might as well not exist at all. Thus although it has a serious aspect to it, it plays out way too light and silly to leave you with fond impressions.VALUEIt came out at the same time as another similar show named Aquarion Evol, which is far more extreme in all sections and pretty much stole all the spotlight. But even without it, it is not much of a show people will remember in a few years from now. It is way too light and simple for its own good to the point you will easily forget it.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks nice)Character Figures 1/2 (generic, too many trashy fetishes)Backgrounds 1/2 (basic)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 7/10Voice Acting 2/3 (silly but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 3/4 (not great but fitting with the feeling of the series)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 4/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 1/2 (loose)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 0/3 (I don’t expect it to be remembered in a few years)Rewatchability 0/3 (nothing we haven’t seen better elsewhere)Memorability 2/4 (perky but that is pretty much it)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Too light and silly for its own good.

The three members of the Track Suit Club are one.""I\'m not 100% sure why Lagrange grew on me. It could be that since I dropped Captain Earth in the same season and wanted a giant robot show I could watch without facepalming because it reminded me of childhood moments I wanted to forget. It could be that I thought the Nissan-designed mechs looked cool, even if they weren\'t Kawamori designs (Anime law of aerodynamics: Any shape, no matter how strange...or convoluted, is automatically aerodynamic). Maybe it was the fantastic chemistry of the three heroines. Maybe it was the symbolism scattered throughout the show. Whatever the reasons, this was a solid production for me.One of the themes is ""machi-okoshi"" (local town awareness), though this isn\'t as in-your-face about it as Sakura Quest, Love Live, or Locodol. I\'m not sure if very many people in Japan knew about Kamogawa until this show, and the mere repeated mention of the town\'s name probably made it a destination for the consideration of anime fans. This setting is crafted very well, depicting a small, quiet seaside town where the residents live simple lives. It might not be the first thing you\'d think of for the backdrop to a brewing interstellar conflict, but it\'s a warm foundation, a place to call home. Listening to Madoka yell at her foe that he\'s screwing up such-and-such\'s peanut fields, etc., is a great way to reinforce this.Even though I tend to prefer heroines who use their brains, I rather like Madoka-- she might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but her heart is made of pure gold, feeds on compassion, and longs for justice. Perhaps it\'s because of this that she is able to draw into her orbit those who sought to manipulate her, namely Lan and Muginami. Through Madoka we see first-hand another theme of the show, ""This is what you decided, so take responsibility and see it through to the end,"" beaten into her. Her cousin Yoko, while not one of the central 3 characters, is nevertheless a very effective foil for Madoka, giving the younger Track Suit member a well-deserved kick in the pants right when she needs it.The other two members of the trio each bring a diverse set of background and personality to the club. Nowhere is this better symbolized than the shots of the three chairs, describing where each girl is relative to one another in most episodes. At their core, they all want to help people (they\'re all chairs), but sometimes they don\'t see eye to eye, or sometimes not all the chairs are there.While Lan was relatively easy to get to know, Muginami was employing subterfuge from her first appearance. To get the audience to understand her motivations, we\'re given a number of flashback scenes where apples are symbolic of her affection. This is particularly important because Kayano\'s performance didn\'t change a whole lot (less \'forced\') after Muginami dropped the act and joined the club in earnest. It\'s no coincidence that, following the final conflict with Villagiulio, the apple remains at Madoka\'s house, meaning that while he will always be Muginami\'s first love, Madoka is even closer.Visually, nothing terrible, but nothing amazing until the power of the Vox is unleashed. Part of the reason why the fear of the Vox is so effectively communicated is the unknowns about it-- what happened in the past to inspire a verse warning generations to never allow the Vox to release its poewr. The synth soundtrack does a fairly decent job of setting the tone, though it can get a tad repetitive and predictable-- you know things are turning for the better when the violins lead the soundtrack in a stirring piece (almost like a quick march).Megumi ""Mamegu"" Nakajima, who attained anime stardom for her role as Ranka Lee, sings the opening and ending themes. Pay close attention to the opener-- the upbeat default opening arrangement emphasizes the major chords, evoking freedom and youth. In the finale\'s climactic scene, the accompaniment is reduced to a solo piano, which naturally emphasizes the minor chords, evoking sadness and yearning. I wouldn\'t be surprised if this is inspired by a similar rearrangement done by Angela in similar scenes in Stellvia-- as the backdrop to exploding starships and a farewell scene, it is a powerful coup de grace.Admittedly, the climax of the story has a couple of issues, assuming this saga ends at one cour: (1) it\'s very deus ex machina (deus ex Dizelmine?), and (2) there are several areas where there clearly is more to the story than meets the eye. You know, it\'s almost as though they were planning on a longer series but only got approval for one cour.

The characters were clear and understandable, you knew their pasts and the reason for the things they did, but you didn't care. The story left us with questions at the end, I myself had 5 of them. The second season is likely going to answer these questions but I didn't find the story engaging enough to continue watching. The story couldn't decide if it wanted to lean more towards being a funny show or a serious one and because of this failed at both.The show...had potential, the first episode was one of the best first episodes I have ever seen. The beautiful background art with the catchy music, adding to that funny and mysterious characters, it got my attention from the very beginning. The characters later on proved to be boring - from episode 4 or so, I couldn't sympathize with them anymore and started not caring about what happens to them. Despite the numerous questions left unanswered, the story was decent, however it wasn't good enough to carry the show through.The characters felt like a decent looking meal that had no taste, not enough emotional attention was given to their past and their feature actions didn't quite had the punch. The reason for all of this, I believe, is because the show couldn't decide what it wanted to do. It didn't wanted to be too heavy on emotions and decided to have comedic moments, but it couldn't juggle both at the same time. The characters were not sympathetic because they didn't went full on with the emotions, the comedy failed because they started sneaking in half-arsed emotions that were incomplete due to the comedic nature of the show. It is fine to have comic characters that act as a stress relief, which release the tension, but when the overall mood of the show leans towards to comedy more then drama, everything mixes together and nothing gets properly done.If the show had anything outstanding it was the music and the background art, they were top notch, it always caught my attention. Especially the clouds, they were drawn beautifully with great detail, their color popped up and grabbed your attention. The shadows and the overall shading of objects was well done.With its decent story that left many questions behind, and the unsympathetic characters that were well understood but couldn't fully express themselves due to the comedic and light nature of the show, it is possible to think that the show would be pretty bad.But it is still possible to enjoy it. Instead of looking for a story or trying to understand their past, if one instead focused on the present and just watches over the friendship between the characters, their relationships and interactions, then it is possible to enjoy it.

Soukou Kihei Votoms: Kakuyaku taru Itan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2586/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms__Kakuyaku_taru_Itan,"['TLDR: Shining Heresy is a 5-episode OVA series that is a good 2 episodes too long, choosing to focus on dull church bureaucracy rather than Chirico or interesting mech action scenes.Full review:The strongest two arcs of the original VOTOMS TV series were easily the middle two arcs (Kummen and Sunsa) in which Chirico is rivalled by Ypsilon for the affections of Fyana. It\'s an oddly engaging love triangle stuck in the middle of a real robot series that focuses on the mentality of a soldier.Shining Heresy attempts to go back to this by introducing a new rival for Chirico in the form of Teitania,...a ""Nextant"" who was created ostensibly for the purpose of replacing ATs and I guess also destroying Chirico. However, it also incorporates notes of the Woodo arc of the VOTOMS TV show by setting her up as a female love interest for Chirico.This is done in the most awkward and illogical way possible; Teitania literally falls in love with Chirico for no really good reason after he shoots her. Let me emphasize that Teitania sees Chirico like two times and is shot by him before falling madly in love with him and deciding to follow him forever. It makes Fyana\'s reasons for loving Chirico seem completely legitimate.The biggest problem with Shining Heresy is that it is not about Chirico. Chirico barely ever appears on screen; the other characters certainly do a lot of TALKING about Chirico but the focus of the OVA is clearly on a completely unrelated story about ""The Catholic Church, Except In Space"" and a yawn-worthy competition over who is going to become the next Space Pope.To the OVA\'s credit, the original VOTOMS show did not really explore the role of religion in the VOTOMS universe so in theory it\'s a cool idea to explore it, but the problem is there\'s no context given. Why does this church matter? What do they control? What are the stakes at hand in this competition to kill Chirico in order to become the next Space Pope? None of these questions are resolved by the end.Oh yeah, Fyana is there too. But she has like a total of 5 lines and is pretty much just a plot device.And here\'s the thing about Fyana: She\'s always been a very flat character. She hit her stride in the middle of the TV series when she was actually fighting in her AT, but the latter half of the series reduced her to a damsel-in-distress sitting around yelling ""CHIRICO!!"" every so often. But they\'ve gone a step past that in Shining Heresy and she\'s incapacitated for the entire OVA and then... well...I won\'t spoil what happens but the conclusion of Shining Heresy left me scratching my head and wondering ""OK, but why?"" Well, the answer to that question seems to be that the writers wanted to take Fyana out of the story and replace her with Teitania. Seeing as VOTOMS is about Chirico, that is the only major development that has transpired by the end of this OVA, and one wonders why the writers felt the need for this development. Sure, Fyana wasn\'t the best character, but she was Fyana! 50 episodes and several OVAs of Chirico chasing Fyana, and for what?The art and sound are OK for a 90\'s OVA; it\'s obviously a low-budget production but nothing stands out as ugly. There\'s a new OP that isn\'t quite as catchy as the original OP but is still listenable. The scarce few mech battles are pretty interesting as far as VOTOMS go, and I honestly thought Teitania vs. Chirico in episode 1 was the highlight of the whole thing.Overall, it has a few fun action sequences but they\'re stuck in a swamp of boring dialogue about Space Catholicsm. It tries to ambitiously explore the role of religion in the VOTOMS world but it fails to properly provide context for why the story being presented matters at all. Still, if you plan to watch the other VOTOMS OVAs after this one, you may want to just grit your teeth and bear with it for the major plot development that occurs in Shining Heresy. a ""Nextant"" who was created ostensibly for the purpose of replacing ATs and I guess also destroying Chirico.

Despite being full of missed opportunities to expand on the story of VOTOMS and the previous OVAs based on the series, watching this one still has its own merits.The story is the biggest and probably only major weak point in The Shining Heresy as a whole. Shining Heresy's writers had to fish for a new conflict to make the next entry in VOTOMS ripe for watching and ultimately decided to turn the Space Church into a major factor, something that was pretty much only...mentioned in the original show. After a number of asspulls with Chirico and his immortality it was decided that he was a freak of nature and was deemed untouchable, and a Nextant (which is basically a human AT and the successor to the PS program, I have to admit it's actually a really badass concept) named Teitania is sent to either convert Chirico to their religion or exterminate him. The reason for this despite marking him as untouchable either wasn't there at all or it just slipped past me and I really don't want to go back just to find out.A big part of the original VOTOMS story was Chirico's struggle to be with Fyana, who he fell in love with.. After seeing the two finally get together following being hunted down by entire armies, then subsequently watching The Shining Heresy you'll feel pretty duped because Teitania ends up replacing Fyana as Chirico's love interest only after they try to kill each other a few times or something. I don't mind good endings or sad endings but when one is already established and then soiled by another story it only comes off as frustrating to me.In just 5 episodes there is enough to keep you entertained and maintain a continuous interest in watching however. Seeing the evolution of VOTOMS from the 1980s to the 1990s standard is really fulfilling in its own right and through time it still stays true to what made the original series so good, with its gritty combat and emulation of real war's expendable nature. Along with that it still has its jazzy soundtrack that works so well with the series and a new opening that I must admit I like better than Honoo no Sadame after hearing it so much.If you're a fan and you want something that looks and sounds good, even if it doesn't really FEEL good, The Shining Heresy will satisfy you. If you're not interested after seeing this review take my advice, and let the story end where the show ends. mentioned in the original show.

Besides how cartoonishly old the space Pope is and how, well, absurd the elders act, the main reason why this expansion of Votoms' in-universe religion comes off as bad is because it doesn't click in with the original series. The Secret Society were a break-off group of this Church? I don't know, it's all very obviously written in after the fact. Not that the writers for Shining Heresy had that much to work with, but it seems like overkill.The mecha scenes are good, but the...last fight between Chirico and Teitana is rather ridiculous in how the protagonist wins.All in all, Votoms is a very hit or miss series - and this OVA sequel is very hit or miss, too. Teitana's infatuation with Chirico makes little sense, as does the Church obsession with him. It would have made more sense if they brought up what Chirico does at the very end of the series. How does Wiseman fit into their Church? Does he at all?Not boring to watch; definitely enjoyable to sit through.

But rather disappointing."", ""This is less of a structured review and more so my thoughts on Brilliantly Shining Heresy as a sequel to Armored Trooper VOTOMS, discussing vaguely the direction and themes of the show without spoilers.Despite how wacky Brilliantly Shining Heresy may seem at first as a sequel to VOTOMS, I do feel like it is a good continuaton of the elements explored in the final arc of the show.Brilliantly Shining Heresy explored more of the religious and secret society beliefs in the setting which was interesting following the end of VOTOMS where Chirico is revelaed as an overman who is now a known entity...to both the Gilgamesh and Balarant armies which he is pursued by. Considering this, the story is set within a schism between the religious factions and how to deal with the knowledge and reality of such a person existing.Because of this the plot feels less grounded compared to early VOTOMS. My favourite arcs of VOTOMS were Woodo and Kummen so I do miss the action adventure side of VOTOMS with the merry gang of Gotho, Coconna, Vanilla and even Shako who are sorely missed from Brilliantly Shining Heresy. The story more so follows a new character, Teitania who is an answer to Chirico and in light of Chirico waking up the story explores the mystery of her backstory and destiny.With this being the focus of the story Fyana is sidelined to being more of a princess in a castle. Lastly, the explaination for the ending seemed to me to lack pretext and felt shoehorned. If this was to be the finale to the franchise it is the inverse to the original series but writing this in 2024 i'm looking forward to seeing the other OVAs and sequel to Brilliantly Shining Heresy.The standout aspect of BSH for me was seeing the worldbulding expand with more revealed about the church and the evolution of AT and PS technologies.

If this was to be the finale to the franchise it is the inverse to the original series but writing this in 2024 i'm looking forward to seeing the other OVAs and sequel to Brilliantly Shining Heresy.The standout aspect of BSH for me was seeing the worldbulding expand with more revealed about the church and the evolution of AT and PS technologies. Especially with the contrasting grungy 90s sci fi and baroque aesthetics.""]"
Servamp,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31229/Servamp,"['This anime is takes itself too seriously by trying to be \'deep\' on the premise of \'friendship\'. It fails horribly and characters act irrational on a basis such as ""you called me a friend"". The characters themselves come off as bland and again try to be deep with their single layered backstory or motives which just makes it even more laughable. After four episodes out of twelve I couldn\'t even remember what the plot was and I didn\'t even care because it seemed like they didn\'t even care themselves. If you like staring at your screen as long as theres something moving then you could...tolerate this anime. tolerate this anime.', ""The top rated review for this being a '3' seems very exaggerated. An anime that is rated a '3' lacks not only in story, but also art, sound and character. Here's why that is not true:Story: 8/10This is a setting that many have seen before. Normal High School student is met with the supernatural and pulled into a whole different world. So far, it doesn't seem like there is anything too amazing about it. However, I have not yet encountered a story in which said supernatural creature is literally THE most lazy person in the show, which often helps loosen the 'deep' mood that the...story is going for with an amusing comment about how he'd rather take a nap than do anything 'bothersome'.Art: 9/10The animation is great, and the character design is a very favorite of mine. Bright colors, distinctive character designs so that you don't get confused about who is who - nothing to complain about here.Sound: 8/10I really love the opening by Oldcodex that suits the anime's darker theme, but also the ending that gives you a more upbeat and happy-go-lucky feeling if there has been a particularly 'dark' episode.Character: 8/10The main character is your everyday hero who wants to protect his friends and do everything right, which comes across as a bit generic at times. What really pulled me in was Kuro, the second main character, who (while being one of the laziest people on Earth) still manages to be powerful when needed, and also funny at times.A few episodes in is when the character development of Kuro starts to happen, when you start getting a deeper look into what has happened in his past.Enjoyment: 9/10I really cannot say I disliked watching any of these episodes. I'm always looking forward to the next one, and can't say that I felt like I wasted time with any of the episodes.Overall: 8/10If you're someone who enjoys an anime with a pretty art style and bright colors, an anime that is somehow 'deep' but still manages to bring in funny and amusing scenes (sometimes when you least expect it), then I highly recommend this to you. story is going for with an amusing comment about how he'd rather take a nap than do anything 'bothersome'.Art: 9/10The animation is great, and the character design is a very favorite of mine.

Rating on those aired 4 episodes, i think the story is very interesting. This anime isn't focused on a tragedy or a romance anime, but it still made me shed tears near the end of the 4th episode. Therefore, for story i give it an 9. It meets my requirements and i genuinely enjoy animes that can make me emotionally unstable because it just shows how much attention i'm giving the anime.For the art, it looks rather basic. Lol im kidding, i think the art is cute. Kuro's fashion makes me think moe, but...uh that's not the point. The art is exceeds my average standards. Leading my rating for it, another 9.For sound wise, i'm not sure if i enjoyed it too much. The voice actors were incredible however, as always. The opening did match the the of the anime so although the beat wasn't quite my taste, I did understand. Sound gets an 7.To be honest, the characters in the anime were the main part it was so interesting. Kuro's lazy personality really helped lighten the anime and made it easier for the watcher to consume. The story in general about vampires isn't realistic but the MC displays realistic human emotion which helps the person watching relate a little. The supporting characters made me feel like they were really needed to bring the story up as they did their job well. Sometimes in animes, the supporters don't do the job well which make watchers think that they're not needed in general. With these details included, this section scores yet another 9.Finally the enjoyment, this may just be personal because everyone has their own enjoyment level on different animes, but mine was a 10. This anime led me on with plot development and suspense. I couldn't wait for the next episode and when i realised i had finished watching all the currently aired ones, i was rather devastated.Overall this anime scores a whooping 9. I suggest you try out this anime if you have nothing better to do or you're looking for an anime to really make you excited.This concludes my review. uh that's not the point.

No matter when or where, there is always people hoping that 'someone' would come and because that 'someone' would definitely appear, the world keeps going.

If that’s the case, then “Servamp” is right up your ally.To make things clear, I do not mind the ideas the show has to offer. I found the concept of Servamps and Eves to be quite interesting. The problem I had with it was how everything was presented. Each episode gave us new subplots after another where eventually we have a bunch of things happening at the same time with almost no conclusion. It then makes me question what the main plot...is because when something new happens, that suddenly takes priority. By the time the series finished, many things were left discarded and unanswered.Similar to the plot, the characters never go anywhere in terms of personality. They just appear and decide to be involved in the conflict like it was nothing. The main characters have zero presence and don’t even feel like main characters. I had a hard time figuring out who the actual antagonist was or if there even was one. It’s not an exaggeration when I say that we get two of more characters introduced each episode. We’re overwhelmed with all of these people who have little to no presence. There is one thing I would like to mention. Each of the Servamps represent one of the seven deadly sins, and two of them are disregarded save for a flashback scene way later into the show. It was to my surprise that these two had appeared within five chapters of the manga, which baffles me because I don’t know why that choice was made.The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It’s actually not that bad. The character designs were unique and each episode was often consistent. The action sequences weren’t terrible, but still a bit uninteresting. I did like it when the style changed like when a Servamp was using its powers or we were inside their minds.Although it had some good ideas and animation, “Servamp” is still pretty boring with nothing to it. If I may be completely honest, the only thing that I truly got out of the show was the opening theme. It’s one of the styles of music that I love, but what got me was how unexpected it was. I had known beforehand that this was based on a shoujo manga, so this opening surprised the hell out of me. Knowing there are major differences in the manga, I may give that a shot someday. Otherwise, I don’t plan on revisiting the anime. is because when something new happens, that suddenly takes priority.

Just the fact that it was actually published in a Josei magazine baffles me. Who thought it was a good idea?________________________________________STORY: 2/10What do you get when you add 'figthing for my freinds!!!1!!!' with vampires with a survival game? The answer is a clusterfuck of characters and battles with lame motivations who's names you can't remember due to horribly executed master/servant relationships. The plot is very hard to follow at points, but from what I did follow, it wasn't that good to begin with. The conclusion,...to top it off, is satisfying. Like, very satisfying. Almost made me wish that the series  actually had something good earlier so I could've gotten at least a bit of enjoyment out of it.________________________________________ART: 4/10Servamp's art and animation just scream 'bland'.  The animation seems to avoid any difficult  character positions which looks weird at some parts. The art is colorful at the very least, but still feels dried up almost, like it sat in the sun for too long.________________________________________SOUND: 4/10For the most part, the voice acting, though half of them were annoying, were unique, and it helped the terrible characters become a little more distinguishable. As for the rest of it... well if you like heavy metal blaring in your ears, this is for you.________________________________________CHARACTER: 2/10The characters are frustrating to me. Mostly, because even if they are all VERY sexualized towards a female audience, some of them still look pretty cool! Kuro especially, and that lobster guy. Oh, and the piano kid. I don't have a reason to look up their names; the show didn't give me one. Despite some having alluring designs, they're motivations are so lame, it's hard not to laugh as they yell the way only anime characters can.________________________________________TL;DR: 3/10+Satisfying ending+Some good character design-Everything elseServamp isn't worth your time, honestly.

I binged the whole series and was quite entertained until the final episode.It felt like through the entire series we were constantly forced to switch lights between different characters to uncover their unique backstories, however, everything had to be cut off in a strange way, due to the lack of time. The conclusion is absolute garbage and I felt like reflecting on the show as a whole, I...know nothing interesting or unique about any of the characters with the exception of Lawless (who gets his own episode).The characters are all boring and flat and even the characters with some depth like Sakuya and Licht, they have a couple moments before receding back into their boxes. Its all very cut and dry until the last episode where you hope for some satisfaction only to be severely disappointed.As someone who watched the anime with rose colored glasses, I can only compare it to the currently ongoing manga. The manga and the anime are two completely different entities with the anime missing dramatically important character development points, plus the villains' whole motivation. If you seem intrigued by the concept (which I think is awesome), definitely save the hassle of watching the show and instead pick up the book instead. It has way more character points and develops the story much more naturally than the rushed anime.Overall, read the manga instead. know nothing interesting or unique about any of the characters with the exception of Lawless (who gets his own episode).The characters are all boring and flat and even the characters with some depth like Sakuya and Licht, they have a couple moments before receding back into their boxes.

I feel like the adaptation went well but not as well as it could have went.For the story, as it happens in lots of adaptations of any manga, the sequence of the plot changes a little and that can be quite a put-off. Some of the original story isn\'t even adapted and others are either short or expanded. It feels like episode to episode,...your opinion of the show itself changes…The art and effects are still very well done, like the fight scenes. Themangaka\'s original style, like the thick and rough paint brush strokes for the ""dramatic"" effects, are incorporated in a good way. The animation is very clear, also. I\'d say what I didn\'t wnjoy was the stop-start of character motion in comedy scenes…I feel like there wasn\'t enough done on top of that to give the watcher the notion that it even was a comedy scene.The bgm could have been a little better. Where it was good, it did well to bring the moment to life I\'d say. The theme songs help set the mood for the show in a positive way-- like the OLDCODEX op gives off the dark and action-ish feel and the cv ending brings more life to the characters. (I really enjoyed the ed because it was cute lol)The cv\'s do a very good job of voicing the characters…I\'ve had plenty of moments where a character appeared and I was like ""wow, that\'s exactly what I thought he\'d sound like!!!"" As far as development goes, some characters are focused on more than others so it feels like you know them more (example Kuro and Mahiru) and everyone else just kinda fits into their roles and that\'s it :( because their backgrounds aren\'t adapted much at all.Overall, I do enjoy the adaptation as much as I do the manga. I did notice the friendship theme and it\'s strong prevalence in the plot…which isn\'t bad but it does make up a large theme of the series itself…take it out and it would be completely different and would probably have a more mature feel to it. The action is good and the dramatic scenes could\'ve used a little more work I believe. ""Yes!! More dark shoujo is needed in this world!"" is what I thought when I first started to enjoy the series (and is true after all). It\'s all guys (yessss) pretty much so for shoujo/reverse harem fans it isn\'t very hard to find a bias or two. No romance either (that was a plus for me) so it doesn\'t interfere with the plot.

Forming a pair made them a little more fragile, but they also got another person to help them and all the pairs shown worked well on their own as well as with other servamp and eve pairs.I liked Tsubaki's development, Kuro's, and Greed's; I also enjoyed how Mahiru and the other eves grew too....The action was also  a huge plus for the show, even though it could always be better.  Despite how much I enjoyed the show, I think there was too many plot twists.  Every-time that they carried out one plan, another huge huge event or just sometime they didn't account for would take place.  I'll still give this an 8/10 because it was really enjoyable, the theme song was really good and added to the mood, and the characters were all lovable if you like their personalities.  If you think, the things I mentioned sound interesting, watch it, if not, avoid it. The action was also  a huge plus for the show, even though it could always be better.

I also want to make note that I am HUGELY particular when it comes to anything dealing with vampires so if I liked a vampire series there must be something good about it.Overall I really enjoyed this series. I adore all the characters and being some one that does yaoi shipping all the time I love that this series just hands you the material on a silver platter. This is another series that has a character for everyone...to fan over and the voice cast is very spot on as well. The story is also very unique in the idea that the vampires serve the humans they drink from and are bonded to them. It does have a slight black butler feel to it so I feel like fans of that series (which I am one of) would really enjoy that aspect of this show.However, this show does have quite a few faults that can\'t be ignored but I feel like its import to say that most of these issues could be solved with a second season. I quickly went and found the manga to read and I realized that episode 9 of the anime is chapter 31 of the manga. I think what\'s happened is the anime team decided that rather than trying to properly introduce 14+ important characters in just 12 episodes they choice to pick out the story arches that focused mainly on the 2 main characters and probably intend to fill in the rest of the content later if the first season does well and gets green lighted for a season 2. I could see how the story arches could easily be told in a different order than they are told in the manga in order to make that possible so most issues should be fixed if a season 2 does happen.With that in mind i have two issues with this series. First is that virtually no questions get answered as to why the vampires powers work this way or even the details on exactly how their powers work or even larger picture questions ""like are these the only vampires in the world or are there others that don\'t work this way"". You are told in the manga that a lot of these things are a mystery even to the vampires themselves because they don\'t particularly like what they are and don\'t want to investigate it any further. My other issue is that the ending of this segment of the anime is super fast and doesn\'t explain at all how the issue actually got resolved. I haven\'t fully caught up with the manga yet but I suspect that the wrap up of the last story arch was happening pretty much at the same time as the anime was being produced and again the ending could always be better explained in the first episode of another season.Overall I really enjoyed watching this series for the story theme and characters (and this has to be the funniest role i\'ve ever heard chuck huber do). I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys things like black butler or even blue exorcist but keep an open mind to the potential it could have in the future or even read the manga as well. to fan over and the voice cast is very spot on as well.

The show kept throwing characters at us instead of trying to make us take the plot more seriously....The stakes felt non existant and the resolution felt extremely rushed. I'm not fully sure if something is meant to come after this but is there is it still has a lot of thing it needs to answer. Who is the guy who created servamps and why did he do it? Whats with all the weird powers of an eve and servamp? Why can the mc change his weapon all of a sudden? how do the servamps know they die if their object gets destroyed when none of them have spoken to their creator? Where are the other servamps? Why is C3 a thing and what's the deal with them? Why does emo catboy have a lion form? What was the villain even trying to accomplish i still don't know??art:the art was pretty decent. The designs were good. The emo catboy Kuro was the whole reason why i decided to watch the show in the first place. I saw him, blacked out, and by the time i realised i had finished the whole anime (man i wish he had more screentime). The mc had the most boring design, i guess it makes sense since his whole thing is liking simple stuff but he couldv'e at least had a bit more of a unique design if we have to stare at him for the majority of the show. The world itself felt pretty empty, the backgrounds were nothing special and did the bare minimum of establishing a setting. The animation felt very stiff. The fighting lacked any kind of impact or force and felt ~muddy~. There wasn't any glaring issues with the art that took all of my attention though so i can't complain too much. Kuro's design is amazing though i still can't get over itsound:very good, nothing to complain about in this department. wasn't particularly memorable but was servicable. The opening theme was pretty funcharacters:i mentioned earlier how this anime just kept shoving characters in with barely any development. The 2 exceptions to this would be the blonde hedgehog guy and his eve, angel piano boy. They had a super fun dynamic and had a lot of character growth. i got pretty invested in those 2. kuro, while his design was my favourite, was pretty boring. i'm not fully sure i understood his regrets but it was nice seeing him actually face his problems at the end. the grell rip off was annoying, the villain was stupid, green hair guy should've had a romance subplot with the mc, the coffin guy and pride were boring, and there were loads of others that were pretty disappointing. Luckily the mc was actually kind of smart and i could appreciate his independant mindset and all that, though he wasn't very memorable. I'm assuming the manga handled all of these characters a lot better but i haven't read it yet so i can't confirm.final thoughts:i mean, it could've been worse. would i recommend it? not really no, if you are gonna watch it don't set your expectations too high. There's some funny moments and some character interactions were an absolute treat but nothing special. it managed to keep my attention for the most partat 5/10, not offensively bad, not terribly good either, i don't regret the watch though The stakes felt non existant and the resolution felt extremely rushed.

While I have no idea how the manga progressed, considering this anime was only 12 episodes while the manga is still publishing, it\'s obviously not going to follow the manga to a tee; that being said, that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be great on its own. Unfortunately, while I find myself wanting to read the manga, it\'s because I want to know just how...badly the anime screwed things up.Story: 5The story premise is decent enough, but the progression in the anime was awful. There was one episode towards the end where a good chunk was the backstory of a character that did practically nothing for the plot; what was covered could have easily been summarized into two minutes of brief flashbacks (as opposed to the long ones) so the viewer could understand a few of the dynamics between this character and a few of the others. On the other hand, some of the most anticipated battles get...well, no screen time. And the ending of the series was pretty much the default ending for a few of the episodes, since apparently, the writers couldn\'t be bothered to create a special final line for the last episode.Art: 6The art was interesting at times, but ultimately, nothing special.Sound: 5The opening is heavy metal, so I\'ll admit I was biased towards it, not being a fan of that genre. I tried to listen the whole way through the first time but just couldn\'t bring myself to. The closing is pretty random for the series and a total contrast to the opening. While there is music throughout much of the series (courtesy of one of the characters), the music played often feels misplaced, making it even annoying. The sound of one of the characters (hint, the one who says ""happy birthday"") I felt was well done.Character: 4The main character Mahiru was made annoying; by that, I don\'t mean his character type (which is also annoying), but I mean he was literally made to be especially annoying even for his type. How many times do we have to be reminded about how he likes things ""simple"" (his definition of simple isn\'t the average)? Turns out quite often. Kuro, the other main character, is actually the only character I cared for in the whole anime by the end; kitty Kuro and his silly moments are actually some of the few highlights of the show for me.Besides those two, we have the tsundere friend; the two extra friends who have almost no screen time outside of the first episode; the snobby rich kid; the ""hot"" guy who appears to be a lolicon (which none of the characters even comment on...); and featuring the villain who is psycho but with some ""sad"" backstory...actually, make that villains. That\'s not even all of them, but you get the idea. Granted, stereotypical character types can still be done well to where the characters don\'t feel recycled, but in this anime they aren\'t.Enjoyment: 5The best way to watch this is probably to binge-watch and finish it in a day or two; it retains some entertainment value at least since you keep anticipating those revelations and epic battle scenes, while not giving yourself enough time to get frustrated that they still haven\'t showed up, just to let all the disappointment and frustration sink in after you finished. I personally binge-watched, finished the series in two days, and looking back I don\'t want to think about how I would be feeling if I had watched this weekly as it was airing.Overall: 5To be honest, I\'m probably being generous, but there\'s a lot worse out there in my opinion. I can\'t compare this to the source of material (the manga), as much as I wish I could. I can only assume that they crammed as much as they could, based on what was published, to try to create a full series while making an alternative ending; an ending which, quite frankly, sucked. If you have free time, and have nothing better to watch, go ahead and watch Servamp. Otherwise, go ahead and watch the next series on your to-watch list. badly the anime screwed things up.Story: 5The story premise is decent enough, but the progression in the anime was awful.

It\'s the first anime I have seen where they have used important scenes to make them as short as possible to let them run concurrently just like in the episode with C3.For me it looks like they just want to bring everything in 12 episodes as fast as they can do.The anime based on...one big annoying problem called ""Friendship"". It may would become a little bit better if they had used 1 or 2 \'friendship moments/sentence\' what ever fewer.The characters are interesting but not really that good. We have 7+1 vampires and there Eve\'s and a few freaks from C3 and a strange Doctor, that\'s it.[I\'m sorry if my english is not that good] one big annoying problem called ""Friendship"".

I will say it wasn't the best, but it didn't suck. I give Servamp an 8/10.Story:The story wasn't that bad. It didn't have any depth though. It was kinda cliché. MC gets some sort of special something and then tries to save the world. But the whole servamp concept makes up for it. BTW a servamp is a servant vampire if you didn't know that already.

I didn't really hate any of the characters. The bad guy, Tsubaki, insane. I mean insane! The MC, Mahiru, however was kinda generic. He's the character that will run into a battle head on, risk his life for a friend, you know that kind of character. My favorite characters by far would have to be Lawless and Licht.

I thought what little humor it had was done well and the story was gripping enough to make me not drop the show. It was 'just' about gripping enough so don't expect an amazing story just expect to be entertained because this show definitely does that.Now onto the characters. We have Kuro, a vampire who can turn into a cat. Mahiro, a simple guy but quite unique. Sakoya(I think), who is his mate and other various characters. I really liked Kuro and wanted to learn about his backstory...from the get-go and I was supplied with it. The rest of the cast are ok and the only others which stand out are Lawless and Licht who are my fav side characters in the show.The opening is really good. Possibly top 10 maybe.

I personally think the anime tried to fit what could've been 24 or 25 episodes into 12 episodes. This is because they didn't introduce a lot of the servamps and eves, didn't explain C3 thoroughly enough, and the storyline was kind of unorganized and all over the place. It was very anti-climatic and overall kind of confusing. I also think this anime had poor character development.~It's one of those anime with great potential, but poor set up (the way things played out wasn't very organized), but that's...just my opinion.The character design was amazing (visually) and they had cool and unique features/traits but they weren't developed deep enough. A lot of characters just showed up and had a mini background story, but to me that was kind of weak. The development (background info.) on the characters was merely just enough to make them relevant to the story line, rather then deep development that makes the character understandable. I understand that this was only 12 episodes, but I've seen anime with only 12 episodes that can perfectly develop characters.In addition to poor character development many of the characters showed up, like servamps and eves, but weren't developed at all. To me I thought it would be important to at least meet all the servamps, but only some were introduced.For example, the queen that Greed (Hyde) was infatuated with had more screen time then most of the servamps, and she was only used in a background story to 'develop' him. While Greed and Licht (the angel) were my favorite parring, I personally think they had better character development than Mahiru and Sloth/Kuro/Sleepy Ash (the main characters).Another problem I had with the anime was it was a little confusing and kind of unorganized. There was a point in the story where there was a flashback about the Servamps and Kuro's history with his family. While it was a good idea to include the flashback into the plot, I personally think it should've been elaborated on more. It was a quick flashback that apparently was a big deal throughout the show. It seemed like something so small in the plot, but it affected the main characters in a way, that I think, shouldn't have been such a big deal. I saw it as something in the past, but it kept coming up as something that affected the relationships between multiple characters.Adding on to my list of picky complaints, I think the goal/reasoning (for the anime) wasn't evident till the last episode, this anime's antagonist wasn't made a big deal (in my eyes), his appearance was minimal. The conclusion of the anime was based solely on stopping this antagonist, but I just thought he was a crazy man everyone need to keep an eye out for. In the end, the way the plot played out, it made it seemed like this anime didn't have a point.As you can see character development and plot are kind of a big thing to me, and I know for some people it isn't and that's where people may disagree with me, but this is my two cents on everything ~.< just my opinion.The character design was amazing (visually) and they had cool and unique features/traits but they weren't developed deep enough.

Half way through it took a lot of effort just to sit through a whole episode without falling asleep or getting up and doing something else... watched most of the series in 5-10 minute pieces. Started off at about a 7.5/10 but slowly got to about a 4.5-5/10. I was very disappointed that after all the action/anticipation the ending is not completed with a ""season finale battle"" so to speak. Don\'t worry, that\'s not a spoiler to anything but this being a bland...anime. Thanks for reading! anime. Thanks for reading!', ""Oh, I tell you what, this anime doesn't deserve the rating it has right now. It went way beyond my expectations.The concept of this anime is endlessly interesting to me. Right away, the jumping off point for the plot of this anime was sure to be a success based on the information given to us about Servamps and their Eves. Add on top of that the wealth of interesting characters, and you've got the makings of an awesome anime.Here's where it went wrong: simplicity (no pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). Servamp's potential was really strong, but it...fell short when it came to expansion. For example, had the anime dug into the history of Servamps a bit more, it would've been a lot more enjoyable. You get the bare minimum that you need to understand the story, but there's so much lost information that would be really interesting to learn about.Also, you'll see these bonds develop throughout the anime that don't have as much basis as they could have because the relationships lack development. It doesn't really cause the partnerships to feel forced or disingenuous, but it doesn't feel like the audience is missing a piece of development. That's not true of all the characters as one particular pairing had a really lovely backstory that supported their current relationship nicely. However, I would've liked for there to be just a bit more focus on the friendships in the anime since the overall theme of it hinges on friendship.Besides those things, this anime was tops. It was extremely enjoyable, and I really only came up with those criticisms after watching it and thinking about what issues there were. The characters were fun and alluring, the story was told in a very intriguing way, and I want more of it. I don't know if a new story is entirely necessary as it probably would've been better to have an expanded first season, but I want to watch these characters more. You're not gonna get deep and complex world-building from this anime, but I think you'll still have a great time watching it. If all else fails, the humor is perfect. Can't go wrong with a good laugh. fell short when it came to expansion. For example, had the anime dug into the history of Servamps a bit more, it would've been a lot more enjoyable.

The vampire, Kuro, is a servamp (servant vampire) and they end up making a contract after getting attacked by another vampire. The story follows Mahiru, Kuro, and more people they meet along the way trying to stop the main antagonist Tsubaki from killing and such.Characters - 9/10The characters have nice designs. The servamps are basically the seven deadly sins (one of the characters being ""the 8th"" one) so it\'s easy to remember them. They don\'t get into all of their...backstories, only Kuro (Sloth) and Hyde (Greed). My favorite character would have to be Licht. I found his personality the most interesting and he was entertaining while on screen. Something I have to note are the interactions between the characters. They have lovely bonds and connections that are just nice to see. We\'re also able to see character development for a few of the characters.Story - 7/10I wish they had gone more in depth with the story. It felt like there needed to be more explained about Tsubaki\'s character as well as the other sins who weren\'t in it too much. Kuro and Hyde being able to find resolvement for what happened in their pasts was one of my favorite things about the story.Art - 8/10I enjoyed the art style and the animation.

As a kid that he grew up after his mother is dead his uncle decide to adopt him as his own and learn the phrase ""simple is best"". Which is a great phrase... That I should learn.Hence he adopt a cat and name him Kuro. One day after coming back from school he found a man in his home watching TV and eating some cup noodle.He warn Mahiru to not to say his name but since this is a shounen anime which I have no idea why this is a shoujo anime....He has to open his mouth and BAM those two are bound together for at 24 hrs unless Kuro have Mahiru blood. Once his friend got stab by a servamp or a servant vampire. He has been bond together as vampire and eve as he try to stop the Tsubaki also the 8th servamp.Art and animation: The animation is like the show is not bad but is not great as well. Oh don\'t get me wrong there are some great art in the series that look fantastic like Kuro mental state of problem and Hydes past but other than that nothing special. I usually don\'t called out studio but I\'m gonna do it this time. Brain\'s base I expected better from you. This is the same studio who made Baccano, Natsume yuujinchou, Durarara and one of my favorite sport anime from 2016 cheer boys. I just felt it could be better a little bit as specially the ED. Like, ok... I get it kekkai sensen ED was pretty popular... can we move on from that ED?? Then we have the OP.... I\'m not gonna talk about it here.Characters: No offense but Mahiru is bland. He is a typical shounen protagonist like Nagai kei from Ajin. A simple guy that wants to live in a simple life but he couldn\'t. I don\'t see him as a MC hell I don\'t see any of the characters in the series needed besides from Hydes, Mikumi and Licht. None of them get any character development that they should have gotten. Misano is a little angry little shouta. While, Testu is a character that should be in Hatsukoi monster instead of this series and the rest were there to be there characters. The only point that Mahiru to be there is for the faint of his friend, Sakuya. We learn that Sakuya is a sub-class of Tsubaki. Sub-class are the human almost dying then turn into a servamp. Sub-classes are not allowed to disobey the master order. Therefore, Sakuya must follow his master order Tsubaki and disobey if he wants to live. Tsubaki is a psychotic villain that likes to make bad puns like Fango without the puns from 91 days but his character is different. Unlike Fango which is a psychotic person throughout the series. Tsubaki is a person that actually have some caring side to him showing that he does care for his sub-classes. Most psychotic characters will go psychotic to everyone even his own minions. unfortunately, this series doesn\'t like to keep a lot of good thing. Like the OP(still not talking about that yet). Now for the other servamp they are barely develop. I mean Doubt-Doubt has nothing special going on beside having a boxes as his head. Lily is nothing but a stripper, making kids to sub-classes and finding the reason why Mikumi and his brother can\'t like each other. Also we never get to see the Gluttony and Warth besides flashback and there is the buildup between the battle of the 7 servamp and Tsubaki. Kuro is the best character next to Tsubaki. Cute in cat form and the distance between the other servamp and seeing him not being one of the best servamp so Mahiru can actually proceed and snap him out of his order of mental despair. now we the best character Hydes. Introduces in the middle of the series I thought that he is gonna be the worst character of the entire series. However episode 10 happen and change my perspective of his character (not gonna spoil anything).Now for the OP... I HATE THE OPENING. Is so hard listen and hard to get into it. Sure the visual were ok. But the song... You got OLDCODEX. I REPEAT OLDCODEX AND YOU WASTED THEIR TALENT. Usually I won\'t be this mad... But I enjoy some oldcodex AND YOU WASTED IT. They sang a lot of my favorite op and ed.<<Now please skip this part of the review as I am gonna talk about finale of the show and why it felt flat. So if you want to watch servamp skip to recommendation>>Now for the climax that we are waiting for... A hug... Are you kidding A HUG?! We have waited for an epic battle... the climax was real and it was real and you gave us a hug at the end. So why is Tsubaki mad and angry??? Nobody loves him. You are kidding me... Tsubaki a psychotic person that make a raining storm of sword out of the sky, has an army of sub-classes and mess with people mind for love?! That is stupid and NO you can\'t do such a thing. That sort ending can happen if they warn us a few episode back. take Shouwa we already know how is it gonna end as they show us in the first epsiode. This is the biggest problem of servamp. What the hell do you want to do?? Similar to Re:zero, servamp does not know what to be. Does it want to be a serious action anime or does it want to be a comedy action anime?? Hence it felt the series is doing too much overall. In the end is quite fun to watch but I see many other series does it better.Recommendation: So... do I recommend it... No... Not really... like I say is not great but is also not bad. However I do recommend it as an anime to get some time off your back if you have nothing to watch... Go watch servamp.Other recommendation: Noragami where the human and spirits fight together but instead of spirit is vampire. Then we have Owari no seraph both uses vampires and human relationship a little bit better than servamp.So servamp get an overall score of 5.5 out of 10. Like I say not bad but not good either.So would I say that servamp to be the worst anime of 2016?? OH HELL NO... I have sat through big order, bloodivores, Taboo tattoo and hundred. He has to open his mouth and BAM those two are bound together for at 24 hrs unless Kuro have Mahiru blood. Once his friend got stab by a servamp or a servant vampire. He has been bond together as vampire and eve as he try to stop the Tsubaki also the 8th servamp.Art and animation: The animation is like the show is not bad but is not great as well. Oh don\'t get me wrong there are some great art in the series that look fantastic like Kuro mental state of problem and Hydes past but other than that nothing special. I usually don\'t called out studio but I\'m gonna do it this time. Brain\'s base I expected better from you. This is the same studio who made Baccano, Natsume yuujinchou, Durarara and one of my favorite sport anime from 2016 cheer boys. I just felt it could be better a little bit as specially the ED. Like, ok... I get it kekkai sensen ED was pretty popular... can we move on from that ED?? Then we have the OP.... I\'m not gonna talk about it here.Characters: No offense but Mahiru is bland. He is a typical shounen protagonist like Nagai kei from Ajin. A simple guy that wants to live in a simple life but he couldn\'t. I don\'t see him as a MC hell I don\'t see any of the characters in the series needed besides from Hydes, Mikumi and Licht. None of them get any character development that they should have gotten. Misano is a little angry little shouta. While, Testu is a character that should be in Hatsukoi monster instead of this series and the rest were there to be there characters.

It\'s the sin of a human. The story is about seven vampires of which also named as seven major sins. It starts when a student picked a lone beautiful black cat on the way home, not knowing that it was a vampire. Along the serues, a bond between them will grow. And the past which Kuro, the vampire of sloth, wanted to bury will bring into light. There\'s really no amazing plot, interesting twist of the story, or unexpected turn of events...that happen. What excites me is the flashback of their past and the regret felt by the protagonist of the story. The way the story shows that sin is a natural part of life, the people make mistakes and acceptance is always around the corner. I also love the words of wisdom the characters said from their own perspective and belief. But it is kind of incomplete, it is lacking of justification and explanation as to why and how that thing happened.Characters: 7I hate weak characters. I hate those type who talk much more than do. Those who always blabber about their ideals, but is useless is really annoying. Well, the MC of the story is human so I guess it is understandable. What I find irritating is his speech of hope and friendship and saving, the kind of character who\'s only dependent on something dependable. Rest aside his character, the other character are cool and changed in a better way. They realize the things they have done wrong and decided to move forward, accept their mistakes. The fear they\'ve felt, the number of times they ran away, they overcome it and was release from the burden they only made themselves. I love the character of Kuro. A very lazy person with an eyebag very noticeable, make me miss Lawliet.Sound and Animation: 10""Mendokse"". How I heard this expression so many times and how I love it. The voices of the characters are great and catchy. It really matches the expression of them which is really cool. Each of them is different from each other, but their all handsome and cute. The emotions was really attached on the characters expression. Lastly, the pyscho characters voices is really something.Enjoyment: 8I wanted Kuro. I love characters like him. Lazy but strong, cute and cool, serious and mysterious. Him being the highlight of the story made me enjoyed watching it. In a way, the series also made me curious of the sins past, the revelations that should happen and felt that I wanted more.Ending: 7I\'m thinking that the ending is out of character. It was plain normal and the way the war cooled off was like a joke. Yes, I understand the human\'s emotion can also be answered by the same emotions. I get that he only want salvation, a person who will accept his existence. It is predictable if you see through the character. But as a viewer, you will always expect for more. More unexpected outcome in the end, more surprises and the like. Additionally, there were still unanswered questions. The ending was fine but if only there will be next season, it will be great. that happen. What excites me is the flashback of their past and the regret felt by the protagonist of the story.

I will attempt to keep it spoiler free. I will put a warning beforehand if I do include a spoiler.Story: 7/10The story was good. Vampires are really nothing new to work with both in anime and in Hollywood and the like. I can\'t say the story was super new, exciting, and unique, because it really wasn\'t. Being unoriginal doesn\'t equate to the story being bad though. As I\'ve said,...it is a good story, and it was definitely enough to keep me watching. Basically, Mahiru is our main protagonist. He likes simplistic things, and hates troublesome things. He picked up a black cat who (not really a spoiler since this is in some synopses of this show) is a vampire. He names the cat/vampire Kuro. Together they join forces with other vampires to fight bad vampires. That is in VERY simple terms. I\'m sure Mahiru would approve of my description. Don\'t let this cliche storyline stop you from enjoying the plot though. While it isn\'t exactly original overall, it does have its unique points.Art: 7/10The art was good! The character designs especially were very enjoyable. Who doesn\'t like watching attractive bishounen-type characters fight each other? If the rest of the art was as good as the characters, this score would have been a little higher. Of course, even the characters weren\'t worth 10/10 or anything like that. The art style isn\'t unique, it is just pleasing to the eyes is all. The backgrounds and scenery is my main complaint here. There are times the lighting seems a bit weird to me and makes the characters look almost puppet-like against the backdrop. All in all, I have no major complaints besides that.Sound: 9/10I really had no problem with the sound throughout the anime. I think all sound effects and background music were well-executed. Some people complain about the opening theme being a metal/screamo song instead of the usual jpop type of OP many anime have. I felt it was unusual and new, and probably the most unique thing about this anime. I also have a weak spot for metal anyways, so this appealed to me.Character: 9/10The characters in this show are either said to be very unoriginal and bland, or the polar opposite. I thought the characters were very well done. It isn\'t because they are super unique, but if you have any type of heart, then you will become attached to many characters in this anime. I am a sucker for sad backstories. If you are, too, then you will enjoy the characters of Servamp as much as I did.Enjoyment: 8/10I guess I could say it was really enjoyable. I binge watched about half of it one night and finished it the next morning. Normally I\'d binge watch it all in one night, so I cannot say my enjoyment exceeds an 8/10, but it is definitely worthy of that 8. I am also really looking forward to season 2 which is said to be coming out this year of 2017.Overall: 8/10I really enjoyed Servamp. Was it spectacular and the most amazing anime ever? No, not really. However, it was worth the watch. It is only 12 episodes, so it doesn\'t take much of your time. I would suggest to give it a chance if you like anime like Owari no Seraph for example. If you like bishounen vampires, overly ""anime"" type humor, cool fight scenes with cheesy character lines that are never let go, and memorable characters, then you\'ll enjoy this anime.I will be posting a more in-depth review on my new blog which is theotakutimesblog . wordpress . comThe blog is currently still under editing but it will be up hopefully within the next couple of days.Thank you for reading! it is a good story, and it was definitely enough to keep me watching.

Please do consider reading it, as it is MUCH BETTER than the anime. The anime does the series a LARGE disservice, pushing away potential readers. If it was mere promotional material for the manga then sure I guess it put it out there, but it's still one of the worst adaptations I've seen to date.I wish I'd done this sooner so more people would've read the manga. Alas, we can't always have nice things.Story - 6/10I know the story from the manga, so I rated this higher. If I'd only watched the anime...I'd probably give it a 4. Whoever the director was, I don't know what you eat for breakfast, but I don't think it's good given the quality you've given for this series. The studio could've made it better had this anime gotten a different staff, probably. The delivery in the anime was so...I don't even know where to start. So many nuances and neccessary build-ups lost. So much compressing plot points. If this were a 24-ish episode adaptation, I'm willing to bet it'd become a shounen powerhouse (not that it's labelled a shounen, but whatever, it's shounen enough). I will edit this review later to actually argue but right now I'm just so mad so I'm sorry.Anyway, there are many alterations and cuts done from the original source material. Maybe so it'd all fit in the 13 episode cour. Nonetheless it was a futile attempt...again I will edit this when I've calmed down so this text is basically filler.Art - 3/10I'm sorry character designers but. BUT. I am not an artist, I respect your work. But to downgrade Tanaka STRIKE's art like this was not pleasant at all. I had to rewire everything and lower my standards to appreciate it. The manga's art was stellar, some of the best character designs in my opinion, for both males and females (though there are way more males here).If I were to rate animation, it'd be 5. Such a waste on a studio with acclaimed titles, really. The fight scenes were ok. I just. I just WISH it had the fluidity of the manga.Sound - 4/10This rating will likely change. As a fan of the artists who sang the openings and endings, I think they were okay. But the soundtrack overall was lacking.Character - 6The characters from the manga were brilliantly written. Here, I don't know what happened to some of them but....ah. Whatever lol. Will edit this to explain more.Enjoyment - 6As a huge seiyuu fan, hearing these characters was literally the only thing keeping me from watching (they did a great job okay). And seeing them animated I guess.Overall - 5Just. READ THE MANGA PLEASE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I'd probably give it a 4.

Well like stated below, the characters are real. Not only based off of their portrayed ""labels"", but in reality, tell me one time any of us have not crumbled under the ""friendship"".also lets remember the ages in these anime. If you are older than 17+...of course you may not feel like it can resonate with you!! the largest watching party is normally in high school or early college!It gets better, if you already made it to episode 4,...i can promise by 5, 6, 7 it slowly becomes a lot like ""seraph of the end"" and stuff. I get the feeling that this wasn\'t created by the most professional or experienced artists, so with that in mind...they REALLY did a good job. i can promise by 5, 6, 7 it slowly becomes a lot like ""seraph of the end"" and stuff.

This anime is, through and through, a journey of learning about the characters as the characters learn about themselves. It offers you several questions, but doesn\'t leave you hanging for the answer at the end of the anime. Everything is solved, and yes, the characters are indecisive compared to most stereotypical anime characters. But that just makes it more human. My enjoyment was a definite ten, but I rated it a nine because I always want to believe an awesome story like this can be even better.Anime like this, with full fledged characters, with unresolved feelings,...history, and ideas.

Brief appearances by Hiroshi Kamiya and Daisuke Ono (faves of mine).The story has a simple pattern to follow, each servamp representing 7 sins and all that. It\'s not overly complicated. I think it\'s primarily meant to be a fun anime. It DOES attempt to get ""deep"" and I don\'t see anything wrong with that. Most people won\'t considered it properly executed, and if I was completely unbiased, I would agree.Given how it only received 12 episodes, it\'s understandably a RUSHED anime. Friendships build...pretty fast by the 3rd episode, and they don\'t stand if you give it too much thought. The ending will undoubtedly disappoint many. I was (VERY), BUT I plan to check out the manga and hope there\'s something different, deeper, and overall better.However, I watch things primarily for the CHARACTERS and their interactions with each other. So, I found this anime VERY enjoyable mostly because I invest primarily on characters just a little bit more than plot execution. I loved the servamps and how we were able to learn a lot about at least 3 of them. Some of the Eves hint at deeper backstories, but, again, 12 episodes isn\'t enough to expand. I hope the manga goes further.Might come down to personal tasted, but my #1 problem is Mahiru. Yes, yes, he\'s a basic protagonist, the Every Man here... but he\'s so ANNOYING at times. And the lines he repeats, while they ARE his way of life... still ANNOYING to hear every episode. I only tolerate him because he\'s nothing without Kuro.Anyway, I enjoyed it overall. As of writing this review (Jan. 12, 2017) I heard the manga author is ill, so the manga will go into hiatus.

It was pretty interesting seeing the concepts and how they unraveled, even though somethings go unexplained or poorly so. Which is overall my main problem with this anime, it felt rushed, it had great potential but I don´t think it was suited to be told in 12 episodes, I believe splitting the anime into at least 2 seasons would have been better as at some point it feels like there are too many subplots or things going at the same time with a quick pacing....There is only one episode however dedicated to one of the Servaps and personally my favorite of the series, it shows how it could have been, it is the slowest paced episode but considering how quickly everything else was going on it allowed us to invest much deeper into the character of greed.enough it felt rushed, I don´t it to blame the story itself and more so of the contract as I am pretty sure it is difficult for a minor manga series like  Servamps to get a contract for a second season, even with bigger anime such as Yuri on Ice a second season didn´t happen. It just seems the producers just wanted to tell the story they wanted to tell with the time they had.Even though rushed and quick-paced, the characters are super likable and only seeing their interactions alone it's pretty enjoyable, even with a simple story. I caught myself quickly liking the characters after the second episode and I felt the world had so much to be explored.Something that I enjoyed is that they don´t add all of the deadly sins and focus merely on the ones important to the current plot, otherwise it would have been way worse with too little screen time for the already big main cast.I only wish it had more time to develop the emotional arches and morals of the characters it was trying to convey, as well as familial relationships. The execution wasn´t bad but slight above average, possibly wouldn´t have enjoyed as much if the characters hadn´t had their own charm and personality to keep the story together.

Having a vampire as a servant is quite cool and it's the first anime I've watched with such theme. Well, in terms of originality, I must deduct points for that because it's kinda of quite your typical master-slave relationship.Characters: 6I'll just be discussing some characters here.Mahiru: A typical must save all peace loving main character. Not fond of him but at he doesn't annoy me as much as the girl in Code Breaker. Shows some character development at the very end of the episodes (somewhere between...10-12ep). However, I felt distant with the character. I don't know much about him. Where's his father, where's his uncle gone too? etc.Kuro: I kind of like his lazy ass character. At least his not the typical cool, cold protagonist. However, so many questions left unanswered about him. I wish they developed his character a bit more. And also, his true powers, I wish they show more of his true, awesome powers as the first creation of the servamps! All I got to see is his sloppy side. Minus points for that.Tsubaki: A moderate villain with lots of potential. Like Mahiru and Kuro, there's nothing much to this character. There's no character development at all. Like, I still don't know why is he in so much despair or why is he even created in the first place. Where does he come from? Whose' his Eve? He must have on since the others need one too.OP: 7Nice opening. Usually not my cup of tea but this one grabs my attention.Over all: 6.I would love to rate this story as high as 8.5 because with the kind of plot and foundations of awesome characters with cool powers, this story can go far. It could be even up par to SNK and the rest cool most favourited anime. But because of the plot holes, the rushed ending, the undeveloped character, I could only give a 6.

Guessing you have already seen it then it\'s the freaking vampires. Why are they called vampires? They don\'t need to suck blood, they are immortal and are created by a human. So considering that, why make them obey after you have given them a name, your blood and...an item. If you make some awesome creatures, you wouldn\'t want them to obey someone else and go after you right? that\'s a pretty stupid mistake to make.Also you can only kill them buy destroying the object, if you just attack them they turn back into their little ""cute"" state which in itself is kinda bullshit. But when they are in their ""cuute"" state, they don\'t even have objects on them so they are pretty much immortal by that time. AND objects are given by masters so if they don\'t have a master they can\'t die ever????This is just a little part why I really disliked it other than missing main characters, boring plot developemend and other stuff that you can conveniently find on my channel on YouTube if you search for MudanTV. I even throw some funny sketches in there, freaking 10 hours of work on a video and only 20 people see it, such is life. an item.

Okay well, I frick\'in loved Kuro but every time Mahiru or whatever his name is would say something I\'d automatically be like ""Nobody gives af."" And other characters were a little insane but after you find out their backstories it\'s pretty understandable. And the relationships were good too. I really liked Kuro and Mahiru\'s relationship.Enjoyment---10/10....It never bored me, and I never felt like doing something else when I was watching it either. which says a lot cuz I got ADHD.

I\'d heard it around enough times that I assumed it would be really good. But boy was I disappointed. Torn between a 6 or a 7, the overall rating I had to give it was a 6.Most animes peak either in the middle or are great straight off the bat, only to progressively get worse, or (more rare) are good all the way throughout. Rarely ever have I seen an anime slowly get better within 2-3 episodes and then drop back to bad within a couple minutes.Within about 2 episodes...of watching Servamp I had determined that it was a waste of my time. But I pushed through, cause like I said, most animes will pick up from episode 3 onwards at least.The plot seemed a bit.. childish. The premise was interesting but the way it was executed was childish. The MC was whiny and annoying and his character development wasn\'t even worth sticking around for. It lowkey seemed all over the place. If anything, Servamp got worst as I went along. Most of the characters follow the usual tropes, in other words, they weren\'t original at all. The MC was definitely the worst character, he had literally no redeeming qualities. Three of the characters had their own catchphrase that could turn this anime into a drinking game (""Not interesting at all"", ""what a pain"" and ""thinking simply""). I could list so many other flaws, but the anime does actually have some good points.Firstly, despite how annoying the MC was, I liked his backstory. I liked the reason why he always stepped up to be that ""someone"". It made sense, lowkey hit me in the feels and I was excited to see where it would take him (it didn\'t take him anywhere but we\'re focusing on the good). Secondly, though most of the characters were stereotypical, some were quite enjoyable. They were all pretty eccentric and quirky in their own way, but overall likable. Some of the side characters feel a little underdeveloped, and although that would usually be fine, this anime gives them some unnecessary screen time for being underdeveloped side characters. It made me feel like they were important but then never went further to develop them.And here\'s why I struggled between a 6 and a 7. Hyde, Licht and Tsubaki are the best characters in the show by far. Ofc, personal opinion, but Hyde and Licht carried the show for me. Everything turned around for me when a whole episode was dedicated to Hyde\'s back story, and it made me appreciate the pair a lot more. I loved the character and relationship development, the backstory was really good, I wish they had shown more of Licht\'s.Then Tsubaki was amusing from the very first episode (which I think he was in, if not, second episode). They had dropped subtle hints of his character from the beginning, which Sakuya played the perfect role in (sidenote: Sakuya was also a very good character and miles better than the MC, understandably doesn\'t get that much air time as he is a side character for most of it). His backstory was also spot on and I wish they had shown more of it, it felt like it was rushed through as it was only shown towards the end.And aside from the final couple of minutes feeling like a mess that was quickly put together, the episodes prior to that were the peak of this show for me. Maybe it was just because it was the climax, but the quality just seemed to get better. I was definitely more invested within 3 episodes, had liked the characters more and didn\'t want it to end. The MC also didn\'t have that as much screen time towards the end as he did throughout everything, so maybe that\'s why lol.Overall, it wasn\'t as bad as I thought it was when I was watching in the beginning. I really thought I would\'ve rated this a 4, if not for the sudden shift in priority with the characters. I wouldn\'t say it makes this worth watching though, hence the 6. I\'d recommend this if you\'ve exhausted every mid anime possible (by personal opinion and preference), but otherwise, you\'re better of finding something else.Sidenote: Kuro is funny and has a somewhat relatable personality. However, he is glued to the MC and so that naturally decreases the quality of his air time from an 8 to a 4. of watching Servamp I had determined that it was a waste of my time.

It relies too heavy on a single villain, whose maniac laughter becomes repretitive already during the first episode. Other servamps turn up too easily and too fast.I think the series would've benefitted from the main character Mahiru having more on-screen relationships with humnans. They drop most of them after the first 1-2 episodes, which makes it difficult to understand Mahirus driving force of protecting those he like (aside from his vampire friend).Due to the focus on a single villain who attacks again and again...for vague reasons, I simply became bored. The introduction of a scary human(?) organization came too late to save my attachment to the show. I will not see the rest. for vague reasons, I simply became bored.

I enjoy the idea of it, and the plot had a cute outline, but it felt like the story veered off several times.

SPOILER WARNING: the protagonist defeats our antagonist with a hug. 5 minutes prior they were fighting and the entire city was being tortured with rain made of knives, and then the villain decides that he doesn't want to be evil because someone showed him the smallest sliver of love?

Samurai Flamenco,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco,"['Samurai Flamenco is a strange animal. Despite its conventional appearance, it is full of twists and turns. Overall, Samumenco addresses its core themes very effectively, primarily the theme of heroism. It has likeable and developed characters with distinct personality traits. It also comments on general character/plot tropes, mainly involving heroes and villains, as well as the sentai/tokusatsu genres. (And doesn’t always take itself too seriously while doing so.)It’s hard to find a show like this where you truly don’t know what to expect. It may be for this very reason that this show received such widespread negative reception: it\'s a bit quirky, but it...isn\'t initially apparent whether or not it\'s trying to be. Many would say that Samumenco isn\'t quite sure what it wants to be.

The eccentric main character, Masayoshi, is an upstanding young man with a strong vision of heroism. What he lacks in ability, he makes up for in spirit, which is pretty darn endearing. Another major standout was Maya Mari. The story starts out from the POV of the other male lead, Gotou, the ""average joe"" who gets fleshed out gradually, if not as thoroughly as some other main characters.

It requires the creator to have proper knowledge of the formula they\'re trying to deviate from by understanding how the tropes and trappings of said formula should be incorporated, in order for it to feel natural. With the right pedigree of writing and proper usage of the commonalities associated with the given formula needed, the creator is expected to build the illusion to the viewer that they\'re simply following the setup they\'ve already experienced countless of times before. And during...this stint of limbo, where the viewer is caught up in the illusion, the creator then proceeds to dismantle and ""deconstruct"" the formula that the viewer had grown accustomed to. While it may seem like a relatively simple process, all it takes are a few missteps for it to implode on itself. And more often than not, if the writing for the show is shoddy at best, the end result can be more of a trainwreck than anything noteworthy (School Days can attest to that).But perhaps the biggest reason that causes most deconstructions to fall flat on its face can often be something as simple as neglecting the fundamental building blocks of proper storytelling, more specifically, in this case, foreshadowing. Without it, things can come across as manipulated or just ""ass-pulled"" into the narrative. Proper foreshadowing is what allow the transition from following a formula to subverting it to feel natural. And when foreshadowing is non-existent, well..., we get things like episode 7 of Samurai Flamenco.Samurai Flamenco is a weird anime title, to say the very least. It\'s a satire, homage, parody, reconstruction, and deconstruction of the super sentai/superhero genre, all wrapped up in one. And if the idea of that sounds insanely convoluted to you, well, that\'s because it is. While the intentions it had was genuine, the presentation and overall direction it took to see its vision through fell short of the mark. And of course, many will simply single out the tonal/genre shift of the infamous 7th episode as their point of contention, but that was just one of many blunders the title made during its 22-episode run. At the end of the day, Flamenco just bit off more than it could chew.Brief history lesson: the Super Sentai phenomena have been something that has grown synonymous with Japanese culture with both live-action shows (Ultraman) and animated ones (Hurricane Polymar), for over 30 years. For the most part, it illustrates the fight between good and evil forces, and during its heyday, was a primary tool used to teach kids that ""justice always prevail."" Usually portraying a team of color-coded heroes, with the help of high-tech gadgets, they fight off evil forces that threaten the stability of mankind. Due to its kid-friendly programming, it didn\'t take long for it to gain success overseas, which eventually brought it stateside, most prominently with the cobbled together The Power Rangers franchise. The Super Sentai series are basically more kid-friendly versions of superhero shows (4Kids level if you will). As such, the super sentai genre has become a part of many people\'s childhood. And that\'s where a title like Samurai Flamenco comes in.Now with that out of the way, Flamenco can be split into two parts: the first being along the lines of a traditional coming of age story told through the setup of a superhero origin tale and the latter half being a super sentai show along the veins of Power Rangers. Following our protagonist Masayoshi Hazama, we see his journey from a petty enforcer of the law, tackling trivial matters like recycling and obeying traffic signs, to him being caught up in higher stakes that escalate as the story moves forward. Similar to movies like 2010\'s Kick-Ass and Super, the 1st half of the show is more of a satirical parody of what the traditional superhero story is generally comprised of. While possessing no real superpower or qualities of a superhero, to begin with, most of the charm of the 1st half is seeing an average Joe attempt to live up to the role of the TV-show superhero icon of his youth. The fact that his ""heroics"" was no different than what anyone else can do themselves went a long way in grounding the show in reality. He was simply a vigilantly running around in spandex and as such, we see the real-life repercussions of those actions. In real life, a guy running around a city with his underwear worn over his bodysuit ""defending justice"" would be viewed more like a lunatic and nuisance than an actual ""hero,"" and the show knows that. In a way, it exposes the childish ideals that those super sentai/superhero shows were trying to feed kids growing up by treating situation realistically. It\'s an externalized reflection of the mentality of us as we grow past such juvenile ideas and ""face the music"" of what life is truly is. And to be honest, if the show had continued to take this approach, that would have been enough to make it a solid satirical parody, but that just wasn\'t the case.Now where the controversy comes into play is the show\'s 2nd half. It transitions from what was, to that point, a down-to-earth parody of a superhero story, to a show that turns into a full-fledged supernatural super sentai deconstruction. This shift from a grounded account to an ""out of this world"" supernatural one was done with no foreshadowing or build-up whatsoever, and as a result, caused a whiplash of adverse reactions among viewers that didn\'t see it coming. The negative backlash the show received was harsh and rightfully so. It isn\'t the viewers\' fault, but rather the show for not handling the transition better. It didn\'t have to give away too much, but if it had simply dropped a few foretelling signs and hints throughout the narrative, its tonal shift would have been better received. Instead, it felt more like an out-of-place plot twist that had no business being there. While this was partially explained to those that finished the show, by that time, the damage was already done. This poorly handled decision was perhaps this show\'s biggest blunder.Not only was the tonal shift not handled well but the 2nd misstep was that the show crossed the line from being a parody to becoming the subject matter it was making fun of, to begin with. It would be like if someone were promoting equality but then turned around to proclaim themselves as a racist. It\'s contrived and defeats the purpose of the first action performed. While it still did an excellent job paying tribute to the super sentai genre, it did so with subtext that didn\'t match up with what was established in the show\'s 1st half. Tying back to what I was saying about this show taking on more than it can chew, the attempts at a deconstruction clashed with the narrative because of the already firm satirical stance the show had taken early on.Both the 1st half and the 2nd could have worked respectfully on their own, but when combined, they didn\'t have proper cohesion, and as a result, felt forcefully tact onto each other. It\'s like going from watching Neon Genesis Evangelion to the 2nd arc turning into Pokemon. Just because both titles have proxy battles, doesn\'t mean they should be bundled together as a single viewing experience. That\'s essentially what Flamenco did in a nutshell.This mismatched exhibition wasn\'t limited to just the narrative either.Like the show, the cast also ranged from down-to-earth to wacky. Some characters feel somewhat believable to what you\'ll find in the real world, like Hidenori Gotou, the show\'s person of reason and friend to our protagonist. But then, on the other side of the spectrum, the antagonists can range from street-level thugs to batshit crazy megalomaniacs akin to a Saturday morning cartoon. The further the show goes down the spiral of nonsense, the more ludicrous the characters involve becomes. Even our person of reason is shown to have a rather disturbing backstory revealed towards the latter half of the show, almost as if the writers wanted to take him down to coo-coo land with the rest of the nut jobs introduced.The lead protagonist, Masayoshi Hazama, was nothing more than a man-child, being an adult with the mindset of an adolescent. As such, most of his actions are done to counteract the rational mindset of Gotou in the show\'s beginning. This, of course, changes as the title progresses forward, but I\'ll leave that tidbit for you to discover yourself. There is also a handful of supporting characters that get caught up in the fray, but for the most part, Gotou and Hazama are the characters that take up most of the limelight and relevance in the story.The art and animation for Flamenco were a cut above average but nothing overly impressive. While the choreography of some of the action scenes was stiff at times, they still were serviceable enough to get a pass. The color palette of the 1st half is somewhat subdued and tamed, which fit quite well with the realistic tone it was aiming to serve. Later on, that was swapped out for a more schizophrenic display of color and elasticity, which helped in ramping things up a notch, matching the new up-tempo tone that the show took on.The sound department, for the most part, was an appropriate mix of rock, funk, latino and other superhero-esque flavoring used to add a nice punch to any given scene. It also doubled up as a means to establish atmosphere while also adding life where the animation couldn\'t perform on its own. The voice acting was also a cut above average with everyone involved delivering a satisfactory performance. Special mention for Juurouta Kosugi, who did a great job bringing the character of Jouji Kaname to life by providing a particular type of machismo hamminess to the way he talked.Now, with the general rundown out of the way, the best thing to take away from Flamenco is to understand what it was trying to do, rather than how its efforts panned out. The more you comprehend its intent, the more you could grow to appreciate it. The problems, however, stems deeper than that, and depending on how demanding of a viewer you are, might determine just how much you\'re able to tolerate from Flamenco to get those ideas tucked away inside it.While the show failed to deconstruct the super sentai genre accurately, it still did so in an entertaining and spectacular fiasco. It was so ""out there"" that I couldn\'t help but be entertained by its nonsense. It was certainly a unique experience that will stick with me, and despite not holding up as well as I was hoping it would, it was still something I was happy I watched.Samurai Flamenco is what happens when writers forget the importance of foreshadowing. It made a complete 180 in tone and genre without letting it gradually build up to that point, which in turn led to the notorious viewer backlash that\'s usually associated with those that hear of it. It was an interesting idea on paper but what we got instead was a failed attempt at a deconstruction that became the joke it was making fun of. Despite that, I suggest giving it a try, as it is an experience within itself that you can\'t honestly find anywhere else. this stint of limbo, where the viewer is caught up in the illusion, the creator then proceeds to dismantle and ""deconstruct"" the formula that the viewer had grown accustomed to.

There are a few genre shifts and plot twists that can seem to come out of nowhere, and for that reason a lot of people dropped this anime after the first shift or the second and gave it a low rating. Even I was apprehensive at first at the sudden genre shifts. However, I stuck the anime out until the end to give it a \'fair try\' and I am very glad that I did. The final arc wrapped up the story very nicely and the last episode left me coming...away from the whole thing feeling generally satisfied.However, this review is also a review spurred about by my third watch of the show, so I\'ve had more time to fully grasp the story and come to love it for what it is.First of all, the most important thing and what really tied this anime together for me and made it so worthwhile -Characters - 10/10.Honestly, this show\'s story did sort of fall flat in a lot of ways. However, the characters were very genuine and fleshed out, and they felt real - some of the best characters I\'ve seen in a recent anime. Masayoshi, Goto and Moe in particular will probably remain in my heart for a long time, as they just felt so genuine and really breathed a lot of life and enjoyment into the show that might not have been there otherwise.Story - 7/10It\'s not bad, but it\'s definitely not the best story out there either. There are four arcs to Samurai Flamenco - and some of these arcs were better than others. Particularly I found the 1st and 4th arcs good, but this does not mean that the others were necessarily bad - they just felt out of place or oddly-paced at times. It was easy to forget what I was even \'supposed\' to be watching, as the plot kept shifting so suddenly.Art - 7/10Again, not bad, but not the best either. It\'s definitely not anything extraordinarily beautiful. However, it\'s well-animated and the art isn\'t glaringly bad or anything. Just your typical standard anime fare. The art style was particularly refreshing, however, in my personal opinion, as it seemed to look a little more \'realistic\' than your usual anime (the proportions weren\'t as completely skewed as you usually see; it was more akin to FMA: Brotherhood in anatomy.)Sound - 9/10The OST is very good and I find myself listening to it every now and then, especially the Flamengers theme and the opening ""Just One Life."" All in all nice though there were a few songs that stuck out as seeming a little out of place (Usankusai comes to mind, though it wasn\'t necessarily bad, just... out of place.)Enjoyment - 9/10Keep in mind this is a rating upon rewatching the series and seeing it all really come together now that I understood what was happening. Depending on how well you can understand what\'s going on this may be lower.Overall - 8/10The point with Samurai Flamenco is to go into it with a truly open mind. If you go in expecting a certain type of show, you are very likely to end up disappointed - as the genre shifts a few times. Overall, however, the characters really make the whole thing worthwhile, and this will probably remain one of my favorite anime for a very long time. away from the whole thing feeling generally satisfied.However, this review is also a review spurred about by my third watch of the show, so I\'ve had more time to fully grasp the story and come to love it for what it is.First of all, the most important thing and what really tied this anime together for me and made it so worthwhile -Characters - 10/10.Honestly, this show\'s story did sort of fall flat in a lot of ways.

When we see or hear the word ‘hero’, we tend to think of a guy in a flashy outfit, with extravagant poses, and dynamic entrance. To add on to this faction, they also make it a mission to protect the people and save the world. Why? Simply because it’s the right thing to do. Samurai Flamenco qualifies the title of being a sensation with this trend. What started out as a promising series later turned into a nightmare, one that I had hoped was just a dream. Unfortunately, it wasn’t and the horror plagued this series in...ways that is unimaginably absurd.Samurai Flamenco is an original series produced by Manglobe. The TV network Noitamina handles this anime that follows a trend of producing unique series as done in previous years. Samurai Flamenco is unique at first sense with its pattern. The concept of a hero trying to save people despite not having superpowers should be seen as an inspiration. Now, if only that was the trend with its initial set up. The first few episodes offers promise but that doesn’t last…For starters, this series is about heroes saving people. Naturally, you’ll expect to see action in the form of battles around the world. It isn’t a new trend in the anime industry since series such as Tiger & Bunny, Zetman, and the recently Gatchaman Crowds adapted similar themes. The major difference initially is that Samurai Flamenco’s characters (superheroes) possesses no supernatural powers. Despite this, they still strive to help their city and ensure the safety of its people. Initially, Samurai Flamenco is a symbol for a classic superhero theme series. The characters are there to do the job and the story moves smoothly with a slice of life like style. Furthermore, the characters can even been seen as relatable with the way they handle tasks whether it’s be helping retrieve an umbrella or stopping a bank robbery. It’s what normal people do to help others and characters such as Masayoshi Hazama does a realistic job at it. Not only that but as his hero adventure goes deeper and deeper, he finds himself in more trouble. Luckily, he also gets unlikely help in the form of his Samurai Flamenco girls made of idols. It defies the classic ‘female crying for damsels’ trope as they let out battle cries rather than fear. Everything seems like a strong promise for this series but the show decides to kill its logic..The easiest way to describe this is the way Samurai Flamenco goes as a path that is literally unbelievable. By that, I don’t mean it just as surprise but also sets up a route of destruction to this show’s original premise. It obliterates realism in ways that is unimaginable, defiles logic that is overwhelming, and kills its set up in ways that not even a time machine will be able to take back; as if time was ever on the characters’ side in the first place. It doesn’t just challenge itself anymore with this execution but makes it seem like derailment is a natural word to present a new side of the story. Don’t get me wrong though. Stories with a huge shift such as time skip or travel can redeem and set itself back together again with everything back in normalcy. What Samurai Flamenco screwed up is more than just the story. It becomes the anti-establishment of what it has originally had so much to offer. It gets more and more ridiculous to a point where full on Sentai takes control and characters transform into Power Rangers formula with the whole get-up. (even with the damn robot)One positive characteristic about the show might be its characters. Most of them are adults so there’s no childish gags or take place in a generic school life setting. Unfortunately, most of them lacks depth in personalities and some of them come as shallow as it can be. Hazama is the typical young man with a big dream in a big city. There’s nothing new about that since young people often aims for high. It just so happens that he aims to be a superhero until he bites off more than he can chew. On the other hand is Goto, a more cynical man that lacks a sense of justice. If we put the two together, they come off as an incomparable pair. Even with the closeness between the duo, they seem so far apart. If we talk about unity however, then there are the Samurai Flamenco girls made up of Maya, Misawa, and Morita. Naturally, with a show like this, they also takes on a secret identity and trying to save the world before bedtime. Unfortunately, none of them really defines themselves in a unique way whether it’s Maya’s cop fetish or Morita’s yuri attractions towards her co-worker. Other characters also later join the ranks of the so called “Flamengers” that becomes abominable to watch. It’s not just change but rather a synergy of characters mixed in an unrealistic execution.If you were also expecting the unexpected, then action shouldn’t be one of those factors. There’s plenty of action whether you view them as a counter factor to what it initially presented. Perhaps it’s different but it is there. At the same time, Sentai vibes is reflexively presented with all the new gags. Villains comes as stereotyped as it can get with their ideologies. In particular, the big bad announces his intention to taking over the world with a grand master plan. Sound familiar? It doesn’t stop there with the cliches. Hazama goes through dramatically changes. Initially, he fails at a lot of his tasks but becomes more experienced later on. This was originally presented as a credible way for his character for development. We want to see Hazama succeed because of what he does. But as the show progresses, Hazama finds it more component to not only help others and literally annihilate the villains. He becomes hypocritical in more ways than one with his newfound powers. Again, the urge to discredit the change becomes unbearable. And the show itself takes on a more mature route with stomach-aching torture scenes and psychological despairs. Although it strives to communicate its message to the viewers, it becomes detrimental with its original premise.Artwork wise, Mangalobe handles its production and the style matches somewhat with its themes. Characters looks normal on most parts when they aren’t fighting the bad guys. But when they do put up that gear, then it’s where everything becomes surreal and generic. The outfits the characters dress up are flamboyant. But really, they look like a rip-off of power rangers and Kamen Rider. It’s not only has that but it also even come with robots, a gag that has been used for generations. Villains and monsters look like they are on steroids with their self-proclaimed ideologies. Some of them are mindless and no more presented than as action figures. On a more positive note, the female characters’ designs looks flashy and offers some credibility when they aren’t around town fighting. Overall, the artwork seems like a slow progressing tape running on an old machine.The soundtrack almost makes sense if it followed its original slice of life style. On most parts, we get to witness action packed tones because the show itself offers action. It delivers almost in consistency if it had its vision going. Most movements of the series has that Sentai rhythm so naturally, the music would have to match along with the style. The OP and ED songs matches on most terms with some touches of surrealism. Surprisingly enough, most of the characters’ voice mannerism does stand out. In particular, Hazama’s character (as Samurai Flamenco) can be seen as silly but credible when he makes his point. Reactions coming from the characters often voices their thought out that will reach to you with their delivery.Samurai Flamenco isn’t a total piece of trash to be tossed away into the garbage. However, it is a perfect example of a derailment of what it originally had to offer. You’ll be caught off guard more than ways than one.. It serves as a perfection for juxtaposition and the show writes off itself as a deconstruction of realism. Characters who we originally felt attached to become annihilated by their change while villains offer little more than stereotypes. On another note, there’s also hardly anything more unique by its later executions. Prior to what I had envisioned as a super promise becomes a soiled story. It’s unbecoming. But if you must, do give this show a try for some crazy fun. ways that is unimaginably absurd.Samurai Flamenco is an original series produced by Manglobe. The TV network Noitamina handles this anime that follows a trend of producing unique series as done in previous years. Samurai Flamenco is unique at first sense with its pattern. The concept of a hero trying to save people despite not having superpowers should be seen as an inspiration. Now, if only that was the trend with its initial set up. The first few episodes offers promise but that doesn’t last…For starters, this series is about heroes saving people. Naturally, you’ll expect to see action in the form of battles around the world. It isn’t a new trend in the anime industry since series such as Tiger & Bunny, Zetman, and the recently Gatchaman Crowds adapted similar themes. The major difference initially is that Samurai Flamenco’s characters (superheroes) possesses no supernatural powers. Despite this, they still strive to help their city and ensure the safety of its people. Initially, Samurai Flamenco is a symbol for a classic superhero theme series. The characters are there to do the job and the story moves smoothly with a slice of life like style. Furthermore, the characters can even been seen as relatable with the way they handle tasks whether it’s be helping retrieve an umbrella or stopping a bank robbery. It’s what normal people do to help others and characters such as Masayoshi Hazama does a realistic job at it. Not only that but as his hero adventure goes deeper and deeper, he finds himself in more trouble. Luckily, he also gets unlikely help in the form of his Samurai Flamenco girls made of idols. It defies the classic ‘female crying for damsels’ trope as they let out battle cries rather than fear. Everything seems like a strong promise for this series but the show decides to kill its logic..The easiest way to describe this is the way Samurai Flamenco goes as a path that is literally unbelievable. By that, I don’t mean it just as surprise but also sets up a route of destruction to this show’s original premise. It obliterates realism in ways that is unimaginable, defiles logic that is overwhelming, and kills its set up in ways that not even a time machine will be able to take back; as if time was ever on the characters’ side in the first place.

And with it has come miscommunication and ultimately disassociation. Deconstruction is to recreate cliches in meaningful and innovative ways, as opposed to be aware of one\'s own genre. The latter is usually what people mistake deconstruction for nowadays, and with Samurai Flamenco this couldn\'t be proven more rightly so.Samurai Flamenco is a failure on all fronts. It is not a parody but is aware of it\'s own genre. With it comes this misunderstanding by it\'s audience. Simply because a work is self-aware does not mean it is a...deconstruction. To be a deconstruction Samurai Flamenco would have had to do something new. Something that would innovate the many genres it was all too often burdened with.Between it\'s goal to create a serious and inspiring vigilante-filled universe and it\'s majorly flawed execution, the most mediocre result is achieved. We have neither an entertaining superhero series nor a psychological exploration of vigilantism. Was Samurai Flamenco a buddy-cop series in the light of Tiger & Bunny? Was it an action-thriller like Darker Than Black? What was it and what is it? It\'s an unique work, but unique only because of how poorly the tone of the series shifts throughout. There\'s a difference between uniqueness and quality that Samurai Flamenco can\'t seem to separate.Samurai Flamenco is illogical. It creates and sets characters for a few episodes at a time to later remove all traits from them in a jolt of narrative-based absurdity. Full of ""plot-twists"" that are not properly foreshadowed or explained and then quickly disposed of, Samurai Flamenco comes across as extremely disingenuous. The series wants you to be shocked at how many curveballs it can throw you before landing on a classical Hollywood ending every time. Yes, Samurai Flamenco, ""Hero will never give up, never hide, never be defeated"" but sometimes it just doesn\'t make sense for him not to. When the writing collapses on top of it\'s flimsy groundwork the most unremarkable deus ex machinas occur ad nauseum. The characters are used merely as avatars to deliver uninspiring tripe about justice and mankind. The level of depth found in Samurai Flamenco\'s exploration rivals that of children\'s programming.

Those who pick up what sensible watchers drop just to see how bad things can get. Those who seek out “classics” like Skelter Heaven and M.D. Geist to deepen their knowledge of bad shows. Those who came back to Galilei Donna week after week to see if it could sink any lower. For these people, Samurai Flamenco is a godsend. Samumenco isn't just bad, it's transcendentally bad. It's beyond mere words like “horrible” and “awful.” It's a special, painful kind of bad, like...if someone kidnapped your family and sent you pictures of their torture every week.Samumenco's badness comes as a result of intensive study into why shows fail. Thousands of man hours were spent dissecting specimens like Mars of Destruction to find out why they are so bad, to extract their badness essence. Along the way, Manglobe's mad scientists discovered that there was a key element missing in even the worst of the worst, something that could propel mankind into new depths of disappointment. See, there have been shows that started off good before betraying the audience. Guilty Crown disguised itself as a shounen action series before melting into a boring mess. Valvrave seemed like a classic mecha before dropping every single cliché known to man. Shows like these all have an interesting premise as the bait, and once you're hooked, they drag you lower and lower until the final episode sets you free. They leave you bitter and jaded, thinking that you'll never fall for that trick again. Then you fire up Blazblue, and the cycle starts again. Samumenco's greatest accomplishment is that they manage to compress this cycle of excitement and despair into one show, filling you with years of disappointment in only a few months. The key ingredient that made this advancement possible? Hope.With the average bad show, once it starts going downhill, that's it. It's jumped the shark, passed the point of no return, all you can do is hang on and watch things burn. But Samumenco is not the average bad show. Samumenco offers you a tiny sliver of hope, it promises that things can get better, things can be good again, you just have to believe that the bad times will pass. Then it smashes those hopes into dust and snorts them right in front of you, laughing maniacally the whole time, before giving you another grain of hope, seriously for real this time guys cross-my-heart-hope-to-die. And like a whipped dog you come crawling back time after time, praying that the pain will end, praying that you can have fun again. But you can't. You can never go back. The Kick-Ass style anime you fell in love with is dead, and you're being pummeled with its corpse. Things have gone far beyond what anyone ever thought possible, far beyond anyone's ability to control it. Samumenco deconstructs ideas, then parodies them, then becomes them, then parodies itself. Is it a realistic view of superheroes? Or a critical stab at the superhero genre? Or an homage to a simpler time? Or even a political parody? Is it all just one big joke? The answer is no, to all of those. It doesn't just jump the shark, it turns around to jump the whole aquarium.It's impossible to truly describe the feelings you'll experience from Samumenco. The ending brings no solace, only pain and bitterness, mocking you for being dumb enough to watch all 22 episodes. So heed this warning, bad anime pilgrim.

If you\'re a fan of Sentai shows, or just like great character interaction and twists, this show is for you. However, don\'t go into this show expecting something profound or deep, it simply isn\'t there. It\'s a parody series through and through, so just sit back and enjoy it.The good:The character interaction in this show is very solid, you\'ll get entire scenes of characters just talking and you won\'t feel bored, and the dialogue flows very well....Easily one of my favorite things about it.When you do get action, there\'s usually great build up to it and I found myself excited quite often as I watched the main character grow.The music feels very fitting and uplifting at times.The BAD:The ""QUALITY ANIMATION"" and I use that sarcasm harshly, prepare for some frames where the characters don\'t even look like themselves, or some very shoddy animation here and there.This show doesn\'t seem to have much of a budget, so I can give it some slack, but the character models being off frame just feels lazy at times.The genre tone shift might be too much for sum.

Just so that when the series ends people finally notice notice how deeply flawed and filled with cliches/tropes the series has been and for better or for worse the backlash begins.Notable examples:Code Geass,Sword Art Online,Attack on Titan...Samurai Flamenco fits perfectly in the last category.What started out as a realistic and modern perspective to the idea of heroes ,from the perspective of Japanese people as depicted in their TV and other anime series, ended up as a complete train-wreck.While i know this word is used extensively there is no other way to describe Samurai Flamenco better,you stand there watching it and just cant take your eyes off it,its a glorious and yet twisted sight that needs to seen to believe it can happen.To put it into perspective imagine a combination between KickAss ,Power Rangers and Se7en (without the actual killing).All competently different in tone/genre and all waiting their turn to appear making the viewer completely confused as to what he/she is watching.That\'s Samurai Flamenco in a nutshell.Character progression? Story? Proper pacing?  Ha-Ha! ,these are things that Samurai Flamenco considers unnecessary to even bother with so it just makes its own rules one episode just so that it can be completely discarded the other.Plot points appear and disappear on a constant basis.The only constant thing throughout the series is the main character ,well to be precise his one note motivation to be the hero,to fight against evil no matter what,even if he puts other people in danger (and he does this on multiple occasions).I could go on and on about how stupid the characters are ,especially Mari whose sole characteristics are that she wants to kick bad guys in the balls and that she loves police uniforms.Oh and that she kisses her band member ,who is also a female, for no apparent reason except for obvious fan service.That\'s it ,i honestly wish i was joking.Or how the villains are laughably bad in both design and (complete lack of) motivation to the point where you are wondering if: ""is all of this on purpose?"" Like is this supposed to be a parody or something ? Even though its played completely straight ,the overall tone of Samurai Flamenco is surprisingly serious ,even when it went full on Power Rangers with very few jokes spread throughout the series.Is this some sort of a parody of a parody?Its hard to say if that\'s the case or not,because it all comes down to being extremely incoherent and very inconsistent.On paper or at the very least as a small idea by the people behind this series,it might have sounded decent or even good and could have actually been good with the wright attitude, writing and such.But in practice like i said earlier its just a complete mess with ideas borrowed from all over the place pilled together into a giant pile of rubbish.It likes to constantly trow curve balls at the viewer and have the nerve to expect a genuine praiseworthy reaction.For example without giving to much away ,the final episodes (or i guess arc ) of the anime actually had me laughing out loud ,for all the wrong reasons of course,like ""oh so now all of a sudden its going this way ,after all that has happened just 1 episode ago?"" Yup and it expects the viewer to take it completely seriously as well, and even to go as far as wanting to create sympathy and emotion , but all it achieves is that if fails so hard on its own pretentious ass that it in a very weird way it almost makes up for putting the effort to sit trough this loathsome series.Almost.Do i recommend it,no absolutely not.Unless you really love the over the top nature and clumsy action scenes of Power Rangers or have a thing for bad series ,the same way many people like ""so bad its good "" movies like The Room,Troll 2,Birdemic, and enjoy to see how completely incompetent some people are while making their own ""project"" ,then just stay away from it. they properly deserved.Many series fall into this category.And lastly the series that for some reason or another get excessively praised just on the basis of the initial premise or first promising episodes and are instantly regarded as groundbreaking/original and all that jazz.

Yup and it expects the viewer to take it completely seriously as well, and even to go as far as wanting to create sympathy and emotion , but all it achieves is that if fails so hard on its own pretentious ass that it in a very weird way it almost makes up for putting the effort to sit trough this loathsome series.Almost.Do i recommend it,no absolutely not.Unless you really love the over the top nature and clumsy action scenes of Power Rangers or have a thing for bad series ,the same way many people like ""so bad its good "" movies like The Room,Troll 2,Birdemic, and enjoy to see how completely incompetent some people are while making their own ""project"" ,then just stay away from it.', '*CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*Samurai Flamenco is a hard show to pin down and give a really fair rating.Going in what my original interpretation was which was reinforced by the events of the first few episodes was that it was a show set out to answer the question of what it means to be a ""superhero"" in a world with no monsters, Evil villains, or aliens. and it does that following the protagonist as he dons the outfit of the original character ""Samurai Flamenco"" created by his grandfather as he sets out to enforce justice in the city which usually ends up with his getting beaten up....this first part of the show has a really great feel as we watch the protagonist defend justice even from the smallest of offenders such as loiterers and umbrella thieves as we learn that even the smallest crimes can have dire consequences.about a 4th of the way through however the show blatantly crosses the line and introduces real monsters, evil, villains, and aliens as it rapidly devolves into becoming the very show its been a parody of. its at this point of the show that it can become hard to watch as if you liked the beginning then this part is most likely too much and if you wanted this from the beginning then you wouldn\'t have been watching for this long.in the last few episodes the show performs another 180 and somehow returns to its roots after the ""will of the universe"" allows the protagonist to return to the ""original world"" while this plot point feels strange and continent it does accomplish the task of bringing the show back to what at least I felt was the best part. here we get some great exposition with some dark twists about the main characters specifically the best friend of the protagonist. On top of this we come to the realization that the greatest evil of all isn\'t a monster or an alien its an everyday human just like our hero.in the end this show was bi-polar at best and if it had stuck to its main premise would have been near perfection. but by crossing the line and becomming the show it is meant to parody it eventually shoots itself in the foot despite having a great ending. so the beginning and end would be rated and at least an 8 or 9 in my opinion but having to muddle through the middle drags the score for this show down unfortunately. this first part of the show has a really great feel as we watch the protagonist defend justice even from the smallest of offenders such as loiterers and umbrella thieves as we learn that even the smallest crimes can have dire consequences.about a 4th of the way through however the show blatantly crosses the line and introduces real monsters, evil, villains, and aliens as it rapidly devolves into becoming the very show its been a parody of. its at this point of the show that it can become hard to watch as if you liked the beginning then this part is most likely too much and if you wanted this from the beginning then you wouldn\'t have been watching for this long.in the last few episodes the show performs another 180 and somehow returns to its roots after the ""will of the universe"" allows the protagonist to return to the ""original world"" while this plot point feels strange and continent it does accomplish the task of bringing the show back to what at least I felt was the best part. here we get some great exposition with some dark twists about the main characters specifically the best friend of the protagonist.

The show presents itself as part love letter, part parody, and part attempted deconstruction of the Saturday morning superhero cartoon and fumbles past the finish line, but finishes none the less.The story\'s strength shines most brightly when it is paying tribute to shows like the Power Rangers and Kamen Rider with wacky monsters, team dynamics, and world shattering threats. However, this is where I found the story to drag because it was too much like the monster-of-the-week shows of my childhood, lacking any real substance and I...have since outgrown their appeal.The parody-ing of superheroes was mixed in with all elements of the story, though I thought it was most prominent in the first few episodes. I found it provided me a good chuckle, was relatively harmless, and felt natural to the tone of the story... in most scenes.The proverbial dark cloud looming over this anime is when it tries its hand at deconstruction. By the most technical definition it is not deconstruction, it goes to dark places with the theme of obsessive fandom, but in my opinion the show does not let these plot threads play to their logical end. Furthermore, the deconstruction seems to be less focused on superhero tropes, and more on fans and obsession.As a result of the whiplash tonal shift, the story feels disjointed and flows poorly. The combination of several different set pieces for Samurai Flamenco to fight doesn\'t help; adding a cluttered and rushed feeling to the disjointedness. I like that the story tried some new things, but I think it failed to execute all of them (5/10).I found both art and sound to be average and enjoyable. There was some small use of CGI which felt a little out of place, but it was not overly egregious. The fight scenes weren\'t bad either, the use of speed lines in certain places felt appropriate given the shows inspiration.Voice acting was good as far as I\'m concerned, the stand out voice actress portrayed a pop idol who can emote selfish rage at ear splitting decibels, and I though she did an admirable job of getting me to dislike her character. There are plenty of cheesy ""Stop Right There Criminal Scum"" lines delivered with the appropriate amount of love and irony which I believe was intended for this anime.All in all, there was nothing mind blowing about the audio or visual talent, but it looks and sounds competent, and in no way detracts from the overall product (7/10).Overall I rated Samurai Flamenco a 6 out of 10. I am a fan of superheroes both North American and Japanese and I thought there were moments in the story which really provided me with a comment or critique I had not considered. However, the over ambition and loss of focus in the story really damages its final result. If you are a fan of superheroes I suggest giving it a try, but if you are looking for either a fun, colourful action series or a more thought provoking story or if you don\'t like superheroes, I suggest you pass on this dance. have since outgrown their appeal.The parody-ing of superheroes was mixed in with all elements of the story, though I thought it was most prominent in the first few episodes.

It starts off very well, kind of like a more low-key version of Kick-Ass, only to throw everything they've built away in a sudden burst of insanity. There is a lot of talk about genre shift in the reviews but it's not always clear what that phrase means. It seems like a fairly innocent expression, and usually it is. But here what it means is that the show works hard to set up its themes of a superpowerless superhero trying to exist in the real world where such a...figure doesn't necessarily have the easiest time fitting in. He spends his time yelling at people for minor law violations and hunting down stolen umbrellas and generally living an ambiguous career as a vigilante. Then after seven episodes of painstaking and intriguing character development it throws it all away by having monsters suddenly appear. The appearance of superpowered villains need not have been lethal if it had been handled carefully in a way that preserved the style of the show, but that instantly vanishes as well and instead of the realistic meditation on what use superheroes are in the modern world we have the most extreme example of superheroes battling Power Rangers-level villains and unironically hitting all the cliches it had previously been questioning. This change happens instantaneously and without any setup, and suddenly a promising show has been replaced with exactly the show they had been playfully mocking only an episode ago. While fascinating to watch, this train wreck only gets worse and worse never rising above the tired cliches until the end, when it suddenly tries to switch back. Definitely one to avoid. figure doesn't necessarily have the easiest time fitting in.

Definitely one to avoid."", ""Samurai Flamenco is a Frankenstein's monster of an anime. It can neatly be chopped into 4 arcs (1-7, 8-14, 15-18, 19-22) and these arcs all feel incredibly different in tone, message, point and quality.Story:The major problem with the story is that when watching the show I really hoped they would pull a: “IT WAS AN ILLUSION/DREAM/SHOW ALL ALONG” type of stupid twist, because if they didn’t the show would be utter nonsense. The show is a writing disaster, it feels like the writers threw a lot of ideas and hoped the audience would accept them or that some of the ideas would stick. In the...end only what happens in the first and last arc matters to the plot. This leaves episodes 8-18 or half of the series as a pointless waste of time plot wise, I guess the cast develops somewhat, but compared to the first and last arcs it’s not a lot.On the positive sides there are some flashes of brilliance in the series, the show is clever at the beginning at how they poke fun at the super hero formula and how it shakes it. It’s mostly a more lighthearted Kick-Ass with a hero who fights with stationary (so it’s not illegal weaponry).The story gets a rating of 3. It goes in too many places too quickly and barely develops anything long enough, but the first 7 and the last 3 episodes are actually pretty good.Art:Not much too say, the animation is bad if you care about that, although the characters do have their tics and move somewhat interesting. Humans look OK, although nothing stands out. The monsters look silly, but charmingly silly. Backgrounds are bland as hell, Offices, back alleys, the city and dingy places are were most of the action takes place.Art gets a 4 it works and is functional. Although this is bad for the type of super hero show the show is for most of the runtime.SoundTo be honest I don’t remember any of the soundtrack of the show. The OPs were OK but the endings were too jarring, since they were cheesy J-POP maybe it was intentional but I’m not sure.Voice acting wise the cast is pretty good, no real stand outs but no one letting the show down. Characters sound like they’re supposed to and all the engrish is actually pretty funny and appropriate.Sound gets a 5 the voice acting is great and funny, but everything else is a blank for me.CharacterThe characters of the show are actually above average. Our main character Hazama Masayoshi is a super hero Otaku and is so dumb he can only work as a model because of his pretty face. He believes in justice, truth and the Japanese way. He decides to become a super hero (Samurai Flamenco) because it was his dream. Following closely is Gotou, a straight man cop who has to rein in Masayoshi and soon enough they develop a close (somewhat homoerotic) friendship. Mari is a member of a band of idols who also becomes a super hero for shits and giggles. The other characters mostly works, Samurai Flamenco’s mentor, the guy who makes weapon. Masayoshi’s manager who is trying to find out if he’s Samurai Flamenco. Moe and Mizuki, who are Mari’s friends and also become super heroes. There’s also Akira, a shady guy who runs a newspaper.With this the cast would be perfect, but the writers managed to screw up, there is only 1 good antagonist who appears in the last 4 episodes. Worse yet are the Flamengers, a group of one dimensional characters (they have a gimmick they repeat each time they appear), who steal the spotlight from Gotou and Mari for various episodes and stick around until the end (albeit with a reduced role). When they first appeared, I honestly thought they were parodies of badly written characters, so I guess they weren’t since the plot took them seriously.So characters get a 5 most of them work but the Flamengers and antagonists bring the show down immensely.EnjoymentSamurai Flamenco is enjoyable for all the wrong reasons. At first it is genuinely enjoyable, then after episode 7 it becomes a train wreck until episode 19. The last episodes are less terrible, but not as engaging as the first ones, although it is the most tight and structured plot the series has and the conclusion is as hilarious and baffling as only this show could offer.The enjoyment factor gets a 6, sometimes for the right reasons and sometimes not, you certainly won’t be bored.OverallSamurai Flamenco is a well-intentioned anime and has glimpses, but it falls flat on its face when it comes to executing the actual plot.

What I got was a whole lot of holy sh*t what the hell is happening?????This anime is one wild ride, jumping from plot twist to plot twist at the speed of a Double Flamenco Kick. Its just one surprise after another, and frankly, it just gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on. More than once I found myself in absolute hysterics due to the sheer insanity...that I was watching. There were a few parts I had to go back and watch over because I was laughing so hard I had missed what had happened.Samurai Flamenco is seriously one of the best animes I've ever seen. its fun, its ridiculous, its absolutely outrageous and its amazingly gleeful. There is a wide variety of characters, and an innumerable number of story arcs to keep you entertained.I very strongly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone! Enjoy! that I was watching.

Enjoy!"", 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (this is also a similar review I used for another site)I really loved the first 7 episodes. Honestly. Masayoshi\'s good, honest intentions with his powerlessness and desire for justice made a very enjoyable piece to watch, and it was fairly believable how he gradually became better and honestly began making a difference in his society. I loved his reckless, wacky interaction with the serious-minded and more realistic Goto, and a lot of the other characters also had interesting intentions and characterizations that meshed well to make a very cohesive plot.It was at the end of episode 7 that things became...very weird too fast. Before, the heroes were believable real-life superheroes who were really just humans with some courage and maybe a little-advanced technology (BUT nothing major as it was basic technology that is honestly quite realistic and doable in our world). With the advent of King Torture, the series goes full-out supervillains, with a monster of the week and disregards most of the realism and realistic social issues built up in previous episodes. It becomes zany, unrealistic, and to be quite frank, boring. The episodes stopped engaging me as much as the antics became more extreme and unbelievable and drew less on the real life social drama that I had loved.Thus, this series is a huge disappointment to me. I\'m not sure what the directors/writers were thinking with this. The majority of reviewers I\'ve read online agree with this sentiment: the beginning was brilliant and well executed, but the latter was crazy and went too far too fast with too little cohesion to the first 6 episodes. I looked if there were bad reviews or a reason for the sudden shift in plot, but nothing online indicates it, so I\'m honestly confused. There was so much potential and greatness, and I feel now that its been ruined by a poor plot decision.Overall, I think this show is very much worth a watch for the initial 6 and a half episodes. It tells some nice lessons about society and life, and it brings nicely to the forefront the question of what is the right thing to do and when. Those 7 episodes alone are excellent and very enjoyable. But don\'t bother with anything after the 7th unless you want to know what happens at the end. The shift in tone/genre does not keep the spirit I felt in the original IMO, and that is a tragedy.Also for scoring, for the first 7 episodes I\'d give it a solid ""7"" score overall, but the remaining episodes, I\'d give it a ""1"" or so overall, so the overall score is about a 3/4 for me. very weird too fast.

But I guess that\'s it, one has to reach episode 7 to appreciate this anime to the most of what it has to offer.Story = 8A lot of great, superb, epic anime are boring from their starting eps: Gurren Lagann\'s start is boring; Kill la Kill\'s early episodes are boring; Shingeki no Kyojin at its beginning episodes are also boring; Psycho Pass, AnoHana,the list goes on. Samurai Flamenco is of no exception. It started with a slice-of-life-esque opening, focusing on the main lead Hasama Masayoshi, who is a model, and has...aspirations to become a super sentai or heroes that goes ""henshin!"".

However, they\'re able to pace up the mood for the show.Character =  7Dynamic and complex characters are what I always admire, those who begin as flailing and sometimes hate-able, and begin to crawl their way through what the plot offered them, and they change with it for the better. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'ve watched Kamen Riders and Ultraman shows myself, so I\'m familiar with the typecast characters that henshin shows produce, but Samurai Flamenco was able to put the blend of their main characters to get you riled up--unless you\'re the kind of anime-fan who just enjoys mainstream shows like Naruto and One Piece and expect each character to be all-mighty and winning (and being Gary-stus/Mary-sues)  and all that, then you may not be able to wind what dynamic personas our heroes have. The main characters here are what I\'d say the right blend of transforming the mindset of henshin-heroes in live action, putting them in the stead of the anime realm.Enjoyment = 8You have to go through past episode 7 here to understand why I rated this as 8.Overall = 8Samurai Flamenco doesn\'t come often. Anime productions are too focused on either moe-ness, shounen, shows that needs shipping, and those of the kind of ecchi-bunch of shows that only gets the score of anime-fans because they showed boobs and too much skin. Samurai Flamenco is for the plot, story, and enjoying a take from henshin-concepts brought into anime.

I really enjoyed the series, and gave me a bit of a laugh in the process.Story: 8Samurai Flamenco really took me by storm after the 1st arc ( 4 arcs= 1-6 7-14 15-18 20-22). The story does take place in 4 different times, but each arc fits right into the next. The story was not as unique, but it is like your typical sentai show. Even though I enjoyed the show overall, the 1st arc of the story could have been much shorter,...but it does introduces some really big characters that will become important in the upcoming arcs. But for me the 2nd arc was possibly my favorite. The arc really gave Samurai Flamenco the sentai feel to it, eve though it was corny. If you look at the episodes in each arc I left out episode 19. The reason was because it was a filler episode, and didn\'t contribute to the final arc as much. Speaking of the final arc, the ending was perfect. The ending filled in some holes, and was the perfect way to end the series with more of a "" personal"" villain to it. Overall Samurai Flamenco had a good storyArt: 7The art style fits perfectly with the series. Some of the characters are definitely going to be memorable. It did have the flaw of the animation looking awkward a few times. The art style fits well with not only the series, but especially the action scenes. The look of each character was perfect, especially the sentai suits. It did have a flaw though, two characters did look familiar, but the clothes made the two different. Overall the art was great, and the look of the characters will be remembered very well.Sound: 8The OST was very memorable to me. The BGM was great, and made the action scenes look even better. I particularly didn\'t like the ED that much, considering that I didn\'t change at all during the series.Character: 7The character development was quite good, and every character was believable. The main character Masayoshi is a model, but takes an interest in following the footsteps of his heroes. Masayoshi lacks technique, but makes that up for his spirit which helps him to continue to become a hero. The other main character Gotou is an average cop, who finds Masayoshi and befriends him. Although thinking Masayoshi is crazy, he still befriends him knowing that he will need his help on the way. Overall the characters were great, and I can relate to many of themEnjoyment: 9I really enjoyed Samurai Flamenco because it brought back memories watching Power Rangers as a child. Even though it isn\'t as re-watchable it makes up for its story, and comedy. If you dropped this series just watch episode 7, and I bet you will want to continue this series. I would definitely would recommend Samurai Flamenco to people who want to watch a piece of their childhood, but with a touch of comedy to it. but it does introduces some really big characters that will become important in the upcoming arcs. But for me the 2nd arc was possibly my favorite. The arc really gave Samurai Flamenco the sentai feel to it, eve though it was corny. If you look at the episodes in each arc I left out episode 19. The reason was because it was a filler episode, and didn\'t contribute to the final arc as much. Speaking of the final arc, the ending was perfect. The ending filled in some holes, and was the perfect way to end the series with more of a "" personal"" villain to it. Overall Samurai Flamenco had a good storyArt: 7The art style fits perfectly with the series. Some of the characters are definitely going to be memorable. It did have the flaw of the animation looking awkward a few times. The art style fits well with not only the series, but especially the action scenes. The look of each character was perfect, especially the sentai suits. It did have a flaw though, two characters did look familiar, but the clothes made the two different. Overall the art was great, and the look of the characters will be remembered very well.Sound: 8The OST was very memorable to me. The BGM was great, and made the action scenes look even better. I particularly didn\'t like the ED that much, considering that I didn\'t change at all during the series.Character: 7The character development was quite good, and every character was believable. The main character Masayoshi is a model, but takes an interest in following the footsteps of his heroes. Masayoshi lacks technique, but makes that up for his spirit which helps him to continue to become a hero. The other main character Gotou is an average cop, who finds Masayoshi and befriends him. Although thinking Masayoshi is crazy, he still befriends him knowing that he will need his help on the way. Overall the characters were great, and I can relate to many of themEnjoyment: 9I really enjoyed Samurai Flamenco because it brought back memories watching Power Rangers as a child.

But I say that this is a series that has a lot of unexpected twists that slowly grow on you.I think after binge watching this Sentai....I mean Anime show, I can safely say that I thoroughly enjoyed the shit out of this show. I\'ll start by saying that the twists that this anime takes is a matter of taste. You can either hate it or really love it. For me I was on both ends of the argument but still loved the show.This show has a way of...continuously drawing the viewer in by throwing these twists after the end of each arc. After the initial 6 episodes of the series I felt like the twist was something that this series needed. The story is all over the place and has some of wackiest things that I\'ve ever seen but it somehow manages to keep me intrigued but not confused on where the overall plot or story is trying to get to. Now what I meant when I said that I was on both ends of whether the twists were a love or hate, sometimes the twists take at least an episode or two for you to actually understand what is happening and when the initial twist happens you might not want to watch the next episode and that\'s where the hate part comes in but after making through the initial twist I feel as though the story will grow on you.This leads me into talking about how well the show unfolded its story and how well this show was paced. There was never a dull moment in this show for me, ever. Almost all of the characters are likable with the exception of one character. The main character Masayoshi was one of the funniest and well developed characters alongside Gotou who had amazing chemistry with Masayoshi. The only character I felt was a little lackluster was Maya because although she played an important role in developing Masayoshi, I felt as though she was the characater that had the least character development and I was a bit disappointed with the the development that she had gotten. Other than that I enjoyed all the characters thoroughly.Overall the series like I said is a matter of taste after the first couple episodes and whether you choose to drop it or keep watching is up to you, but I highly recommend you continue because the twists are interesting, the characters are well developed, and fun. Combine these things with two highly catchy opening songs and a soundtrack that is both somber, and intense I feel as though this anime was one of the best shows I\'ve seen in a while, enough so that it has now become one of my favorite anime that I will continue to go back and watch. continuously drawing the viewer in by throwing these twists after the end of each arc.

Still, I'm glad I got to do it.It was mostly a mix, and I have to confess that it was unbearable starting episode 8 to episode 13, but past that point was less painful on the brain and the eyes. I'm giving it a 7 because in the last 5 episodes, they saved the show and somehow managed to wrap it up and excuse those infernal episodes.I guess we agree that Samurai Flamenco must be divided in three stages: 1.Before Episode...82.The craphole from ep 8 to 143.The rest which was coolThe story was fine. They ideas of heroism were conveyed very well although they should have done something with that horrible shift at the end of episode 7. Would have been all easier if we just were to see masa waking up in a mental hospital or something.Sound was good, the music was catchy. not much to develop here.Art was... Bad. I mean, the art itself and the style wasn't bad but many times, especially in the second half, you would see failures in the drawings or over simplistic art which kinda hinted that the show was rushed.Character development was good in the beginning until episode 7 minute 18, then it was crap for 6 episodes, and then it was fantastic.Overall I gave it a 7. They managed a lot without a big budget. Still, there were many fails too. I'm only giving it a 7 because of the last episodes. 82.The craphole from ep 8 to 143.The rest which was coolThe story was fine.

This show was trying to take on a realistic view of ""Superheroes"". A lot like Batman, but it wasn\'t about stopping the world from getting destroyed or anything. It was just stopping everyday crimes such as littering or stealing purses.SUDDENLY, something so fucked up happened. This was above M. Night Shyamalan level. It was so whack. It\'s like opening a Snickers bar and getting a retarded Mars bar instead.I ask why, why do you do something like this? What...went through this director\'s mind when he made episode 7? What the fuck happened in those last 5 minutes of that episode and why did it happen?I have never seen an anime take this huge of a turn in such a small amount of time.

Honestly, this show cannot be reviewed.""Fuck you"" - Samurai Flamenco Episode 7, 18:00, Omori Takahiroit\'s shit 10/10', '(TLDR Review at the bottom, as usual, thanks for reading)""Hero will never give up,never hide, never be defeated,never accept evil.""Superhero.That word, a word which millions of people across the globe have come across before. A superhero, defined as:>a benevolent fictional character with superhuman powers, such as Superman.Has taken the hearts of many, in a wide range of different interactions ranging from media consumption, merchandise, or just plain inspiration. The idea has been a thing for a very long time now, with the origins of best selling comics of such heroes dating back as far as the 1930s. The superhero, however, despite its waves...of resonance into our subconscious, is of no limits to the idea of deconstruction. Deconstruction is usually considered to be up there with kino, zenith, chef-d\'oeuvre type storytelling. So when the concept of superheroes and the idea of deconstructing such come together, I had no real idea what to expect, considering how this is also under ""Parody"". The result of such, more so, the result of Samurai Flamenco, was probably one of the most unique and well-written stories I have seen in a long while. It\'s like Goku (DBZ), as he keeps achieving higher levels of Super Saiyan and transformations, just when you think the bar is as high as it gets, he pushes it even higher. That\'s what Samurai Flamenco is in this tidy mess of an anime it has made for itself.The narrative of Samurai Flamenco is simple, it starts with a superhero-obsessed fan, Hazama Masayoshi, wanting to become the very thing he looked up to, that is the Superhero. Luckily for him, he could, taking up the role of the new hero in town ""Samurai Flamenco"". From here on out, the story is on a linear path, consistently going through the different petty crimes the Samurai Flamenco has to fix for the neighbourhood. In this time of life, he is just your friendly odd hero guy doing whatever it takes to make the small things in life just that better for people. This part of the story, however, is just a bigger connection to the ascendance that is the greater chaos waiting to erupt from this deconstruction.When you get to episode 7, you know something is not right, something has changed, and that it will never revert back to its prior state. The anime is full of rising action and climaxes that knows no end. It comes up with new ideas that should be apparent, yet combust devoid of notice as if it was already there. What this anime does is it takes popular tropes ranging from martial arts movies, dark age of comics, tokusatsu and others, and slimes them all together to make this magnificent wtf. It\'s strange, and to some extent, completely stupid. However it is a unique idea I don\'t see quite a lot in the medium. In fact, such an ambitious task is already self-aware of how dumb these things are and uses them for the purpose of enhancing the story at hand. I\'m sure many of us understood shows like Power Rangers was completely amplified in everything, I mean, it wasn\'t hard for me to decipher such at a young age, continuously pointing out irregularities in acting skills that could never have been real. The same thing applies here, when this anime seems dumb when it seems that there is no hope for what it gives, you need to remember that there was never hope to begin with. Looking for real-world logic simply does not exist here, and the reaction in being self-aware to such is simply amazing. It doesn\'t even stop there with mixing superhero pop culture, it mixed cliches like every arc out of the book, I won\'t go into it due to spoilers, but I\'m sure what you think up would be most likely true. From what I understand, everything based on the narrative/writing of the anime seems to be based on poking fun at what currently exists in the entertainment media. It makes for something quite fun, something to look at with the knowledge that you are entering a new elaborate adventure that seemingly knows how to continuously overwrite any absurdity with something you wouldn\'t have thought it would come to. Great creativity made here.The characters are in a similar situation, though they are usually under the command of the story. However, they themselves have real attributes accumulating their whole personalities to them, when one character looks baseline, they may surprise you with a new quirk or backstory you didn\'t think would apply to them. Sure, it may not be true for all, but the anime does compensate with some interesting quality for as many characters in the story as it can. Some may have more detailed backgrounds in comparison to others, others may just be an over-exaggerated idea with nothing else to their name, but entirely, the anime does a good job at pushing characters to be of some substantial quality.Going on about the main characters, Hazama comes across as basically the centre of the anime and everything that happens to it. At first, that may seem obvious, however, it is called for in a skilful way. At one point, when he is just some hentai (not the sexual kind) running around trying to help people, at the next, he is this red ranger getting all the fame and glory as you would expect him to. Sure, this would be expected in an anime of its kind, however, you could argue that it being such and not focusing on others, like Goto, for example, would indeed be a good way to show how Hazama has developed as an individual. It makes sense that he would grow as a hero, as all heroes do. In some sense, Hazama is a very fitting character. Though it should be noted, he is still the same individual that he was, with him still maintaining human personality so much so that his character isn\'t completely distorted. He\'s an interesting character to see how he moves from start to finish in the entire anime, I suppose everything just plays out and sails smoothly with the guy. Goto is an interesting one too, you don\'t see his true identity until later on. He may seem a little boring, and honestly, I can\'t go on about a lot about the dude since there is nothing to go on about that wouldn\'t otherwise lead to spoilers. Though from what I understand, he seems to be that perfect fit for Hazama, being the dude Hazama can depend on when he is in need of help, he sure gets along with others too, which makes him a more loveable character putting up with the antics of the eccentric characters in this anime. Overall, fine characters.I could go on a lot about the characters a lot more than I have already done so, but it may become unnecessary saturation that isn\'t needed to actually appreciate Samurai Flamenco. Sure, it can be a little cryptic with it hinting at future ideas non-stop through objects, and characters, but the entire foundation can be understood without relative overthought, which people can stumble into whenever something of ""thought-provoking"" anime comes to play.The thing that gets me the most with Samurai Flamenco is its low-quality animation, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt relative to when it was released, and to be fair, it had its moments of shining. However, sometimes it was clunky with its motion, borderline visually unappetising. It comes across as one of those products of its time which is why it isn\'t as bad as it seems compared to others around itself. Though given Manglobe\'s other works, I am not too sure as to what is needed to be said here, because better has existed. The audio is pretty good, I can\'t praise the voicing, because nothing of importance is to be noted there. The OST was amazing though, and it was placed right every time, I didn\'t think something this skilled could come to be but it is shown here and I\'ve heard it for myself to confirm such. It comes across as that main theme you heard yourself thinking about 10 years down the line from when you originally first heard it, it is that main theme that clicks with nostalgia, being easy to remember and catchy to get a hold of. Same with the 1st OP, not so much the 2nd. Both endings weren\'t even all that anyways and feel kind of misplaced to some extent, though, it is fitting for the Samumenco Girls and what they have going for them. Otherwise, on the whole, very good audio, animation lacked.You are one of two people with this anime. You feel betrayed, or you feel enlightened. As of this review, Samurai Flamenco has a score of 6.89 which will tell most avid watchers that something hasn\'t gone quite right. Which is both true and not. As mentioned, this anime is pretty much anything but serious, it does go over the serious stuff in a serious fashion, but the entire point revolves around the absurdity of the superhero climate. So I would imagine most who don\'t mind their expectations getting subverted into something wackier would enjoy this more than others, or if you are just a superhero fan in general, you may enjoy this a lot as well. Universally, this is pretty much on its way there with the polarisation you\'ve never seen the likes of from other than School Days, or Redo of Healer if you want a more recent example. But in the large scope of things, in what Samurai Flamenco tries to present, it is a master at such, leaving me with no reason to hate on anything the anime has going for itself. It\'s stupid, it\'s nonsensical, but most importantly, a fun superhero story deconstructing the ridiculous nature of what we have made.----------TLDR Review:Story - 10: Self-aware story about the stupidity that exists within the superhero realm of fiction, going on a path of nothing but absurdity, as the plot slowly progresses.Visuals - 6.5: Lackluster, though it is good when it needs to be, that just doesn\'t happen a lot. Kinda the style of animation you\'d expect from its time.Audio - 8: Well placed and very memorable OST, memorable OP and ED (only the 1st ones), nothing to report on seiyuus.Characters - 9: Great characters, everyone has something to their name, whether it be big or small. Good ideas embedded in characters as well rather than them being soulless representations. Unique and intriguing.Enjoyment - 9: It\'s a very polarising anime, so I wouldn\'t imagine everyone would like it as much as I do. But its ludicrous activities are one to praise in what it is trying to sell.----------So, I\'ve held this review on hold for a while. I do that a lot. But I managed to overcome these youkai flying above my head with a proper review I haven\'t made since July. Anyways, I\'d recommend this anime to most people who\'ve I\'ve noted and also those with an open mind. I\'m not entirely sure where the dislike for this anime ensues but I can only recall people not liking the switch up, but I never really understood ""I don\'t like it = bad anime - on an absolute level"". Out of the many superhero anime out there like MHA, OPM or Tiger & Bunny, this has to be the most underrated one for sure.Anyhow, I leave off with nothing more than some Flamenco review.

Out of the many superhero anime out there like MHA, OPM or Tiger & Bunny, this has to be the most underrated one for sure.Anyhow, I leave off with nothing more than some Flamenco review. Since everything is Flamenco.Overall - 8.92 (9)', ""I'm gonna go off of what the other people writing reviews have said, and agree that you have to watch the whole show to get the complete enjoyment. There are a lot of weird twists that don't make a whole lot of sense until the very end, but it really is worth it to get to the explanation. Even I had to force myself to watch some of the episodes because they made virtually no sense whatsoever, but I'm extremely glad I did.Story: 8/10It didn't take much to draw me into the story, but honestly, the pacing was terribly shaky in the beginning. It didn't...make a whole lot of sense to me what was going on half the time, but it was still enjoyable. I actually really enjoyed learning about each character and seeing Mari, Moe, and Mizuki's relationships --as well as Goto and Masayoshi's -- progress throughout the show. A lot of things seemed bizarre and completely random, but everything falls into place as the show goes on, so it's definitely worth it. The ending is what really made the story for me, though.Art: 8/10I actually really liked the art style. I was hesitant at first because of it, but it actually grew on me quite a lot. There aren't really any intricate character designs, but I think that helps humble them and make them more relatable.Sound: 7/10The voice acting in the show was spot on. It felt like everyone's voices fit them, and the soundtrack was really good as well. Sometimes it felt a little out of place, but it usually worked out pretty well. I also enjoyed the openings, and the endings were really cute.Character: 9/10I loved the characters in this show. It's true, sometimes I didn't understand the reasons for the things they did, but for the most part, they were amazing. They were extremely relatable, and about 97% of the time likable. Towards the end they start to hit home more, especially the story with Goto, and the development of him and Masayoshi skyrockets.Enjoyment: 8/10I found this anime to be undeniably peculiar and difficult to finish, yet I still loved it. It was funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and just a fun show in general. It was as random as it was depressing, which I guess gave it a good balance. While it's true I absolutely couldn't stand the Flamengers Arc, the rest of it is amazing.Overall: 9/10I'm giving this a 9 because I felt the ending truly sold it. During the period of watching the show, the lowest rating I gave it was a 5, so even I'm surprised I gave it a 9. I even debated dropping it until I saw the other reviews saying watch until the end, which I'm extremely glad I did. The ending was the satisfaction I was looking for after all the bullshit in the episodes prior. All in all, it's a good watch and I recommend it highly as long as you can stick through the rough patches. make a whole lot of sense to me what was going on half the time, but it was still enjoyable. I actually really enjoyed learning about each character and seeing Mari, Moe, and Mizuki's relationships --as well as Goto and Masayoshi's -- progress throughout the show. A lot of things seemed bizarre and completely random, but everything falls into place as the show goes on, so it's definitely worth it. The ending is what really made the story for me, though.Art: 8/10I actually really liked the art style. I was hesitant at first because of it, but it actually grew on me quite a lot. There aren't really any intricate character designs, but I think that helps humble them and make them more relatable.Sound: 7/10The voice acting in the show was spot on. It felt like everyone's voices fit them, and the soundtrack was really good as well. Sometimes it felt a little out of place, but it usually worked out pretty well. I also enjoyed the openings, and the endings were really cute.Character: 9/10I loved the characters in this show. It's true, sometimes I didn't understand the reasons for the things they did, but for the most part, they were amazing. They were extremely relatable, and about 97% of the time likable. Towards the end they start to hit home more, especially the story with Goto, and the development of him and Masayoshi skyrockets.Enjoyment: 8/10I found this anime to be undeniably peculiar and difficult to finish, yet I still loved it. It was funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and just a fun show in general. It was as random as it was depressing, which I guess gave it a good balance. While it's true I absolutely couldn't stand the Flamengers Arc, the rest of it is amazing.Overall: 9/10I'm giving this a 9 because I felt the ending truly sold it. During the period of watching the show, the lowest rating I gave it was a 5, so even I'm surprised I gave it a 9. I even debated dropping it until I saw the other reviews saying watch until the end, which I'm extremely glad I did. The ending was the satisfaction I was looking for after all the bullshit in the episodes prior. All in all, it's a good watch and I recommend it highly as long as you can stick through the rough patches."", '""Plot twists are good, so the more we put in our story, the better it is, right?"" - M. Night Shamalayan, who was apparently the director of Samurai FlamencoViewer expectations are an interesting thing to mess around with, you\'ve got your Dokuro-Chans, which mess around with them and utilise them for comedic purposes, and you\'ve got your Evangelions, which utilise them to enhance an emotionally impactful story, in what is called a deconstruction, a word I really do not like and so I hope I won\'t have to say it again. Samurai Flamenco clearly intended to do something, but it didn\'t really manage to...do so, it betrayed my expectations as a viewer, but failed to utilise them, in any manner. It\'s like a joke without a punchline. We\'ve been told that 2 men walked into a bar, or that a chicken crossed the road, and that\'s the end of it.SF starts off reasonably decent, we\'ve got some (male) model who is obsessed with superheroes to an unhealthy extent, and has created one by the name of Samurai Flamenco, costume and all, and has taken it upon himself to go about at night and stop people from all wrongdoing, starting small, and usually creating misunderstandings, one such understanding brings him to police officer Goto, who spends the next few episodes basically trying his best to keep our protagonist, whose name is Masayoshi for the record, out of trouble. If the show was funny, I\'d say that Goto plays the straight man, and Masayoshi the funny man, but I\'ll talk more about humour later on.After a video of SF embarrassing himself goes viral, he finds himself having to keep his secret identity just that, while simultaneously trying to keep a lid on the whole affair, despite others seemingly intending to do the opposite, and in most cases, I’d use the phrase “it all takes off from there”, but herein it really doesn’t, it all descends from there. From Episode 7 in particular it goes from a bit unengaging to what I can only imagine was the writer having 25 minutes of time to make 25 minutes worth of content, which resulted in some awful storytelling, not the absolute worst, but certainly bad enough that it is highly deserving of the title “shitload of fuck”. Once the evil aliens who want to enslave humanity for no reason other than that they enjoy enslavement come along, there was a definitive drop in quality in storytelling, one it never recovered from. And this is where Samurai Flamenco biggest shortcoming is – its tone. It has none. It seems to have wanted to make it about philosophical ideas about justice a little bit, a little bit a standard superhero (and later super sentai) type, but doesn’t really do either, it’s got poorly orchestrated action, uninteresting and shallow attempts to be “deep”, and to return to humour, it’s got some things that seem like they could very well be humorous, yet were not. Consider, for instance, a politician whose mecha suit’s power is directly linked to how much support he has. Or an evil alien brandishing a “Destruction of Japan Device”, or, more generally, just a story about a man with no superpowers at all, trying to be a superhero, it all seems like it could very well make for some perfectly good comedy, they just rather strangely chose not to do so.Now, on to plot twists, I’m not going to go too in depth on this, but I do believe it would be agreeable to say that the most effective plot twists are ones that the viewer does not expect, and ones that greatly alter the course of the story. Samurai Flamenco has foregone both of these, as at around the halfway point, they decided to implement a plot twist every single episode, after about 3 of them, they lost their charm, and after about 5, they were stupid, bungled, meaningless, and predictable, in other words, the complete opposite of what a plot twist is meant to achieve. Imagine if you had a surprise birthday party every year. After a few years, you know once your birthday’s arrived, you’re going to get someone trying to surprise you, but there is no surprise at all, you know it’s coming, and that’s just what SF’s plot twists were. You knew they were coming, and you know they were going to be an omnishambles, utterly reprehensible, every last one of them. So, to conclude, Samurai Flamenco’s unbelievably poor writing, coupled with the boring and uninspired and genuinely impossible not to predict plot twists forced in, resulting in some extremely boring writing, and despite all the faux philosophy they tried to put in, it is utterly irredeemable, I’ve seen better stories written in shit on the walls of a public toilet. do so, it betrayed my expectations as a viewer, but failed to utilise them, in any manner.

In the best of ways.  I sat through 10 episodes thinking I hated the anime until a healthy dose of THC alerted me to how hard I was being trolled.Honestly, I don't think I would have even made it through the series if I hadn't come here half way through and gotten some encouragement.  I needed a couple of spoilers to see the big picture.Noitanima likes to produce anime that entertains people other than just the 18-35 male audience, and they've never done me wrong.  There's something for everyone, whether you...grew up watching power rangers or sailor moon.  Just keep in mind that since they're reaching for a broader audience, there may be references you don't get because they came from anime outside of your childhood demographic.  But all in all, this is a parody, and that needs to be stressed pretty hard.  Maybe you would be better served to watch some of it while intoxicated.  But if you got involved in the anime for the first 7 episodes, don't worry too much, the story line does return to sanity eventually.Enjoy :D grew up watching power rangers or sailor moon.

Now this isn't a review for people that have not yet watched the anime because i am simply making an analyses of it and there will be spoilers but you're welcome for the ride.First off going into this anime it seems like an anime where you have to turn your brain off and just sit back and enjoy the...ride. What it is is a blend of tengen toppa gurren lagain, power rangers, and kick ass and when you here those three together how could you possibly have to use your brain when watching this anime. Well thats because just as a normal stupid giant robots anime it kinda blows.My problems with watching this anime without thinking are mostly to do with the pacing and ridiculous shifts in tone. When it comes to pacing this anime is bad... really bad like so bad that... maybe it could be intentional? now what I mean when i say bad is well first we have one enemy, our hero defeats him and instantly another pops up. Right away our hero is given new comrades and sent to instantly fight these bad guys, with a one scene break suddenly they realize the president set this up and it was all a trick. They beat him but suddenly it turns out the guy helping them set that up and that was a trick... thats kind of ridiculous and not in the good way TTGL would have beenBecause of this i started to think that there is no way this could have been an accident but still that wasn't enough the other thing that i found interesting is the ludicrous shift in tone. At first this anime is pretty calm no one dies or gets hurt nothing really bad happens. Then completely out of nowhere 2 cops die. They die bloody deaths to. Their deaths are treated with respect and care like a death should be treated. Okay and so then we continue and the monsters of the same breed that killed these cops act almost comical? When i say this i mean they literally have a monster that's buying all the fruit so that no one can have it. That's a bit of a switch. Then in the next arc the happens right after the first people do die except these deaths are treated like the deaths of people in super hero shoes the faceless side characters that just fall over and die without any real impact, completely unlike the other unimportant cops that were treated with a lot more respect.These two things got me thinking that well there's probably more to this anime then what one may see by just looking at it at the surface. The first thing i thought about was the escalation in this anime. Now bear with me this will take a while. We start of in a setting where everything is generally normal and realistic. Our hero wants too well... become a hero and so he makes a costume and tries to make people follow rules that people don't consider important. Seems fine right, well soon after  a girl from a popular idol group joins him because she wants to be a hero. She is a bit psychotic and she uses a mace thingy with a tazer. Wellll that's getting a bit weird in reality that wouldn't really be allowed but still its within the bounds of reality. Soon after he meats a mild scientist who gives him weapons that don't cause pain so would be legal. Hmmm that's once again strange but not impossible. Then we have a gorilla with a guillotine inside it... wait what that doesn't sound very realistic you're probably thinking. Well hold on this gorilla kills the two cops and its treated like how this situation would be treated in reality if a gorilla with a guillotine inside it suddenly pops up and kills people we would hold a memorial for their deaths and there would be a meeting of powers as to how to handle it. Soon more monsters come, and they keep coming however every time they seem less of how it would be in reality and more cartoon like. Then we meet with our bad guy. When he talks two idol girls I found him to say some things that make sense as if he was aware that they were superheroes and they had responsibilities just like super villains however in the next episode when he talks to the main character he seems more cartoon like telling him to join him. Then the world is saved and just as its saved its put into danger yet again. Then the show goes full power rangers however the team dynamic is more realistic but as it goes on it becomes more cartoonish until all the super heroes gather in a cartoon like setting to stop evil. Then the next bad guy to keep it short is even more cartoon like although it turns out he has good motives and then the next one is similar to a lot of anime bad guys where there imposing their way onto people thinking its right this last one may not be as cartoony but it is the most stereotypical one. And then we meet god.Phew that was a lot but as you can see if you agree with me this anime gets more and more cartoon like with every episode causing it to have weird pacing and tone shifts. Now when our main character talks with god, god says he did everything as the main character wanted it. I'll get back to this but another thing to point out is that another focus of this anime, mostly in the last arch is that of how boring this world is. Have you never though that you wanted to live like those superheroes because thats exactly what our main character thought and the way it plays it with him is the way it would probably play out in our minds. The anime goes from how it would be like in reality to how it would be like in our minds. I feel this was done on purpose in order to make us relate to the character in reality as in how it start and in our minds as in how it ends( not the last arch). Thinking about it like this made me like this anime quite a bit and honestly i think this anime is more than what it appears to be. It's like how we go into our own worlds in order to escape reality for a little while and thats what this anime does, slowly pushes away reality in order to go into it's own little world.HAH and you thought it was done. Well not just yet I do still want to say a bit about why my entire shpeal didn't include the final arch. Well that's because i feel more so that it was there in order to bring us back to reality for that wild roller coaster kind of like saying don't get too ahead of yourself with your fantasizing because when you put away your phone and look up reality is still there and you still have to deal with it.If you read this that damn I'm impressed but if you looked at the giant block of texts and thought, naw, then heres my summary basically an anime bout a love triangle of one guy and one girl trying to fuck another guy. Thanks for reading o and here are some arbitrary numbers cause I dont believe in scoring ride.

He decides to become a real life super hero and fight crime for justice and for all that is good but after his first attempt fails he is discovered by  Goto a police officer who instead of arresting him decides to let...him go and builds a very strong relationship with Masayoshi and eventually becoming best friends.Even so Masayoshi dosent give up and continues his quest to become a super hero and continues his long journey to greatness.

Samurai flamenco is meta as fuck. The show goes through three different genres throughout the entirety of the show. Starting off as a realistic if not somewhat parody based drama, then changing into a full force super hero show, and then pulling back and becoming somewhat of a psychological thriller(the final genre being the one to really make me appreciate the show). I think if I could rate the three different genre changes in the show I'd give the drama portion a 7, the super hero portion a 6, and the psychological portion an 8. If you like something that...doesn't take itself too seriously but you still want to get something out of it than I think this would be the show for you.

Every time you turn around there seems to be a new superhero adaptation hitting the big screen or television. The novelty is gone. Asking me to get excited for a new superhero film is like asking me to get excited for a video of a cat doing something cute on YouTube or a new meme. So, when a title comes along that parodies the superhero genre, I\'m interested. If you feel the way I do, watch ""One Punch Man"".Then if you still want some silly satire, watch ""Samurai Flamenco"".Coming from the respectable studio ""Manglobe"", ""Samurai Flamenco""...or ""Samumenco"" gives us a whole parody parade drawing it\'s influence from many, many famous titles and genres. From ""Kick Ass"" to ""Power Rangers"" to ""Sailor Moon"" to more grown-up titles like Christopher Nolan\'s ""The Dark Knight"", you could have a game of ""guess what that\'s referring to"" while watching this 22-episode series.While it is a parody in most ways, it does try to stand on it\'s own. The story is about a guy who wants to become a superhero like those he watched growing up on TV. So, he puts on a silly costume and goes out crime fighting. This starts a long, winding road where he makes new friends, plenty of enemies, and has one of the most bizarre adventures this side of JoJo. Watching this story unfold, I thought I was gonna be rooting for the bad guys because the campy ""justice will prevail"" stuff gets annoying quick. But, by the time I was bored with that, the story shifted gears and things got a bit serious. It was quite refreshing.The characters actually grew on me and while I\'m not going to place them in my Top 10 or anything, I will say that I did enjoy the lovable goofballs that were as colorful as the art on display. A lot of bright colors and primaries that are typical of the superhero genre with sound effects of equal ability. The music is very ordinary, with some rock opening themes and some J-Pop to close. I was hitting fast forward through the credits a lot. The Japanese voice cast did a good job (still no English dub) performing well in both the silly scenes and the more dramatic stuff. Overall, it is a well-made show from top to bottom.The finished product that is ""Samurai Flamenco"" does have it\'s merits, I laughed out loud many times and enjoyed myself, but I did also have to grind through a few of the early episodes and questioned the rapid shift in tones and plots that seemed to happen almost at a whim. To go from a bad guy who is actually intimidating to a group that looks like a band of rejects from ""One Piece"" is a bit of a let down. In the final analysis, it is hardly a failure, but it struggles at times (as many before have) mixing the action with the comedy and therefore ends up only as slightly above average spoof piece. 6/10 across the board. Check it out. Cheers! or ""Samumenco"" gives us a whole parody parade drawing it\'s influence from many, many famous titles and genres.

But, by the time I was bored with that, the story shifted gears and things got a bit serious. It was quite refreshing.The characters actually grew on me and while I\'m not going to place them in my Top 10 or anything, I will say that I did enjoy the lovable goofballs that were as colorful as the art on display. A lot of bright colors and primaries that are typical of the superhero genre with sound effects of equal ability. The music is very ordinary, with some rock opening themes and some J-Pop to close. I was hitting fast forward through the credits a lot. The Japanese voice cast did a good job (still no English dub) performing well in both the silly scenes and the more dramatic stuff. Overall, it is a well-made show from top to bottom.The finished product that is ""Samurai Flamenco"" does have it\'s merits, I laughed out loud many times and enjoyed myself, but I did also have to grind through a few of the early episodes and questioned the rapid shift in tones and plots that seemed to happen almost at a whim. To go from a bad guy who is actually intimidating to a group that looks like a band of rejects from ""One Piece"" is a bit of a let down. In the final analysis, it is hardly a failure, but it struggles at times (as many before have) mixing the action with the comedy and therefore ends up only as slightly above average spoof piece. 6/10 across the board. Check it out. Cheers!', ""So..I just finished watching Samurai Flamenco after putting it off for a couple months, after watching the first 3 or so episodes, and my feelings on it are mixed.While I was kinda expecting it to take the route it did, no spoilers of course, I feel as if it could have done it better, for sure. Certain characters fell off and felt unnecessary, or just as sidekicks, something that's even acknowledged by one of the villains.I didn't like how everything regarding the hero side of Masayoshi's life seemed so convenient. Again, no spoilers, but there's a big aspect of his career later on that...I have a very hard time finding believable, and it didn't make much sense to me.But, I was often excited to see how Masayoshi would deal with his opponents, and these methods were interesting to see. He stands for justice, and will essentially nitpick people for even the smallest offences. A neat trait, but I can see how it could get old.In the end, Samurai Flamenco was a good watch, and entertaining nonetheless. Despite its shortcomings and missed opportunities, I think it was alright. It has good art, interesting action scenes, and an okay story.

If you are a fan of the superhero genre, you should definitely watch this!SamFlam starts off pretty much as a story about a kid who grew up and never lost his desire to become a super hero. Our MC starts off small, trying to stop petty crimes by petty crooks and juvenile delinquents, and things don't go as well as he hoped. It definitely tries to stay grounded in reality despite its superhero premise.Then things go absolutely crazy as time goes on, where our superhero story becomes an insane, and insanely fun, over the top superhero adventure.Story: 9 - The...story is amazing, and just when you think you have it figured out it turns things up another notch.

But, after forcing myself to finish the series due to completionism, it would haunt me if i didn\'t.The anime started off as a slightly meta-breaker of an anime, with some One Punch Man tones despite the MC being weak as heck. Essentially what caught my interest was that it was parodying popular shounen genres and I enjoy those.I enjoyed the anime up until around the 7th or so episode, and then from that point on the anime pretty much did a backflip and dove head-straight into...a pile of crap, and turning into one of my greatest regrets in my lifetime of viewing anime.The anime suddenly goes from parodying the cliches, to actually adopting them, becoming absolutely horrible cheap knock-offs and NOT with the intention to be humorous but instead assuming it\'s doing a good job.character development went to absolute crap, the story development turned into something along the lines of, ""hey, remember that old anime that everyone loved? let\'s copy it\'s plot and major plot twists, and add in bits and pieces and pretend we\'re doing it better!!!""absolutely horrible, at the end of it you sit there in your chair or whatever wondering, ""why..?""""why did I even watch this...?""in summary: Crap.story: Pathetic.character: Disgrace to shounen genre.Enjoyment & overall: I\'m surprised I didn\'t jump off a building / 10the art and sound was decent I guess, in other words...a decent budget flushed down the toilet. a pile of crap, and turning into one of my greatest regrets in my lifetime of viewing anime.The anime suddenly goes from parodying the cliches, to actually adopting them, becoming absolutely horrible cheap knock-offs and NOT with the intention to be humorous but instead assuming it\'s doing a good job.character development went to absolute crap, the story development turned into something along the lines of, ""hey, remember that old anime that everyone loved? let\'s copy it\'s plot and major plot twists, and add in bits and pieces and pretend we\'re doing it better!!!""absolutely horrible, at the end of it you sit there in your chair or whatever wondering, ""why..?""""why did I even watch this...?""in summary: Crap.story: Pathetic.character: Disgrace to shounen genre.Enjoyment & overall: I\'m surprised I didn\'t jump off a building / 10the art and sound was decent I guess, in other words...a decent budget flushed down the toilet.', ""Samurai Flamenco is a cluster fuck of ideas that subtly asks the question of justice wanting villains even if they were fabricated. It also delves into some human psyches, experiencing the trauma.The beginning premise was very humane experience of what heroes from TV shows would be in real life. Being ostrisized and ridiculed, while few thanked and supported the gentle hearted Hazama. It was mundane and the problems that occurred wasn't any extraordinary news.But the story takes a sudden turn with real monsters and psychopathic villain appears out of thin air. Then tops that with a ridiculous bullshit that is Flamenger and the classic superhero...sentai trope of previewing monsters before their arrival.This again gets topped by senator Armstrong from MGS: reveagence propaganda, in order to defeat Alien Flamenco god. However Hazama being epitome of a hero; he refuse to continue fighting fabricated enemies to fulfil his fantasy, if it meant endangering other people around him.This yet again gets topped by sickening attacks made by Haiji, who is not a formulated villain like before. This was what superheroes should be concerned if their secret identity was revealed.At the final arc there is the revelations of many of these mentally broken characters which are then explored making interesting mini plots for each of them. Whether it was a setup or incidental, the final arc definitely the highlight of the show with ridiculous fantasy build up crashing down to grim reality.The show overall is a massive superhero plot orgy ride, you will never see same thematic more than once every 7-8 episodes, which is like watching 4 animes at once.The art direction wasn't anything outstanding, but definitely average if not better.

', 'THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL STREAM/TV RELEASE and should be viewed as such. THings such as art may improve with a home release and therefore as such keep in mind that this is a review of the original stream/tv release of the show.IF you don\'t want to read my review here are my recommendations for this show .Overall recommendation:WATCH episodes 1 to 10 . This covers the first two arcs, which are really the best. This is when teh animation suffers the least, and covers more of a ""Kick ass"" type of plot and a parody of ""Power rangers/sentai""THEN watch 19 to...22.Why you say skip 11 to 18.....Well this is when character development , animation, and really most things drop off the radar. The plot is still there, and the show is funny with it\'s parody of super heroes in general.With episode 19  a new plot picks up, and they more of less cover from time to time what happened in the past episodes. Like who they defeated. You really don\'t need much details about the previous 2 arcs because they don\'t affect the overall plot of the last arc hardly at all( aside from characters which make one liners at times). And anything that does seem to affect it they seem to reference it via flash back, or they mention it so many times that with some thinking you can guess what happened like since the plot is very complex.The last arc really picks up that pace of the first arc IMO and really hits its stride again, and if samurai flamenco had been given a 14 or 15 episode anime season and was able to skip the arcs from episode 11 to 18 , I think this show would be much betterStory: 7/10the story for flamenco is really all over the place, which is fine IMO to go above and beyond throwing galaxy\'s at each other. However, it lacks something within this story.Yes the plot seems to continue on one right after the other, and it is a very enjoyable comically  because of the characters . But the story just misses the mark overall.Without spoiling much, Flamenco story is a truly unqiue one and it gets larger and larger and large with each arc. However, the end result in the last episode completely throws this pattern away, leaving a disappointing feeling at the end. Like nothing is going to happen to these characters any more other then ""Daily life"".Also the plot isn\'t one to psychologically evaluate (aside from the last arc), so if your looking for a show with a light hearted super hero themed plot this will be up your ally.Art 5 or 6 / 10Samurai Flamencos style and art starts out great, it was fantastic and amazing at the beginning...... But starting in episode 11 it starts to have its on and off moments.For example in episode 17, the fight scenes are drawn in a normal or high quality like the beginning of samurai flamenco showed. BUT other scenes that may happen inbetween the fight barely look animated and some characters faces look so almost it hurts. (this episode in particular i remember the most of for whatever reason)Also , the 2nd opening animation begins as a montage of first half of the series and then is later changed to an almost still opening. Using pictures of the cast from the shown at there multiple identities (such as hazama yoshi as samurai flamenco). For some reason after abandoning the montage and given this as a replacement, the first few episodes of using the revised opening animation result is a badly animated opening. And strangely enough with every single episode something is usually added or changed to the opening, making it look more presentable and nice, but at the same time makes you wonder if the production team truly didn\'t have the budget or time at the moment, and could only alter it little by little.Compared to the first opening, which was fully animated like most shows really makes you consider the lack of budget to make samurai flamenco look as nice as it did in the beginning.Note, to my knoweldge, aniplex often trys to touch up the animation for the home release. So heres hoping this also applies with samurai flamenco, and that they fix all the horrible moments that look like bad animated sketches, and can remove the 8 different versions of the opening 2 animation.Sound 7/10 : Nothing amazing here, but it wasn\'t bad, Usually fit and the moment, but nothing that makes me want to go listen to the soundtrack .Characters: 6/10Overall the main probably 3 to 5 main characters get developed a good bit, but overall as the story progress\' only hazama masayoshi (Samurai flamenco) gets developed at all at times. The other characters help with situations, but really after the 11th episode it seems like character development, samurai flamenco aside, is thrown at the window for the most part just to be picked back up in the final arc.Enjoyment 10/10: The only perfect thing about this show. I love there take on super heroes and there parodies of multiple views of heroes through out the series.  Every weeks episode was like feeling like a kid , wonder what villian would face Samurai flamenco, or what crazy plot twist(which there are too many of) would happen. and as such I highly enjoy this series, even if it may not be the best one out there with all the other areas falling hard in the 2nd half of the series..... 22.Why you say skip 11 to 18.....Well this is when character development , animation, and really most things drop off the radar.

Then the last episode came out a few days ago and I wasn\'t still in the mood to watch it to be honest but I saw a spoiler of the last episode which made me want to watch it right away.The idea of the story wasn\'t really that bad.. the protagonist, Hazama Masayoshi, wanted to be a superhero (but he\'s just a normal human being) and to achieve that, he starts to solve small/petty crimes  like lecturing people who smokes in a non-smoking area, people who jaywalk, people who doesn\'t throw their garbage on the right time, catching an umbrella-thief.. small crimes like that... it was kind of ridiculous at first because I really thought he\'s exaggerating. But then when he said that ""even if the crime is really small, if no one\'s gonna stop them it will never stop"", actually I thought he has a point and that made me think the story was kind of interesting. I really thought the story was only like that. Like he\'s just a modern wannabe-superhero in a super normal city.But then the story drifted off from what I was expecting. I wouldn\'t say it was horrible but it did put me off at some point. Like... was that even necessary? It was ridiculous though I was still kind of amused.

I don't know much about hero shows, but this show essentially only requires that you've seen a couple episodes of, say, Power Rangers to understand the premise.STORY: It starts out light hearted with a boy who wants to be a real life hero. Halfway through the series, however, the show takes a hard turn towards the serious. Honestly, it was a light hearted show about a guy that desperately wanted to be a real hero and often took a beating for it. Then we find out about his family connections to this dream, the serious emotional ties. And...then, in the middle of en episode in which it seems like there's someone in an elaborate costume...people start dying. Have you ever been the only one laughing at a joke only to realize it was a relatively inappropriate response? That's how this will make you feel. But still, by that time you've been pulled into the characters and their story to give it up.CHARACTERS: I enjoyed the character development, even if I felt tricked into thinking it was a light hearted buddy comedy. People suffer from things that have happened to them. Romance isn't easy. And friendships have bumps. My only issue is that you get attached to some new characters only for them to leave for the final arc.

After reading the synopsis I thought it was going to be slice of life (which normally isn't my style), and thought maybe I'd try it out. The first few episodes were a bit awkward and somewhat childish but honest and down to earth. I could say that I fell in love with the first few...episodes until it took a turn for the worse. After that point in the show, the rest of the series felt like an utter betrayal. I question why the writers decided to take the route that they did, but now I see you really couldn't make a 22 episode show about a superhero solving petty street crime. Even so, the writers took the story so far beyond it's starting point that it leaves you completely flabbergasted and confused; it is literally the mother of all plot twists. Later on in the series, about episode 16 or so, you start to see some of the old Samumenco come into light. I found one scene to be so heartfelt I actually teared up a bit. (seriously though). Then it gets insane again the following episode. The last episodes really make you want to keep watching because once again, there were some last minute twists that I found to be enjoyable. The overall plot was bad due to its poorly executed manner, but I have to admit there were a few heartwarming lessons and scenes that made me love this anime.I really don't want to say too much more other than I was bit disappointed with the path it took, and while the story and plot were not as enjoyable, there were some elements I loved about.

While it treads a thin line, the protagonist Masayoshi is fairly likable and engaging, if a little shallow. His friend Gotou is a bit flat, but clearly intended as a foil, and the relationship between them is enjoyable to a degree. Beyond those two, there are a few humorous side characters -- but very little attention is given to making the few women in the show more than caricatures.The series takes an unfortunate turn in choosing to abandon its deconstructive approach, and instead just become a...superhero show -- and not a very good one at that. It tries to remain a little self-aware with moments of supposed clarity from a few characters: but it never really comes into its own.I very much wanted to like the show for the first few episodes, but frankly, there are better deconstructions, and there are far better superhero shows.

For all of its many, many problems and missteps, there is one undeniable fact: it's just FUN.I will always applaud audacity and go-for-broke gusto, and Samumenco has that in spades. The opening story arc was refreshing, deserving of its easy comparisons to Mark Millar's Kick-Ass.

The beginning was amazing and had amazing potential until (spoiler alert) Samurai Flamenco becomes a real hero that fights real monsters instead of how realistic it was when he was just an average citizen fighting petty crimes.

Regardless of what the premise and the first episodes make you believe the show is about, is not going to be valid for long. So if you want to get into this series with the proper mindset as means to enjoy it, it is crucial to be spoiled about a few things. So allow me to spare you the trouble and spell it out for you. Samurai Flamenco is a parody reconstruction of a superhero deconstruction, set in a laid back slice of life world, where supernatural stuff exist only if God said...so. Sounds confusing, doesn’t it? Well like it or not, that’s what it is.Set in the Noitamina timeslot, you of course need to expect the characters to feel sort of feminine, since it is aiming at middle aged women who prefer things to be easy going, regardless of how post apocalyptic the stories may be. Right off the bat, don’t expect excitement of the sort of Hollywood action flicks, nor expect manly brutes.The biggest quirk this show has is its several genre shifts. It will constantly be switching from normal, to superhero campiness, and then back to a normal world. The reason for that is because the protagonist really wanted to be a superhero, and because there were no supernatural stuff in the world, God created them for him. And that is the explanation you get in the end of the show, and I have to spoil it for you if you don’t want to drop the show because of the genre shifts. For you see, when the show began everybody thought it would be a realistic take on how heroes would look in a typical world. Of course and it is embarrassing to have a guy dressing like a clown and going around preaching to people how to behave properly as if they are still in the kindergarten, and of course most wouldn’t take him seriously and try to kick his ass. Of course and the media or the police would try to unmask and ridicule him as a troublemaker. All that felt at place in the first episodes and you were made to think that, well, it may not be exciting but at least it is trying to depict how ridiculous it looks to try bringing lame idealism in a cynical world.But when gorillas with guillotines in their bellies started appearing (aka Gorillatine), most of the audience was very confused. Many dropped it because it became ridiculous and others thought the whole thing was either special effects or the protagonist dreaming the whole thing. THERE IS NO WAY SUCH WEIRD STUFF CAN HAPPEN IN THIS SETTING. Well, turns out there can happen if God said so. Thus the ultimate deus ex machina is supposed to excuse your discomfort of having a realistic setting turning to Disneyland. As long as you can bear with it, you will like the show for the silly nonsense it is.As for me? Well, I like exciting shows and this one never was. It remains all the way as nothing more than a light comedy about a zero turning to hero casually fending off gradually more ridiculously powerful enemies that popped into existence because God said so. Also, if you are waiting to see another Sunred or One Punch, or Kickass you won’t get that either. The daily lives of our heroes are filled with lots of silly moments one would expect to find in a fluffy shojo romance and not in a dynamic coming of age teen story. And indeed, what most of the viewers were more concerned about was if some of the girls were lesbians, or who was the secret girlfriend of one of the guys. Yeah, talk about being afraid of monsters that are trashing cities if you are wondering that sort of thing.The way I see it, the show could have ended as a 1 cour mediocre parody of power rangers most would remember as a nice filler anime between better things. But nope, the show decided to head for 2 cour and the only way it for not becoming boring was to keep throwing in more and more absurd things to keep the audience guessing of what could possibly be causing all those supernatural stuff in a typical world. And it was God…Now you may be wondering why I make such a fuss about the Big Cheese. The reason is, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE if God feels like it. There is nothing to take for granted, all conflicts are rendered useless, and what is worse, the hero didn’t even know he was given a playground for his petty dreams. It’s like he unknowingly almost destroyed the world a dozen times because he was a brat, and nobody was telling him it was his fault. How childish and disgusting is this? How doesn’t that contradict the premise of a show where a superhero wants to protect the world, when he is the one endangering it, and then treat the whole thing as a joke?Of course there will be those who will try to defend the show as EVERYTHING IS FORESHADOWED and that IT MAKES SENSE in the same way they consider Clannad to be the most realistic anime there ever was. Wish fulfillment doesn’t slide with me and what I mostly care about is excitement and consistency. This show has neither. I would have given it the base score if it remained a plain anime about a normal guy pretending to be superman. But it didn’t, it turned to a farce because God said so.

There you go, have another Gorillatine. Now go stalk those lesbians.', 'A cute idea that potentially thought it was a parody and then, perhaps growing bored of that (or realizing it was failing), chucked the idea out the window and doubled down on the worst of anime and manga superhero tropes and put the two most important characters through a writing woodchipper. Not to mention that it doesn\'t seem to ever know what genre it wants to go into. This might have worked, if the writing wasn\'t completely terrible.The first several episodes seem fine for what it was trying. It\'s your generic anime/manga protagonist who wants to be a hero they\'ve always read/watched taking the first...opportunity to do so. Except there\'s no magic powers, no secret societies, no other dimensions, no vast wealth, no mad scientists inventing tech, no supervillains, no years of martial arts training across the world, or heavily condensed hard martial arts training from a master(s), no experiments gone wrong or dangerous medical procedures or supernatural mental or physical capabilities. I have no issue watching a series about any/a mix of any of these particular tropes, but this series seemed to originally be committed to something without all of those things.And that\'s fine. One of the best moments in the first several episodes is when we see a civilian who wants to collect the bounty for Samurai Flamenco\'s identity actually change his mind when SF saves him. It\'s one of the last times we see what should have been the message of the show: that ordinary people going out of their way to help others, even if they put themselves at risk, can change hearts and minds of those around them and make the world a better place. And this should have been a warning about how the show doesn\'t care about any cliche messages it puts out before it does a 180 and focuses on something else shiny.Because not even halfway through the show there is a \'mad scientist\' with powerful gadgets. There is a martial arts \'master\' to train with. Further along, shockingly, there are actual monsters to fight (not just humans) and a supervillain or several. And there are aliens. And giant monsters (not just regular size ones). And interdimensional gods? And a government conspiracy! Pretty much all of this is everything that\'s bad about the show. The one good thing and perhaps one of the show\'s only good ideas is the inventor, whose idea is to make stationary that can be used in fighting and self-defense, rather than just giving SF a gun or something. Admittedly I don\'t know Japan\'s legal system all that well, but I\'m pretty sure the concept that \'it\'s stationary so it can\'t be confiscated\' or SF wouldn\'t be held criminally liable for using it has no water whatsoever (pretty sure hitting someone with a ruler rather than a bat isn\'t going to protect you from liability as long as it causes the same damage). The idea behind the inventions is still pretty great. And that\'s it for the neat ideas here.Have you seen any amount of ""Power Rangers"" or ""Kamen Rider"" or ""Voltron"" or any other series that required a giant robot formed of five or so smaller robots run by a team? Then you have seen the last 2/3rds of this show, and any version of those other series is likely better than what\'s in this show. If this was striving for a parody, it\'s not succeeding, because all it does to \'parody\' is to reproduce the same content, but with worse writing (which is saying something, just not what I imagine the creators of this show intended). By the time it\'s incredibly obvious that the main message is ""look at this tropey thing, it\'s so corny!"" is basically every joke, it\'s long since stopped being funny.Any other message of hope or camaraderie or working together to make the world a better place or being the best you that you can be, even in the small things, is lost. This is not a good new take on any of the series that formed the base idea for this one. So it is not a parody, not enjoyable on its own merits, and not a good addition to any particular superhero genre it wants to be part of.And then there\'s what it does to its main two characters. Goto\'s background is so badly written that the actual only good part of it is how it plays into the final antagonist\'s story arc (and I don\'t even like the last antagonist). The end of the conversation the last antagonist has with Goto has one line that just felt so well written and terrifying, particularly coupled with Goto\'s reaction, and it\'s the only villain moment that felt like someone on the creative team cared about making a decent story.But it seems like at the last moment, someone thought that the protagonist was missing a few important personality traits, so the writers tossed them in at the last second to add more plot to the story. The show actually seemed to be going in an interesting, unusual (for an average similar anime/manga) direction with Goto and Masayoshi\'s relationship, but then the bad writing came in and bungled it. As is, I like to pretend the ending scene between the two characters didn\'t happen, not just because it destroys any character development for the two characters or plot development for the last several episodes, but also because it seems like a studio exec or five stepped in and said WOAH WOAH WOAH, this is TOO gay. A part of me likes think that if ""Yuri On Ice!!!"" had come out before this series, that ending scene would have been very different. Unfortunately we got what we got, which, considering Masayoshi\'s actions during the climax, isn\'t too bad.There are a few decent gags and jokes that work. Most fall flat because they\'re at once trying to be corny and also trying to make fun of the corniness, and just end up being a string of corny-ception that makes you roll your eyes or forget it ever happened. Unfortunately, whole characters, at least in the last 2/3rds of the series, are used as gags, which only makes things worse. The token Pink Ranger is the worst example, with one of the weirdest and dumbest plotlines in the story. And then there\'s one of the gags that makes me wonder if someone wanted to write a shonen but got stuck with this: Masayoshi\'s boss is constantly being sexually harassed by a reporter and every time you can tell that it\'s being written as a joke. Even worse, the guy gets sort of turned into a hero, so if you really couldn\'t tell before, it all was a joke! Ah, women threatening men that don\'t take a hint and men constantly not taking a hint, and neither of them demonstrating any particular reason why they\'d be good together... How cute and funny! -end heavy sarcasm-Notably, I have nothing to say about the magical girl trope. That\'s because nothing notable about it whatsoever. It is neither interesting enough to merit commentary, or offensive enough to merit any worthwhile critique.The animation is decent for a modern, off the line anime. It\'s no ""Garden of Words"" or a Studio Ghibli film, but it\'s not whatever the worst anime you\'ve ever seen is visually. The character models look good, with a nice art style. The music made no impression on me, and I liked none of the opening or ending songs. The overall soundtrack wasn\'t horrible (although the second opening definitely is), but heck if I remember anything significant in it.Don\'t watch this. If you do, be ready to fast forward because most of it isn\'t worth watching. Watch ""Voltron: Legendary Defender"", for some giant robot/monsters/aliens fights and good team-building stories and action scenes and animation. ""From Up On Poppy Hill"" for some cute romance, or ""Yuri On Ice!"" for some cute M/M romance. Watch ""Darker Than Black"" season 1 for a half-decent government conspiracy/superpower/cop serial. Watch ""Free!"" for relationships between men and humor and drama (among other things). Watch ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" for \'average kid with a superpower makes lots of friends along his journey\'. Those are all so much more worth the time. opportunity to do so. Except there\'s no magic powers, no secret societies, no other dimensions, no vast wealth, no mad scientists inventing tech, no supervillains, no years of martial arts training across the world, or heavily condensed hard martial arts training from a master(s), no experiments gone wrong or dangerous medical procedures or supernatural mental or physical capabilities. I have no issue watching a series about any/a mix of any of these particular tropes, but this series seemed to originally be committed to something without all of those things.And that\'s fine. One of the best moments in the first several episodes is when we see a civilian who wants to collect the bounty for Samurai Flamenco\'s identity actually change his mind when SF saves him. It\'s one of the last times we see what should have been the message of the show: that ordinary people going out of their way to help others, even if they put themselves at risk, can change hearts and minds of those around them and make the world a better place. And this should have been a warning about how the show doesn\'t care about any cliche messages it puts out before it does a 180 and focuses on something else shiny.Because not even halfway through the show there is a \'mad scientist\' with powerful gadgets. There is a martial arts \'master\' to train with. Further along, shockingly, there are actual monsters to fight (not just humans) and a supervillain or several. And there are aliens. And giant monsters (not just regular size ones). And interdimensional gods? And a government conspiracy! Pretty much all of this is everything that\'s bad about the show. The one good thing and perhaps one of the show\'s only good ideas is the inventor, whose idea is to make stationary that can be used in fighting and self-defense, rather than just giving SF a gun or something. Admittedly I don\'t know Japan\'s legal system all that well, but I\'m pretty sure the concept that \'it\'s stationary so it can\'t be confiscated\' or SF wouldn\'t be held criminally liable for using it has no water whatsoever (pretty sure hitting someone with a ruler rather than a bat isn\'t going to protect you from liability as long as it causes the same damage). The idea behind the inventions is still pretty great. And that\'s it for the neat ideas here.Have you seen any amount of ""Power Rangers"" or ""Kamen Rider"" or ""Voltron"" or any other series that required a giant robot formed of five or so smaller robots run by a team? Then you have seen the last 2/3rds of this show, and any version of those other series is likely better than what\'s in this show. If this was striving for a parody, it\'s not succeeding, because all it does to \'parody\' is to reproduce the same content, but with worse writing (which is saying something, just not what I imagine the creators of this show intended). By the time it\'s incredibly obvious that the main message is ""look at this tropey thing, it\'s so corny!"" is basically every joke, it\'s long since stopped being funny.Any other message of hope or camaraderie or working together to make the world a better place or being the best you that you can be, even in the small things, is lost. This is not a good new take on any of the series that formed the base idea for this one. So it is not a parody, not enjoyable on its own merits, and not a good addition to any particular superhero genre it wants to be part of.And then there\'s what it does to its main two characters. Goto\'s background is so badly written that the actual only good part of it is how it plays into the final antagonist\'s story arc (and I don\'t even like the last antagonist). The end of the conversation the last antagonist has with Goto has one line that just felt so well written and terrifying, particularly coupled with Goto\'s reaction, and it\'s the only villain moment that felt like someone on the creative team cared about making a decent story.But it seems like at the last moment, someone thought that the protagonist was missing a few important personality traits, so the writers tossed them in at the last second to add more plot to the story. The show actually seemed to be going in an interesting, unusual (for an average similar anime/manga) direction with Goto and Masayoshi\'s relationship, but then the bad writing came in and bungled it. As is, I like to pretend the ending scene between the two characters didn\'t happen, not just because it destroys any character development for the two characters or plot development for the last several episodes, but also because it seems like a studio exec or five stepped in and said WOAH WOAH WOAH, this is TOO gay. A part of me likes think that if ""Yuri On Ice!!!"" had come out before this series, that ending scene would have been very different. Unfortunately we got what we got, which, considering Masayoshi\'s actions during the climax, isn\'t too bad.There are a few decent gags and jokes that work. Most fall flat because they\'re at once trying to be corny and also trying to make fun of the corniness, and just end up being a string of corny-ception that makes you roll your eyes or forget it ever happened. Unfortunately, whole characters, at least in the last 2/3rds of the series, are used as gags, which only makes things worse. The token Pink Ranger is the worst example, with one of the weirdest and dumbest plotlines in the story. And then there\'s one of the gags that makes me wonder if someone wanted to write a shonen but got stuck with this: Masayoshi\'s boss is constantly being sexually harassed by a reporter and every time you can tell that it\'s being written as a joke. Even worse, the guy gets sort of turned into a hero, so if you really couldn\'t tell before, it all was a joke! Ah, women threatening men that don\'t take a hint and men constantly not taking a hint, and neither of them demonstrating any particular reason why they\'d be good together... How cute and funny! -end heavy sarcasm-Notably, I have nothing to say about the magical girl trope. That\'s because nothing notable about it whatsoever. It is neither interesting enough to merit commentary, or offensive enough to merit any worthwhile critique.The animation is decent for a modern, off the line anime. It\'s no ""Garden of Words"" or a Studio Ghibli film, but it\'s not whatever the worst anime you\'ve ever seen is visually. The character models look good, with a nice art style. The music made no impression on me, and I liked none of the opening or ending songs. The overall soundtrack wasn\'t horrible (although the second opening definitely is), but heck if I remember anything significant in it.Don\'t watch this. If you do, be ready to fast forward because most of it isn\'t worth watching. Watch ""Voltron: Legendary Defender"", for some giant robot/monsters/aliens fights and good team-building stories and action scenes and animation. ""From Up On Poppy Hill"" for some cute romance, or ""Yuri On Ice!"" for some cute M/M romance. Watch ""Darker Than Black"" season 1 for a half-decent government conspiracy/superpower/cop serial. Watch ""Free!"" for relationships between men and humor and drama (among other things). Watch ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" for \'average kid with a superpower makes lots of friends along his journey\'. Those are all so much more worth the time.', 'Samurai Flamenco displays an uncommonly blatant disdain for narrative conventions and so little coherence that after the last episode I was left thinking, “That was baffling, even for anime.”  I don’t consider my time wasted – in fact, I enjoyed myself for all 22 episodes – though on closer inspection it must be admitted that this show really doesn’t look out for itself.Blessed with a solid cast and a superb soundtrack that includes blood-pumping hero fight music, adorable idol pop, and a suspiciously Pink Panther-esque sleuthing song, Samurai Flamenco racks up some style points right off the bat.  The character designs have a...wide range of quality; some, like Joji Kaname, are memorable and perfectly appropriate for the personalities that reside therein.  Others, like the Flamengers, seem very ordinary, and I’m not sure if that’s the point or what.  By and large, however, I have no complaints from an audio-visual standpoint; the key issues with Samurai Flamenco lie in the writing.The show’s first arc, equal parts insightful superhero origin and compelling underdog tale, lasts for six-and-a-half episodes, and that is about the longest stretch of time this show spends in any one dimension of reality.  At that point, Samurai Flamenco experiences an abrupt shift in tone and direction, only to undertake a hasty regression to the mean over the next few episodes while getting continuously more surreal.  Arcs that could have easily filled a season vanish within a couple of episodes, with the breadth and scope of the overall story changing in the blink of an eye.  Soon, its powers fully unleashed, the show becomes a runaway train of retcons and wild twists, cycling through characters and concepts faster than Mumen Rider.  The nature of the world we’re meant to experience seems to change with such wanton speed and elasticity that the show feels like it was written not episode-to-episode, but minute-to-minute.Samurai Flamenco must have developed ADHD halfway through, because suddenly it is no longer content to tell one story or let things lie as they fall.  Characters phase in and out, sometimes emerging at the other end of the series with very different personalities and no straight line from point A to point B.  At the conclusion of each mini-arc, I can practically hear a voice in the background saying, “That was fun, but how can we make that not matter anymore?”  There are satisfactory emotional payoffs, decent moral lessons, and the beginnings of some engaging tangents about heroism, society, and justice, but for the most part, the show staggers back and forth like a drunk, varying in atmosphere, genre, and plane of existence far too much to be considered a paragon of excellence in writing.What began as the story of a naïve, powerless teenager with dreams of becoming a hero winds up as a reality-spanning clusterfriend of aliens, deities, conspiracies, mech battles, power suits, and sociopathic ghosts.  I can no longer say with certainty what Samurai Flamenco is about.  Is it about the character of Masayoshi Hazama, the titular Samurai Flamenco?  Is it about the concept of being a hero or a superhero?  Is it a revelation about love or friendship or sacrifice?  Is it an examination of world peace, doing good in society, the nature of good and evil, the government?  Is it a parody of Super Sentai- and Kamen Rider-type shows?  Perhaps a tribute to them?  Is it some weird, obsessive thing about the word “flamenco”?  Whom are we supposed to be learning about and what are we learning about them?  By the show’s finale, things have gotten so far off-base that it’s hard to say there is any truly satisfying closure, either because it was already snapped up earlier in the show or because there just doesn’t seem to be anything in need of closure.  Maybe because there was supposed to be closure, and then there just wasn’t.  I can’t tell anymore.Is Samurai Flamenco…  “good”?  Oh, hell no.  Well, maybe.  No, no, it probably isn’t, at least from a storytelling perspective.  It probably deserves a 5, a 6 at best; I’m just feeling generous because of how much I liked it.  Nonetheless, I’ll look back on it fondly: an ugly duckling, perhaps, but still a good egg, and something I’m likely to recommend to others.  Hazama is an idiot and so are all of his friends, but they’re lovable, goofy idiots who are fun to watch and very easy to believe in and support. wide range of quality; some, like Joji Kaname, are memorable and perfectly appropriate for the personalities that reside therein.

If you\'ve never seen an episode of Kamen Rider, this show is not only not for you, but it\'s a little frustrated that you\'re even watching it at all. I had the misfortune of being that unwanted viewer.Samurai Flamenco is a pastiche show, though a poorly communicated one. This is not a spoiler. You will enjoy the series SIGNIFICANTLY less if you don\'t know this. I feel like the show wanted you to pick up on it the moment the genre switches for the first time,...but because the writing is clunky and poorly communicated, it just feels like a plot twist. It is not a plot twist. There are no real ""plot twists"" in the traditional sense in this show at all until the real-world aspect comes back. If you think it\'s building up to a plot twist? It isn\'t! It really isn\'t. The answer to why all the nonsense in this anime is happening is ""hey, super sentai shows, am I RIGHT fellas"", and if you don\'t go in with this in mind, this show is going to rate a 4 and you will feel robbed of something.So, a review:The anime cycles through various different genres: The vigilante, the sentai hero, the sentai team, and, three more genres, before concluding on a regular action/drama arc that actually carries itself REALLY well, with none of the pacing issues that plagued the previous mini-arcs. Does it mean anything? I don\'t know! The rest of the series is so wildly disorganized and I know so little about the genre that I can\'t pin down any sense of quality or intention. This show is REALLY weird!Despite the garbled, senseless storytelling, the characters are strong, distinctive, and behave naturally enough, and I was rewarded for sticking it out for them with the last few episodes. Even as the plot fades into obscurity, the characters are still clear in my mind, and I find myself attached to them despite having zero interest in the show. The ending made me cry and I still feel happy and fond about them even now, years later.Hm, what else...There\'s gay themes, but mostly as hands-off, ""if you don\'t want them to be gay it can just be a fun jokey-joke! No in-text reciprocating because that would mean something concrete! They\'re not gay they\'re just dudes being dudes! Lesbian whomst???"" coward\'s way of doing it. If someone recs you this show based on the presence of gay/bi characters, they\'re begging for scraps and you shouldn\'t trust their judgement, but it\'s still present and has real dramatic weight in a ""gay love saves the day"" sort of sense, so you can enjoy it for what it is. I guess.Overall, while I think the show wouldn\'t have been as interesting if it went from ""Vigilante"" straight to ""real-world action-drama"", I really wish the show had gone with 3 genres instead of trying to awkwardly speedrun through 7. It just didn\'t have enough episodes to do what it was going for. One of these genre arcs lasts an episode and a half. It was exhausting. 7/10 for lopsided viewing experience, saved from true mediocrity with the strength of the character writing. but because the writing is clunky and poorly communicated, it just feels like a plot twist.

Personally I thought it started out really cute with the idea of him becoming a hero in his own way, even if he does\'nt have super powers... and then a few episodes later aliens show up. It took me...a little while to adjust to the aliens because I was all geared up for some Slice of Life/Action hybrid that would\'ve been unique.  However, after the aliens show up and I got all used to aliens, then like twelve new characters are introduced and they go into space (or at the very least into a spaceship, again I paused watching here). This was my limit on ridiculous plot-switching. At that point I was kind of thinking ""just pick something and stick with it wouldja?!""""HOWEVER, episode 19 - 22 were so captivating and I highly suggest that if you are like me and can\'t take the space wars stuff, just skip to 18 and you miss no information that is pertinent to the remaining episodes. Trust me. The element of real crime pulled me back to the first few episodes where a regular guy is playing super hero, which is what drew me in in the first place.Art 6/10Pretty standard in my opinion. Better than a lot of cheap looking anime and better than a lot of the new stuff out. If anything it just looks natural, not too stylistic, not too cheap which I\'m just fine with. The animation was pretty fluid and detailed which I also appreciated but I wouldn\'t say that its something the anime should be known for.Sound 5/10The opening was okay and aside from that the sound was normal. Not a stunning soundtrack or memorable voice actors in my opinion but sound is pretty hard for me to grade because I\'m not always readily looking for it.Character 7/10Definitely well designed but also definitely had some flaws. The police officer had a lot of flaws actually. In a way he wasted his own redemption arc that the protagonist literally risked his life for and the ending kind of brushed it off like ""yep he completely ignored that important life lesson"". It\'s hard to grade the protagonist because of the gap of episodes I didn\'t watch. I thought he was cute though, very eccentric and funny. The other characters I remember being kind of one dimensional in the sense that yeah they were fine but there wasn\'t a lot to them.Enjoyment 7/10I\'m thinking of rewatching it again just to see if my enjoyment of it changes it at. Sometimes with series like this you\'ll find its better the second time through when you can get a fresh look at it. At the moment, my opinion is that it was fine. I didn\'t want to gouge my eyes out and I wouldn\'t put it in a frame.Overall 6/10What can I say that hasn\'t already been said. Its a swing or a miss but I definitely think its worth trying out, even if its just one or two episodes a little while to adjust to the aliens because I was all geared up for some Slice of Life/Action hybrid that would\'ve been unique.

To some, being called such may be taken as an insult. However my intention with saying that phrase is always a compliment. And there is no show more deserving of the title, “Most unassuming anime of all time” than Samurai Flamenco. I heard someone mention this series in passing on a message board as one of their all time favorites. This interested me because this was a series I’d never heard of before. And upon downloading and watching the first episode or so, I thought the characters and their...interactions were swell enough and I’d thoroughly enjoyed my viewing. But I’d figured I had the series figured out, “Oh, so this is a Japanese spin on the Kick-Ass story”. And for anyone who's reading this and has already seen the show, you’ll know how much of an insult that is to this show and also how embarrassed I feel for having honestly thought that at some point. But why does having such an innocent misconception about a show with a name like “Samurai Flamenco” bring me so much shame? Is the show truly that groundbreaking?Yeah, it truly is. You see, pinning this show into one genre or category isn’t impossible per se, but it’d be doing the show a disservice. The story is many things, but not all at once. The rate at which the plot unfolds is very gradual. Each development or sudden change the plot has makes sense (usually) in the moment, but by the time you reach episode 10, you’ll look back at episode 1 in retrospect and have a double take. I had one during my initial viewing and wondered if I was even watching the same show anymore. That said, the show doesn’t change its visuals or artstyle drastically in any way aside from amping up the brightness and color variety when it touches on super sentai or traveling across the universe.Yes you read that right, super sentai and traveling across the universe. The show makes mashing up genres together as such seem like child’s play. Despite these dramatic shifts in genre, it still retains its art style throughout, minus the occasional color palette change. And that’s one of the main reasons I consider this to be the most unassuming anime of all time. Its admittedly bland visuals, at least initially. That’s not to say that they’re particularly ugly or unpleasant on the eyes, but it does look rather plain at first. The animation isn’t particularly flashy either, and the designs of the male protagonists seem like they’d fit in better in a BL series than a series revolving around protecting the universe with a naive sense of justice(at times) like super sentai. I say “at times” because the show isn’t a parody or a love letter to super sentai, like Kaijin Kaihatsu. Nor is it about fighting crime and defeating the bad guy. The show’s intention is much more layered than one might think coming into this. Throughout the show we learn that superheroes aren’t always what we thought, whether that be reality or fiction. What it takes to be a real “superhero” goes beyond being a prude about what time you leave the garbage outside, or protecting the world from aliens.Despite the show’s tendency to feel larger than life, it still feels coherent and grounded in reality. It helps that one of the MC’s (named hidenori) is a cop looking out for Masayoshi(samurai flamenco) throughout and serves as an anchor keeping the story grounded and as a proxy for the viewer. With those characters in mind, how about I touch on the story briefly? We follow Masayoshi, a young model whose actual dream is to be fighting crime as his alter-ego, samurai flamenco. After getting dusted by trying to apprehend a businessman jaywalking, Hidenori finds Masayoshi naked in an alley after the aforementioned scrap. After learning about Masayoshi’s situation the two become friends and from then on Masayoshi’s descent into dishing out justice had only begun.Beyond the show’s odd tale and unpredictability, I found the relationship between Hidenori and Masayoshi to be very captivating and moving. Though I’m not a fujo, I must admit to shipping the two given their tight bond and given the peculiar circumstances they find themselves in. Masayoshi is such a pure soul and quite literally, a cinnamon-roll. From fighting monsters the size of planets to stopping Hidenori from capturing the person who stole his umbrella from crossing the street because the light turned red, his sense of justice is very innocent, if not also overbearing. He’s also incredibly awkward. I feel on edge for just about every scene that Masayoshi’s in that doesn’t have Hidenori in it as well. At least for the first quarter of the series. Because I’m always bracing myself for a second hand cringe moment from Masayoshi spilling his spaghetti by saying something incredibly awkward. But that just adds to his charm and allure to me as a character. It’s because of his naivety, genkiness, and innocence that Hidenori has to act as his wrangler to make sure he doesn’t get himself into too much trouble. Speaking of Hidenori and Masayoshi, their banter is so amusing to watch. Though their friendship is sudden and hits the ground running almost as soon as they meet, one could assume they were lifelong friends given their tight-knit and brotherly relationship.It was also the dialogue exchanged between these two that gave me quite the hoot. Given the random and absurdist nature of the show, you’d think the show would be filled with low brow humor with a hundred jokes a minute. But I was pleasantly surprised that the show's humor is much more high brow. With gags being somewhat vague and requiring more thought processing to get. Making the punchline even funnier. I don’t mean to make this show sound pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, or that it gets high off its own fumes. But I can appreciate a series that’s not primarily, yet it still puts more effort into its sense of humor than one would assume. That’s not to say that there aren’t silly random low-brow humor jokes either, cause they’re also in abundance, but those are also handled with more thought. Guillotine gorilla’s introduction springs to mind.The jokes themselves also play a huge part in progressing the events of the story. The way the show unveils what would be one off jokes into something much more profound or important later on in the story isn’t something to scoff at. In fact, I’d say Samurai Flamenco excels in its foreshadowing, and that a second viewing, while not required, would make you better appreciate the scope of the story with how much thought clearly went into it. With its name and infamy, one might perceive it as a hodgepodge of absurdism. But don’t put all your eggs into that basket, because this show will grab the basket and chuck it across the galaxy and much like the viewers, this will either compel you to continue indulging in the series or dropping it altogether. Because where this show shines is in its ability to subvert the audience’s expectations when they’d least expect it.To me, Samurai Flamenco is, “The most unassuming anime of all time”. But what is it about the show that makes it so groundbreaking and unassuming? Take any random shot from any episode and show it to someone who’s never seen or heard of the show. Chances are, they won’t find it particularly interesting on its visuals alone. That’s because to appreciate what this show accomplishes so well, you have to watch it, and I mean the entire way through. No other show has exceeded and subverted my expectations as much as SamFlam, and being a surprise isn’t all it has going for it. Every genre and type of show the series touches on, it knocks out of the park. It’s never the same type of series for long and always keeps you on your feet. Once you think you have a feel for the show it will surprise you and with a complete 180. But it’s not random for the sake of being random, it goes from genre to genre seamlessly. Where it’s only crazy in the direction the anime goes in hindsight, (and episode 7 on your first viewing). Every episode becomes progressively more and more fantastical, dreamlike, and larger than life yet somehow manages to keep at least one finger touching the ground of reality. The way the events unfold and the story progresses is done smoothly. And lastly, it excels at having plot threads littered throughout the series that lead from the first episode all the way to the final. The way in which the smallest instances are accounted for, must be commemorated. All in all, Samurai Flamenco is an out of this world experience that many didn’t give the light of day until after it had finished airing. And though that is a shame, the past is in the past and all those who have yet to see it can watch it and learn what it truly takes to be a superhero. interactions were swell enough and I’d thoroughly enjoyed my viewing. But I’d figured I had the series figured out, “Oh, so this is a Japanese spin on the Kick-Ass story”. And for anyone who's reading this and has already seen the show, you’ll know how much of an insult that is to this show and also how embarrassed I feel for having honestly thought that at some point. But why does having such an innocent misconception about a show with a name like “Samurai Flamenco” bring me so much shame? Is the show truly that groundbreaking?Yeah, it truly is. You see, pinning this show into one genre or category isn’t impossible per se, but it’d be doing the show a disservice. The story is many things, but not all at once. The rate at which the plot unfolds is very gradual. Each development or sudden change the plot has makes sense (usually) in the moment, but by the time you reach episode 10, you’ll look back at episode 1 in retrospect and have a double take. I had one during my initial viewing and wondered if I was even watching the same show anymore. That said, the show doesn’t change its visuals or artstyle drastically in any way aside from amping up the brightness and color variety when it touches on super sentai or traveling across the universe.Yes you read that right, super sentai and traveling across the universe. The show makes mashing up genres together as such seem like child’s play. Despite these dramatic shifts in genre, it still retains its art style throughout, minus the occasional color palette change. And that’s one of the main reasons I consider this to be the most unassuming anime of all time. Its admittedly bland visuals, at least initially. That’s not to say that they’re particularly ugly or unpleasant on the eyes, but it does look rather plain at first. The animation isn’t particularly flashy either, and the designs of the male protagonists seem like they’d fit in better in a BL series than a series revolving around protecting the universe with a naive sense of justice(at times) like super sentai. I say “at times” because the show isn’t a parody or a love letter to super sentai, like Kaijin Kaihatsu. Nor is it about fighting crime and defeating the bad guy. The show’s intention is much more layered than one might think coming into this. Throughout the show we learn that superheroes aren’t always what we thought, whether that be reality or fiction. What it takes to be a real “superhero” goes beyond being a prude about what time you leave the garbage outside, or protecting the world from aliens.Despite the show’s tendency to feel larger than life, it still feels coherent and grounded in reality. It helps that one of the MC’s (named hidenori) is a cop looking out for Masayoshi(samurai flamenco) throughout and serves as an anchor keeping the story grounded and as a proxy for the viewer. With those characters in mind, how about I touch on the story briefly? We follow Masayoshi, a young model whose actual dream is to be fighting crime as his alter-ego, samurai flamenco. After getting dusted by trying to apprehend a businessman jaywalking, Hidenori finds Masayoshi naked in an alley after the aforementioned scrap. After learning about Masayoshi’s situation the two become friends and from then on Masayoshi’s descent into dishing out justice had only begun.Beyond the show’s odd tale and unpredictability, I found the relationship between Hidenori and Masayoshi to be very captivating and moving. Though I’m not a fujo, I must admit to shipping the two given their tight bond and given the peculiar circumstances they find themselves in. Masayoshi is such a pure soul and quite literally, a cinnamon-roll. From fighting monsters the size of planets to stopping Hidenori from capturing the person who stole his umbrella from crossing the street because the light turned red, his sense of justice is very innocent, if not also overbearing.

It's only useful if you've watched the first part of Alicization when it first aired and need a refresher before the second season begins.If you haven't watched the first part then this is no replacement, you need to watch the first part to know what's going on. If you've just finished watching the first part and it's still fresh then you don't need to bother with this, it's just a recap and is not intended to further the plot. Just skip it and move on to War of Underworld. "", ""Retelling 24 episodes in a timeframe shorter than episode 1. If that sounds like an impossible feat, you're absolutely right. There's nothing new, enhanced, or special about this recap and it doesn't substitute for watching this first 2 cours. I can't help but wonder why reviewers are putting up scores of 8, 9, or even 10s on a recap episode.[5] Story - they cut 2 cours into a 24 minute episode, it's not going to substitute for watching the anime, it's not that entertaining imo as to rewatching the entire first 2 cours, and it doesn't add anything new.[6] Art - no major improvements here,...which may be upsetting. I would have liked to see some revisions of blu ray quality or even redrawn scenes for a recap airing on SAO's 10th anniversary year, but alas nothing new.[9] Sound - Alicization has good ost's. They're not going to make a new soundtrack just for a recap so same as Alicization.[9] Character - Same old characters, nothing new, just scenes cut into a 24 min recap.[6] Enjoyment - Not sure what you're expecting from a recap that's shorter than the first episode. You really can't get much excitement out of a recap that doesn't do something incredibly unique or creative.This recap episode may be for you, if you enjoyed the first 2 cours of Alicization and don't rewatch anime. Perhaps if SAO isn't the only media you consume and you don't memorize the sequence of events and key story elements, this can be helpful in enhancing your War of Underworld Experience.

Nonetheless I enjoyed it. The animation never ceases to amaze me as they upped the animation style for SAO for Ordinal Scale and Alicization. The voice acting was on par and you could feel the emotions with the words they spoke. Therefore I give this a overall 9/10 because I enjoyed all the Sword Art Online Seasons and Episodes / Movies thus far. I know I will continue to enjoy them as time goes on. The new season is upon us and I can't wait to...watch it as I hope some of you do. watch it as I hope some of you do."", ""SAO has been blasphemed for years by netizens. Yet my friends a pure watcher regardless of what's the SNS said, he still enjoy and recommend it to me. Their fans suggest to at least try the Alicization arc because it's a fresh start with a better writing & not much related with prev arc. I guess, I should give it a try.(this is general review of SAO Alicization & War of Underworld, because they all a one package story)So the story is about MC brain damaged by accident (how come a 1 meter umbrella lose by a 1 cm injector? & he called himself the...Sword Hero?). To cure it he must dive in a VR game console that can recover his brain in-trade of carrying a mission to stimulate AI there to break a rule by their own, to make a self-aware AI not a robot. Alice the AI did it but then arrested by the God in-game. MC & friends try to save her & success even with a lot drama mid-way. In real-life side, the game facility attacked by terrorist who want to use that AI for war. Half building locked to protect MC progress but enemy can also dive in game and start a big war. Yet MC still win & send Alice to real life but leaving himself there for 200 years worth time because enemy hack the speed setting. Finally in real life Alice got physical body, MC wake up from slump & become normal again (what's the point of that 200y I mention?). The end, happy ending. Oh wait, somehow to make the story continue, they dive to that game again after few decade worth of time there.A simple general story with many small forced twist trying to make it complex but failed. By that setting, MC supposed to be a 3rd party observing AI growth but no. Writer really love him and all problems solved by MC, all characters love him. Okay, this harem bait is good for shounen viewers (my youth maybe like it too), but this leads to a problem at final part War Underworld. While the good side is at pinch in the war, all women calling the MC in coma (it's so cringy...), zannen it's not working but after just one small push by his friends Eugeo, he woke up with many OP skill out of nowhere and save the day. Again, after things going normal in real life he cried while remembering his friend Eugeo (so gay...). Eugeo supposed to have a big key at final & gave a stronger touching moments but the viewers don't care much about him because he is just additional cast a by-passer at first arc. This general plot hole can be solved if writer gave more role to Eugeo at first arc, if he really intent to make him the wake up call key to MC at final.One thing hard to be denied by haters is the visual. It's awesome at normal scene thanks to studio A1 Pict. The fighting animation is fine for me, but as time goes I'm getting annoyed by how short a battle can be. Feels like everything is one hit die, one hit win, one hit lose. Even the snippet at the opening song is more entertaining than the actual scene. Also the SFX feels similar between each clash (well at least not as bad as studio JC Staff).Summary, the story is generic but the visual still enjoyable so I recommend to skip 25eps Alicization by just watching the recap (it's good enough for a recap ep), then go straight to all War Underworld episodes with top notch visual experience you can get, the battle scene is longer & better too, it's so amusing. Well, if you like catching a harem bait then I won't stop you for going to Alicization eps. Sword Hero?).

No, Alicization was a blast.For a season that has given us a full-blown, well put together recap around episode 18, it seems that chronologically at least; 5 to 6 episodes later it will present yet another recap. A bit overkill, but watching it on the release date makes more sense.In terms of a recap, 18.5 was definitely more well-motivated and properly placed on a narrative note, while this one is more of a hype-up moment for War of Underworld.The recap is split into two parts, the first one focuses on Asuna and her outside perspective on the whole dilemma, while the second...part is more about what was happening in the final battle hasn't Quinella. I really liked he first part, maybe because 18.5 (which is still fresh on my mind) already expanded on whatever happened in the underworld, so the whole scientific side of the season felt more appealing, it was great to rewatch how the series makes sense of Fluctlights and its applications.The recap swiftly ends on the same cliffhanger note from before, really setting up the stage go a great spectacle. part is more about what was happening in the final battle hasn't Quinella.

Wakaba*Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30355/WakabaGirl,"[""So with most of the summer anime is closing their curtains, Wakaba Girls is also one of them. Being a 13 episode and 7 mins long, i would say, it was a fun ride with Wakaba and the girls through out the series.The story tell us about Wakaba who is a rich girl trying to learn the common things that are done by commoners, she wanted to be a 'gyaru' which her friends help her, it was cute to see them doing girl things like eating ice cream, hanging out and more which Wakaba really takes it to the next level. The cultural festival scene...was also fun, enjoying to see Wakaba crowned as the winner and yeah. Overall, it's a fair amount that i enjoy looking at the story as there is nothing much on the plotline except trying to become gyaru but glad that the story is not too complex to understand, as this is basically slice of life.From my perspective, i already know that this author is the same person who write Kiniro Mosaic, since the character designs are obvious. Background image are not too saturated, and animations are not that bad either, great job Nexus studio! Would love to see more of your works.Well, this is the second anime where i don't hear any ED song aside from Wakako, just only the OP, the OP is really catchy , i enjoy hearing it. Aside from that, most of the seiyuus are the seiyuu i've known like Ozawa Ari and Rie Murakawa whom they voice acted Wakaba and Nao. Great voicing! While Ichimichi Mao voiced Mao Kurokawa, i never know she can voice different way which she already voice acted Gakkou Gurashi's Wakasa Yuuri andIzawa Mikako where she voiced Moeko, kinda cute to hear. Overall, it was enjoyable to listen all the seiyuus voice.I do enjoy Wakaba, since she love to explore new things which she hasn't done in the past, i love seeing her doing stuff at the next level, like taking pic of foods repeatedly and taking a huge bite of Moeko ice-cream. She does react very funny but very cute. I find her interesting for a rich girl trying to be a gyaru. Nao, does really like to act like tomboyish since she kept saying boku but she tend not to use in front of them since she loves the boys-love genre.Overall, i do enjoy watching Wakaba for my loveable wee hours of saturday, it alerted me to wake up before going to school as i do love watching cgdct, with the season over, wouldn't be a fun saturday wee hours anymore, but i do gonna enjoy with fall anime as they would have more SoLs and CGDCT airing but hopefully on Saturday.So i do hope you guys enjoy reading this review, hope it's helpful to you though there are some of it can be a bit nonsense since my brain is overloaded with stuffs, but yeah do enjoy and have a nice day!~P.S get me a season two for this.7/10 was also fun, enjoying to see Wakaba crowned as the winner and yeah.

Overall, it was enjoyable to listen all the seiyuus voice.I do enjoy Wakaba, since she love to explore new things which she hasn't done in the past, i love seeing her doing stuff at the next level, like taking pic of foods repeatedly and taking a huge bite of Moeko ice-cream. She does react very funny but very cute. I find her interesting for a rich girl trying to be a gyaru. Nao, does really like to act like tomboyish since she kept saying boku but she tend not to use in front of them since she loves the boys-love genre.Overall, i do enjoy watching Wakaba for my loveable wee hours of saturday, it alerted me to wake up before going to school as i do love watching cgdct, with the season over, wouldn't be a fun saturday wee hours anymore, but i do gonna enjoy with fall anime as they would have more SoLs and CGDCT airing but hopefully on Saturday.So i do hope you guys enjoy reading this review, hope it's helpful to you though there are some of it can be a bit nonsense since my brain is overloaded with stuffs, but yeah do enjoy and have a nice day!~P.S get me a season two for this.7/10"", 'Wakaba Girl pretty standard fare for a cute girl show. Our main character, the titular Wakaba, is starting her first day of high school hoping this will be the time she finally gets to make friends & do the things Japanese men like reading about Japanese girls doing. In this instance, Wakaba is a rich girl who has spent all her previous childhood following her father\'s work, so naturally she doesn\'t have a clue what to do in normal school girl situations. Cute!Not wanting to waste time, Wakaba soon latches on to the first group of girls she meets. This forms the quartet of friends...who we\'ll be following through the school year, & what a bunch they are: Wakaba is rich & naive; Nao is ""rotten"" & a bit boyish; Mao is the impulsive one & speaks in the third person; & Moeko is moe. Together they\'ll go to the usual places, talk about the usual things, & get into the usual misunderstandings.*cough*Wakaba Girl is by the same mangaka who graced us with Kiniro Mosaic, & it seems likely that it\'s the success of that show which resulted in this one, which ended circulation in 2013, also getting the anime treatment. It\'s certainly clear why it was Kirino Mosaic & not Wakaba Girl was the one that became the success it has. For lack of a better way to put it, if Kirino Mosaic is like eating cake, then Wakaba Girl is like eating refined sugar.The components to a good cute girl show are there. The moe character designs, vibrant colour palette, voice actresses trying really hard to reach the upper limits of human hearing, the day to day vignettes about girls doing things & girls crying over what great friends they are. It\'s all here, all arranged in such a way that feels like Wakaba Girl was practice for what would become Kirino Mosaic (although they began publication at around the same time).The setting is one that\'s been done to death several times over. The characters lack anything that makes them seem more than just cute girl cutouts. Wakaba being a rich girl whose spent a lot of time abroad is simply used to make fairly pedestrian jokes resulting from her apparently having never had friends, seen snow or used a kotatsu before. The other three girls are just kind of there for the most part, there to react to Wakaba rather than do much themselves.Occasionally it can even get rather mean spirited. One episode, for example, sees Nao try to enter a beauty contest, only to first be all but told she isn\'t good looking enough by her friends. Then, after a self-inflicted cold causes her to have to let Wakako take her place, they throw out the dress she designed & made herself in favour of a bland maid outfit. Wakako wins, of course, because rich girls are amasing. Maybe that\'s funny, & maybe there was a point to it. But I didn\'t laugh, not once throughout this predictable cute girls doing cute things parade that did precisely nothing to distinguish itself.It\'s inoffensive, & it does enough that If you\'re a committed fan to the cute girl thing, Wakaba Girl might be alright if you need a quick sweetness fix & aren\'t picky so long as there\'s girls with oversize heads smiling on screen. Otherwise, you can pass this one by. It\'s sweet, but it lacks heart. who we\'ll be following through the school year, & what a bunch they are: Wakaba is rich & naive; Nao is ""rotten"" & a bit boyish; Mao is the impulsive one & speaks in the third person; & Moeko is moe.

But the anime is so interesting that makes you want to watch more even without a complex history behind.The humor is nice. Particularly I\'ve liked a lot the animation and expressions of the characters, it is ""one more point"" that made this anime so funny.The characters are so different between each other, and it\'s nice and funny to see their friendship because of this. They are very cute too!The only thing I didn\'t like so much was the fact that the episodes are pretty short (seven...minutes each one), the anime is pretty interesting and I wish I could watch more.

Hopefully, this review finds its way and tells people that there is some misleading reception behind this cute anime.Wakaba Girl is a TV short in which specialises in using its cuteness to make for a really wholesome anime, and that\'s about it really. I guess with lack of content, it is understandable that some may not like this compared to similar shows, but as I have preached since god knows when, short...and simple is the essence of bliss, hell, this anime could actually be watched religiously too. Wakaba Girl has an uncountable amount of times where the cuteness was executed without fail to add onto my points, making for cliche moments to at least be loveable in some shape or form. Speaking of cliches, this anime uses many of them, and whilst that is also looked down upon, the lack of creativity is saved by basic features like cuteness. That too will lead me to some other point.Moe.I am not entirely sure if it was just me, but Wakaba Girl\'s moe seemed to be so noticeable that it would make me believe it was some kind of masterpiece. I can\'t really describe it properly other than ""feel my vibe"", but if I had to try I\'d say it was the purest kind of moe I have ever seen.Going onto the audiovisuals, very baseline, probably the type of stuff you saw just before and will see after this anime. It is that baseline but I don\'t think that is a problem. +1 for industry consistency. The same goes for audio but I do think that the seiyuus and OP are worth some praise other than achieving baseline, but I suppose at the end of the day it does come across as a common acting skill. Eh, it caught my attention.So, I enjoyed this, quite a bit, and it was something I thought has the capacity to be universally enjoyed, but if you are like me who glorifies short and sweet, well, this will be an even better watch.

Sometimes it\'s going to eat ice-cream, other times it\'s a festival etc. The...dialogue is funny and the jokes do hit their mark.

My Goddess)Sound: 7 (All the sound FX you would expect in a comedy)Character: 8 (Great idea putting support cast in main roles)Enjoyment: 6 (Fairly funny for a kids comedy)Overall: 3/50 = 6.6 = 6.0 (5 minutes of a fun show )::FULL REVIEW::Mini Goddess is to Ah My Goddess as Tiny Toons is to Loony Tunes. Basically a chibi version of the goddesses Urd, Skuld, and Belldandy. They're a lot funnier, cuter, and wacky compared to its normal counterpart. First off, you should know that Keiichi and Belldandy aren't the main characters. Urd,...Skuld, and a new character named Gan-chan are the main characters in this show. I especially like this since there is more screen time for Urd and Skuld. Belldandy is more of a supporting cast and its perfectly fine. It's not a show to be taken serious since the episodes last around 5 minutes with a 2 minute ending theme song. With the limited time, the episode stories are all pretty much made up of &quot;what if&quot; episodes, parodies, silly situations, and afterthoughts. It almost feels like they were just making it up as they went, but thats just how the show is constructed. This puts a whole new spin on random sitcom anime with the only comparable show (that I know of) to this one is Tiny Toons. If you don't know what that is feel free to search the internet. One episode said it best: &quot;Why do you call it the adventures of mini-goddesses when all you guys do is mess things up.&quot; It's so hilarious but true!On a technical standpoint, the art and animation was perfectly fine. All kept in the same style of Ah! My Goddess style. But slight details will be left out to keep the characters in a chibi feel to them. Since this is a comedy in the simplest sense, the animation's are mostly contrived of comical sight gags and limited frame rates. The visual issues are placed well enough to convince the viewers its for comical purposes. And it plays out pretty convincingly. The voice actors are kept all the same and still retain their greatness, and even the ending theme song is pretty cute although it never changes.Some people might take a while getting used to Gan-chan as being one of the main characters. But after a while you will most likely end up getting used to him as he and the Goddesses get stuck in many silly situations. It's obvious this is geared toward a younger audience, but people will still be able to find a few laughs in this show regardless of age. Even I had a few favorite episodes, but there are much more funnier shows than this. If you're a big fan of Ah! My Goddess or if you enjoy silly comedy slapstic or even if you're a big fan of Urd and/or Skuld, definitely give this show a shot. And don't be fooled by the episode number, you can finish this whole show in about 4-6 hours time. Skuld, and a new character named Gan-chan are the main characters in this show.

Every episode happens when keichi isn't at home and the goddess turn into the mini-goddess living their adventures with gan-chan. You'll find lots of parodies with other known animes like Saint Seiya and Berserk.Chibi artwork hasn't anything really exceptional. If you feel stressed and wants to be free from it, watch few episodes, they are really short. Perfect anime for casual times. "", '*Very Minor Spoilers""It\'s really hard for me to sum up my thoughts on this series because even though I\'ve always enjoyed the romantic and magical aspect of the ah my goddess series with regards to its many iterations in the realm of anime, I really enjoyed this anime a lot more because of its heavy emphasis on humour which made this show quite an easy and enjoyable watch.This show is basically a parody series on the ah my goddess license and the story line of this parody anime is that it focuses on the adventures that the three goddesses have with a little rat...called Gan-Chan while Keichi is gone to college. The hilarity factor comes from is that all the goddess are all chibified which makes them quite adorable to watch and the poor abuse they put through their little rat friend.This anime doesn\'t have an overall plot per se because a lot of the episodes are very self contained minus the odd two part episode but with each episode only being 7 minutes long it does a really good job of telling the story it wants to tell, getting a lot of laughs out of the viewer while not getting bothersome and annoying within those 7 minutes. This anime covers so much ground with its silliness because it greatly exaggerates typical anime tropes while taking on parodies of several things in Japanese and American media.Some of these things are doing their own versions of the Godzilla and the die hard films. Each of the goddesses still retain their personalities that we\'ve become accustomed to in ah my goddess, but in this series they\'re greatly enhanced and over-exaggerated.Belldandy is still kind and loving, but completely naiveUrd is brash and hot-headed and on the scatter occasion goes completely insane especially when she clones several versions of herself.Skuld is still as whiny and temperamental as ever, but there are some episodes where she is completely random and designs some very zany things.Then we have poor Gan-Chan; the adorable little rat that has big dreams and big goals and despite the goddesses always offering to help him with those dreams and goals it can sometimes end it complete disaster but you can\'t help but feel a little bit of sympathy for poor Gan-Chan. No matter how many times he gets hurt, he keeps coming back for more and you have to applaud that.In this series the main characters are Urd/Skuld/Gan-Chan while Belldandy takes more of a supporting role which is vastly different from what we\'re use to in ah my goddess. There are even a few episodes where Belldandy has very little dialogue. Overall it doesn\'t really hamper the overall enjoyment of the anime because each character has their share of hilarious moments.The strongest appeal of this anime is that its incredibly funny and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments because you just don\'t know what to expect when you watch each episode. I can guarantee you this, its going to be something completely random and completely unexpected. Despite the humour that this anime has, it does have some beautiful moments as well. I want to bring to attention to one episode in the series called rainy day, and its just an episode with urd walking around town in the rain to the tune of ambient music without any dialogue until the very end. Its very refreshing to have an episode like that to give you a chance to relax from all the crazy zaniness that this anime exemplifies.I want to also mention that I really adored both ending theme songs of the anime because they\'re very adorable and light hearted tracks to listen to and at the end of each episode you can\'t help but feel a little happy by the end of it because I think this anime does what it sets out to do which is to put a smile on your face and I think this anime does a great job of that.Overall this is a wonderful little anime to watch, and its not too much of a time sink with each episode only being 7 minutes long. It\'s a great anime to watch regardless if your a child, a teenager, or an adult and I hope you find plenty to laugh and smile about when you give this anime a try.Favourite Character: UrdLeast Favourite Character: Marller9/10 (I Recommend it.) called Gan-Chan while Keichi is gone to college.

No matter how many times he gets hurt, he keeps coming back for more and you have to applaud that.In this series the main characters are Urd/Skuld/Gan-Chan while Belldandy takes more of a supporting role which is vastly different from what we\'re use to in ah my goddess. There are even a few episodes where Belldandy has very little dialogue. Overall it doesn\'t really hamper the overall enjoyment of the anime because each character has their share of hilarious moments.The strongest appeal of this anime is that its incredibly funny and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments because you just don\'t know what to expect when you watch each episode. I can guarantee you this, its going to be something completely random and completely unexpected. Despite the humour that this anime has, it does have some beautiful moments as well. I want to bring to attention to one episode in the series called rainy day, and its just an episode with urd walking around town in the rain to the tune of ambient music without any dialogue until the very end. Its very refreshing to have an episode like that to give you a chance to relax from all the crazy zaniness that this anime exemplifies.I want to also mention that I really adored both ending theme songs of the anime because they\'re very adorable and light hearted tracks to listen to and at the end of each episode you can\'t help but feel a little happy by the end of it because I think this anime does what it sets out to do which is to put a smile on your face and I think this anime does a great job of that.Overall this is a wonderful little anime to watch, and its not too much of a time sink with each episode only being 7 minutes long. It\'s a great anime to watch regardless if your a child, a teenager, or an adult and I hope you find plenty to laugh and smile about when you give this anime a try.Favourite Character: UrdLeast Favourite Character: Marller9/10 (I Recommend it.)', ""Ah My Mini Goddesses is a small tv short for kids that airs for about 7 minutes per episode and has chibi versions of Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld but mostly Urd and Skuld and a new character, a mouse named Gan-chan.Story 6/10It mostly revolves around Gan-chan whom is a somewhat clumsy mouse who loves food.

Basically a series of AMG Chibi short skits played for laughs with no involvement with the actual AMG main narrative when you boil it down. I do give it credit for keeping interest in the AMG brand alive after the short 5 episode OVA from the early 1990s as Mini Goddess did help to maintain a presence in the anime market for the AMG brand, which later received a feature length adaptation and was then commissioned for two television...seasons, several specials, and further follow-up OVAs seasons, several specials, and further follow-up OVAs']"

Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience. tournament.

The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch.

I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate.

Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10?

Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10?

Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10?

So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card.

So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet.

In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet.

Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT!

I mean, shut up, Mokuba. I mean, shut up kid.SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!*Kaiba gets on his computer and purchases an entire deck full of Red Eyes*See? Now everyone can be happy. Except Kaiba. He\'s always angry.----What Actually Happens:So, this episode is essentially a special episode/epilogue to the 1998 season. It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice.

I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there. It makes no sense that it appears in this movie, but hey it\'s a nice touch. Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba).

Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Growing up, this anime always gave me excitement and always left me on the edge of my seat.If you enjoy sexy characters, with a mix of cute, funny, and kindness, then this show will truly open your heart up to anime.If you love the Yugioh classics like I do, then this action packed anime of duel monsters is for you!Great series to get into, great story plot, and even though it has some sad points, every episode has a twist! Enjoy! ', 'Children\'s Card Games Saga Part II: One Card, One Duel, One Useless RulebookOkay, so why is it that Kaiba wants this Red Eyes card SO BAD? Seriously, Kaiba is so rich, he\'s able to hire personal security, owns limousines, CREATED A DUEL MONSTERS THEMED THEME PARK, and an entire expo center complete with 3D holographic animated versions of the duel monsters game, and owns his own corporation...and the mother f*r still can\'t go to the game shop and buy booster packs.No. He has to go to the extreme lengths of setting up a contest in an enormous expo center, inviting thousands of onlookers...and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care. He\'s Kaiba, b*tch.*Enter kid with anime haircut, and Seto Kaiba, now off the drugs and looking normal without green hair.*Seto Kaiba: Hey kid, I heard you have rare cards.Dumb Kid: YEAH IT\'S THE BESTEST!Kaiba: Watch me go to extremely convoluted and exorbitantly expensive lengths to set up a duel in which we play for your one rare card!Dumb Kid: Dude, you have like 50 armed henchmen... couldn\'t they have just, you know, robbed me for it? Or like, you offer me a hundred bucks for it? I mean, I\'d probably take like 75, but you know.Kaiba: BUT THAT RUINS THE GAME! I derive no enjoyment from purchasing things with this plebeian money! I have ALL the money!Dumb Kid: But if you just want the card, I\'m sure you can like, buy 10 of them on ebay for a hundred bucks...Kaiba: YOU IDIOT! My only joy in this adult life is beating children at a children\'s card game that doesn\'t have any rules!

It\'s not a movie, despite what MAL says- it\'s 5 minutes longer than a normal episode and was released on home video as a stopgap between Season 0 and Duel Monsters.So basically what happens is that this little kid name Shogo buys a booster pack of Yugioh cards and gets an ultra-rare out of it, then goes around showing it to everyone, claiming he can beat them in a duel, even though he never duels anyone because he suffers a mental breakdown and turns into a blubbering mess anytime even the mere thought of ""losing in a duel"" flashes through his three neurons.Anyway, the kid attracts the attention of one greedy corporate assbutt named Seto Kaiba, who, despite owning three of the best card in the game: Blue Eyes, decides he also wants this particular second best card in the game: Red Eyes Black Dragon. So he sends his goons to deliver an invitation to this little kid for the most extravagant duel this side of ""On top of a blimp flying over a city Kaiba had built specifically for the purpose of playing a card game tournament"".The kid suffers a lapse in having a brain, and refuses to commit, so Yugi, being the only person who has ever even come close to beating Kaiba takes up the invite, and an epic duel commences.Seriously, like, this duel takes about 20 minutes of screen time, but it feels like 5. What Yugi and Kaiba took 3 episodes to do in Yugioh 1998, and about 20 episodes in Duel Monsters took them 15 minutes, and oh boy was it ever sweet. The pacing for the duel is very fast, but the flow couldn\'t be better. Seriously, this episode basically has everything in it that makes Yugioh cool- allowing the gameplay to drive the show, including twists and turns in who holds the upper hand, and some of the classic Yugioh trick plays.The characters in this episode also show up looking like they do in Duel Monsters- Yugi sporting his signature sleeveless edgemaster vest and cape, and Kaiba with his infinitely long swooshy blue trenchcoat- the art is MILES better than it was in Yugi \'98- so much so that it actually upgraded to N64 graphics from Phillips CD-i! (and in the span of only 6 months. Jeez, Toei, you came a long way.)Anyway- to wrap up, this episode is basically the entirety of Yugioh in a nutshell. Heart of the Cards, friendship, card games, and pulling a win out from way, way up inside one\'s butt- Egyptian Pharoah style. and commentators PAYING THEM TO BE THERE, all just so that he can beat a little kid at a card game and take his rare card.Kaiba don\'t care.

So it\'s pretty much just a 30-minute commercial for the manga and/or card game. As a Yugioh fan I still got some sort of enjoyment out of this, so let\'s start with the story of this so-called movie:A little boy named Shougo Aoyama finds a powerful card called Red-Eyes Black Dragon, but he is too scared to actually ""fight"" (aka play a card game), so he just doesn\'t use the card at all. Kaiba wants to have the card, so he invites Yugi, Shogo, and some other duelists to a...tournament. Wow, what a creative plot! Since Shougo doesn\'t want to fight, Yugi borrows his card and battles Kaiba instead. The first half of the movie is pretty much Shougo whining over the card and the second half Yugi and Kaiba playing Duel Monsters.Sounds pretty terrible, right? So why am I rating this a 6/10? Before I start with the positives, I want to mention some flaws in the plot. It\'s just so ridiculous how everyone is overreacting over this dumb card. Yeah, it\'s Yugioh, but even in the show, they don\'t react like this. On top of that, they mention in the movie that Red-Eyes is the second most powerful card, right after Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So I thought to myself ""well the Dark Magician probably wasn\'t introduced at this point"". But guess what: the Dark Magician actually appears in this movie! So shouldn\'t Shogo\'s Red-Eyes be the third strongest? Also, Shougo himself is pretty annoying and not memorable at all.The duel between Yugi and Kaiba was pretty sweet. I mean it\'s nothing you haven\'t seen before, but ""Yugi vs Kaiba"" is just a pretty safe bet, so it should appeal to most of the audience. The monster design looks especially nice. In fact, the whole movie looks pretty pleasant. Just from the coloring, you can tell it\'s based on the 1998 version (season 0), but the character design looks more like the Pegasus arc and onward. Also, Kaiba finally has his brown hair instead of green one. So the style looks like a mix between Season 0 and Duel Monsters. The music was good too. It had a very video game-ish feel to it, which I found very fitting. I especially liked the remix of Yugi\'s transformation theme.I really like how they actually use Kaiba\'s proto-type Duel Disk, which was introduced in the Pegasus arc and only used there.

Also, Rex Raptor, who hasn\'t been introduced at this point makes a small cameo ;)If I actually went to the cinema to see this, I\'d probably be very disappointed, but as a fan of the franchise who just discovered this obscure movie on the internet, I found this to be an alright experience.', 'It starts with a totally different mood than the conventional Yu Gi Oh Zero, with some relatively evolved and different characters (some even physically like Kaiba). The movie focuses on the card game ""Duel Monsters"", no longer featuring familiar games, and that\'s interesting, because that\'s when they started focusing on what would later become the well-known Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.The premise is generic, telling the classic story of the introvert and frightened boy who can stand out with something by luck (in this case, catch a Red-Eyed Black Dragon in a booster). I found it senseless that even after getting such a good card (The second best...in the game), the boy still had no confidence and still had an absurd fear of losing.Kaiba organizing a tournament, as usual, calls Yugi and Shougo to participate. I thought Shougo would duel, but again Yugi who will duel with Kaiba. It\'s a rather interesting battle that makes you slightly distressed and anxious, but the end is already as expected. But it was a good scene, I admit ...Final Thoughts: I don\'t even know if it should be considered a movie, it\'s more like an OVA. It seems more than just an advertisement to sell the cards that Bandai released shortly after the end of Yu Gi Oh Zero. The main mistake of this ""movie"" is that things happen too fast, it has a crazy pace.

Uta∽Kata: Shotou no Futanatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/689/Uta∽Kata__Shotou_no_Futanatsu,"[""The Uta-Kata special -- sometimes known as episode 13, other times referred to as the special or OVA depending on what site you're looking at -- picks up some months after the Uta-Kata series left off. With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off. Ichika is in school with her friends, her family situation is as left at the end of the series, and Ichika's birthday as well as Christmas, is approaching. Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things). Some main issues from the series are addressed with the subplots from the original series somewhat ignored, there are certain things that are just entirely left up to speculation. This, however does tie up many loose ends which I felt took a lot away from the series. Therefore, in light of this, I felt the little story deserved a 9 for accomplishing what really needed to be done but wasn't at the end of the series.ArtThe art is just as wonderful as in the series. Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series. The starting song (after a little introduction music) is the same as in the series. The song at the end of the episode reminded me of music heard during the series Maria-sama ga Miteru. This is a familiarity which can be seen in music during the original series as well. I found the music/sound pleasing, appropriate, and unintrusive so I gave that a 9.CharacterIt's very hard to write about the characters without revealing a spoiler (and having someone spoil a storyline for you just downright sucks) so I'm deliberately not going to mention names. I will say, however, that there is a certain character depicted a bit differently than in the series and that the character's way of relating to others changed a bit. Though this may be able to be explained if you go into various analyses of the series and characters, I intuitively felt like it didn't fit and that it felt somewhat unnatural. I took off some points because of this shift. Otherwise, all characters followed very well from how they were presented in the series, leading me to give this an 8.EnjoymentAfter the series leaving me quite unsatisfied between the dark, sometimes depressing nature and the abundance of loose ends, this little special really helped to turn some of that around. Though it doesn't explain every nuance or sub-blot to one's satisfaction, it does resolve some of the larger issues left hanging out in the open from the series. That actually made me enjoy the series as a whole much better, leading me to give this a much-deserved 9 for enjoyment.OverallOverall, this isn't perfect. Ideally, the series could use (at least) a full 12-episode sequel addressing and expanding upon some of the sub-plots and details revealed in the series left otherwise underdeveloped -- including some of the character histories and relationships. This special doesn't accomplish that, however, it does tie up a few big details from the series and it does so with art consistent with that from the series (which is of very good quality), it has an enjoyable little plot, appropriate and enjoyable music, and I found it really added something to the series as a whole leading me to give this a 9 overall.I hope this review is detailed enough to help you decide whether to watch this or not! :) off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off. Ichika is in school with her friends, her family situation is as left at the end of the series, and Ichika's birthday as well as Christmas, is approaching. Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things). Some main issues from the series are addressed with the subplots from the original series somewhat ignored, there are certain things that are just entirely left up to speculation.

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off. Ichika is in school with her friends, her family situation is as left at the end of the series, and Ichika's birthday as well as Christmas, is approaching. Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things). Some main issues from the series are addressed with the subplots from the original series somewhat ignored, there are certain things that are just entirely left up to speculation. This, however does tie up many loose ends which I felt took a lot away from the series. Therefore, in light of this, I felt the little story deserved a 9 for accomplishing what really needed to be done but wasn't at the end of the series.ArtThe art is just as wonderful as in the series. Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series. The starting song (after a little introduction music) is the same as in the series. The song at the end of the episode reminded me of music heard during the series Maria-sama ga Miteru. This is a familiarity which can be seen in music during the original series as well. I found the music/sound pleasing, appropriate, and unintrusive so I gave that a 9.CharacterIt's very hard to write about the characters without revealing a spoiler (and having someone spoil a storyline for you just downright sucks) so I'm deliberately not going to mention names. I will say, however, that there is a certain character depicted a bit differently than in the series and that the character's way of relating to others changed a bit. Though this may be able to be explained if you go into various analyses of the series and characters, I intuitively felt like it didn't fit and that it felt somewhat unnatural. I took off some points because of this shift. Otherwise, all characters followed very well from how they were presented in the series, leading me to give this an 8.EnjoymentAfter the series leaving me quite unsatisfied between the dark, sometimes depressing nature and the abundance of loose ends, this little special really helped to turn some of that around.

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special.

The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.

Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things).

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series.

Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things). Some main issues from the series are addressed with the subplots from the original series somewhat ignored, there are certain things that are just entirely left up to speculation. This, however does tie up many loose ends which I felt took a lot away from the series. Therefore, in light of this, I felt the little story deserved a 9 for accomplishing what really needed to be done but wasn't at the end of the series.ArtThe art is just as wonderful as in the series. Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself.

I will say, however, that there is a certain character depicted a bit differently than in the series and that the character's way of relating to others changed a bit. Though this may be able to be explained if you go into various analyses of the series and characters, I intuitively felt like it didn't fit and that it felt somewhat unnatural. I took off some points because of this shift. Otherwise, all characters followed very well from how they were presented in the series, leading me to give this an 8.EnjoymentAfter the series leaving me quite unsatisfied between the dark, sometimes depressing nature and the abundance of loose ends, this little special really helped to turn some of that around. Though it doesn't explain every nuance or sub-blot to one's satisfaction, it does resolve some of the larger issues left hanging out in the open from the series. That actually made me enjoy the series as a whole much better, leading me to give this a much-deserved 9 for enjoyment.OverallOverall, this isn't perfect. Ideally, the series could use (at least) a full 12-episode sequel addressing and expanding upon some of the sub-plots and details revealed in the series left otherwise underdeveloped -- including some of the character histories and relationships.

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special.

The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself.

With the Uta-Kata series having painted a sometimes light and airy, sometimes dark and depressing view of the world and characters' lives, it leaves off with some loose ends, making you wonder what happened and what the state of things is. This little special manages to smooth out some of those rough edges, making me wonder why they didn't include it in the series itself. Though short, it rounds...off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.

Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things).

Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series.

Michiru mentions she thought she had seen Manatsu and the story picks up from there (as to not spoil things). Some main issues from the series are addressed with the subplots from the original series somewhat ignored, there are certain things that are just entirely left up to speculation. This, however does tie up many loose ends which I felt took a lot away from the series. Therefore, in light of this, I felt the little story deserved a 9 for accomplishing what really needed to be done but wasn't at the end of the series.ArtThe art is just as wonderful as in the series. Though the style of the character's pupils is unique compared to all other anime I've seen, it's a style I got used to over the course of the series and didn't seem very out of the ordinary by the time I saw this special. Animation is smoothly done, and the visual quality of characters is better than other series I've seen. The colors and tones used in the characters are continued well from the series with no visible changes. Another thing worth noting is that certain aspects of animation and art in this series are just amazing -- one example is the fireworks in the series itself. Remnants of this high-quality art trickle through to the special in the way the snow and frost on a window is shown -- which I found to be particularly good in comparison to other animes I've seen.SoundThe sound continues its trend from the series. The starting song (after a little introduction music) is the same as in the series. The song at the end of the episode reminded me of music heard during the series Maria-sama ga Miteru. This is a familiarity which can be seen in music during the original series as well. I found the music/sound pleasing, appropriate, and unintrusive so I gave that a 9.CharacterIt's very hard to write about the characters without revealing a spoiler (and having someone spoil a storyline for you just downright sucks) so I'm deliberately not going to mention names. I will say, however, that there is a certain character depicted a bit differently than in the series and that the character's way of relating to others changed a bit. Though this may be able to be explained if you go into various analyses of the series and characters, I intuitively felt like it didn't fit and that it felt somewhat unnatural. I took off some points because of this shift. Otherwise, all characters followed very well from how they were presented in the series, leading me to give this an 8.EnjoymentAfter the series leaving me quite unsatisfied between the dark, sometimes depressing nature and the abundance of loose ends, this little special really helped to turn some of that around. Though it doesn't explain every nuance or sub-blot to one's satisfaction, it does resolve some of the larger issues left hanging out in the open from the series. That actually made me enjoy the series as a whole much better, leading me to give this a much-deserved 9 for enjoyment.OverallOverall, this isn't perfect. Ideally, the series could use (at least) a full 12-episode sequel addressing and expanding upon some of the sub-plots and details revealed in the series left otherwise underdeveloped -- including some of the character histories and relationships. This special doesn't accomplish that, however, it does tie up a few big details from the series and it does so with art consistent with that from the series (which is of very good quality), it has an enjoyable little plot, appropriate and enjoyable music, and I found it really added something to the series as a whole leading me to give this a 9 overall.I hope this review is detailed enough to help you decide whether to watch this or not! :) off the Uta-Kata series, not flawlessly, though quite well -- and does so in an enjoyable little storyline.StoryThe story is short (because it's essentially only one episode) and picks up a few months after the series left off.
