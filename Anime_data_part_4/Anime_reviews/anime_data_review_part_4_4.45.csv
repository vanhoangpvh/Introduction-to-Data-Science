Bakuman. 2nd Season Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23369/Bakuman_2nd_Season_Special,"[""It's strange, isn't it? It's bee 5 years since this special episode of Bakuman was aired and yet there hasn't been a single review on it. It's a shame!In which way this short anime lacks in quality? I demand an answer. Of course as a review. As an earnest fan of Bakuman series I can't allow such disgrace.Without any doubt Hiramaru is the funniest character in the 2nd season of Bakuman and his Ottaru 11, is undoubtedly one hilarious manga. The whole concept is funny and interesting. Yet, there is no one to acknowledge! Unforgivable!What if it's 4 minutes long? An anime has to be...interesting, that's all. And it's a special episode. There's absolutely no problem for it to be 4 minutes long.Story - 8/10It isn't actually a story by itself. But if you think of it as a part of the original anime.... like you got to watch the late-night anime adaptation of Hiramaru Sensei's manga.... If you think of it this way, then it's fun without any doubt.Art - 8/10The art is good. It's hilarious absolutely matched with the mood. Rather it sets the mood at high for the anime.Sound - 8/10The ending song was funny. Sound was okay.Characters - 8/10Funny and hilarious.Enjoyment - 8/10Overall - 8/10 interesting, that's all. And it's a special episode. There's absolutely no problem for it to be 4 minutes long.Story - 8/10It isn't actually a story by itself.

Biohazard: Death Island,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54398/Biohazard__Death_Island,"[""It is a good film with some well done action scenes that will leave most fans satisfied. After all, this time around the movie features every single one of the main characters of this legendary franchise getting together to take down this new threat. I'm glad to inform you that it mostly does justice to all of them other than Jill being a bit extra at times (in her mannerisms, not the action sequences) and Rebecca's introduction scene with Chris being a bit meh. Also, sadly most of the characters don't get that much time to shine as the movie's main character is Jill and...the story predominantly focuses on her.Action:The animation is great and all of the characters look superb. I do wish they kept Leon's jacket all the way through and that Jill had a new outfit but those are minor grievances as everything else looks on point. The film does justice to all of these superhuman characters by showcasing their amazing survivalist and acrobatic abilities, though I wish there was more of this. Resident Evil has always had the strongest characters in the genre and their strengths are on maximum display here. All the characters get their time to shine and they look really badass too, sadly Leon Kennedy who is my favorite gets little time to shine in the later half but I still loved to see him back.Characters:Let’s be real, the characters are the reason we are watching this movie. This is the first time many of them have interacted with each other for the first time and their interactions are great, I only wish there were more of them. As mentioned earlier all of them get to shine and share the screen with each other. This is basically an Avengers film for RE fans.I am very happy to announce that Leon is finally over his depressed arc from RE Damnation, RE6 onwards, and is now back to his full charming non-depressed goofy self from RE4.For all of them other than Chris Redfield, this is the latest version we are seeing of them as the movie takes place after RE6 and Rev 2. I loved to see them all return, it made me feel like a child finally reuniting with his favorites in the continuity. Thank God, the movie is canon, otherwise no idea when Capcom would have these characters make their apperance in a new game again.Story:The main story is meh, it literally only exists to get the characters to come across each other and present us with many spectacular showdowns. I don’t mind the story being ignorable cause it was never intended to be anything special, all of us are here for the interactions and action sequences, but most of all to see our favorites finally return.Conclusion:In the end, I highly recommend it, I really enjoyed it even if the action wasnt as good, and frequent, as I had hoped. It's the sequel to RE Vendetta and is fully canon, I loved seeing all of these characters back and together and the movie does all of these legendary videogame characters plenty of justice. I'm only taking off a score because Leon didn't get to shine that much and Jill was a bit out of character at times. 8/10. the story predominantly focuses on her.Action:The animation is great and all of the characters look superb.

If you just want to see your favorite characters do cool stuff, ok sure watch it, but if you\'re looking for an actually good entertaining story, it\'s a pretty big dodge. If you\'ve never had contact with the resident evil series, then don\'t even bother watching, because unlike past resident evil movies, this wasn\'t very entertainingEnjoyment: the most important factorI don\'t mind a movie with a stupid plot nor other bad characteristics, as long as it\'s fun and keeps me entertained. Was this movie fun? Hell  no....Halfway through the movie, I remember thinking to myself ""Man, when does this end?"". Unlike previous Resident Evil movies which had a big Unga Bunga element to them but were still very enjoyable with tons of cool moments, Biohazard Death Island is a chore to watch. It felt like running through the Sahara desert, desperately wishing for water, but you can\'t even see a god damn mirage of an oasisPlot:It\'s more of the same. Random crazy person with some past trauma tries to use new zombie virus strain to do evil stuff, and our main characters have to stop him. Along the way, a bunch of civilians and side characters always die, but no one really cares because it\'s not the main charactersCharacters:I mean, it\'s the protagonists of the Resident Evil games. You get to watch all your favorite characters interact with each other and do cool sh*t... but then there\'s the random generic villain number 59# and 60# who no ones gives a sh*t about. I legit just finished watching the movie and have already forgotten their namesVoice acting:I rarely talk about the voice acting, but god damn, it\'s kinda bad. Some characters\' voice acting is noticeably bad to the point where you laugh due to the complete lack of effort. It\'s as if they just did 1 single take and the director was like ""Yeah whatever, let\'s go with that""Visuals:The visuals are overall pretty good. My only criticism is that some characters\' movements seemed really stiff, and I feel that the fight choreography is worse than in the past moviesConclusion 5/10If 10/10 is the absolute best movie you ever watched, and 1/10 is the worst most garbage movie you\'ve seen and 5/10 mediocre, I\'d say this was a solid 5/10, pretty average overall Halfway through the movie, I remember thinking to myself ""Man, when does this end?"".

While most of these adaptations haven´t been well received by fans of the video game saga, the Japanese CGI movies are considered to be the best adaptation of the tone of the game. As a longtime fan of the series, Death Island seemed like a dream crossover, and while the fanservice is plenty, the movie is very flawed.Death Island is definitely a movie tailor made for RE fans, beginning with flashbacks to the Raccoon City incident while discreetly introducing new characters for the plot of this movie....Fast forward to the present? (actually 2015 due to the franchise weird timeline), we quickly encounter the familiar faces of Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Rebecca Chambers and the Redfield siblings. Even if this character lineup sounds like a dream team, they aren´t quite working together but following their personal duties, basically following the events from RE4, RE5, RE6, Revelations 2 and the Infinite Darkness series and retaining the character development and characterization from these works. While the characters seem as stale and stoic as their portrayal on the modern RE games, Jill Valentine, a longtime missing series veteran, makes her return and is definitely the highlight of this movie. Dealing with the aftermath of the traumatic events from RE5, Jill has to learn to work in a team again with the help of her longtime coworkers.The movie´s plot is basically just a poorly-written afterthought even for the standard of the RE series, being extremely similar to the plot of other outbreak incidents in universe, with the villain unironically having to acknowledge that our main characters are tired of dealing with such threats. The lack of creativity even extends to the virus´effects and mutations, recycling ideas from all over the series for the BOW present in this movie. The action segments of the movie are serviceable and enough well done to be fairly entertaining, although not quite reaching the heights of the other RE CGI movies.Even with its mediocre setting, the character interactions between the main characters may justify the existence of this movie, full with cheesy dialogue and callbacks to other events within the series, Leon´s and Jill´s first meeting being one of the best scenes of the movie. Overall, Death Island is worth a watch for diehard RE fans, newcomers to the franchise might only enjoy the decent action scenes and impressive CGI animation. Fast forward to the present?

Oops wrong quote, ""i loved that bike""Truly a Resident Evil. Nothing is special about this movie at all, its just all of the characters from the Resident Evil Series doing stuff that can be considered as special and world saving.Good:CGI is okay.Has Leon S Kennedy.Battle sequences are cool.Gripes:...Cannot remember the antagonist 10 minutes after the movie is done.Not enough Leon.Not enough one liners.Some plot holes are there.Plot armor for the main characters.Story was poor, and writing was kinda mid (The antagonist\'s reasons for being evil made 0 sense).Characters are in their 40s by this point and look like they are in their early 20s.I enjoyed it, but I like the Resident Evil franchise, so I might be a little biased.Most people will at least think it is okay, and an alright waste of time.

I love resident evil. Some of the scenes remind me of some of the previous Resident Evil games. (Nomally, i always wanna know about resident evil game. Even in anime version. Or in movie version)Apart from that, I can see a lot of action, tension, emotional and also GORE being shown.I also saw unexpected moments in several scenes.The visuals are also epic. The story is also epic.As a writer, I didn't expect to see a very epic and fiery Resident Evil like this. I like it very much. I'm very grateful to be able to watch Resident Evil. This movie...will be my motivation to write later.After all, it has become my habit if there is something that makes me curious. Moreover, about Resident Evil. will be my motivation to write later.After all, it has become my habit if there is something that makes me curious. Moreover, about Resident Evil."", 'Firstly Sorry for my bad English :))Resident Evil, also known as the Biohazard series, has a very special place for me. I love all the characters, especially Leon (I love everyone, including Ashley, who has cancer in Re 4\' game) and when I saw the trailer of this movie, I was already in the mood saying ""Oh, let\'s watch it right away"". This movie has Resident Evil Avengers, almost all the popular characters. Leon, Chris, Clarie, Jill and Rebecca what more. Even if these characters only shoot at the zombies, they have set up such a cast that we can watch for 1.5 hours without...getting bored. (This time, not just Leon, everyone is hooked to John Wick, they go to the pistol Headshot :D Normally, Resident Evil animated movies, dont talk about previous games and movies. ""He always writes scenarios by underlaying them as if he is playing to the new audience. However, this is not the first time they have done this in this movie, and this decision was very good. It was nice to talk about the old ones and refer to them. I finished resident evil 2-7 games. Film."" We understand that after the 5th Game, becasuse Chris saying ""Wesker had brainwashed Jill""  even from what Chris said about Piers Nivans, after the 6th Game, it felt nostalgic for him to accept the past and talk about it. Even I, who are just plain viewers without research, understood the time. Likewise, from the conversation between Maria Gomez in Leon, referring to the previous movie, Resident Evil Vendetta, which was reviewed on our site, we can accept that movie and understand that this production took place after that.I realize it\'s a long introduction because I really like the series. The animations look great in this movie, too. Not a Final Fantasy quality, but still great for today\'s conditions. (Let me point out that the mouth and eyes are sometimes ridiculous and glaring) The voice-over staff is amazing. I watched English, and I recommend English to you rather than Japanese. You praise it so much, but you will say why did you give 8? The main villain of the movie is a mediocre one, the animations I\'ve said stand out from place to place. There are no music patterns. And I think the biggest minus is that they had to put some tension parts. It\'s been a lot of action. I think the action scenes are great, but the thriller is a genre that should be in the genes of Resident Evil. but unfortunately it was never in the movie. In addition, the film is very short, only 1.5 hours long. So I don\'t want to talk much about the story. If you remove the action parts, there is a little story left. In terms of the story of the movie, I think it starts out very strikingly, but then it becomes mediocre. That\'s why I think you will watch a very enjoyable crispy cookie movie with 8 points. (By the way, it\'s sad that they didn\'t add a scary voiceover called RESSİİNTT EVİLLL DEATHH ISLANDDD at the beginning of the movie :D )Let me not go without praise, I liked the last Boss fight too much. Take down the big Boss by using the guns, bullets and other gear around. Just like in their games. Especially in the Resident Evil 6 game, we were getting into such crowded boss fights, it gave me nostalgia. Nobody likes it, but I would like to see Wesker\'s Son Jake Muller in RE 6\' in game.I I wish I see him next animation movie But they literally wiped out the character. After Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, which was a big disappointment for me, this movie came as a medicine, I hope you enjoy watching it. Don\'t expect too much, but you will have an enjoyable 1.5 hours from me. I hope the film draws a graph that climbs upwards by throwing off the low scores it has now received. So we keep seeing movies like this. Otherwise, we\'re left with the infamous Resident Evil series and movies shot by real people. Imdb series with 2.5-3 points, they are making the movie, they are not ashamed, they call it REsident Evil. Shame on the brand. So let\'s value and upgrade these animations. See yha in ; Quality animes, Charisma like Leon, Muscular like Chris, beautiful like Jill, smart like Rebecca, meddling like Claria, but a survivor :D getting bored.

It\'s middle of the road and I am surprised it accomplished that much.It establishes itself that it\'s a dumb action movie from the first 10 minutes with how Leon finds the truck holding a vital character minutes after being told about his relevance to the plot and getting into a dumb motorcycle chase and highway fist fight later, if you can\'t accept the first 10 minutes of the movie and then you might as well...shut it off. I can go on about the dumb crap in the movie, and some of it that bugged me was how they established a virus that acts like FOXDIE from MGS and how it\'s basically kryptonite for RE characters, which is a funny way of creating stakes and tension for the movie since it needs to seperate the team and make sure Rebecca and Jill play their roles in the story somehow.A big issue however is the that villain is basically Obito Uchiha garbage levels of writing where he wants to destroy the world because he was forced to kill his friend. Give me a fucking break, and so much of his character is expressed through endless amounts of excessive monologuing most of it is during the middle point of the movie. His backstory is just too much of a boring sob story to even make me care and his characterization being expressed through monologuing doesn\'t help.Some nitpicks as a ""fan"" of the games is that it\'s rather silly to see characters struggle against typical zombies when they have beaten them over 9000 times by now and it\'s also rather amusing to see Lickers get killed by one shot to the head with no use of a shotgun or high powered weapons considering in REmake 2 they take over 3 shotgun rounds to kill and the REmake games were the ones being refrenced in earlier in the movie.Good things about the movie is that Jill is handled decently and is the best character in the movie. Her character is decently foreshadowed as being the ""underdog"" lone wolf of the team is decently contextualized within the first 20 minutes. I also like some of the nods to the games like RE5 and 6 which kind of does a good job at creating some degree of a continuity in a franchise as messy as RE\'s. Rebecca\'s role I also kind of liked since it does a good at making her establish her role as the medic of the team and the action was decent and wasn\'t wannabe John Wick like Vendetta was.The ending climax with the super sayian hulk wannabe boss fight was hilariously over the top. It\'s basically an over the top climax boss fight you\'d find in an RE game particularly the third person over the shoulder games.Overall, for an RE movie it wasn\'t as bad as I was expecting it to be especially considering how much RE content has been produced as of late. Still, not ""good"" but at the very least tolerable. shut it off.

Cool characters form old RE games, (Leon S. Kennedy , Chris Redfield , Jill Valentine , Rebecca Chambers ,Claire Redfield)2. Teaming up together to fight and breakthrough the mission to success.Unfortunately the movie is not that good the way you look at it, it's just made to impress the fans i think, that's all.and leon's bike is so cool, actually driving it makes you feel in heaven xD, so yeah if you are really into RE series then their is no reason for you to...not to bring a snacks and your popcorn and enjoy watching. not to bring a snacks and your popcorn and enjoy watching.""]"
Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach DX,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1957/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach_DX,"[""Sometimes, more isn't better. That sums up my feelings. I finished Wedding Peach and I thought these would be maybe 4 more episodes to see if these would serve an an epilogue of sorts. Instead, they wiped all the characters' memories and it's 4 pointless stories that are just showing the girls' underclothes and bras and stuff.Who is this for? Certainly not for anyone who enjoyed the spirit of the original. The staff must've been ridiculously horny or something, it's actually ridiculous and wholly to the detriment of the show. Like, what even is this?It feels like 4 random side episodes with strangers who...share the faces of the original cast but act nothing like them. I don't think it's worth watching at all, it's not enjoyable. share the faces of the original cast but act nothing like them. I don't think it's worth watching at all, it's not enjoyable.""]"

The level of intricacy and philosophical stimulation is completely unprecedented.This truly transcends the realism and morality of any other anime; nay, any notion ever conceived in the ripe, feeble minds of contemporary society.My second mistake was writing this review, as it deprives you of the experience of Kapibara-san and words simply cannot ever hope to describe the caliber of this anime; nay, this masterpiece.Through a variety of moral dilemmas that question the myriad facets of human nature, Kapibara-san aims to provide not just mere enjoyment, rather,...it aims to reconstruct our perceptions of social institutions themselves.Alas, as mentioned previously, mere mortals cannot do Kapibara-san the justice of fully appreciating nor understanding the true purpose of Kapibara-san.

Being cute and incredibly calm nothing more nothing less.The art is really well done, the charachter are only cute but really well designed, they doesn't have any particular development, they just living their own life.As i said the story is nothing amazing, each episode is 1 minute and a half long and it talk about what the kapibara family doing in that time, is nothing amazing, but the two charms stated above make this anime super useful for stay calm and i suggest it merely for that.

Another of those underground shows which almost no one is watching.The story... wait, it\'s slice of life about kapibaras. I guess you can find somewhat of a plot in every episode, but it\'s not important at all. All is happening is just kapibaras stuck on each other or eat grass.Sound is descent, besides comic narrator voice, there\'s nothing to talk about . Although, soundtrack made by Tateyama Akiyuki, who also made music for ""Yuru Camp"", so I guess OST is likable.Characters are pretty... Yeah, they\'re just pretty,...adorable and every synonym to that.You might enjoy this show if you just want to off your brain and gag along with kapibaras. adorable and every synonym to that.You might enjoy this show if you just want to off your brain and gag along with kapibaras.', ""It's a slice of life kids show about a family of capybaras that's only 1 minute and 20 seconds long per episode.Story - 6 - Very basic since it's a kids show.

Blue Drop: Tenshi-tachi no Gikyoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop__Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku,"[""The following review would never be written if it weren't for the ending...it was very touching...it brought the show to a whole different level...anyway...Blue Drop (BD) is a combination of slice of life school drama and sci-fi water action anime. In a nutshell, BD is not meant for those who only seeks action (slice of life HINT HINT). I would say about 70% of the show is slice of life-ish and 30% action.Story:The story itself is pretty easy to follow. Nothing too complicated, though I didn't expect the ending to be like that... It was a bit lacking at the end though due to...the lack of follow up to what happened at the end. Also, I just didn't quite like the Yuri stuff throughout the show (should be good news for all you Yuri lovers).People should also appreciate the events leading up to the ending (mainly the preparation for the drama and how it never get to finish) as that's what really makes BD shineArt:One of the stronger points of the show. Some may argue the drawing of the characters are not very original (actually, a few faces does remind me of some characters from older anime), but when one consider the creative art of the spaceships, environment settings, etc, one should agree that solid efforts were applied to the show.Sound:The OP and ED are not particularly outstanding to me (in fact, it took me quite a while to &quot;accept&quot; them). But the occasional soundtracks fit the settings perfectly.Character:The strongest point of this show. There are tons of character development for the main characters (namely Mari-san and Hagino-sama!) and what they experience throughout the show is what truly makes it worth watching. A lot of the background story get uncovered as the main characters develop themselves. In particular, one will see a great deal of maturity in Mari-san at the end compare to how she started in the beginning.Enjoyment + Overall:There were some silly parts likehaving BLUE (the ship) act like a whale jumping in and out of waterbut all in all, the story has a satisfactory ending and most of all it wrap things up which is always welcoming. I was able to sit through the entire show in a day, so I don't think it is really that boring as some people has suggested. Again, I don't recommend this anime to those seeking for intense action as the show is rather calm until the end when all hell break lose. the lack of follow up to what happened at the end.

One moment you think you're watching a slice of life school drama, the next moment you feel like watching some sci-fi space/water action show. When these two things intermingle badly it feels like you're trying to watch two different shows at once.Story (Decent)Having said that though, you will notice it will lean towards one or the other toward the end. It's basically a story about a sole survivor of a tradgic incident who has no recollection of her past or the incident. When she joins an all girls school, she happens to discover things about her...past. ...And the wheel begins to start turning. The story starts out fine but then it starts to branch out to other stories involving other characters, and with the lack of episodes, it &quot;sorta&quot; gets a little overwhelming. But not to a point where you get lost completely, but to a point where you might have to pause and think about what happened before hand why certain decisions are made. Its not really a thinking mans anime but more of an attention to detail kind of anime. Either good or bad, is your decision I found it to be alright. But what helped me to watch this show was that it was an all-girls school.Art (Poor)The art style is kind of below average in my opinion. Although there is a large variation (but mostly cute) cast of girls. They're all drawn pretty weak. Almost reminds me of a late 1990's anime. Not much time is given to fully understand the technology and reasoning behind what is going on but for the most part makes the action scenes fairly decent albeit very short. If there was anything good out of the art department, that would have to be the paintings of the &quot;spaceships&quot; They're very detailed and show a large amount of time was taken to create them. Too bad they look like ridiculously inefficient machines. But one can't think too much on the Blue Drop universe, since a lot of details are left out. I will say one thing, for a slice of life school anime, the battles are pretty epic.Sound (Fair)The sound and music is average as well. Nothing spectacular. Aside from the girls talking and the orchestra pulling the strings to the viewers heart, nothing really stands out. Even the sound effects for the battles all sound like they came straight out of a final fantasy game. The electronic voices all voices sound perfect for this show, they didn't sound annoying like most war animes manage to do on a normal basis. The school girls voices all sound spot on as well, but they're typical. Just stereotypical voice casting but it was all done very well.Characters (Mediocre)The characters are neither memorable nor are they forgettable. With a drama, of course theres a love story involved, its incomplete. Well not incomplete but rather you wouldn't expect it to go the way it went. But when there was drama, it was pretty good and heart moving. But like i said, with so much going on in this show it kind of beats itself up on making this a well thought out show.If this show as at least a whole season longer, or if they explained things better, or at the VERY least put more than two people to run such a gigantic warship maybe I could have grown to love it. I'll even admit I was almost moved to tears in this show, and almost enjoyed all the characters, if there was a little more polish to this show it would have gotten higher points.

One of my friends sent me a link to it, and I decided to check it out which I'm grateful for.The greatest assets in this anime is the art. The art is superbly smooth and well done, details couldn't have been more and everything just looks so realistic. Already from the beginning you can see it, the beauty in the art. It is sparkling and dazzling and leaves a taste of wanting more.The storyline can be a bit hard to understand first, it's more...like a Slice of Life in the beginning. Introduction to the environment, all the characters and lots of new stuff appearing all the time. But despite that, it all goes in a very smooth and calm pace which leaves plenty of room for one to enjoy.Characters are rich and engaging, they interact with each other a lot and are very detailed. Their personalities are flawless and make good spots for humor in their own way when making mistakes.The OP and ED are both made by same artist, Suara and are very good. The OP leaves a trace of sadness and beauty, and the ED gives a calm feeling. But the rest of the soundtrack aren't that astounding but it fits well into the scenes.In my own opinion, there ain't many drama animes that has this mix of emotions in it. Happiness that makes them laugh until the fall  asleep, hate that constructs an aura around you strong enough for others to feel and sadness so deep that the body they live in feels like a vessel for hell. Emotions in this anime are really bunched up in a mix that makes you taste all the flavors one by one strongly.For those who like Slice of Life's and drama, here is  a perfect anime for you. I strongly recommend this, from the very bottom of my otakuheart. like a Slice of Life in the beginning.

But mysteries aren\'t everything in storytelling, what distinguishes a good story is when you know what is coming but you\'re still biting your nails and hoping that it does, or doesn\'t, happen. And this is what this animé managed to do, at least to me.There are two parts to this animé as has been said, the high school/romance part and the sci-fi part. For those hoping for quick-ass action, avoid this title, battles are few and generally quickly over with, they often serve to increase...the tension on the characters and not to be the main events. A bonus point however for more realistic sci-fi in terms of equipments and weapons... given the more serious approach of the material, I was afraid when seeing some calling the animé as part of the ""mecha"" genre of seeing mecha as such as Gundam and the like.As to the second part, this is what sucked me in. The characters may be based on typical character types found in animé, but they get a chance to be fleshed out well so that you find them sympathetic and grow to like them. At the end of the story, you\'re really rooting for the main characters and feeling for them. As some say, this animé is slow-paced, but this slow pace I believe allows characters to grow a bit beyond their mold and truly become alive, as relationships don\'t develop overnight nor do the developments seem forced. This is truly an animé more for the emotional side, at which it succeeds...However on the rational side, it fails a bit. There\'s a lot of questions that go unanswered or sci-fi aspects that go only slightly explored. It\'s ultimately the sci-fi bit that gets a bit forced at times to make way for the relationships bit. And for those interested about the ramifications of an all-female species and concerned about a coherent fleshing out of it, you will be disappointed. Same thing with the intentions of the main vilain, whose actions often seem illogical. It seems the sci-fi context is almost only used as a reason to put the characters into relation and to justify the drama surrounding them, and for little else. The ending rubbed me in the wrong way too, it succeeds emotionally (again) but fails rationally (if it wasn\'t a spoiler-free zone, oh, the questions I would ask!).In short, a very good tale for the shoujo-ai fans and for those looking for drama, but best avoided if your main interest is science-fiction and you don\'t care much for romance and relationships. the tension on the characters and not to be the main events.

When it first aired, I was looking forward to this series since I'm a bit of a shoujo-ai-fan (as 80% of male anime fans) so I gave it a shot. Here are my thoughts after finishing it:StoryThe story is interesting and original, thus I gave it an 8. I would have graded it higher but there are some parts that for a shoujo-ai/sci-fi anime, it just don't add up. There were times when I would have wished a more sci-fi story than...the slice-of-life they're showing. Basically half the anime is about the (almost) normal life of Mari and Hagino. The drama is there, of course, and I admit I didn't see the ending coming but most of the story I could read along. The original idea was good yet the content were a bit bland for me. Still, it gets an 8.ArtWell, the art is Blue Drop's strong-point. I really like the way it's drawn though I can't say I like all of it, it's normal for every person to like/dislike some things. I gave it a straight 9 for the awesome design and concept of the alien ships, especially Blue, that looks like one kick-ass battleship from modern times with a bit of a whale DNA. Even the battle scenes between ships were impressive compared to other anime series I've seen.I wished the character design would have been a bit more special since some of the characters really look like grabbed from the bookshelf and added another color of eyes and a lock of hair. The only character that looked out of the ordinary was the dorm leader.SoundNothing much to say about this, as usual. The OP and ED are sung by Suara (lovely voice) and they fit the anime in my opinion. They're really worth listening to once in a while. As for the background music, it fit the scenes but it was pretty average. Nowadays the producers don't spend so much time creating quality, touching BGM. Anyway ...CharacterApart from the art (mentioned earlier), I liked the characters. Sure, their personalities seem to mix here and there with other anime characters but I have no complaints, pretty well done. The one thing that annoyed me was that the whole action happened on Earth, yet we see only 3-4 males through the entire show. I know it's SHOUJO-ai but I would have liked to see a bit more male activity along the way, could have added some flavor to both the characters and the story.Final ThoughtsEven though it wasn't the greatest shoujo-ai I've seen, I enjoyed it. I has it's good parts and it has it's bad parts but who am I to judge it. It's not a waste of time but don't expect anything too special. Off to fight some hot aliens ...

IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZERZ!Final Overall Grade: 7.5, rounded up to 8."", 'After hearing that Blue Drop is a slice-of-life/ sci-fi action with some yuri, it is understandable to assume that it would be a big floundering mess. The whole idea of school life, spaceship battles, and girl-on-girl romance being mashed together in one show sounds ridiculous (yet we still see this kind of thing far too often as anime-fans)... and yes, Blue Drop flirts with disaster on a regular basis. However, it manages to juggle these elements surprisingly well to deliver a decent story with emotional punch.Mari Wakatake is a young amnesiac and sole survivor of a tragedy that left hundreds dead. She remembers nothing before...waking up in the hospital and has lived with her wealthy grandmother ever since... that is until her grandmother sends her off to an all girls boarding school. Here Mari meets Hagino Senkouji, a girl highly admired by her fellow students, but also quite mysterious. As it turns out Hagino has some big secrets, as she has ties to Mari\'s past; plus, she may not even be of this world.Blue Drop attempts to combine school-life drama with sci-fi action, and for the most part it does a decent job of this. Those looking for heavy action might be disappointed, as the primary focus is on is on the school-life aspect; but really, that is where the heart of the story lies. The drama works very well here, in no small part to the show\'s colorful and sympathetic cast; most important of which are Mari, Hagino, and their classmate, Michiko. On face value Mari is kind of a jerk, pushing away her classmates, but as the show continues and she begins to build relationships, it becomes clear she\'s actually a very caring person who acts abrasively because of the traumas in her life. Hagino\'s perfect girl exterior is actually a facade hiding a deep remorse over her past; Michiko is friendly and has a love for stories, but is very unsure of herself. It is very compelling and rewarding to watch these three distinct personalities grow; Mari and Hagino\'s friendship (later on romantic relationship), and Michiko\'s struggle to write the school play (which in of itself is an interesting story) are definitely the highlights of the show. Other notable characters are tough girl and wannabe cook Akane, dorm-manager Hiroko, and chemistry teacher Yuuko Sagawara; all of whom have there issues and turns in the spotlight.With the school-life aspect being dominant, you would expect the sci-fi portion to be a huge mess that doesn\'t work. Surprisingly, it actually works quite well. Hagino\'s dual life, and her species purpose on Earth (the presence of heavily armed spaceships should be a dead giveaway...), fit nicely into the frame of the story. There is even a good amount of compelling drama regarding the show\'s sci-fi segment; the spaceship battles are exciting satisfying. There is a lot left for speculation and some gaping holes in logic, so the sci-fi aspects are far from perfect, but admirable considering its considerably limited time.On the technical-side, Blue Drop works, but doesn\'t excel. The character designs are, for lack of a better word, \'normal\'. They certainly are not hard on the eyes, but they aren\'t particularly striking, and honestly, the outfits for the (all women) alien race are pretty silly. The backgrounds are decent enough, but again mostly the interior of a school, the grounds around the school, occasionally a city or small town, without any particularly distinctive characteristics; so nothing eye-popping. More interesting are the interiors of the spaceships, which are quite striking and practical in design, which is nice and shows effort was put into their look. As would be expected from an anime from Gonzo, there is CG art used present, it is primarily used for the spaceships and done well there. However, it is also used for birds, or cars, for which the rendering could have been done better. The music is pretty standard, it can be effective and is used well, but ultimately not a memorable soundtrack.The problem here is, because of uneven amount of time spent on each part, Blue Drop ends up falling short of being rewarding as a whole. Sure, the school-life drama is done very well, and the sci-fi is competent... but they just don\'t mesh well enough together to work cohesively as a whole. The fact of the matter is that the trials of school life are trivial when faced with an alien invasion, and the possible enslavement/genocide of the human race, and that is what takes up majority of the shows running time. It is hard to care about a school play, no matter how well written, when there is world-wide destruction taking place. On top of that, there is no clear resolution to the monumental events that take place late in the series; with only a very vague idea of what happened that just screams ""Haha... read the manga"", which makes sense because this is a precursor to the manga, but it ultimately feels like a slap to the face to the viewer.Blue Drop is a show that ends up feeling like less than the sum of its parts. All the aspects of the show are good enough on their own, but fail to come together in a completely satisfying way. Perhaps if the show was given more than 12 episodes, they could have. That aside, it is recommendable for how well each individual part works. The drama is compelling, the characters are sympathetic, and the action is exciting. For those reasons, Blue Drop is certainly worth a watch. waking up in the hospital and has lived with her wealthy grandmother ever since... that is until her grandmother sends her off to an all girls boarding school.

There is even a good amount of compelling drama regarding the show\'s sci-fi segment; the spaceship battles are exciting satisfying. There is a lot left for speculation and some gaping holes in logic, so the sci-fi aspects are far from perfect, but admirable considering its considerably limited time.On the technical-side, Blue Drop works, but doesn\'t excel. The character designs are, for lack of a better word, \'normal\'. They certainly are not hard on the eyes, but they aren\'t particularly striking, and honestly, the outfits for the (all women) alien race are pretty silly. The backgrounds are decent enough, but again mostly the interior of a school, the grounds around the school, occasionally a city or small town, without any particularly distinctive characteristics; so nothing eye-popping. More interesting are the interiors of the spaceships, which are quite striking and practical in design, which is nice and shows effort was put into their look. As would be expected from an anime from Gonzo, there is CG art used present, it is primarily used for the spaceships and done well there. However, it is also used for birds, or cars, for which the rendering could have been done better. The music is pretty standard, it can be effective and is used well, but ultimately not a memorable soundtrack.The problem here is, because of uneven amount of time spent on each part, Blue Drop ends up falling short of being rewarding as a whole. Sure, the school-life drama is done very well, and the sci-fi is competent... but they just don\'t mesh well enough together to work cohesively as a whole. The fact of the matter is that the trials of school life are trivial when faced with an alien invasion, and the possible enslavement/genocide of the human race, and that is what takes up majority of the shows running time. It is hard to care about a school play, no matter how well written, when there is world-wide destruction taking place. On top of that, there is no clear resolution to the monumental events that take place late in the series; with only a very vague idea of what happened that just screams ""Haha... read the manga"", which makes sense because this is a precursor to the manga, but it ultimately feels like a slap to the face to the viewer.Blue Drop is a show that ends up feeling like less than the sum of its parts. All the aspects of the show are good enough on their own, but fail to come together in a completely satisfying way. Perhaps if the show was given more than 12 episodes, they could have. That aside, it is recommendable for how well each individual part works. The drama is compelling, the characters are sympathetic, and the action is exciting. For those reasons, Blue Drop is certainly worth a watch.', ""Welcome to the third review of yuri anime month. Well, we've had two comedies so far. Let's move onto something more tragic. Adapted from the manga by Yoshitomi Akihito by Asahi production and Bestack, this is Blue Drop: Tenshi tachi no Gikyoku, which I will consistently refer to as Blue Drop for the sake of simplicity. One thing that makes Blue Drop interesting is that it's not directly adapted from any of the Blue Drop manga, it's a prequel to them with its own story and characters. Yoshitomi Akihito did co-write the screenplay though. Still, you have to wonder why they didn't do a direct...adaptation. Maybe they thought it was a good opportunity to expand on the manga or maybe they just didn't think that either of the manga stories that existed at the time would make a good anime (there are three now.) I'll try to find an interview or something to answer that during my time re-watching the series.*We open with a girl named Mari being moved to a private school because her grandmother thinks it will benefit her to learn social skills. Like anyone needs those. Mari is upset because she's spent all her life that she can remember with just her, her grandmother and their servants but on the way to her school she sees a girl surrounded by birds, almost like a Disney princess. She soon finds out that the girl, Hagino, goes to the same school as her. They meet and things instantly get off to a bad start. Why? Because there's something strange about both of them and no, I'm not going to explain what exactly. While not a major spoiler it would be a minor one. There are actually two major focuses to Blue Drop's story. The first is the relationship between Hagino and Mari. The second is invading aliens. I promise, it makes sense in context. Let's start with my problems with the story... okay problem. There's really only one and that's that there's a bit of a plot contrivance, let's just call it the spectre. If you watch the anime you'll figure out why. Yeah, I have a few minor complaints like that the alien culture isn't really explored much or that the short sequences in the first and last episodes set in the future are out of place, but those are things that hardly merit mentioning because, honestly, they kind of work. That being said, there's a lot that Blue Drop does really well. Foreshadowing is used to great effect, the relationship between Mari and Hagino is really well developed with good tension that never feels forced. Then we have the ending. It's pretty masterfully done. The first time I saw this was with my anime club and we all cried at the end. I thought that it would be less tragic when I knew what was coming, but it doesn't lose it's impact. I'm not ashamed to admit that the ending moved me to tears... again. It has a largely tragic element, but there's also a sense of hope underlying the whole thing.Let's move on to the characters. Mari and Hagino are both really interesting characters who have small aspects of over-used tropes, the tsundere and the tortured past, that are expanded upon and developed in a unique way. Another thing that makes the tropes work is that they're only a small part of their characters. Both of them have a lot of depth beyond the tropes. That's what makes them interesting characters instead of the same ones weve seen multiple times. One thing I really like is that Blue Drop's major supporting characters all get their own miniature story arcs. Azanael, Tsubael, Hiroko, Akane, Michiko and Sagawara sensei, they all get an arc. That could've easily led to a bunch of scenes that were out of place or pointless, but it doesn't. The writing is really spectacular. Every miniature arc is worked organically into the story and feels like an essential piece to it. Which naturally leads to a very intricate and character driven story.The art is just magnificent. The alien tech is both otherworldly and awesome looking. The nature scenes are beautifully done. The characters, backgrounds and general settings all look really good. The way they use a bird to mimic actual human expressions, and yes there is a good reason for it, is brilliant. I do have one complaint about the art, though and that's that the aliens' military uniforms are ridiculous. They look like leotards with random holes poked in. Look, I hate to break it to you but that's not going to be helpful for combat. It is going to be detrimental.The vocal cast does an excellent job in this. Particularly Sawashiro Miyuki. I'm used to her giving good performances, she's always good, but this is the best I've heard from her. The music is well done. I especially like the way that most of the music is really serene except towards the end when things start going down.And the yuri factor... It's a little tougher in this one. Of course there's yuri, it is a yuri anime and the romance is central to the plot. That being said, a lot of it focuses on them learning to be friends and the romance doesn't become a major factor until the last four episodes or so. Still, the relationship between Mari and Hagino is very well done and it isn't the only yuri. There's also Azanael's relationship with Onomil and Hagino's fan girls. I'm going to say a 9/10 since it's there and it's canon, but it is a little down-played.Now we move on to the final rating. You may have noticed that I did have some problems, but nothing big. As such my final rating is a 9/10. It's got a good mix of sweet moments and tragedy, both of which are well done. The story, characters, art and voice acting are all really good. Give it a try. Now, I know my last two reviews have been anime I've seen and knew I liked, which can't really be helped when you look at how much yuri I've seen but still, so next week I'll be looking at something new, for me anyway. So next week its Mnemosyne.* I couldn't find any real answer. I looked, but there wasn't a whole lot of information about the production, not that I could find anyway. adaptation.

Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, reading the synopsis is assumed, and this review *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* so be careful if that matters to you. This review is for the dubbed version. I tend to rank most anime fairly high, but for once I discovered a show I didn't care too much for. Blue Drop is a odd mix of water/alien warfare, and stuttering, jerky yuri romance. Overall, it fails at doing either very well. Does it make the RTLR wall? Read on and I'll show you! (to quote the unmatched Sailor Moon)Story: 3The...story is an utter mess. A large part of the story revolves around aliens in submarines preparing to invade Earth. (and with poor British accents no less!) The aliens are not well defined, their purpose for their actions not really explained besides 'must conquer earth', and they are all female in silly fanservicey uniforms. The romantic side of the story is fairly slice of life-ish, but opens with a HUGE Chekhov's Gun. A Chekhov's Gun (the playwright, not the nucleer wessels guy) states that if we see a gun on a mantle in a play, it needs to be fired before the end of the third act. Everything extraneous is to be eliminated. Everything detail has to have a motivation. This applies in nearly all storytelling. SPOILERS BEGIN HERE: The main alien girl meets the main human girl. After a simple handshake, the alien girl flips out, her eye color changes, and she proceeds to attempt to choke the life out of the main human girl, while flashbacks from the primary alien plot flash across the screen. This makes for a very memorable meeting between the two, one trying to choke the other to death. In fact for several more episodes the main human is super angry at the main alien for what happened. The main alien seems to have no memory of the event. Never again does the alien's eye color change, nor does she commit any further violence again the main human girl. There's a throwaway line or two about 'contact telepathy' later on, but apparently this only works once, as the girls touch each other many times after, this is a shoujo ai-ish anime. So because we are never told why what happened happened, or why it never happened again, we have a Chekhov's Gun of major proportions. ENDS SPOILERS.The rest of the story is the weird aliens preparing for an invasion of Earth via submarines apparently, and the slice of life shoujo ai is built around preparing for a school play with hints of 'mystery' thrown in that frankly makes one yawn. It really fell flat on both fronts.Art: 4Like the other anime I've watched, again we have simple lines, which screams lower quality to me, but I understand some prefer that look. The ships are odd, appear to be CGI, and mostly look like some kind of robotic scorpions. Not anywhere near good, but not so bad I was distracted by it.Sound: 5Oh the aliens' accents. They are just terrible. Also, the headmistress at the school tries WAY too hard to be the harsh older woman and comes across as nearly comical. Some of the girls are fairly decently cast, the tough girl sounds about right, the shy girl is good, the main human is angry enough to fit the story but because we have so many aliens, mediocre is the best I can give it. This is especially telling, as one of my favorite voice actresses ever, the incomparable Brittney Karbowski.Character: 5I have to say it; the Headmaster of the school looks like he should be in a '70's porno, not an anime. He is hilarious looking, but really kind of a non factor. Some of the best parts of the story come from the side adventures of the supporting cast. The shy girl tends to fall in love with *anyone* at the drop of a hat, the big girl isn't ashamed to be herself no matter her weight, and the tough girl harbors an embarrassing (at least to her) secret. To watch them overcome problems they thought were insurmountable and succeed through them anyway was much more interesting than the battles of the scorpion subs and their 'jilted lover's revenge' thread. The villain for most of the story doesn't seem to have any real motivation, and when she reveals why things happened the way they did, it's utterly disappointing. A conspiracy is involved, and if it was real, it would be too dumb for even Alex Jones.As the main alien's relationship with the main human grows into something positive, we find that the alien girl is much more interested in being a human high school girl than some alien warship commander. Sure the power of love and all that, but it still seems unlikely. There are some small moments of tenderness and sweetness, but they are offset by tons on nonsensical actions by everyone from secret agent teachers to alien second-in-commands.Enjoyment: 5I stuck with it, hoping that either the alien battles would take the focus or the romance would truly blossom but in the end neither of them did. There were a handful of spots I found myself leaning forward thinking they might just be onto something only to have those moments end and the show return to its inane mix. I wanted to like it. I just couldn't.In closing, there are much better anime out there that are not bizarrely disjointed and lost in their own identity. I suggest you search them out.

The summary seemed like it would make for great tragedy at the end, and while it did, I still felt like it was sorely lacking. The whole ending of the show seemed like it downplayed the relationship built between the two main characters, something that felt like a cop-out to me since the relationship really did grow in a very believable way.Story: 8From an unbiased perspective, this story really was more than decent. There were a lot of things going for it, disregarding my feelings on the...ending.

However, despite the relative antiquity of the art, it managed to be very beautiful in it's own way. I thought that the battleships looked very alien in a good way and all of the scenery was well done too. The art fit the tone of the anime quite well.Sound: 6The reason I give this a six is because generally nothing stood out to me. The soundtrack was so much white noise, dramatic at the right parts, nonexistent in others. The ED was a little too upbeat for the feel of the anime, I think, but it wasn't glaringly bad. The OP, however, was really wonderful and suited the anime perfectly. As for the voice acting, I wasn't impressed, but I wasn't disgusted either. Every character had her moment, I guess, but there was once again nothing that stood out more than being just okay.Character: 7This is, again, one of those things that was really quite good until the ending. While character designs were very run of the mill, I thought that the character development far exceeded the design. The growth of relationships was believable, especially between Mari and Hagino. Most of the motivations also got eventually explained which is more than most anime can boast, and unlike most shojou-ai, not everyone was motivated by love of the cute little moe girl (thankfully there was none). However, as I stated before, the yuri relationship between Hagino and Mari came- in my opinion- to practically no end. Thus, the seven.Overall:I would have enjoyed this anime a lot more had it actually acted like the shojou-ai it claimed to be. I left it feeling unsatisfied and cheated which I don't like in my anime.

I was coming into this with such an open mind, but man, I really wasn\'t into this one.Story & Characters: Blue Drop starts out with us seeing our main character, Mari Wakatake, who has been enrolled in Kaihou Academy by her grandmother.  Why her grandmother?  Because Mari lost her parents, along with everyone else who lived on the island she was from, five years...prior to this series starting.  The kicker is that this caused amnesia in Mari, so she can\'t remember any of it.  Skip forward to the present where she meets multiple students in the dorm, including Hagino Senkouji.  Due to Hagino\'s popularity and standing in the academy, it\'s suggested to Mari that she get to know her.  This, before Hagino decides to try and... choke Mari?  To make matters weirder, when Mari steps outside, she sees a rising spaceship in front of Hagino.The story, unfortunately, takes a long time to get going and that\'s really the ultimate downfall of Blue Drop.  It doesn\'t ever feel like we have any amount of foreshadowing into what the end goal of this series is, and that makes this series\' direction completely absent.  I\'d argue that while you\'re in a school setting, you don\'t ""really"" need that end goal in mind, but with this series quickly introducing sci-fi aspects into the story, you kind of wonder what the point of it all is.  There are a fair amount of conversations taking place both back on this ship, or with its crew, but it almost feels like there\'s no way for us to know what the point of it all is.  There\'s nothing to really get excited about, outside of the fact that romantic aspects are getting introduced once the plot moves along.It\'s pretty evident early on that Hagino isn\'t particularly normal.  She\'s very clearly related to this ship in some fashion, and unfortunately, the dialogue that surrounds her makes very little sense until they feed you the information later on.  That makes her very hard to like as a character... because you just don\'t know what\'s there.  There\'s no ramp up for us to see this character shine.  Mari makes almost less sense to me as a character than Hagino.  She has some pretty stark attitude issues, some of which are understandable, that make it seem like she\'s pretty hard to get along with.  That\'s fine for a character, but after a certain point, she\'s completely warmed up to her colleagues.  The journey to see her character from the beginning to end doesn\'t feel smooth, and her character just changes, seemingly overnight.  That being said, the moments between our two characters near the end were really sweet, and if only the character development made sense and was allowed to blossom, I feel like you\'d fix a lot of the issues that I have with this story\'s main cast.Tsubael is one that Hagino knows very early on, and she\'s sweet for the most part, but doesn\'t really add much to the story itself.  Azanael is from the same place that Hagino comes from, but I actually didn\'t mind her as a character.  She has some pretty hard resentment for Harino, which gets explained later in great detail, and that easily makes me feel for her.  Even when she acts rashly, you can kind of see why, and her character develops even further in the last half of the series.  She was an excellent side character.  Yuuko is one of the teachers at the academy, and she clearly has a purpose to the story, but like Tsubael, I just found her to be kind of useless.  Hiroko, Akane and Michiko make up the biggest names in the dorm that we see in our story, and they\'re fine for being general schoolgirls that our main cast hangs around.  Michiko was probably the best of the bunch, trying hard to get some form of reputation while working her absolute hardest.Most of the series took place in and around the school or dorm, and that\'s probably where this series most comfortable.  What little drama occurs during the series was decently placed, even if the storyline itself didn\'t seem like much.  I wasn\'t terribly pulled into all of it because the series basically only focused on one class, but it was all believable enough to call this series a school-based series anyway.  The back and forth between the students does tend to get old pretty quick because there\'s so much bickering.  Even if you consider this typical for an all-girls school, it hardly makes for an enjoyable viewing experience.The sci-fi aspects drag this series down quite a bit because it feels like it was almost added as an afterthought.  It doesn\'t feel like a well thought out story because it\'s not fleshed out and there\'s nothing terribly interesting happening with it until the last couple of episodes.  This is something that Destiny of the Shrine Maiden also struggled with, and is why that series resembled Blue Drop the most - outside of the fact that they were both Girls Love series with Sci-Fi aspects.  When you finally have a realization of the purpose that these Sci-Fi aspects have, the series just kind of ends.  Sure, the last two episodes were probably the best in the series, but there\'s no real resolution.  Not only that, but after a key event happens, the series basically rolls to the credits with a 30-year time skip clip that lasts a depressing minute or so.  It all leaves for a pretty disappointing end to a series that had some potential.  (Story: 4/10, Characters: 5/10)Art: This series is very old, so you have to keep your expectations a little reasonable.  However, the series generally looked fine.  One thing that current series struggles at time is keeping characters looking of decent proportions, even in the distance shots, and I wouldn\'t say this series struggled with that much.  That being said, there was some pretty heavy and misplaced-looking CG used for the ships and some of the associated textures, and it just didn\'t look good at all.  (6/10)Sound: The OST was pretty lacking in most parts of the series, but I\'m not really a hard stickler for anime OSTs anyway.  Same goes for the OP and ED, which were just kind of there.  VO work was really rough here, even for the time in which it was recorded.  Look, Hilary Haag (Mari) is a very big name, still thriving to this day, but I wouldn\'t say this was her best work.  It feels like she overshoots Mari\'s ""rough"" attitude some times and it doesn\'t feel like the greatest fit.  But what makes this series somewhat annoying to listen to is the choice to employ random country accents to our characters.  All of Brittney Karbowski (Tsubael), Monica Rial (Hagino) and Shannon Emerick (Hiroko) had them here.  This was very likely a choice by either the script writer (Clint Bickham) or ADR Director (Matt Greenfield) and I\'m not entirely sure of the inspiration for that.  Rial\'s in particular kept coming and going, for whatever reason.  Shannon Emerick was actually really solid in this series, as was Luci Christian (Yuuko) and John Swasey (Fukamachi). (6/10)Overall: Blue Drop is a really difficult title to recommend because it really doesn\'t have many places that it shines.  The story doesn\'t have enough of a direction, our main couple are okay at best and the random accents popping in and out are fairly annoying.  I gave a pass to Destiny of the Shrine Maiden because all of the non Sci-Fi aspects were really well done, but I unfortunately can\'t say the same thing for Blue Drop.  (5/10) prior to this series starting.  The kicker is that this caused amnesia in Mari, so she can\'t remember any of it.  Skip forward to the present where she meets multiple students in the dorm, including Hagino Senkouji.

I gave a pass to Destiny of the Shrine Maiden because all of the non Sci-Fi aspects were really well done, but I unfortunately can\'t say the same thing for Blue Drop.  (5/10)', 'Note: This review is filled with spoilers, to explain how bad the anime is.Blue Drop is a lesbian show where one of the main girls killed the whole family of the other, and the first interaction they have in series, but not chronologically, is the former strangling the latter, and not because of a kink. This would be more than enough for me to say that this anime is not worth watching but there sure is a lot more to criticize it for.The series is about an amnesiac girl who goes to a prestigious girls only high school and ends up sharing room...with another girl who strangles her at first contact, and is found out to be an alien from an all-female race that wants to investigate Earth for plot reasons. It immediately tells you that the main character has no backdrop, or that it remains a mystery throughout most of the show, and based on the very typical setup and setting, you just know these girls will end up as the main couple of the show.Even though it combines slice of life and sci-fi action like Figure 17, the last show I covered before this one, Blue Drop really doesn’t focus on any of them, or at least, not in a way that feels well written, it’s even hard to tell what part is prioritized in it, because, really, it’s none. Scenes transition from the school to a space ship (as in, a spaceship that’s underwater, it´s a spaceship, but it’s a space ship), without a solid reason, they don’t do much in it during the initial episodes.Eventually it turns out that this spaceship is a traitor, or suspected to be a traitor, again, for no clear reason, yet. It’s not a complicated show in the least, but since stuff just happens for the sake of happening, it’s hard to even tell why or how something just kind of happens. Heck, it’s even hard to say that stuff just happens, things are shown on screen but nothing is progressing any of the two main genres of the series.When the girls are in school, they just goof around, when the space ship is shown, the dialogues are something like this: “Commander, I kept investigating, we need you here to do that thing”, “Understood, I will keep investigating here, so keep waiting for me there, I will go soon to do that thing”. The show desperately tries to build a mystery but there´s no mystery because nothing is happening.So, inevitably, the focus ends up shifting to the school setting. Normally this would be to flesh out the cast and build character dynamics, but here the two main characters just flicker and makes fun of the other. The show dedicates screen time to other girls they interact with, but it feels like it’s just there for the sake of being there, it doesn’t really show much of the girls in question besides one or two things about them, and since those characters are ultimately irrelevant to the plot or the characterization of the main characters, it is just a waste of time.The plot points never connect with each other, each one of them is there just to take screen time from the other. The school life portion just have the girls doing typical stuff, with more drama than deserved and needed, is just there to fill episodes, and eventually it doesn´t even gets a closure. When the stage play that they built for half the show is about to happen, a space invasion kicks in and the play is cancelled and you never get to see it in the show.The sci-fi portion of it has the actual protagonist being attacked by her alien race, seemingly for being suspected of being a traitor, and she and her friend keeps taking down everyone that goes after them, even when there are more than one. How can a single ship take down a whole fleet, and later on a whole army? Well, you better believe it because it happens.And it doesn’t stop there. Everything regarding this part of the show is horribly written and it doesn’t even connect with the main story. Unfortunately, to explain this, we have to step into spoiler territory.-The protagonist is suspected of being a traitor because of an accident, which turns out to be something made deliberately by her superiors just to see what effect would have on their race. Imagine killing lots of your own species just for that, and without any anticipation, it is just revealed when the show is close to being over.-The all-female alien race can create more of their own, but still came to Earth just to investigate about men. Nonsensical writing, they essentially are here just because it’s the setting that the writer wanted them to be. You never even get to see them around men at any point because there are barely any in this show.-There is a teacher who is actually a secret agent spying on the amnesiac main character, she is found out by the latter for speaking about it out loud, on phone, in the school. Aside from the dumb writing, the show tries to build drama around them with this but this is the only episode that dedicates them some shared screen time and dynamic, their relationship goes back to normal by the end of it and their interactions are as brief and hollow as they were before.-Characters suspect that the main girl has some kind of psychic powers, it is never explained properly and it ends up not playing a single part in the plot.-The protagonist captures an enemy and lets her roam around her ship however she feels like it, never suspecting that she might be an infiltrator. Guess what happens.-Knowing that her prisoner of war resents both her and the main girl, she still takes the latter to her ship, gets the two of them to know each other, and even sends them together to the same room inside the ship. Guess what happens.-The spaceship has some level of conscience, yet never tells them what this infiltrator is doing.-At one point the plot or characters progress because of the spirit of a dead character briefly appearing to tell the protagonist to let go, that it wasn’t her fault.-Fights keep happening between the aliens but no one notices them, not even the spy teacher reports them. This spaceships even fly through the city at some point and people act as if they were planes. And yet, by the last episode, lots of human armies appear out of thin air to fight against them, only to, obviously, get stomped with ease.-The outcome somehow leads into the very first scene of the show in the future, but it happens out of screen and after a huge time skip, it feels that it came out of nowhere and that it shouldn’t unfold the way it does.-The protagonist never explains to the main character that she never actually intentionally killed her family nor destroyed the island she used to live in, all she does is apologizing while crying.-What is the response of the other girl? A slap, but not for what she thinks she did, the expected confession, and a kiss, with even a shared line of dialogue in unison. Aside from being corny as hell, we the audience at that point know that the other girl wasn’t really responsible for that, but since she doesn’t explain it to the main girl, the latter is still from this point on, and for a very short time, going out with the person that, as far as she knows, killed her whole family and destroyed every place she used to know about.-The protagonist never explained nor even apologized to the main character for strangling her in their first interaction, yet they are girlfriends by the last episodes.-Her underling, that wanted her Commander to go back to the spaceship the whole time, decides that her being part of the stage play for the school is more important than preventing the invasion on Earth.SPOILERS END HEREAnd these are just the instances of horrible writing I remember off my memory at the moment of writing this, imagine how many more I could write about if I were to do a quick rewatch of sorts.As for the characters, as you can tell by me never naming them, these are the things that I remember about them as well, characters, besides their roles as plot devices in the show:-The main character, she is amnesiac, the plot somehow seemingly revolves around her, but she takes no part in it. At least she is willing to throw some punches when she needs to, I’ll give her that.-The actual protagonist, she is unexpectedly a prankster.-The infiltrator, she is resentful for having lost her ex-girlfriend, ends up becoming an ally once she finds out the truth.-The teacher, she sucks at both of her jobs and ends up having no part in the plot nor any meaningful dynamic with any other character.-Tall fat girl, her older sister has two babies.-Cool girl, is the daughter of the school principal.-Glasses girl, always liked fairy tales when she was a child, after a lot of drama she ends up writing the stage play that is never shown.-The antagonists, they exist, they are cannon fodder and their reasoning is completely forced by the script with no explanation or logic whatsoever.I can’t even say that the visuals are good even with three main studios working on this show. I’m sure they were innovating by 2007 standards, but by now they come off as, at best, painfully average and dated. The character designs are simple, generic and forgettable, the artwork is very inconsistent, the motions aren’t very good, the special effects and the backgrounds are not bad actually, but both are filled with very dated and crappy CGI made by Gonzo, a trademark of the studio for a while.So in the end, Blue Drops ends up being a sci-fi show about an alien invasion that doesn’t go anywhere for most of its screen time, and with a single ship defeating a whole army, with absolutely no reasoning nor logic to unfold the way it does, and with one of the most illogical writing I have ever seen. It is also an empty slice of life series with no fleshed out, memorable nor likeable characters whatsoever, and it never manages to connect its parts together. It is also another nonsensical and quite toxic anime about lesbians, and even a visually very dated show.But I still have two positive things to say about it. One is that it has a good sound department, very impactful and very well mixed sound effects both during battles and during slice of life moments, and also, very good soundtrack, even a very good opening, which sounds almost elegiac, too bad it ended up in this anime, and a very good ending, although not as good as the opening. Check out the full versions of both, because they are even better. The voice acting is not the typical voice acting I expected, but it is still not that special and not on par with the rest.The other is having a very important death in it, which remains permanent, the character that dies isn’t magically brought back to life.And even these two things are still only semi positives, since the volume in this anime randomly goes up and down for no reason, and that ends up being a bit annoying, and a character staying dead should be the norm anyways, and even then it’s weird because you wouldn’t expect this character to die throughout the whole show, it kind of happens to end in a dramatic way, in an attempt to finish with a somewhat bittersweet ending, and as far as I’m concerned it failed because I never cared for the character, and the scene afterwards has a comedic tone to it, ruining its impact.It is far from the worst anime I watched in my life, and is not the worst nor most toxic, nor my most hated Shoujo Ai anime I watched, since I consumed both Kannazuki no Miko and NTR: Netsuzou TRap, but it is still a very terrible anime and one of the worst written anime I have watched in my life. Aside from listening to the very good soundtrack, I think that the best thing that can be done with this anime, is to stay the fuck away from it. with another girl who strangles her at first contact, and is found out to be an alien from an all-female race that wants to investigate Earth for plot reasons. It immediately tells you that the main character has no backdrop, or that it remains a mystery throughout most of the show, and based on the very typical setup and setting, you just know these girls will end up as the main couple of the show.Even though it combines slice of life and sci-fi action like Figure 17, the last show I covered before this one, Blue Drop really doesn’t focus on any of them, or at least, not in a way that feels well written, it’s even hard to tell what part is prioritized in it, because, really, it’s none.

The voice acting is not the typical voice acting I expected, but it is still not that special and not on par with the rest.The other is having a very important death in it, which remains permanent, the character that dies isn’t magically brought back to life.And even these two things are still only semi positives, since the volume in this anime randomly goes up and down for no reason, and that ends up being a bit annoying, and a character staying dead should be the norm anyways, and even then it’s weird because you wouldn’t expect this character to die throughout the whole show, it kind of happens to end in a dramatic way, in an attempt to finish with a somewhat bittersweet ending, and as far as I’m concerned it failed because I never cared for the character, and the scene afterwards has a comedic tone to it, ruining its impact.It is far from the worst anime I watched in my life, and is not the worst nor most toxic, nor my most hated Shoujo Ai anime I watched, since I consumed both Kannazuki no Miko and NTR: Netsuzou TRap, but it is still a very terrible anime and one of the worst written anime I have watched in my life. Aside from listening to the very good soundtrack, I think that the best thing that can be done with this anime, is to stay the fuck away from it.', ""Hmmmm...To simply put it, they fail to end the series properly.The plot is basically like alien scout for invasion make contact with esper girl and become human's ally. The story goes on and end with a cliche plot where the scout alien ended up protecting the human and died on the final suicide attack. Since the main plot is broad where the alien invade earth so the scale of the story are huge so it's unable to fit within 13 episode so you can only see like the prologue for the series.Frankly the reason why I start to watch this series is for the Girls...Love tag, but ended up with disappointment. There is not that much of flirting going on, it feels like more than a friend less than a lover kind of thing. Also it end with the tragic love, where the other partner died while the other one continue living while remembering her dead partner. It's not a complete ship.

Cheer Danshi!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32483/Cheer_Danshi,"[""I first wrote this off as a generic sports type show but soon came to regret it much later as I enjoyed watching it a lot more than most anime this season.The main appeal is the way the characters have to push through so many hardships to reach their near impossible goal of creating an all male cheer leading team. This creates an emotional story of overcoming embarrassment, fear, trust and physical boundary's which may prevent them from fulfilling their goal.It's  the only anime I've seen to make me cry, laugh and simultaneously want  to do a handstand in the same episode proving...just how brilliant it is: normally it's impossible to motivate me to do exercise. The show'scomedy is excellent and hits every time when it wants too. On top of this the character interactions are funny and sincere with great performances all round.Whats also interesting is that their cheer leading team - the breakers - is based off of a real life male cheer leading team, adding to the interest of the show as its cool to think that some of these events may have actually happened in real life (though I'm sure a lot of them are made up).Even though this anime doesn't have a brilliant sound track or a memorable cast of characters theirs enough going on to make it enjoyable and heartwarming enough to work well. It can  almost be inspiring if you like the characters enough.I would consider this a must watch for fans of the sports genre and a refreshing show for anyone who is just bored and needs a good time filler. just how brilliant it is: normally it's impossible to motivate me to do exercise.

Not unheard of but this show is the definition of male empowerment! I believe no activity should be restricted to a certain gender with this show being the beginning of countless opportunities. This a series that has the sport cheerleading under the spotlight as we follow the lives of two former judo participants who embark in this new challenge.The main character for this show is undoubtedly Bandou Haruki, who is a college student that has the...background of being from a prestigious judo family. This is evident in the fact that his father runs a dojo/gym in their name and that his older sister Haruko has won countless titles throughout her career. He then makes the decision to abandon the sport after suffering a severe right shoulder injury preventing him from participating. His best friend Hashimoto Kazuma follows suit in his decision as they do everything together since childhood. After this life decision, they immediately pursue cheerleading for a fresh start by trying to recruit members to start a college club, which would later lead to the formation of the Breakers. Initially they were ridiculed for even trying but our two main characters never struggled and persevered dutifully by researching the basics and applying it in front of campus. This caught the eye of a certain few which led to them joining and a chain reaction ensued since then with more volunteering to join.Now one thing that needs to be disclosed is the ridiculous pacing which is apparent when a recap is inserted 5 episodes into the broadcast. The first episodes mainly focus around 6 characters who are the initial core of the group with them being the founders. Mostly everyone is inexperienced to some degree which is shown when every member undergoes a brutal training process just to be fit performance wise. This implies that they should be naturally strong and have a good sense of balance. Mizoguchi and Toono who are one of the earliest to join struggle with this aspect, due to the fact their bodies aren’t equipped for the sport.Haruki and Kazuma are not subject to this because they are already in good shape from their time doing judo but still encounter problems in the process. Tokugawa Shou, who is an important character later on is adamant on not joining until the group can get on his level, which is the purpose for these episodes. The group weren’t called the Breakers until afterwards when the numbers reached to around 15. As more people joined, the same process of training had to be applied for everyone to be in sync. If they had the time to make a recap episode, then surely they could’ve accommodated another episode to deal with every member settling in to the new organisation.The characters are numerous but there is just no reason to talk about everyone, so I’ll narrow it down to the three most significant characters with them being Haruki, Kazuma and Shou. Haruki is an individual who has defected judo once he realises he cannot keep up with the strenuous workload. His shoulder injury he sustained from a grappling move has somehow led to him having a fear of heights. Yes, this is the man who fell from less than 2 metres at best has resulted in this joke of a character. This is totally unnecessary when he hangs out on his apartment’s rooftop just to socialise and is a base for further cheerleading training. It is also known that he sees his older sister Haruko with an inferiority complex despite the fact that he is a fervent supporter of her when she performs in matches. The irony being is that being the physically stronger sex doesn’t always guarantee success which is the case for our unfortunate young man. It’s not like she doesn’t have her fair share of problems…Kazuma on the other hand is just as talented as Haruki and even exceeds him in some aspects as being a better well rounded character. Kazuma is the focal point of the Breaker’s group when he is assigned the position of captain due to being a very vocal and earnest person at heart. The man is the superglue who resolves disputes that may occur and is the regulator to preventing any infighting. As stated earlier, Kazuma is a childhood friend of Haruki which has given him the status of almost being a family member in the Bandou household. I should rephrase that; he is treated to being the equivalent of a family member which just shows you how far their friendship has come. The reason for him choosing cheerleading is simple, as both his parents were active cheerleaders in their youths but even that does not explain the sadness that lingers in his mind.Finally, we have Tokugawa Shou who has the most difficult circumstances among the main cast. At first he was rejecting every proposal for him to join when it is known he is terrific at gymnastics. Once he is impressed with the setup and general abilities of the group, he is convinced in the direction the Breakers are heading and sort of acts as a player-coach because he is the most valued and experienced of the lot. Things change when they recruit Satsuki Takashiro to supervise their progress, only for it to not go down well with Shou who has a complicated relationship with her, which is later explained in his backstory. Despite this, he is still a team player and is ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the team. Even with less screen time, I find him to be a far more intriguing character compared to Haruki who comes off as one note at times.The art style and animation is certainly subpar compared to the norm that is produced nowadays. Brains Base have had some spectacular looking shows in the past such as Baccano! And Mawaru Penguindrum only to find themselves with Endride and Cheer Danshi this year. You don’t have to be an expert to say this is reminiscent to what Studio Deen had to go through but they are making a solid comeback. The character designs are somewhat basic but are peculiar at the same time, I could never get tired at looking at the same faces. Since this is basically a sausage-fest, this should be well received by the ladies who this time have good looking characters for once! The animation is just below average as there are too many instances of poorly drawn scenes when it’s not related to cheerleading. If only the whole show could be drawn like the opening segment, then that would make me a happy man.The sound is slightly better as there are moments where I was solely focused on the tune that played in the background over the other content. The OST has not been released for me to identify that part of the soundtrack but is usually always played at the end and gets me every time in the upcoming previews. Once again, with a cast so large you will expect top seiyuu to perform their characters with the likes of Okamoto Nobuhiko playing Kazuma perfectly. Another thing to note is that the seiyuu for Haruki who is Yonai Yuki, is completely new to me did a splendid job as he hasn’t worked on many shows.If you’re looking for a sports anime, then look elsewhere as this is a show that may feel underwhelming in many aspects. Sure the competitive drive is there but I feel this is more of a drama-oriented show personally. It’s lacking in production values but won’t necessarily stop you from enjoying it. background of being from a prestigious judo family.

It’s lacking in production values but won’t necessarily stop you from enjoying it.', ""There are only 5 episodes out so far, so this is going to be based on first impressions and my thoughts so far.Story:Even though sports animes is popular nowadays, this is a very original anime. It's about 2 boys who used to train Judo, but decided to try something new. You guessed it, Cheerleading. Every episode has a main focus, so the episodes can skip sometimes, but not so that you have no idea what's going on. It's very sweet and we see them develop from being at the bottom to slowly getting better. What's also good is that there is not that much focus...on romance, the main character has a crush, but it doesn't ruin the story at all.Art:I think the art is really good. It's beautiful, smooth, and the characters look realistic. They are also all unique, so it's easy to tell them apart. I noticed in their first performance that they changed the art so that it almost looked like a music video, which I think is really cool. You can also see the tumbling they do very well.Sound:The opening and ending songs are very catchy and sweet, fits the theme for this anime perfectly. The soundtracks are good as well, there is nothing to complain about.Character:Probably the best thing about this anime. The characters are all unique with different personalities and looks. You will for sure find 1, 2, 3, everyone, you'll like, haha. There is also a lot of characters. Not everyone has showed up yet, but I'm pretty sure they'll make as good introductions for everyone as they did with the characters that have showed up so far.Enjoyment:This is a solid 10. I really enjoy this so far, I am literally counting down days for the next episode. I can't wait to watch this anime grow into something amazing.Overall:A 9 overall, because this anime so far is;-Enjoyable-Good plot-Great characters-And Saku showed up for like 30 seconds in the end of episode 5;; (He is probably my favourite character so I can't wait to be introduced to him in the next episode!)This is definitely a must watch for sports anime/Cheerleader lovers who enjoy a lot of good characters and sweet plot. on romance, the main character has a crush, but it doesn't ruin the story at all.Art:I think the art is really good.

LET'S GOO BREAKERS!!!!!I'm going to remember this quote forever.Cheer danshi is clearly the most underrated anime of the summer 2016 season or possibly the entire year which I don't get it.KEY: Break being what the characters need to accept about themselves or overcome any difficultyStory: The story of the show.... Well there isn't any... The true story of the show is within the characters. The characters backstory is the true story of the show where we just want to get up and cheer for those boys that they need to break whatever they need to break in this cheer club.Characters:...When you look at the opening of the song. I bet you one question... How is the series gonna fit all 16 characters into the series. Well to sum up your answer They were introduce indirectly in episode 5 and in episode 5.5, yes the recap episode was not a full recap episode. It was only a recap for the first 19 mins. While the last 3 mins being ending credits and Haru explaining after their debut new members just keep coming in none stop hence in episode 6 we get to see the other 7 characters introduces into the series. That is a smart way in term of progression. Let's take something useless and make it into a plot driven episode.Each characters have enough screen time that we just want to cheer for them. I say the characters that have the least amount of screen time is chen (Chinese dude) but since his basic purpose in the group is to improve on his Japanese. So... we don't need a lot of screen time with him. Each characters have enough character development. Like, Haru being overcoming his fear of heights and growing some balls in this cheerleading team. Ton learn to overcome his self doubts, Mizoguchi learning to use his own words and not use famous quotation,Kazu to make people smile he needs to first smile on the inside and out. Sho able to move forward in life and become their base in the cheerleading team. Gen learn to stop comparing to Ichiro and just compare to his past selves. Ichiro learn to stop showing off. Hissahi learn that people are different from him his reason to cheer is different from one another. Sakuma always think that having a small body is a problem in life as he isn't that strong but thanks to his small body he is able to a flyer. Takumi, Gen and Doh learn to be independent as their big brother is gonna leave the team. Kin though being a man must be a bad boy and cause trouble. I already talk about Chen as his basic purpose is to improve on his Japanese his getting there as he used some hard Japanese words as his confronting Domino. Takuya being a worry puss on his younger brother learn to stop worry about him as spoil him is spoiling himself. Takeru learn that to have patience and guts to actually become a real man as he is scared when the flyer fall and he isn't able to catch them on time but the flyer are even more scared as the base didn't catch them on time. But we all can thank one person the coach. Thanks to her those boys are able to grow so much.Now when you look at it all the problem that the characters faces are all relatable. Even Haruko (Haru sister) aslo need to understand and able to break and accept that her brother doesn't want to do judo anymore.  From Haru's fear of heights to Kin though that being a man must be a bad boy, We all relate to those boysArt and animation: A lot of people did complain about being dull and the colors aren't that bright but personally it works as they used 1 thing that no other anime uses DUST. There's dust in the air, When I watch other anime I always wonder how the hell they can fire a beam of light straight without dust interrupting. The show also got an addition bonus to the characters design as they look like real human beings where they look like us. So we can't really say characters face are of model as we make some weird ass faces before in our life.OP, ED and OST: The OP (opening song) is literally OP (over-powerful) as the characters start something new into their life as well as changing their lives one by one. Also the song is sung by luck life which also bring me to bungou stray dogs ed. Which I also love. The OST is THE OST is amazing just want me to get up and cheer for those boys. I need it... right now... The ed... is well.. cute. IS THE BREAKERS DURING A MINI PERFORMANCES... ISN'T IT CUTE?!Enjoyment: I'm glad they decided to stick on the basics of what is cheerleading and what is a cheerleader, some moves so the characters are able to shine brighter than the sun. Unlike another sports anime that I'm gonna review next. *cough* *cough* yuri on ice *cough* *cough*.Recommendation: Simply put watch it. Cheer danshi is the show that is able to make me laugh, smile, cry and feels as I watch my boys overcome their difficulties in this male cheerleading squad. A lot of people are actually disappointed with the ending as we didn't get to see the full performances and they didn't mention a winner but when you think about it does it matter... I mean since when cheerleading is about winning or losing?? Cheerleading is suppose to support people, motivate them and make them smile. That is the role of a cheerleader. Now for the full performances part it would make sense to place some past animated scene to see how much those boys grew both as an individual and as a group in this cheerleading team. Also, don't you guys want to know what is in their notebook?? It has been killing me what is in those notebook.Other recommendation include the obvious pretty boys show free!! and not a sports anime... in-fact is about music to save their school love live with the same perspective of characters breaking and accepting what they need to accept about themselves.So overall 9.6/10. Now you why not a staright 10/10?? simple, Haru x chihiro didn't happen. WHY!!! TON WHY!!! POOR HARU When you look at the opening of the song. I bet you one question...

POOR HARU"", 'Cheer Danshi is a sports series unlike many in that the focus is not on characters whose reason to live is the sport itself, but rather tells the story of some dudes in college looking to have a great time doing an activity which for most of them has no deeper meaning than ""I just wanted to try it"", a fact that in my opinion is a plus, as it is closer to the real life circumstances of non professional sports clubs. Having said that, all the members have a real passion for improving and give cheerleading their all.All characters are fine or even great,...very human with their own issues, which thankfully do not get dragged on, as every chapter they  improve a little.A deep problem of this series is the animation, the way the camera moves to evade showing scenes that would have lots of movement is very noticeable, specially in the cheerleading presentations themselves.Not for everyone, give it a try if non standard series interest you. very human with their own issues, which thankfully do not get dragged on, as every chapter they  improve a little.A deep problem of this series is the animation, the way the camera moves to evade showing scenes that would have lots of movement is very noticeable, specially in the cheerleading presentations themselves.Not for everyone, give it a try if non standard series interest you.', 'I honestly thought when I first heard about this that it would be some sports anime to drag in the fujioshi/fundanshi community, but I was completely mistaken.This show had meaningful relationships and teamwork without it being a ""anything is possible with friendship"" stereotype. I also loved how they didn\'t discriminate with the cheer leading club and didn\'t make all the men tall and muscular. All the characters had their own details and backstories so no one was just some filler background character.The main reason this show dragged me into watching it was when I saw clips of the intro, I\'ve never seen...dancing or performances in anime that weren\'t 3d, since it\'s always easier to animate those scenes. But all the performances were frame by frame, which somehow made it much more appealing to look at and looked quite smooth!One heartwarming thing is how the show represents the moral of the story. You learn in the show that the cheer leading team\'s name is called ""The Breakers"". They all decided to name their team this because they all wanted to show people that they are ""breaking"" the stereotype that you need women in a cheer leading group to be successful. But another meaning to the name is that they were all trying to ""break"" through their own personal insecurities by expressing themselves through cheer leading. I absolutely loved the show even more than I already did only because of this one small but significant detail.Overall an amazing and heartwarming show, I would absolutely love a season two! dancing or performances in anime that weren\'t 3d, since it\'s always easier to animate those scenes.

It has a cool premise and a catchy ED, but that\'s where, for me, the enjoyment ends- Cheer!! suffers from a spectrum of other problems, varying from bad pacing to an over-inflated cast to blatant bl-lovers\' fanservice.Story: 6/10The story isn\'t that bad. Cheer!! doesn\'t have a lot of substance, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing for a light slice-of-life sports anime. The storyline is pretty basic...sports anime- a bunch of kids join (or in this case, form) a team for X Sport, aim to win nationals/semifinals/other large X Sport event, and develop meaningful relationships.In this respect, Cheer!! has a decent stand. Haru has an alright backstory, the issue of why an injury that would keep him from doing judo competitively ever again doesn\'t matter when he\'s being flung in the air by a tower of ten other people aside, and the only thing that sucks in the story is the pacing of the character introductions, which I\'ll get into in the character section.Art: 7/10The art is decent. Nothing that anyone would watch the show specifically for, but nothing that would really put you off, either. It feels kind of choppy or plain sometimes, but Bandai Visual isn\'t KyoAni.Sound: 8/10Voice acting and music is decent. It gets an extra point for the catchy ED.Characters: 4/10This, in my opinion, is the biggest issue with Cheer!!.I can\'t remember any of the fucking characters.Aside from the first few who were introduced- Kazu, Haru, Ton, Mizo, and Shou- most of the characters had absolutely no introduction whatsoever. I came back from the recap episode and- bam! timeskip. Suddenly, there were fifteen more guys with unique haircuts in the gym with no introduction. What the fuck? They proceeded to pair up into convenient shipping couples in the span of three episodes. I understand that introducing such a huge cast AND developing a plot in 12 short episodes is difficult, but really, the only way I remember any of the characters is by either their physical description or which other character they were supposed to be shipped with. And I didn\'t really care about any of the main characters- Haru, Kazu, Mizo, Ton, and Sho- either, despite the fact that the writers could have easily developed them deeply if they had cut one or two goddamn gay-bait scenes. (Mizo is the exception. I\'m fond of him because I have a weakness for the megane trope, which is a personal preference and does not affect the fact that he was badly developed.)Another thing that really irked me was the tone of the anime, which can be best represented by one scene I remember from about halfway through the anime. The main six or seven characters were on the roof, practicing, and nothing was going well- at some point, it devolved into them shouting about their problems, complaining about how the issues they faced were worse than anyone else\'s. When Haru- the main- was the only one who hadn\'t spoken, he opened his mouth.At this point, you would expect a rousing speech of leadership, right? Haru is our mc, the ""average joe"" dragged into the world of men\'s cheerleading by his overly positive best friend\'s story about his dead parents. He should say something about how all their struggles are important, but they should always get back up. That kind of emotional validation is what I\'m watching slice-of-life shows for, goddamnit. Instead, he screams and bitches about how nobody around him understands how difficult /his/ life is, and why /his/ problems are so much worse than anyone else\'s. I almost dropped the show at this point, honestly.I also disliked that the only female characters were a) Haru\'s sister, a judo prodigy who apparently can\'t win a single goddamn judo match unless her brother is there to cheer, b) a ""cutesy"" love interest for Haru who the writers cleverly eliminate by making her turn out to be Ton\'s elusive gf so they can continue with their fujoshi-baiting, and c) the hardass coach stereotype. Oh, and all the other cheerleading teams, who are never mentioned or shown for more than a minute. At one point, I\'m pretty sure the show almost explicitly stated that boys were naturally better than girls at sports.Enjoyment: 4/10I like gay shipping, but I\'m not into fujoshi bait, and I didn\'t really care about any of the characters.Overall: 5/10Not a great show. Cheer!! doesn\'t bother to hide its fanservice, and, imo, doesn\'t live up to any of the hype that\'s been surrounding it as a ""fresh, new sports anime"". I finished the show out of a sense of obligation, and will probably never rewatch it. sports anime- a bunch of kids join (or in this case, form) a team for X Sport, aim to win nationals/semifinals/other large X Sport event, and develop meaningful relationships.In this respect, Cheer!! has a decent stand.

Buuuuut, it doesn't. Although the anime's proposal was cheerleaders, the focus is different. But calm down, I also have positive reviews.I believe that the strength point of this anime was the development of the characters. Seriously, each of the 16 members has a well-built personality! Not to mention that everyone has a very diverse appearance (a chinese, a chubby, delinquent, effeminate, with afro hair... anyway). And in those 12 episodes alone, they were better developed than many famous...animes. This made me very happy. Are some a little generic? Yes. But not all. I confess that I felt a little angry at Haru, excessive shyness irritates me. He couldn't even speak to his own sister, that sucks. So I prefer to think that Kazu is the real protagonist. As soon as I finished watching, there was a slight squeeze in my heart, because I will miss them.The art is relatively simple, but pretty.

But I already tell you that you too will be surprised.About the end, it was great and at the same time terrible. Great because all the members had their screen time. Terrible because during all that time they were training like convicts, but they did not show anything exceptional during the presentation.

Which I feel it isn't. Now don't get me wrong, I do like the anime - it just didn't strike the same cord with me that shows such as Free! or Haikyuu!! did for example.First thing's first - I'll go over what I enjoy about the show first:- It is an insanely pretty show but that's to be expected from the gloss kings...themselves: Brain's Base. The animation is very nice, I will give it that. It's colourful, it's eye-catching and energetic which really fits the tone of the show and is used to its advantaged. Brain's Base know how to make shows look nice and Cheer Danshi looks amazing- Secondly the voice cast is really good - I'll give particularly props to Okamoto Nobuhiko who does an excellent job as Kazuma (honestly what is it with this guy and playing excited sports fanatics). The rest of the cast do an excellent job in giving their respective characters the voices that look as though they would fit but it doesn't quite save the characters - but I'll come back to that later.- Finally the story is not that half bad, it's nothing ground breaking other than it's about an all male cheerleading squad. The whole 'characters must come together to create a team and overcome obstacles which may come their way' has been done loads of times before. But I can forgive it because it's hard to do any other way and to be perfectly honest, it is done well. You can get wrapped up in the concept and that's perfectly passable.Now onto the less enjoyable bit - where does the series fall flat?- I said before that I liked the voice actors but it didn't save the characters and what I mean by this is that I feel like the characters are not defined enough. This is going to be a show with a large cast, you can see it in the opening, but I have a hard time remembering the characters names besides Haru, Kazuma and Ton. That's not good for a show with lots of characters - you need your characters to stand out but for some reason the characters in Cheer Danshi all seem to fold together with the exception of - like I said before - Haru, Kazuma and Ton. But that's just who I remember. I understand that it's still the beginning and there's time for the characters to progress and gain their own identities - as such I will wait and see.- The pacing of the show feels a little rushed which is leading me to believe that it will be a 1 cours series with only 12/13 episodes - and that's not good. Unless it gets a second season, I feel like the show will end up being horribly rushed and not enough expanded on. Sometimes a fast pace can be good but when you have to introduce characters gradually, then it can be a downfall. Again I do understand that it is still the beginning of the series and it's yet to be announced how many episodes the series will have but it's just a guess. Perhaps the pacing issues will be resolved later but right now events all seem to collide and it pushes the pacing along at too fast a rate. Hopefully it will be a 2 cours show with 25/26 episodes or multiple seasons because fast pacing can be excused.Over all, I do like the show. It might seem like I don't but I feel like there are flaws with it. I don't think it's really anything new or groundbreaking but it's a nice change from other sports series that don't rely on off the wall plot twists (Kuroko, I'm looking at you). I won't say it's got quite the heart that Haikyuu has or the character likeability that Free has - but there is still time and perhaps my opinion will change.And to that I say - we have to wait and see! themselves: Brain's Base.

Originality: 8Personally, I consider that any sports anime that moves away from the overexploited baseball, basketball and soccer already acquires a higher level of originality.However, the idea that the show tries to capture (to recognize cheerleading as a current sport) is something that I consider quite new. That, and the fact that cheerleading is not really a sport for men normally.That\'s why, although the story is inspired by a team of cheerleaders of real life, I can\'t...help feeling that Cheer Danshi!! is a sports anime with one of the most original plots that I have seen in this genre in a while. However, of course some things in its development look somewhat generic, so I can\'t allow a 10.2. Story Development: 8Although it seems impossible to develop a good sports anime in 12 episodes, Cheer Danshi!! is the exception.Fortunately, this is an anime that could be said to have almost no filler. Each episode, although it may seem a filler episode at the beginning, ends up showing how important it is in the main plot and in the development of its characters. In addition, I have to rescue how all sixteen members of Breakers receive development or, at least, a background story that allows us to empathize with them and keeps them away from being simple extras.3. Characters: 9Its diverse cast, and the different points of view on why to be in the group, makes you get interested in the characters both inside and outside the training for the routines.If there is something that managed to get my attention as the episodes progressed, it\'s how the new personalities that were adhered to the team affected it as a whole both positively and negatively. Although at the beginning our seven original members may seem a bit simple, we can recognize their peculiarities later when we meet the other nine members and their varied personalities.4. Enjoyment: 10Although it\'s a little obvious at this point, I think it\'s worth emphasizing again that I really enjoyed this show in its entirety.If there is something to highlight about this show as the ""most enjoyable thing"" that it has, it has to be the characters and their development not only as a team but as people. Obviously, watching them strive to follow their new dream is exciting, but it\'s even more so to see them strive to improve in their personal lives.–I decided to watch Cheer Danshi!! thinking it would be bad, and that I could laugh at it.

This series had a lot of potential featuring an all-male cheerleading team, however, it failed to deliver the character development, animation, or plot other sports animes had successfully done.Unlike most other sport animes, they didn\'t have any memorable characters, everyone is acting in a melodramatic way, the animation was below average... which is a big red flag for sport anime which depend a lot of action. Most importantly: there was no tension or competition...Forgettable CharacterThe characters were unmemorable and cardboard. I can\'t remember any of them other than Haru, Kazu, and Sho,...who have a bit of back story going on. Most characters are defined with one characteristic, that is displayed over the top in an unrealistic manner, some characters\' only unique characteristics were their accent, some were completely forgotten after 2 episodes. Even the more developed characters were two-dimensional, Sho, for example, was defined by only three traits: 1) his love for a squirrel character - Nishijirou, 2) having experience cheerleading, and 3) being stoic, reserved and serious. Unfortunately, his three traits not only didn\'t work together, they worked against each other. It seems like the producers thought it would make him less boring to have a ""silly"" side with his obsession over a squirrel but it just left me wondering why is an adult man being so obsessed with a product mascot.

The way they make you want to get up dedicate your life to something as you\'re watching them (at least the really good ones do). ""Cheer Danshi!!"" does that. As I was watching it, I really found myself wanting to do EVERYTHING they were doing. I thought, ""man, I want to learn how to do a handstand! I want to cartwheel!"" I even felt like wanting to do planks!--which they do in order to gain that core strength they need for tumbling around everywhere and holding people up. Speaking of tumbling, that\'s probably the only thing I...did NOT want to do because I knew I could never. Lol.Aside from making me want to do stuff, this show is h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s. Like, laugh out loud hilarious. But wait. I have a confession.I watched it English dubbed. (Gasp!)So I can\'t speak for the original Japanese version of it. But about the way the English dialogue is written I\'m 100% sure that the translations are not direct translations. They\'re very localized, and I say this because I\'m pretty sure that Wataru didn\'t actually say that he has ""white boy rhythm"" in the Japanese dub (he really said that in the English version and I about cried laughing because of it). So, I think the localization worked in this anime\'s favor because it wouldn\'t have been anywhere near as funny as I had found it to be in English. With that being said, I recommend it be watched in English if you don\'t speak Japanese and English is your native language.So humor is possibly its biggest strength. What follows would be the characters which really drive the story. The characters are very strong and distinct and I enjoyed seeing how they interacted with each other, how they had to work together as a team, and how they had to overcome their own obstacles. Each character had at least one sole obstacle they had to overcome. Unfortunately, this anime is overall very rushed, which really killed the character score. The reason is because all of a sudden, like a dozen characters popped up at once and I found myself completely overwhelmed. I\'m sorry, but that is NEVER an okay thing to do--at least not in my book. No one appreciates it when you shove a million characters into the story all at once; it\'s confusing. It really started to feel disjointed once that happened, and I had trouble connecting with any of the newbies. halfway through, it just gets really messy which sucks because of how much I enjoyed the first half. I honestly wish they would\'ve tried to split it into two seasons. I\'m sure that would\'ve have been better for the anime.In all, it\'s a very enjoyable show that really rushed its way through at the end, but it was still enjoyable, it made me feel good, and it gave me lots of laughs. did NOT want to do because I knew I could never.

Since the description is up below, but if you plan on watching this, you're in for a unique, laid-back, and overeall very enjoyable sports anime.Cheer Danshi!! deals with two best friends, Haru -- an ex-judo sports guy, and Kazu -- a happy-go-luck young man. They are both attending university, with Kazu offering the idea to start up an all-male cheerleader club after being inspired by old recordings of his deceased parents, who used to be teammates on a cheerleader group. From there on, the two friends search for more of the university students to join them in...order to form up a team big enough to compete. As the story unfolds, Kazu reaches his goal and Haru learns to overcome the hardships that stopped him from feeling more free and doing the things that he love.Cheer Danshi!! has all the same characateristics of most sports anime -- team consisted of many different perosnalities with a few shining more than the others, hot guys, really dramatic practices and so on. Regardless, the anime is mostly noble, in my opinion, for presenting sports as something fun that they would be doing for the sake of their enjoyment and friendship. The BREAKERS practice to compete and win, though Kazu's initial decision come from creating a place for him and his friend to feel at home. Most members of the team are new to the scene of cheerleading, because they're there to have fun.The story isn't very intriguing, but should be emotional at some points. Haru and Kazu are very relateable and loveable as well, being the main characters of the show. I recommend this piece to people who aren't all about the sports in anime, but in for a new experience that they most likely have not experienced before.The art is great, music is very nice and up-beat.

There’s no emphasis on competition, the characters lack any serious emotional bonds with one another, and any development made is crudely washed over with trivial filler.While the series looks promising at the beginning, it loses it’s way once millions of other characters are introduced. May as well sever any connections you had with the supporting characters at the beginning, as they are seemingly forgotten about the higher the episode numbers climb. What’s more, due to the lack of competition, you never see the characters struggle and grow through defeat and failure...– a successful, heartbreaking motif used in other sports anime.

However it’s brushed over with family problems, racist jokes, and gendered clichés. The most you’ll see of anything resembling a choreographed routine comes in the form of the opening.Though there may be sports involved, Cheer Danshi is not really a sports anime; on the other hand it also lacks any serious emotion to call it a good slice of life anime, either.

This is my first time Writing a review about an anime so please read it till the end and bare with me.This anime i did see its name when it aired in july 2016 but for some reasons like for first thing the name of the anime i find it a little weird when i checked the synopsis it was even weird from normal sports genre anime there are many popular titles but nothing with cheer-leading and that too it revolves around a male cheer-leading  club it is kind of weird right??I think that too but that’s where i was this...anime is really good and has some best way to encourage you to exercise.This anime really is one of kind because there are not many anime with cheer-leading  Noo!!! actually there none at all . The character development goes slow and sturdy which build up a good relation with the character.  The show’s comedy is excellent and with the good range of characters.At first they have lass members in the club but soon they started getting a lot of members. Each character added has something special for the team .  I found out something too this anime/manga is based on a real life all male cheer-leading team.This anime has a memorable cast of characters theirs enough going on to make it enjoyable and heartwarming enough to work well. It can almost be inspiring if you like the characters enough.Actually i am not a very sportive person but this anime motivate me to try something. anime is really good and has some best way to encourage you to exercise.This anime really is one of kind because there are not many anime with cheer-leading  Noo!!! actually there none at all .

It seemed like it was going to be pretty funny and actually take its character motivations seriously, but the show took a harsh drop after the first few episodes and quickly filled itself with too many characters to care about and watched its promising aspects fade into the background. The production value suffers A LOT as well. It also had the misfortune of coming out in the same year as Yuri on Ice, which does the whole ""men do a traditionally feminine sport in a non-high school setting""...idea about as perfectly as one possibly could.Overall, Cheer Boys had some promise, but just gets boring and jumbled as it goes along. Go watch Yuri on Ice instead. idea about as perfectly as one possibly could.Overall, Cheer Boys had some promise, but just gets boring and jumbled as it goes along. Go watch Yuri on Ice instead.', '(Sorry my poor english, I\'m brazilian) This anime is wonderful. Despite the low grade for me he is very good, the characters are charismatic and the part where Haru and Kazu talk in front of the hospital thrilled me, is beautiful the way Haru sees Kazu, it seems like there\'s something else there , and Haru ends up crying next to Kazu, because it\'s like he takes Kazu\'s pain for himself. At the beginning of the anime it was Haru who needed the confidence and courage to go on, but in the end Haru overcomes it all and then he has to give courage so...that Kazu could go on and not give up on everything. Despite not having a very complex storyline I like the anime proposal and how they make something simple be fun. The soundtrack may not be much, but I like how lively the ending is, showing the mood of the anime well. The anime may have what it usually has in sports anime, start as a weak team and then gain prominence after much training, but ends up having a different proposal, where there is a ""sport"" that is usually done by girls, but they break down barriers being a team of men only,  and even if nobody likes the anime I like it a lot. that Kazu could go on and not give up on everything.

Yes, that means that the motivation for these characters to cheer is different than your standard sports anime, which is always to be the best team in the nation. But it\'s also the way this anime tells its story that makes it so different. I don\'t really know how I feel about this anime after watching it, but I think the conclusion I came to is this: it does well to make you fond of...the characters but isn\'t that great at telling a story.Before getting into all of that, I\'m gonna talk about the animation for a second because it was very obvious where the effort was placed for this anime. The only dance-ish anime I\'ve seen besides this one was Bakuten!! The way that anime handled the constant full-body motions of the characters as they practiced or performed was to make it completely CGI-based; but that anime still had practice scenes to show the characters in motion. Cheer Danshi!! didn\'t do that, and that was a bit disappointing. Their practices turned into a bit of a slideshow, and most of the anime is their practices, so it felt a bit like a cop out. Especially when the animation for the actual performances was so good. The art style itself is nice, but animation was often disappointing.Back to the good stuff. The pacing--and I don\'t even know if pacing is the right word--of this anime was awful. There are definitely story elements to this anime that almost feel like they\'re broken up into baby arcs depending on the character or conflict being focused on. Many of those elements were nice to watch from a slice-of-life or drama anime perspective, but they slowed down the plot so much. Plus, because they were such short stints of story, I kept expecting a longer storyline to pick up afterward to tie the whole season together (in a better way than just ""let\'s keep cheering"" was holding it together). With the lack of a permanent story, this anime was completely hung on its characters, and that\'s what I hung onto as I completed it. If you think of it as a sports anime, that is. Since it\'s so focused on the characters and their conflicts, it actually makes for a decent slice-of-life. It\'s just that the anime made me expect cheering to be the focus of the series, not only the team on its own, which is how it\'s different from a normal sports anime. I actually think it could have made a very interesting and unique format had the pacing been done better.The characters, like I said, weren\'t bad at all. There were probably just as many corny moments that were a bit hard to watch as there were meaningful moments, but by the end of these 12 episodes, I really liked the cheer team. There were a lot of scenes that drug the episodes down that I felt weren\'t necessary to achieve a likeable cast of characters, but this anime did still achieve that. Now, had the team been developed from the beginning instead of the way it was (to avoid spoilers, I\'ll just tell you that the team isn\'t all together for nearly half of the anime) it could have been more successful. These characters had real-world problems that reached into the story, which took up most of the last half of the anime (another reason it\'s unique among sports anime), and those problems worked to build the character relationships over the course of the 12 episodes.I\'m not sure what else to say about Cheer Danshi!! because a lot of it wasn\'t great and the elements that were are difficult to talk about. If you\'re like me and you like watching anime one right after another, this one might make you feel like it\'s dragging on and on without big enough payoffs at important junctures of the story. But if you like doing other things while you watch anime, this pace might suit you. I don\'t think this anime deserves the MAL score it has, but it\'s also just an average anime.

From a technical aspect, the cheers and routines and realities of the cheerleading were completely spot on.For the most part, I loved the characters, but really felt that they could have dug deeper into the characterization.  At least Kazu, Haru, and Shou got some deeper storylines.What really killed the potential for me was the MASSIVE drop in animation/art quality after only a few episodes.  It was so utterly sad.  I...was hoping that at least the last episode would be better, but was disappointed to see that it was not.  Any scene that showed more than a half-view of the characters was so poorly drawn.  My friends watching with me and myself were laughing.It was super cute but could have been so much better. was hoping that at least the last episode would be better, but was disappointed to see that it was not.

My friends watching with me and myself were laughing.It was super cute but could have been so much better.', ""I haven't enjoyed an anime this much recently, and I didn't expect myself to have taken a liking for this one in particular.There is just something about sports animes or just any anime with a plot revolving around the characters building their team and improving their skills that gets me so motivated to learn something new myself, and with that in mind, I decided to give this one a go despite the plain concept--no isekai, no special powers, and no cute girls on the poster (lol).Huge props to the animators for doing the character's forms, which you will be able to see from the...opening in the very beginning (You will grow to appreciate the opening more as you get deeper into the anime.) But since it's a sports anime after all, at times there is a fair bit of drama that sometimes might even seem unnecessary, but at least it doesn't go on for long and tends to be resolved in that particular episode.The anime is about a men's cheerleading club in a university, which starts off only with two members. As they gain more members for the club, issues that didn't exist before begin to arise since there are a lot of them eventually, kicking off the character development that I crave in all animes. And again, as usual, I really enjoyed Cheer Danshi for the friendship and growth alongside learning more about cheerleading in general as I also thought it was just a group of girls dancing with pompoms when in actuality, that's most likely a half-assed version, and the real one requires lots of training, fitness, and patience like any other competitive sports./Something surprising happened in the second last episode that reminded me of a similar scene in Darling in the Franxx, but I wasn't too shocked tbh lol//I wonder how much Pocari Sweat paid the studio for the product placement. opening in the very beginning (You will grow to appreciate the opening more as you get deeper into the anime.)

I have high expectations because I enjoy the first two episode of this anime. However, I found myself cringe at almost scene and just skip it. Aside from the first two episode, I enjoy the last two episode of the anime. The story was fast-paced and they skip a lot of details.The characters were interesting enough but the story didn't give us deeper individuality of the members but instead it only focuses 3-4 characters.It was painfully obvious that they don't have enough budget in making this anime.

It seems to view itself as a sports anime, but I find it more comparable to a performance/idol anime, such as LoveLive, because most of it seems to revolve around training and bonding instead of competition. So Cheer Danshi!! lacks the intensity of a sports anime, and instead focuses on the buildup before a final performance seen in many group idol anime.The story starts out pretty original and ends pretty well. The story premise is original and quickly grabs the attention of the viewer, however,...the main problem is that the middle episodes are lackluster, as it feels that many opportunities to have something interesting happen are missed. The buildup is generic, and has been seen before in other anime, as they train, gain new members, struggle with conflict within the team, and resolve the conflict ending in stronger bonds. Although with an average buildup, the anime finished off with a great ending that gave a clear understanding of what this team meant for the characters.The art is decent but standard, it doesnt portray a unique style but its comfortable on the eyes. The character designs uniquely define each character and are probably the best part of the visuals. The animation itself is cheap besides the performances where it gets a boost in quality. Overall it has good art but not amazing.The sound really helped make the anime feel energized. Nice background sound throughout the anime to support the other aspects of production and great Opening to really pump up the viewer.There were many characters portrayed in the anime with many unique and colorful personalities. However there are many missed opportunities in this aspect as character development moments are missed especially for many of the beginning characters. As the anime added in a whole new set of characters during the middle of the story, many opportunities to showoff the first group of characters are lost. With the show juggling the team of characters, we only get a taste of who all these guys are, until the very end, where the characters reflect on their experiences and we as the viewers truly get a solid understanding in who they are. Overall though, they are a group of fun good-hearted guys who are inspired to Cheer. In my optimistic/abstract view, I saw the whole team as one character, a few conflicting personalities here and there, but essentially everyone was driven with a passionate heart.I'm a sucker for camaraderie type anime, so I enjoyed it more than others it seems. I think it did a good job in making all the characters likable in a way, and having a few subplots for some of the characters to struggle with. I think I really the ending the best though, because we really straight into the characters through their thoughts.Overall, it was pretty good, I fully enjoyed binge-watching it, but definitely could have improvements throughout the story and character development. I'd recommend it to those who enjoy the camaraderie shown in sports and idol animes, but if your looking for intense competition or jaw dropping drama, this isnt the anime for you. the main problem is that the middle episodes are lackluster, as it feels that many opportunities to have something interesting happen are missed.

It would have been best as a 24 episode or two-season anime.Long version (may contain spoilers) :It was a cute anime and something you could enjoy if you\'re looking for a feel-good anime. However, since it was only 12 episodes, it was poorly done. The themes felt rushed and provided no background info, and the character developed was at best ok; in the beginning, the MC was still doing judo. Then the next episode, we just skipped...to cheerleading, and it\'s never explained what happened to his shoulder. It\'s obvious that it was caused by judo, but some background of it would have been helpful.The jump cuts that\'s one thing that really threw me off. For example, after they cheered at the school festival, the next episode showed all the new teammates who joined. At first, I thought I missed an episode since there were a dozen new people that were never introduced.The anime lacked depth since it just cut from one thing to the next. The story never got the chance to develop, and when it did go deeper, it was really short. I\'m used to sports animes like ""Run with the Wind,"" who explored the characters and story plot a lot better.The anime didn\'t show much of the character\'s lives outside of cheerleading; because of that, there was a disconnect, so you really couldn\'t relate to them besides the two MC\'s. Also, I\'m surprised there wasn\'t more of a school aspect since this is set in college.Some extra things, the romance was a shock, to say the least. That whole thing boyfriend\'s situation was unnecessary. And I hated Sakuma\'s voice (I watched in Dub). I understand they were trying to make him more feminine, but they overdid it. The whole ""rival"" with Hanasaki was terrible. It was so clear he was just a side character to boost the MC\'s and had absolutely no purpose other than running his mouth. to cheerleading, and it\'s never explained what happened to his shoulder.

If any guys have doubts about doing cheer or any other more feminine sport this could really boost their confidence in it. It flowed very well and it showed the struggles that people have to face when doing something that\'s ""not meant"" for their gender. I gave the story line a 9 and not a 10 because I do feel like it\'s missing a few things, for example they should have shown more of the actual events that they...had went to. I don\'t have to many critiques regarding it though.I don\'t have much to say about the art style, it\'s good, but it\'s not my personal preference. Nothing wrong with it, it\'s well drawn and looks good, I\'d just prefer something a little different. I gave the art style a 7 for that reason.The characters, that\'s what made the show, having all the different backgrounds and personalities. They didn\'t all work together but the sport brought them together and they worked through it. Most of them had very good character development, some didn\'t grow as much as others, but I think that adds to the show. It makes it more realistic because not everyone would grow at the same rate. They show the differences between them so well and it made me want a lot more than their was. I have the characters a 10 because I just couldn\'t get enough of them.Overall this anime is a 9, it;s one of my favorites but it just cant outrank my top ones but only over little things. Maybe it\'s because I can\'t relate as much to this was as my top ones. Either way I would highly recommend that you watch it.

They didn\'t all work together but the sport brought them together and they worked through it. Most of them had very good character development, some didn\'t grow as much as others, but I think that adds to the show. It makes it more realistic because not everyone would grow at the same rate. They show the differences between them so well and it made me want a lot more than their was. I have the characters a 10 because I just couldn\'t get enough of them.Overall this anime is a 9, it;s one of my favorites but it just cant outrank my top ones but only over little things. Maybe it\'s because I can\'t relate as much to this was as my top ones. Either way I would highly recommend that you watch it. It surprised me in the end because I never thought I would enjoy a anime about a boys cheer team.', ""This was a very average show. The plot was slow and I still have no clue what the purpose behind their routine was; were they trying to win or just perform because the ending was unclear...? I was bored half the time and the other half I was mildly interested in some of the bromance moments. I hated the random romance subplot, which was poorly done by the way, and the relationships did not go deeper than the surface level.Compared to other recent sports anime, this was a bust. It's literally impossible to compare them but this was not the move.You could skip this...and not waste your time.... and not waste your time...."", ""i feel that the concept about cheerleading is great, however the execution is subpar. like the whole anime should be about cheerleading however the characters' melodrama seems to take over the cheerleading part. like the characters' relationship between each other, their own background stories yada yada, i think these could all be omitted and focus more on their main topic.i mean they entered the cheerleading competition but the performance of other schools are practically not shown, if they are shown, you just see them posing, never the full routine of their performance. even the main characters' school performance in the last episode wasn't all shown...out. additionally, they still add-on the flashback of what happen previously, like come on, who cares??? viewers just want to watch their whole performance which they have spent so much time practicing. i mean they keep on practicing in every episode but the performance are just cut all over the place. all the other competitor schools seems to appear for show only, in the end, it's like the main characters' school participating in the competition only. out. additionally, they still add-on the flashback of what happen previously, like come on, who cares??? viewers just want to watch their whole performance which they have spent so much time practicing. i mean they keep on practicing in every episode but the performance are just cut all over the place. all the other competitor schools seems to appear for show only, in the end, it's like the main characters' school participating in the competition only."", ""definitely a run-of-the-mill sports anime. There really isn't anything that separates Cheer Boys from the rest. That is not to say that it is not a good anime per se, probably just not my cup of tea. Frankly, I love sports animes, as they are one of the few genres of anime that I can watch and not get confused/have to rewatch to see everything. They are thoughtless animes, which is why they are so good for some viewers, you don't have to think when watching, all you have to do is enjoy.Cheer Boys was an anime that took me over 3 months to...watch from start to finish, and that is not a good thing, but also not a bad thing. I would do other things while this show played in the background because it was not something that caught my attention 100%, I had to do other things to get through it. It was a good anime to have one while doing homework, making dinner, or doing my hair, so for that, I am thankful (dubbed of course).The animation was nothing special, the story did not develop the way I had hoped, and it was not the best anime I have ever seen, but it also wasn't the worst anime of all time. If you want to watch an anime that isn't trying too hard to be something, I would say that Cheer Boys is a good one to watch in the middle of other shows that you really like. It is a good palate cleanser. Honestly, it was the first episode that really did it dirty. The beginning is very much a pivotal point in any anime, and Cheer Boys did not make its beginning captivate the audience. I understand why people drop it, but with that being said, I am glad I followed through and watch till the end because it was a cute story about boys wanting to do cheer, which is not something you see all the time.My main grievance with this show is that aspects of the story are never depicted in anime. That being men participating in societal feminine things, while also being college-age and not children. So many aspects could have made it pivotal to the anime community, and that is where it fell short for me the most. I am sad that this show was not more than it was, but it was the worst thing in the world.All in all, if season two comes out, I will watch it, hoping that it is better than season 1. watch from start to finish, and that is not a good thing, but also not a bad thing.

Dream Festival!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33045/Dream_Festival,"['First things first, let\'s state the obvious: DreamFes is an idol anime based on a videogame, with a sprinkle of magical boys, in 12 episodes. If you\'ve considered that and have your expectations set accordingly - good. We can also get two things right out of the way: it won\'t win any award for the story or the overall visuals. Personally, I wouldn\'t call either of those mediocre, in fact in my opinion, the efforts can, at the very least, be seen, and that\'s enough to rate of both of them above the completely neutral ""meh"" middle ground.Ok, so it\'s an idol anime, what...about the idols then? That\'s one part where I think the anime rises above the average. The main cast consists of five characters, and unlike in some other anime of the genre, they actually are distinct individuals. It might not be painfully obvious right from the start, but as the story unfolds and we get to know them all, it actually becomes clear that they\'re not just five blanks with different looks. I dare say they aren\'t even necessarily the usual archetypes, either. It\'s not only in their back stories and motivations, but it\'s also visible in how they relate to and deal with each other and with problems life throws at them. Even the supporting characters have their own personalities, and while many of them only have a few appearances throughout the season (consider the constraints of 12 episodes), it manages to shine through quite nicely. They\'re all loveable (or not, though I don\'t think there\'s a single character here that deserves hate) for different reasons, and that\'s awesome. What\'s also worth noting in regards to the characters is the fact that most of the VAs are rookies. It\'s not hard to pick up on at first, and it may be weird and annoying. But hey, everyone\'s had to start somewhere, and honestly, even if they didn\'t get any better throughout the season, they grow on you.Well, what about the music, then? I think it\'s great. If you\'re into Japanese pop / idol music in general, of course, but that\'s common sense. Coming from the game, where it\'s the main point (it is a rhythm game, after all), it\'s no surprise that those songs we can hear in the anime, some of which we can even see being ""born"", are actually mostly quite strong. Totally radio-friendly, of course, either inspirational or emotional (or both), with the usual awkwardness of Engrish here and there - which you\'ve already learnt to love if you\'re here for this kind of music. And the way the story goes, we learn the meaning of the songs, the stories behind them, which I do believe can important to be able to enjoy music in general. It turns the songs personal in relation to whoever makes it, but at the same time it also gives a way to relate to them, which doesn\'t have to be exclusive, but is certainly a nice extra.This sounds like a very good anime! And it really is, probably the most underrated one of the season. Doesn\'t seem like much at first glance, but once you get into it... The story manages to remain real (or as real as it can be, of course, within the genre limits), almost mundane, in a way, which I believe is an awesome feat. The way the boys interact, the things they have to face and the ways they deal with them: it\'s actually believable. Even the fanservice parts, whether humorous or of an entirely different nature, felt more organic than in many other anime, more believable details of whatever is going on than things just tacked on as an afterthought. Then of course there are the ""magical"" elements, the way the idols transform once on stage: it\'s a cool extra addition that makes the anime a little unique. And it also plays into how the stage performances are rendered 3D graphics: not of any eye-watering quality, for sure, but the thing here is the fact that it\'s taken over from the game, where we see this same animation style, so it\'s another way to tie them together. It\'s unusual at first and takes some time getting used to, and some may never like it at all, but it\'s worth remembering that it isn\'t a gimmick without a reason.All in all: DreamFes is a very good anime, one of those that may just be greater than the sum of their parts. Almost like an underdog, really, and it\'s rather incredible that it comes in as a timid, shy, ordinary little thing, and then manages to exceed the expectations. That\'s truly all I can say, it\'s simply underrated. I\'m convinced that it could be an instant favourite of many of the genre\'s fans, at the very least. about the idols then?

I\'m convinced that it could be an instant favourite of many of the genre\'s fans, at the very least.', 'I decided to write a review before the final episode because the episodes seem to be very consistent in quality and feeling. I gave it an overall 8/10, but personally my enjoyment is 11/10.Dream Festival! is an anime about a few guys who are hoping to make their debut as idols, their dream is to win the Dream Festival contest. We meet Amamiya Kanade in the first episode, who never even thought of becoming an idol, but through Mikami Haruto\'s persuasion he accepts the offer. He later on forms an idol unit with Shin, Junya, Itsuki and Chizuru and they become the DearDream unit. Later...on we get to know their main rival, the Kurofune unit.This is a very typical idol-boys kind of anime. You\'ve got your concerts and silly idol-things (like sending kisses to fans, ""every fan is very important to us!"", trying to aim higher and higher, occasional drama among the unit mmebers) in every episode, but somehow DreFes does it all in a very endearing way. Every aspect of this anime feels ""good, but nothing special"", but I think that\'s what makes it so great - it\'s a very nonchalant, easy-going anime.However, that does not mean that it\'s superficial or boring. I think the personal dramas were good, the occasional suspense was exciting, and all in all, I was (and currently am) entertained.SONGSDreFes isn\'t the best with songs. For example, UtaPri has a lot better songs, but DreFes has some catchy tunes too. Just don\'t try to focus too much on their terrible English lyrics... They don\'t use much technique in their songs either - the variety of instruments and modern effects is quite minimal, and every song has the same kind of feeling to it. This kinda makes the concerts (or as they call them, Lives) repetitive and boring, but luckily the songs are quite short, only 1-1.5 minutes long.For some reason, the animation team went with using CG characters for the dances? Which was a terrible decision in my opinion. The dances look very awkward and even the facial expressions seem kind of blank and emotionless. But then again, luckily it\'s over quickly, and in comparison to some other CG animations, DreFes actually does surprisingly well.STORYLINE AND CHARACTERSI think DreFes\'s charm lies in these things. Every episode has a pretty solid and enclosed storyline that is easy to follow. The occasional humor is very endearing and adorable. The characters\' little quarrels and problems with each other are always solved, and at the end of every episode, everybody goes home with a smile on their face. The problems presented in these episodes are very real (being trampled by rival unit, having to choose between personal career and the idol unit, family problems, etc), but with love, everything can be solved~!VOICE ACTINGDreFes uses total ""newbies"" as their voice actors for the main characters. The only ""big name"" is Mikami Haruto\'s voice actor, all the other guys have this as their first role. [note: There are still some characters, whose voice actors we don\'t know.] I won\'t lie, it\'s pretty obvious that these guys are kind of new to this field. Sometimes their acting comes out a little flat, and you can hear their effort, but really, it doesn\'t make it unenjoyable. I think they\'re doing a great job despite this being their first time. Their characters\' personalities really come through, and with the whole package of animation, background music, and all that, the emotions do come through. All in all, I think they are doing an exceptionally good job. Personally, I prefer these new voice actors, because it\'s kind of different from the usual, it\'s nice to give them a chance, and it\'s a nice mix of \'unexperienced voice\' and \'trying hard and actually doing it right\'.ARTUnlike some other titles this season, DreFes\'s animation quality stayed pretty consistent, which is a big thing. Now that doesn\'t mean that there aren\'t occasional derp faces, but I think they are cute in their own way. The dancing is surprisingly well animated (except for when it\'s the CG dancing part), the colors and character designs are really pleasing to the eye. But that\'s about it - they don\'t really go overboard and try to make it flashy and sparkly. It\'s a pretty simple artstyle but I guess that\'s exactly what makes it nice.DREFES UNIVERSENow it\'s not like we haven\'t seen other idol anime titles do some silly and weird things in their idol universes, like flying through the sky and building things with strings of talent etc. etc., so it\'s really no surprise when I say that in the DreFes universe, the fans choose the idol units\' clothes for the concerts, which they then put on magically in a magical-girl-transformation way. The outfits are printed on a card called Dream Card (or Dorika), and when the concert starts, the fans just shoot these out from their designated card holder thinga-majingas, and then the idols need to catch a card to be able to equip it. Surely this whole system was created to boost sales for the game, and it\'s actually not very well explained in the anime why they went with this kind of system or how this works (but I guess it\'s my problem for trying to look for logic in an idol anime)OTHER DREFES THINGSDreFes is actually pushing through really hard in Japan with arcade games and buyable Dorika cards, and overall they\'re doing a very strong campaign for this merchandise line. This would make anyone think that the DreFes anime is also just a sales technique and no deep meaning will be found in the storyline, or no huge budget will be spent on it. I was actually surprised in a very positive way. I think the anime is very down-to-earth and loveable, despite the fact that it was really only created to help sell the merch.WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH DREFES- loveable characters, interesting chemistry between them- quite relaxing, it\'s an easy anime to watch, with a solid storyline- some songs are actually pretty catchy and all thatWHY YOU SHOULDN\'T WATCH DREFES- if you really don\'t like the concerts and are not willing to skip them- if you wish for more depth and/or negativity in an anime- if you\'re looking for anything sexy or something like that (DreFes is actually very PG-13) on we get to know their main rival, the Kurofune unit.This is a very typical idol-boys kind of anime.

Within moments of the first episode, I had a feeling it was based off of a game, and I was sure of it by the first performance. Their dances/performances were all very confusing. The fans have these card holders where they shoot out strange 'Dorika' and choose the clothing of the performers, which was very strange.The story itself is pretty well done. There were some moments that were very cliche and easily predictable, but the story was solid enough. You got to see development and interesting...plot lines, cliche as some may be.Art:The art is pretty decent, 7/10. I like the animation, except for the awkward 3D CGI when it comes to the dancing during their performances. Their faces look emotionless and flat and it's pretty cringey. Other than that, it's decent. Additionally, the emotional parts are done well. I'm not picky about art, so my only issue is the CGI.Sound:6/10, and I'm being a bit generous there. As far as songs go, they're all so... similar. There's not much change and they all seem to have the same beat/tune, even if the lyrics and dances change. As a music anime, that's a bit underwhelming. Shounen Hollywood/UtaPri/Starmyu all had more variety. However it wasn't like the songs were bad, per se, just generic. The opening and ending was interesting, though, and I did like both.There were some new voice actors for this, I could tell pretty quickly. That, I think, can be both a good and bad thing. I like the change and I appreciate that there's variety, it's always great to hear new voices. Though there were times it could have been better done.Character:Dream Festival definitely has good characters. You feel where they want you to feel and dislike where you should. I was expecting the typical batch - passionate MC, tsundere, kuudere, deredere, and hyper Nagisa™ from Free, and they all eventually come around the MC. It starts off with something similar to this, but I found the characters decent and interesting enough.My only compliant is the lack of female characters. I think it was well done as is, but I'd be interested in seeing at least a few girls that actually played a major role.Enjoyment:I definitely enjoyed watching this. It was fun and interesting. Probably would not watch again, but it's good if you're into this type of thing - a gaggle of attractive guys singing and being passionate. It can get 'suggestive' (i'm using that loosely) between them, as you might expect from an anime with a bunch of pretty boys and no female characters, but that's all to the imagination, I guess. Though the targeted group for this is quite obviously women, though.Overall:7.5/10I liked it, and thought it was interesting and a good waste of time. Would recommend to anybody looking for an attractive group of guys to watch. Don't expect too much -- take it lightheartedly, and it's a fun enough watch. plot lines, cliche as some may be.Art:The art is pretty decent, 7/10.

Unfortunately, there is always a first for everything and for my review on Dream Festival!, the greatest issue --for the first time ever-- lies on the seiyuu.Especially for idol genre, the performance of the seiyuu becomes more vital than ever because it would take a different kind of muscle. As it is about singing, the speaking dialogues must be well-synchronized with their respective character's artistry and inner turmoils. Additionally, just like artists in real life, the idols...in idol-genre anime tend to be vulnerable, whimsical, quirky, difficult, and mysterious. One cannot simply utilize the same method with idol characters as they do with Shounen or Seinen characters. The conclusion? It takes the pro among the pros to bring music-genre anime come to life. Unfortunately, the seiyuu in Dream Festival! somehow seem as if they had not gotten that memo.It is not to say that every seiyuu involved is terrible. Notable exception is definitely Sasaki Junya (voiced with gusto and charm by Tomita Kentarou-- who would later on find his breakout role in Ballroom e Youkoso) to the point of which Junya would have been better off as the primary protagonist than Amamiya Kanade (which, in opposite, is voiced flatly and tentatively by Ishihara Souma). It is understandable that Kanade is more of a blank canvas of a character, but it is as if Ishihara Souma took that character on far too literally.Nonetheless, there are potentials to be found in this anime. The Dorika element does not always work but once it works, it does make the overall narrative stand out for a bit. It is not to say that the season two should be missed. Some anime deserve a second chance and Dream Festival! is one of them.#felixlovesanime in idol-genre anime tend to be vulnerable, whimsical, quirky, difficult, and mysterious. One cannot simply utilize the same method with idol characters as they do with Shounen or Seinen characters. The conclusion? It takes the pro among the pros to bring music-genre anime come to life. Unfortunately, the seiyuu in Dream Festival! somehow seem as if they had not gotten that memo.It is not to say that every seiyuu involved is terrible. Notable exception is definitely Sasaki Junya (voiced with gusto and charm by Tomita Kentarou-- who would later on find his breakout role in Ballroom e Youkoso) to the point of which Junya would have been better off as the primary protagonist than Amamiya Kanade (which, in opposite, is voiced flatly and tentatively by Ishihara Souma).

After all... this anime is about bishonen in a boyband.If you don\'t like these two things you can still watch the anime, but you\'re not their target audiance so I\'m sure you\'re not going to find the same enjoyment as I did,Let me state the obvious, I LOVE these idol/boyband/bishonen anime but this is a review so I\'m goint to do it as it has to be made.Story: The story is good, is about a group of boys who wants to become...idols(each one with their motives) and the anime shows their path to do it while they grow as persons and professionals. Simple and good and they worked this in a good and enjoyable anime.Art: The art is good, is not the best in the world, I got myself thinking a lot of times staring and thinking that something was missing, the movements were a little stiff, something like thiis. They use CG for the dance parts, is a good CG and is well blended with the 2D animation, Have I seen better CG usage in this kind of anime? Yes. But is good so I\'ll give the Arts a 7Sound: I love the ""main songs"" and the anime introduces us to a good number of songs so they don\'t always sing the same(this is a really good point), when they are not together as a group you see the seyuus are not exactly the best singers you\'ll find out there. And the voices for Chizuru and Kanade are quite annoying for me. But the songs are addictive and nice to hear so I\'ll give an 8.Character: This is a usual idol anime, you\'ll have a little of their stories as persons, why they want to become idols and their doubts like ""should I really be an idol?"" ""Why am I doing this?"". I liked their backgrounds, is convincing and well wrapped, it explains their personalities and you get to really cheer for them, the anime gives the space for them to grow up as persons and idols so is good, and for those who didn\'t get their space the anime ends announcing a second season for 2017 so I believe they\'ll explore some characters more in the second season.  I\'m going to give an 8 and wait for season two :)Enjoyment: I liiked the characters as said above, the songs, the ending(since there is a second season announced) so I\'ll give this a 9.Overall: 8Is a good anime, not the best I\'ve seen in my life but I enjoyed it and the songs are going to stay with me for a while.

The reason for this isnt necessarily the story itself but the storys content you can say.The sound is one of those elements i talked about when it comes to a certain downfall of this anime. I find the songs uinteresting and the op and endings arent any better. I mean...its not horrible songs and i would grade them as passing idol anime songs but nothing about them makes me want to go back and listen to them again. I would rather watch another idol anime for the songs than to watch this one again for the same reason.When it comes to characters i actually find them well done in a sence but as we know the main character has alot to say even if its an idol anime. The main character here is a noob in the buisness which can be used as a reason for his slow progress but he problem is that even after that he doesnt progress much in the sence of becomming more interesting or engaging. I find myself remembering many other characters more than i do the main one. His only redeeming quality is one thats with a lot of other mains is that he can do it always but not much more. Even main characters who only seem to have a good attitude also manage to show other abilites that they might not be as much aware of but this main isnt interesting overall.I enjoyed it to some regards but this anime wont be that anime i go back to if i find myself wanting a good idol anime.Overall as i see the story combined with the mediocre music and ok characters thats been overshadowed by an uninteresting main character i cant give it more than a 5. I mean if you want to enjoy a great idol anime with good songs to booth this isnt the one but if you just want to go into the idol anime world i think this anime does that well. As long as those who watches this doesnt think this is what idol anime in general are. Since there are alot of better ones out there. its not horrible songs and i would grade them as passing idol anime songs but nothing about them makes me want to go back and listen to them again.

Yes, more then Love Live!.Yes yes, I agree that the anime follows the same story as most idol animes, but it makes up for it with the character development (just the main characters, for now, Kurofune will come later).Finally, there\'s the music. An idol or music anime with a bad soundtrack cannot be considered an idol or music anime. Luckily, the soundtrack doesn\'t disappoint. This anime gives the viewers a new song almost every episode, yeah I said \'almost.\'Overall, I think it\'s an alright idol anime, giving us a few hours...of enjoyment.Also, my personal favorite is ""2032."" of enjoyment.Also, my personal favorite is ""2032.""', ""I watched both seasons of Dream Festival. Here are my thoughts:This is basically male Aikatsu.Surprisingly good direction. Drama is handled well sometimes. At times there was definitely some 'forced drama' (forgive me for using this phrase), but it's a male idol show so I basically expected that. Forced drama and corniness comes with the territory (keep in mind the target audience demographic of this kind of show). I don't necessarily dislike forced drama but I will acknowledge it when I see it. In any case, the anime did a decent job of achieving the 'emotional rollercoaster' effect that I often enjoy in idol shows such...as this.Richer characterization than expected, especially with consideration for cast size. Most episodes had some element of character development within them, which is something I perceive as being a major strong point. The cast is fairly likable as well.There was occasionally some shounen-ai subtext between characters, but it wasn't prominent. I would have expected more of that kind of thing from an anime like this actually. Not a negative or positive thing, just a neutral observation.Idol songs themselves are good and the background OST is decent too. I notably enjoyed the voice acting of some of the characters (Yuuto and Chizuru).Over-the-top tacky idol outfits, just like Aikatsu!Warning: CGI is used for the dance scenes.The character designs are very simplistic, probably to make CGI easier. Animation quality is serviceable at best. Art style is quite bland and lacking in detail. Visually, the production seems low budget.My rating: 7/10Overall, this anime is surprisingly good for a low-budget low-viewership ONA associated with a video game.It did everything I'd expect from a male idol show and I felt satisfied with its performance. I wish there were more seasons. I would have rated this higher if the drama was executed a little better or if I liked the characters a little more; that's not to imply that the anime did poorly in either of those regards though.I'm a huge sucker for idol shows that depict the more realistic/harder/behind-the-scenes aspects of working as an idol. This show does this fairly well, in addition to its other positive qualities. My expectations going into this were admittedly low, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. I really like idol anime though so I might be biased. as this.Richer characterization than expected, especially with consideration for cast size.

But it turn out it's not, I wont ruin the plot, so ill just say there's events that keep the plot going.Art: The animation has a very 'mid-90s' feel to it, which isn't a  bad thing. The thing I like most is the cars.

After seeing that it wasn\'t as popular as his other works and getting some less than good, I went into eX-Driver with moderately set expectations that I would get at least some entertainment out of the six episodes knowing what the creator was capable of. And after watching it, I can easily see...why this wasn\'t as well remembered or well reviewed as his other works.Set at some point in the 22nd century, people no longer drive cars themselves, instead relying on cars with an artificial intelligence to drive for them. But when the AI systems in these cars started malfunctioning, causing the cars to lose control, a team called eX-Drivers (or eX-D for short) were formed, driven by actual drivers, to chase down the cars that have gone crazy. I don\'t know why the group of people who actually drive cars are the ones called eX-Drivers, but whatever.The series follows three such eX-Drivers, Lorna, Lisa, and new addition to the group, Soichi. Soichi is the youngest of the group at 12 years old, and the other two are in their teens. I imagine that making them younger was to appeal to a younger audience, and I don\'t really mind having three kids as the main characters since this is more geared to a younger audience, but it just raises questions to me, like how does a 12 year get a license, especially for such a dangerous job. But I\'m guessing this is going off of Pokemon rules, with how children are often put into dangerous situations but somehow never get hurt, with this series relying on the same set of convenient rules.eX-Driver does bring up some neat concepts to explore, such as an underground community of drivers mentioned in the first episode where characters have a boost button in their car and have modified the cars programming, and later in the series, there are characters with gasoline cars that can\'t be tracked by the same system as the AI cars and are off the grid. It would have been neat if the series explored this stuff, but unfortunately due to it being only 6 episodes, it never really gets to do that.And that\'s not taking into account other stuff that it could have brought up. Is there no one would doesn\'t trust the automated systems of the cars, and even cites statistics of AI failures, or at least talks about all of the news stories of failing AI as a reason to not have an AI car? Or even just dislikes the idea in general, based purely on personal preference. What about people who simply can\'t afford the AI cars, or simply don\'t care about what car they drive, and just want a way of getting to where they\'re going? And I\'m pretty sure there are car enthusiasts out there who would want to drive, tune, and build their own cars, or just want to buy and deal with classic cars. You could have even had an episode where a mentor once shows his skills of to the kids, who hope to be as good of a driver as him one day.There could have even been an episode where the characters didn\'t have access to cars, like being stranded somewhere where they didn\'t have access to the system, or being forced to take a break since the job is clearly stressing them out, and it ends up being a bonding experience. There was enough here for it to expand out to a 12-episode series at least, but unfortunately we got stuck with what we have.All of these could have been good ideas for episodes, and could have easily broken up the repetitive monotony of the series and at least taken the series from a completely forgotten for good reason series to a beloved cult classic with a few neat ideas.The series also came out at that time when anime was transitioning from traditionally done animation cels to digital animation, and it obviously shows. Characters look flat and overly bright at times and the whole thing just looks mediocre at the best of times.Which is unfortunate, because the series clearly shows off Kosuke Fujishima\'s love of cars, and by extension, motorcycles, and seeing it either be done a few years earlier with cel animation or a few years later when studios were more experienced with digital animation and the detail of the cars would have really popped out more, it would have at least made it worth watching for the eye candy.And it seems like such a waste to not let Kosuke to show off his love of said vehicles and let him stretch his creativity a bit for a sci-fi series with cars we haven\'t seen before. If this couldn\'t have been continued as an anime, it would have been nice to see Kosuke continue it as a manga at least.The only interesting thing about this series is just how predictive of self-driving cars it was. But since it never goes that in-depth with the concept either, so there\'s no real reason to watch the series based on that alone.While eX-Driver is nowhere near the worst thing that I\'ve watched, I doubt that anyone is clamoring for a re-release. But considering some of the stuff that Discotek have picked up, I wonder how long it would be before they get their hands on a release for this.

Not that the story is godly, but because it's just something you have to watch 3 episodes and get used to.It's not like the other car animes out there like Shaokotan...Boogie or Wangan Midnight that are mainly about cars and racing. eX-driver has a completely different approach on cars, and what they do and why. Yet it shares resemblance to those animes which sort of explains why it doesn't feel like a complete product, especially in the end.

In other words this not a substitute for NASCAR racing. This show is more adaption with technology on cars and making sure everything 'runs' smoothly. Introduction was okay.

Not only does it go along with the purpose of the company in the show but the win wasn't settled in a common gloves off fashion.

This team resolves the danger by using their own gas powered vehicles and their sharpshooting skills in order to stop these rogue vehicles. Each of the three main characters of this anime has their own individual vehicle that they...use in order to resolve the conflicts that they are often put in and each of the vehicles are different enough and really cater to the each of the characters personality. You have Lisa who is brash, stubborn and hard headed, Lorna who is soft spoken, shy and reasonable, and Souichi who is selfish, idealistic, and goal-oriented. Despite the fact that the main characters are all different, and their personalities often conflict with each other it leads to a believable and heartfelt bond that all the characters have with each other. Lorna often has to be the mediator because Souichi and Lisa are often at each other's throats on who is the better driver.This anime has a very short length with only 6 episodes but if you ask me I think it's the perfect length when dealing with such an obscure subject matter. The setting in the anime takes place in a futuristic society where people don't personally drive anymore - every vehicle in the city is controlled with artificial intelligence but building a society where all transportation is controlled by computers is literally a recipe for disaster because eventually technology will break down and not work anymore so there needs to be protocols put in place in order to protect the people inside these vehicles in case the artificial intelligence system fails. The majority of the episodes focus on some kind of rescue and after awhile the rescues literally feel all the same in every episode until some proper enemies/antagonists are established but it doesn't happen until episode 5 and 6. It's okay to recycle the same type of final conflict for a few episodes but it can often be aggravating if you feel like your watching the same resolution in each and every episode especially if the anime lasts as long as 12 or 24 episodes but with 6 episodes it never reaches that point where it does feel aggravating. However, the way that the eX-Driver team stop the rogue vehicles is pretty much the same for the most part. They freeze passenger compartment of the vehicle while either smashing or blocking the two sensors in the back of the vehicle and the two sensors in the front of the vehicle minus the odd exception in order to stop it while the rogue vehicle tries to do everything in its power to stop the eX-drivers and their cars from stopping their chaotic nonsense.For an early 2000's anime the animation is incredibly beautiful, every car is animated beautifully and some of the chase scenes are really enthralling to watch. The opening and ending themes are relatively solid, but the strongest musical aspect of this anime is definitely a lot of the background music. There are beautiful ambient tracks throughout a lot of the cityscape scenes especially in a lot of the background scenes that involve water but when the driving happens the music gets really intense and wild especially when the action scenes start to take over.I really have to give a lot of respect to the english dub for this anime because there is a lot of great anime voice talent in this obscure anime such as staples of the 90's anime scene such as Lia Sargent, Richard Epcar, and Steve Blum while mixing in some voice talent from Digimon. To be honest all the voices really suit all of the characters in this anime regardless if it's a main character or a side character.I think deep down this anime knows exactly what it wants to be. It never feels heavy handed and every episode finds a way to be enjoyable. When villains are finally established in this anime, it adds a little extra depth to this anime beyond the standard rescue mission even though the motivations of the villains aren't up to the level of supervillain standards but that is a-ok in my eyes because for the most part it's a simple anime with a simple premise and knows exactly what it needs to be do to be enjoyable. Each of the heroes cars suffer damage in many of the rescue missions and conflicts and nobody ever feels truly invincible in this anime but it lends to the strength of keeping the characters and the vehicles they drive in grounded despite being set in a futuristic setting.Even though the anime caters to some of the typical anime tropes (the female characters being sexualized), the tropes are so minor it actually doesn't detract you from enjoying the anime from what it really is. The anime in itself doesn't really have a lot of humour per se but it's worth watching for the race scenes and the character development between the main characters. The anime is not violent, raunchy, or bloody but it doesn't need to be because it's focused on being entertaining and as far as I'm concerned it certainly succeeds in that.I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed it and in my eyes it's a very fun and easy watch.

If you like cars, you'll get enjoyment out of this series, possibly even if you don't. This series suffers from it's six episode short run that doesn't allow story arcs to be fully completed.As I complete this easy to watch anime, a few things stick with me. I found the art style a bit lackluster and a little outdated. For an early 2000's anime, it seemed okay but was also rather inconsistent. In the scenes with less movement, the art was great but once there was action, the art seemed to suffer a bit.The...sound is truly stellar. The cars sound proper, that is to say a Europa sounds like a Europa and different from the Stratos. When the car shifts, the sounds changes properly and the voice acting (English dub) is better than many, only missing the mark once or twice.Aside from the art, I think the characters and the storyline are what suffers most. Ironically, it's not because the concept or characters are bad, but because there wasn't enough time to fully develop them out. In regards to the story, each run away car is similar and although the exact details in how they are stopped are different, the main concept doesn't change and becomes old by the third time around. When the story does start to pick up and you think there might be some good plot lines or twists coming, we're treated to a premature end.The same thing happens with the characters. I could see that the relationship between Lorna, Lisa and Sōichi was supposed to be the main focus, but unfortunately, just as the characters were getting warmed up to each other, the series ends. It is especially frustrating as it's clear Sōichi and Lisa are attracted to each other, so I know there could have been plenty of jokes between the two had the series continued.The most frustrating part of this series is its premature end. Just as the plot and characters were starting to shape up into something, you're on episode six. Worth a watch, especially if you like cars, but if you're like me and become a bit frustrated at potential that is not fully realized, you'll find it here. sound is truly stellar.

The characters aren't well crafted or deep. The story is grounded in an interesting concept, but ultimately winds up shallow and derivative. If you are looking for an anime you will bill as a must see, go try and find something else. What eX-Driver is, is popcorn fun and that's okay.The highlight of this series is the animation, setting, and action. As a glance into our possible future, the world is filled with automated vehicles. Very few people actually know how to drive a car so every vehicle is equipped with an AI that gets them to their...destinations. It's when the AI shorts out that the vehicles become a danger to the society around it. That is where the organized team of youths driving petrol powered cars show up to disable the vehicles that have gone out of control by knocking out the sensors on the vehicle run amok.Sure this is a bit out there, but there is a crazy amount of detail that was put forth by the team to make this work. Here's an example for you. The team consists of 3 people driving a left hand drive Lancia, a right hand drive Lotus, and a single seater Caterham 7 so that they can basically flank all sides of the car they are approaching.

The logic is all there as to how this society functions around these cars as vehicles move out of the way in emergencies and lock up to let the ambulances or eX-Drivers get through to help the people in need.Its that the story just winds up falling in to tropes that were a bit stale even when this was produced. Instead of information on why car AIs seem to go out of control on a weekly basis or why children are chosen to hot rod about in high speed chases we get sexy motorcycle ladies, bickering between the crew, and jealousy over who gets to be in a TV show.eX-Driver has a shocking amount of attention paid to it, but not a lot of depth applied. Which is why you should be grabbing that popcorn and sitting down to watch a fun sci-fi action car chase movie because what works here really does work well.

I remembered watching an anime with a yellow Caterham as the hero car when I was a kid. I immediately clicked on it and was able to recognize all 3 main characters Soichi, Lisa and Sorna.You know that feeling of nostalgia you get when you watch an anime from the past that you still remember, for me that would be ""Dragon Ball"" ""Naruto"" ""Inuyasha"", I didn\'t get that feeling because I recognized the characters and the Super Seven but didn\'t remember anything about the story....I didn\'t even know that this was such a small series. I decided to binge all 6 episodes and started watching. Soichi and Lorna are likable, Lisa is a bit annoying but, she grows on you. The chief is always angry like in buddy cop movies. Everyone has a flat character arc and no development or rather a development in character isn\'t necessary as the series itself is so small and needs to concentrate on world-building rather than giving the characters something that they have to get over and cannot justify their change in such a short time, as that would lack connection with the audience.I appreciate that part but, after a couple of episodes it starts feeling repetitive, that\'s bad especially when it\'s a short series and you think it would be fresh till the end. I rather enjoyed the last 3 episodes more than anything as we are introduced to Joe Todo and would\'ve liked to see more of him in more episodes or rather have him introduced earlier in the series. His backstory was decent but was made worse as it wasn\'t shown but explained by the chief. I would\'ve loved to his relationship with Rei, Nina and the chief as a former eX-Driver.My favorite character was the car Mechanic Ogawa and would\'ve liked to see his badass driving as something about him just screams that he is an awesome driver. I would\'ve liked for him to be a former eX-Driver turned mechanic, who was called to assist the current eX-Drivers in facing Joe but, alas.I\'ve given the Story an 8 as the world of AI-driven cars for the public where no one even knows how to drive anymore but, there are some special drivers and riders who still have a license and are the ones who are called upon to stop an AI car when it goes out of control. The story has more potential.Overall, watch the anime if you are interested to experience something different in between all the new anime you are watching, it is a short series and is watchable.

Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8536/Fortune_Arterial__Akai_Yakusoku,"['There are few trends in anime that are as fallible as the visual novel adaptation, yet they continue to be made in the hope of finding the next Air, Kanon or Clannad. Unfortunately this means that the industry is littered with forgettable titles that have no other purpose than to serve as no brain entertainment for an audience that simply doesn\'t care anymore.There is hope though, as every so often a series will appear that defies all expectations. Sadly, Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku (Red Promise) isn\'t one of them.Based on the adult visual novel of almost the same name that was released in 2008 by...developer August, the series lays out a fairly stereotypical harem plot of boy transferring into prestigious school and girls immediately falling head over heels for his kind personality and slightly bumbling mannerisms. Oh, and the main heroine just happens to be a vampire.Now where have I heard that before?Fortune Arterial does have a plot, but unsurprisingly it\'s about as predictable as the sunrise for anyone who\'s ever watched a harem based show. The storyline is laid out in the typrical fashion of boy meets girl (or in this case, vampire), upon entering the school, then meets his long lost childhood friend(s) (also girls), then some other girl(s), etc. All the while some mysterious force keeps pushing the boy and the first female (let\'s call her Girl A since I can\'t be bothered remembering her name), together.The problem with Fortune Arterial is actually twofold where the story is concerned, the primary one being that the show follows the harem format almost to the letter, with little in the way of innovation or deviation. There is never any assumption that the viewer is intelligent enough for deductive reasoning, and the only thing expected of them is to sit there, look at the pretty anime girls, and buy the merchandise afterwards.The second problem is the fact the series is based on an adult visual novel, and they\'re not really the best choice when it comes to deep, well written storylines or nicely developed characters. In fact, they\'re so far down on the list of possibilities that one has to wonder how the hell they get chosen in the first place.They\'re also as generic as they come where design is concerned.Fortune Arterial is, if nothing else, a faithful representation of the visual novel, (at least in terms of how it looks), but that\'s not really saying much as the series would only be laudable if the show was at least decent in other areas (storyline, for example). The other downside to staying true to the original (at least in this case), is that there is an inherent lack of creativity, and it shows itself here in several visual ways.Like so many other eroge, Fortune Arterial has some pretty decent animation, and while there are some issues with body position and timing, it\'s probably on a par with many other shows of this type. The downside though, is that the anime is awash with big eyed characters of just about every ""moe"" stereotype you\'d care to name, and that includes the hapless lead male. The scenery is nice enough, but lacks any real flair that would set it apart from just about every other posh, western styled school in anime (there are a few after all).Which, strangely enough, leads me on to the acting.The seiyuu generally work well throughout the series, but the main issue with their performances is that they lack passion. The delivery of their lines can be wooden, and there are several occasions where it sounds like the actors and actresses would much rather be doing something else.The rest of the aural department isn\'t really any better. The OP is a cheesy, boppy J-Pop track that is typical for this type of show. The ED is, as you\'ve probably already guessed, a ballad that is meant to sound somewhat bittersweet, but instead comes off as cloying and unoriginal. The incidental music has some issues with timing and choreography, and there are some odd pieces that doesn\'t seem to match the mood of the scene.As for the characters, if you\'ve seen one harem show of this type then you pretty much know what to expect. The lead male isn\'t as bad as some I could name, but the girls are as stereotypical as they come, and to make matters worse their character types include a vampire and an amnesiac childhood friend (let\'s call her Girl B).Hooray for genericism!The story is driven by events rather than characters, mainly because the nature of the visual novel defines the plot format. Unfortunately this means that there is little in the way of actual character development as while events do occur over the course of the show, the characters basically remain the same from beginning to end.That said, there were some mildly diverting moments dotted here and there, but not enough to warrant watching the show a second time.Fortune Arterial is a strange anime that doesn\'t really feel comfortable with itself, never mind the viewing public. A major problem with the series, aside from all that inherent genericism, is that several aspects of the storyline have already been realised far better in other shows. Because of this, much of the plot seems derived rather than original, and there is little in the way of content to persuade the viewer that they wouldn\'t be better off watching something like Karin or Rosario + Vampire.To its credit, the series does present some interesting situations, but like so many other titles it never fully realises or utilises them to their full potential.The biggest problem with Fortune Arterial though, is that it represents just about everything that is wrong with the anime industry today. Studios like Zexcs seem more focused on catering to an almost non-existent market than they are on giving the majority of fans what they want, and the main reason for this is habit - historically their money has mainly come from selling merchandise to hardcore Japanese fans.The sad part is that the repercussions of making a series like this are far more widespread than people may initially believe, and the shortfall in finances resolves itself through increased license fees and mark ups on the price of merchandise and DVDs.Fortune Arterial isn\'t the worst show of its type, but it\'s a long, long way from being the best.

Whoever said ""don\'t judge a book by its covers"" probably didn\'t look in the right book section because, indeed, Fortune Arterial is shakey and very generic. The experience of watching Fortune Arterial is comparable to eating rotten food (not that you would ever do it voluntarily)- the experience is horrible for the first half, then after eating it for a while your taste buds already dead so you feel that it\'s passable. After you finish eating all the rotten food, you look back and ask yourself ""what the hell just happened?"" Not all of the episodes...were bad, just a majority of them - pointless episodes that you wonder ""why the hell are they showing me these things"". In addition, the lolwtfBBQ ending really didn\'t do much to improve the standing of this anime in my eyes.Story (5/10)The story is my biggest problem with this anime. Simply put, the plot doesn\'t make sense. The story follows Kouhei after he transfers to a private academy. On the first day, he meets the Vice-president Erika, who strangely alienates him by suddenly stepping away from him. Later he learns that the both the prez and vp are vampires. I think, at this point, ok a generic vampire school one, I\'ll just put my hopes at that. Yet, surprisingly it fell even short of what low expectations I put onto it. For seriously the first half of the season, nothing happens. Take my word, absolutely nothing happened. They went shopping, talking, tea blah blah blah. Then for the second half of the season, it seems like the producers were smoking crack, trying to fit in everything into the remaining measly 6 episodes. This shows very faulty planning and poor organization. Certainly it would be wise to introduce the plot through the season, maybe even hinting at it for the first few seasons if they don\'t want to jump right into it, but none of that happened in the beginning. The characters kinda just shopped their asses away and then worked their asses off for the remaining episodes trying to do everything that was written. Truth be told, I skipped parts through the episodes in first half of the season because it bored me to the point where I\'d write English essay sometimes instead of watching it. And I didn\'t feel bad about it. The second major let down was when I become very interested in it starting at the 7th episode and it began to build suspense. I expected a stunning ending.. and all I got was a cheap generic one leaving myself to wonder ""wait.. what the fok happened in these 12 episodes?"". Grr. the horrible plot makes me angry just by thinking about it. After 12 episodes, almost nothing happened and the things that did happen were relatively insignificant and beyond my care.Art (8/10)Art was probably the only thing that matters that significantly raised the score. The art is good, nothing exceptional, but pretty to look at and doesn\'t interfere with enjoyment of the story (albeit the meagerness of enjoyment). Besides, one of the characters in the end looked so much like Yami, so I found that pretty awesome.Character (5/10)ugh... characters. What can I say? Kouhei\'s dense, retarded and probably a fallible species of those generic harem type males. It comes to the point where you\'re almost yelling at the screen asking how he could be any more oblivious. Oops she\'s screaming in pain and falls down, knocking over and breaking stuff... BUT she says she\'s ok with a pained expression... so SHE MUST BE OK :D. yeah that\'s how ""smart"" Kouhei is. Nevertheless, the producers had no problem portraying him to the level of goody2shoe that even Mary Sue would get annoyed at his actions. You\'d hear the word ""Gomen"" about 5 times for every time you see something enjoyable. Besides Kouhei\'s pathetic personality, I find that the majority of the characters weren\'t too likable or significant. The manipulative and arrogant president, the overprotective secretary, the loud obnoxious loli... perhaps the other quiet loli was the only character that I didn\'t dislike. What\'s more is that over 80% of the anime was simply the lazy president forcing Kouhei to join the student council and forcing him to plan events. After 7 episodes of Kouhei with papers around, typing and bowing to the store owners for their support in the next whatever event, one tends to get bored. Very bored.Meanwhile the prez is trying to get Kouhei and Erika together all the time for some unknown reason revealed later. Nevertheless, nothing happens between those two. If you were hoping for a nice summer romance, well look for somewhere else. The lack of actual love in the plot sticks out like a sore thumb in the pile of ""we believe you"" ""you\'re important"" and ""not only I, the school needs you!"" cheesy crap.Overall (6/10)After reading all these vehement criticism of Fortune Arterial that I wrote up until now, I\'d feel bad to simply leave it at that without explanations for improvements. There were some very good things about this anime: stirring scenes that incites emotion, suspense keeping the viewer watching, deep character developments, however, animes hardly ever succeed with just that. What let me down the most was the ending. I was so hooked on the series from episode 7-11 that I thought a good ending would amend for the crap first half of the season; yet, I was very disappointing by the ending and it\'s inability to introduce something innovative. Not even at the standard of just generic, the ending reverted it so absolutely nothing important happened at all. If the producers ever make a second season, these are some aspects they should consider.1) Better organization and connection of plot and events so they make sense2) Cut the useless school scenes and focus on the actual plot. Many anime attempts to combine school and ulterior plot, but unfortunately few succeed at that ordeal.3) Reduce the episodes spent on developing the history of characters that didn\'t play a single role in the actual plot.I really hope that if another season comes out, it would be a season where the characters in it could actually feel proud being in it. Call me weird but I sometimes feel sorry for the anime characters being in an anime that was just skimmed through and thrown away. They unfairly carry the failure of the producers who made it. were bad, just a majority of them - pointless episodes that you wonder ""why the hell are they showing me these things"".

This anime is one that i enjoyed because it has a good hook onto the viewer and doesnt get boring too easily. It presents unanswered questions early on so far and keeps my attention. The story doesnt move too slowly nor too fast.The art is good and i enjoyed it.The enjoyment was pretty good so far, because i enjoyed watching the ups and downs and a few romantic scenes. (Not going to say more still airing No Spoilers)Music was good it sort of set the mood beter than some other music from other animes.Characters in Fortune Arterial:...Akai Yakusoku are pretty good. They set it up very well. It keeps you interested in each character because it seems like they have something to hide.Overall i enjoyed the first bunch of episodes and i expect to see greatness from this anime Akai Yakusoku are pretty good. They set it up very well. It keeps you interested in each character because it seems like they have something to hide.Overall i enjoyed the first bunch of episodes and i expect to see greatness from this anime', 'Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku is a visual novel adaption that I thought really should have done better. The problem with this series is that it lacked uniqueness in anyway and it seems very genericThere actually is a plot is very lackluster and seems very generic. Our main protagonist Kouhei Hasekura has just transferred to a new school where he meets our heroine Erika Sendou, who falls for him immediately. He also gets reunited with his childhood friends and he soon finds out that Erika along with her brother are vampires. The problem with a plot like this is that it\'s very generic and predictable. If...you watched so much as one harem in your life you would know what to expect.  There\'s really very little that\'s unique about it, sure they have the whole vampire plot but it really have much depth. It\'s a shame really because the part of the plot seemed interesting and overall would have made the series much better.  Now I understand that the series is based off a visual novel and they are following the events but the producers could have tried to deviate a bit.  The ending is also too good either it looks like something that they pulled out of their ass last minute because they couldn\'t think of anything.I don\'t really pay attention to technical aspects but the art didn\'t really seem too special. It seems up to par with most anime today so I guess it\'s not bad but nothing special either.The sound is alright too. The opening sounds really good but I think that\'s because Lia is singing it.  The ending is performed by Veil, who I actually never heard of but I would say they did a good job.  The VAs all seemed to fit their roles well too.The characters are generic too.  They seem like the characters that you would find in any typical harem anime. The main protagonist, Kouhei Hasekura seems like the typical warmhearted lead. There\'s hardly anything unique about him that separates him from other protagonists. The other characters are also very bland, we got our female lead who seems perfect but has a problem that she wants to deal with herself (well at least she\'s a vampire). Then we got the childhood friend who had amnesia and is responsible and helpful.  We also got her lively and active sister. We also got a character who is really quiet and doesn\'t really have friends. These are typical personalities for characters from the typical harem.  Also there is very little character development too. I wouldn\'t have really had a problem with the character\'s personalities if they had significant development, but they didn\'t. There are a few romantic interests that fly around but nothing ever comes of it.This is a series I really wanted to enjoy but I couldn\'t because of it\'s blandness. If it did go more in depth with it\'s whole vampire thing maybe the series would have been good. But that was a big ""if"" that never happened. At this day and age, playing it safe doesn\'t cut it anymore. Thanks for Reading =) you watched so much as one harem in your life you would know what to expect.

This is different though not much to do with vampire lore (hope isn't similar to twilight). first episode leaves you with grabing sensation asking for more, great start hope though it doesn't get all weird and over the top. Only thing i dislike is the use of galic church used in the anime not my pick but yeah. 8/10 very interesting "", 'Story & Characters (2/10)Another season, another eroge transformed into an anime. Eroge adaptations are now ubiquitous enough that they have to be treated like shonen action series: you have to start ignoring the obvious and start enjoying the variation in details. Taken that way, Fortune Aerial isn\'t just bad enough, but even if there\'s a level of Hell for anime, it wouldn\'t be allowed in.Ah, school transferring. No youthful memories, no lasting friendship and no meaningful romance. That\'s the kind of lifestyle Kouhei has been suffered from until he finally gets a choice of his own he opts for Shuchikan Academy, a boarding school out...on a peripheral Japanese island that he had once briefly stayed at several years ago. There he reunites with his childhood friends and quickly gets associated with several classmates, but when comes in contact with the eccentric vice-student council president Sendou Erika, something annoys her so bad that would forever leave mark. Much to his dismay, is the discovery of a vampire on campus, and it\'s someone he\'s already met.Yeah, this is yet another old-fashioned premise of visual novel, spends its first episode introducing the key players. Awfully familiar, yes? Some guy transfers to a new town to frolic amongst the walking female set up; he encounters ""Girl #1"" then childhood friends and some new girls. Why does this have to be strikingly cliche when there was another eroge adapted-series in its season, Yosuga no Sora. My goodness, if it isn\'t bad enough that this was filled with the worst kind of school-romance drivel and unacceptable introduction, it\'s got VAMPIRES. Whenever you hear the word ""vampire,"" the first thing comes to your mind is blood-sucking monster walking around at night and get burnt when interacted with sunlight, doesn\'t it? Don\'t expect any of that kind of treatment in Fortune Aerial because it simply is what it is, school romance.The regular episodes have nothing that could be called an ongoing plot, as they mostly just amount to the main characters busily preparing for school events, enjoying school activities, or (in Erika\'s case) try to subdue her vampiric nature. The personalities of the characters are a cross-section of archetypes common to fan service shows, and most are executed in a simple, straightforward way. To begin with, Kouhei\'s lamely nice guy attitude and his ""picking-up-girls"" comrade soon prove to be boring. While other characters don\'t show up much, including standards like the childhood friends, the mysterious and quite one, the cute younger sister you want to protect, the focus remains on the central character Erika. However, the latter turns out to be the most awfully written of all. Heard this before? A vampire tries to integrate herself into man\'s society by subduing her thirst for blood ends up being more pathetic than she already is. Even if you\'re not a big fan of Twilight, you would not want to see how much damage vampires receive in this show, stick to Hellsing or Tsukihime if you want to see a vampire babe in action.Art (5/10)Feel, a support-focused animation studio whose only other significant lead efforts are the recently-released Mayo Chiki! and the unlicensed Yosuga no Sora, here produces a showy and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of vampire element but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor that the lackluster animation may not matter. The same applies for background art and character design too, which seem to look good but also absolute typical for this type of series; while the girls\' look can be replaced, the blandness of background art is a complete waste of this unusual setting (a boarding school built on a small forested island). Perhaps the way vampirism is going to fit into the picture could be a bit intriguing and serve as an initial hook, as these vampires can walk in broad daylight, but this offering comes from Feel didn\'t show why viewers should keep watching.Sound (5/10)The problems don\'t end there; production wise, this thing is an epic fail. The score is acceptable with nice violin mix and soothing music, but its graphic spends too much to show the bright side of schooling despite all this vampire problem here. The same could be said to ED, which captures the enthusiastic fan-service of the show, something they didn\'t allow to bring on campus.Japanese seiyuu performances conform to the expected mix of cutesy interpretations. The voices is a loud, shrill assemblage of cheesy and cute accent; whenever something ""funny"" is supposed to be happening, a ""THIS IS FUNNY"" honk-beep cacophony starts blaring, nearly at the same volume as the dialogue.Overall (4/10)Now Fortune Arterial is a terrible show, but not because of the idea - its current season also aired one of the most censored eroge anime, a guy traveled to his place from childhood and got stuck up in one of the worst harem, so let\'s not pretend that somehow this particular idea is any more or less boring than anything else in its genre. No, this show is awful because it\'s unbelievably poorly constructed and executed – this is one of the worst vampire element of any fiction ever come in existence. At least Yosuga no Sora has the benefit of pretty landscape and soothing music; this series can\'t even manage that much or perhaps, it aimed to become even more than what a school romance could be, which often fails. on a peripheral Japanese island that he had once briefly stayed at several years ago.

It was adopted into a manga of the same name, and an anime called ""Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku (Red Promise)."" Some people were disappointed with the anime because of a lack of action scenes, which they assumed would be there de facto as the series had vampires. In case you have not seen Twilight, I have got some news for you: vampires do not equal action anymore. You just have to live with it. This show is basically slice of life, with friendship elements thrown to it. However, there is an overall plot, and it is heavily related to vampires, which is apparent from the very first scene of the very first episode, continuing to slowly progress, with mysteries being revealed at a steady pace.The story follows Hasekura Kouhei, a boy who frequently changes schools, feeling like a migratory bird. He is finally about to settle in Shakugan Gakuen (Academy), a six-year English-style school on Tamatsu island. The first person he meets is a pretty blonde girl that welcomes him warmly as the vice-president of the student council. However, just as they are about to shake hands, she, Sendou Erika, suddenly backs off and falls, acting strangely. When he asks her what is wrong, she says it is nothing, and promptly delegates the task of showing Kouhei the dorm to fellow student Hachimandaira Tsukasa, who had just walked by. Over there, he meets two sisters, Yuuki Hinata and Kanade, that remember Kouhei from childhood, as they used to play together on the island. Since he is a new student, Kouhei has to take pictures of various locations around school grounds. When he gets to the church, he helps a little girl find her pet rabbit, called Yuukimaru (""yuuki"" means snow, referring to the rabbit being white). The girl\'s name is Tougi Shiro, and she is a member of the ""Royal Ring,"" which is never actually explained as to what it is, just that it apparently has something to do with the church. He also encounters ""sister"" Amaike, who, as he heard from Tsukasa, hits misbehaving students with a fry pan. Kouhei spills this out to her, causing Amaike to be angry. He wisely decides to leave to look for the student council building to take pictures of it. Shiro goes with him to show Hasekura the location. However, her older brother, Tougi Seiichiro, sees them together when they arrive there. Seiichiro, with an angry expression, sends his sister away, and warns Kouhei to leave. Just then, another student interrupts. He is Sendou Iori, the cunning student council president, and it turns out that Tougi was actually warning Hasekura about Sendou. After Iori invites Kouhei in, the former causes a problem between the latter and Erika. She becomes upset with Kouhei, but later, she overhears him defending her. Then, Erika tells Kouhei to meet her under the zelkova tree, a place where people usually confess their feelings. He goes to the church first, where Kouhei sees something shocking, a boy biting a girl in the neck . . .I like the progression of the story in general, as it focuses on Kouhei trying to do his best with the duties entrusted to him. Also, he helps Erika whenever he can, causing their feelings for each other to grow in time. Others play a role as the show goes on, but not on the same level.You can see what I meant by slow development, but the characters are so likeable, you will want to get to know them. Hasekura Kouhei is a boy looking for something he has yet to find. A diligent girl who is the vice-president of the student council, Sendou Erika has to both keep a secret and struggle with her new, strange feelings around Kouhei; some fans wished for her to become Kouhei\'s girlfriend by the end, but there is no real conclusion to that aspect. Yuuki Hinata is a nice girl who is constantly by her sister\'s side and seems to have feelings for her childhood friend, Kouhei; I was rather disappointed that their relationship does not really develop throughout the show, and she instead befriends Erika, her rival. Becoming a good friend of Hasekura\'s and copying his homework, Hachimandaira Tsukasa is a nice guy that sometimes gets bullied by Kanade. A very energetic, outspoken, and childish girl, Yuuki Kanade is highly fond of her little sister, and is responsible for the dorm. In the sixth year of school, Sendou Iori is the sly, seemingly light-hearted president of the student council. A member of the student council, Tougi Seiichiro is calm, collective, serious, and very protective of his little sister; as their families have been friends for a long time, he is on good terms with Iori; it bothered me that he appears weak at a later episode, despite his usually-strong disposition. Tougi Shiro is a cute fourth-year girl who is a part of the Royal Ring; it is traditional for her family to perform a dance during a certain time of the year. Not very social, Kuze Kiriha is a calm and mysterious student at the school.The anime certainly lives up to its visual novel counterpart, with colorful, astonishing animation and character designs. I cannot recall a single mistake in that department. There is a lot of detail given even to the background characters, making them seem like they could be main ones, and the scenery is just spectacular.The opening and ending sequences are beautiful as well, with the former showing scenes of the main characters accompanied by an uplifting song, and the latter displaying the main females (save for the heroine, who appears in the last part, moving) wet in still pictures with calm music. The seiyuu generally fit their respective characters, with one in particular, Yuuki Hinata, a quiet and collective girl, being voiced by the same woman that did one of the heroines of Ef - a Tale Memories. (which happens to be my all-time favorite show), Miyamura Miyako, who is hyper and energetic in comparison.To be honest, in my opinion, this is the best story depicting vampires (and I have seen Twilight and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer); it does not change actors nor drag on for too long. The show is episodic for the most part, but it does have a powerful finale, though one might want more (action- and romance-wise). Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku is an anime that is worth the watch for those intelligent people who wish to learn about life. ""Fortune Arterial"" is actually the title of a visual novel. It was adopted into a manga of the same name, and an anime called ""Fortune Arterial: Akai Yakusoku (Red Promise)."" Some people were disappointed with the anime because of a lack of action scenes, which they assumed would be there de facto as the series had vampires. In case you have not seen Twilight, I have got some news for you: vampires do not equal action anymore. You just have to live with it. This show is basically slice of life, with friendship elements thrown to it. However, there is an overall plot, and it is heavily related to vampires, which is apparent from the very first scene of the very first episode, continuing to slowly progress, with mysteries being revealed at a steady pace.The story follows Hasekura Kouhei, a boy who frequently changes schools, feeling like a migratory bird. He is finally about to settle in Shakugan Gakuen (Academy), a six-year English-style school on Tamatsu island.

I can\'t compare this with any animes since it\'s my own tastes. but watching this animes really makes you want to scream out loud!

The desire that a person has for another, fighting through deadly pain just to keep that person safe knowing that you have to sacrifice your own life to keep the other one alive, ready to do anything for their happiness.

Main guy character really annoyed me for some reason i just wanted to punch him.  Main female was alright.  Only real development of some sort was with the the main female and her longing for blood.  The president guy was very annoying.  Tried to be funny but failed badly, but also dialouge also contributed.  He was more tolerable when he was serrious.  All other characters just existed and never were given any time for development of any sort.Enjoyment - I came to this anime expecting comedy/romance.  what i got during the entire series was ""fap/romance"".  didn\'t stick with its genre except for the romance and slice of life.  show also says ""comedy"" but that is not even existant in this show.  only ""comedy"" it attempts to do is during the president\'s dialogue, but he didn\'t even have impact.

You hear Lia, the singer of well known KEY titles, singing another good song that gives you the feel and illusion that this will be a promising show that will brighten your mood whenever you turn it on.Yes, this was my very first impression. How foolishly naïve I was at that time.Expectation: 8-9Episodes: -,-,-,5,7,5,7,8,8,9,7,4Actual: 6 (fine)Anlysis:Yes, this is a show about a boy who has luckily had no friends since he has traveled with his family constantly, who sets off, on his own of course,...to find himself. Something like that. So our male lead lands himself in the Academy with vampires. The first few episodes were rather impressive actually, as the lead slowly got involved with a substantial cast of characters. However, the plots ambition is larger than its episode capacity and realizes this after wasting much of its time on leisurely episodes with little purpose. While the ending does make good use of the what it has, it makes all the wrong choices. In the end we are left with another drama about vampires who want to really be human but really can't. Yet, the producers wanted to keep that type of ending so they threw logic out the window.While the story was a rollercoaster ride the male lead is not actually horrible. He is aggressive at the right times, a good human being, and a hard worker. He essentially makes all the right choices which is surprisingly very rare for his kind. Yet, almost all the characters in the show are perfect almost, and not very flawed. While the characters are pleasing they did not strike me as being distinct and noteworthy. You have your mandatory male friend who has no signifigance, the loli-ish sister who is also the motivater of the bunch, the intelligent person who doesn't try, two shy types, and our perfect vice-president vampire.Conclusion:While enjoyable at times this really was not long enough. Slightly average it would of still been really enjoyable nonetheless if they had not ruined the ending. Sort and simple this turned out to be the exact show one would expect it to be; predictable and average. Sadly I am giving this a little above average, out of a bit of dwindling expectations perhaps, a Fine out of 10. to find himself. Something like that.

Kohei and Sendo are the two main characters, and there blooming romance is cute and amusing to watch.  Sendo is a vampire that is trying to find a new way to live without sucking human blood.  The first part of the show is basically just setting up normal school life, while the second part is about sendo struggling with her urge to draw human blood.This is essentially what you are going to get out of watching this show.  A few amusing charecter...interactions and some good back story episodes.  You will also get the first taste of a fairly interesting story between sendo and Kohei, the problem is its cut short.  They have the framework hear for a truly excellent anime with great character setup and a possible unique story about a vampire choosing humanity rather than darker urges to feed.  The anime promptly ends just when it gets interesting.This is why I wait to review an anime until its over.  12 episodes is just to short for this kind of thing.  I recommend to watch this if a second season comes out, otherwise its fairly pointless. interactions and some good back story episodes.

I don't know why people hate obvious ending but i personally like it when the protagonist  in the end falls in love with the heroine...The ending was a bit out of story but the romance was good in the anime. And the story line was pretty obvious but thats the good thing... If its not obvious, there is no point of the romance... The reason why i gave this anime a 7 is that the romance is very good and not like those harem anime that make you so pissed at the end when...the protagonist don't choose one girl as his own... Those kind of anime just makes me so irritated although i know that is the feature of harem anime... Anyways, back to topic, this anime is a decent anime for people who are finding 1 on 1 romance anime and i kind of enjoyed it... There isn't a lot of comedy in this anime or eechi scenes don't expect too much... The purpose of this anime is clean romance not eechi so perverts who watch anime for nude scenes, this isn't the anime for you... ;) If you are looking for romance anime and don't know what to watch, this is the anime for you. the protagonist don't choose one girl as his own...

The plot after episode 8 is rather good and i feel that it allows you to actually care for the characters. Now is it anything amazing? Not really. I just really enjoy this plot. Now before episode 8 it is honestly a stereotypical slice of life anime. So really the plot after episode 8 does pick up the show a bit. I...can't say much more without spoiling it.Visuals are like i said just good. Hell visuals and music are just good. This show has nothing bad in it but they also don't try for something unique. I think the best term is safe.Character wise there are a few characters i don't like. Yet the other characters are rather good. The main two characters are rather good and i love Erika. I think that she is quite honorable in her desire to be normal. While the other characters kind of bring the rest of them together. These characters may not be good on their own but they are rather good together.Enjoyment again i said at the beginning this anime came out of no where for me.

The show however does have a plot and does not just include a bunch of unconnected episodes. It...uses its time to deepen and show us its characters and develops them nicely.The art is pretty nice, the characters are drawn well with some detail gone into them but for the most part are generic looking. It does suffer partly in the animation, some scenes are nicely animated but will occasionally get it wrong, it uses still shots of a character that should be moving and doesn't even bother animating people in the background and just have them there stuck which is a little off putting and is a little lazy. Backgrounds use a simple painting style and generally look ok.The opening song is a nice tune, it gits with the dark side of the show while not ignoring its lighter elements. Ending is a slow piano ballard. Voice actors did ok for this type of show, because of the type of characters this show has the over the top voices are expected and can be a little annoying and background music doesn't always fit but doesn't stand out too much.Hasekura Kyohei is the shows protagonist and is a some what decent lead, he knows what to do and isn't your typical shy boy, he is immiedietly appointed into the student council and ends up having to put together a sports event which he manages to do with little difficulty, he finds out aboutb the existance of vampires and sets out to help his friend.

However, this child takes more after Twilight. How unfortunate. Skip this one.Story: 4Starting out as a cheap rip-off of Key novels, the story seemed average at best. However, the more episodes I watched the more I hated myself for watching it. The overall plot is pretty stable, if mediocre. The dialogue is what really ruins the rest of the story. To be fair I watched it subbed, so the translator may be at fault. The general plot of the story is that the MC causes problems that he then fixes without...really doing anything. Such is the fate of anime adapted harem VN.Art: 4To be perfectly honest the art itself is ok, if a bit average. The shot composition is awful. It wasn't noticeable at first, but the longer I watched the more something was bothered me about the art. The director really owes an apology to the artists for that.Sound: 3The opening and closing are legitimately annoying. The overall soundtrack has a total of two good songs that they use at any dramatic moment. The seiyu tried their best, but as mentioned before the dialogue is awful.Character: 4There isn't a single interesting character in the show and they all have cookie-cutter problems. You have seen or will see these types of problems and characters in other shows. In those show they will be most likely handled better. Normally average characters and such would be rated a 5 by me, but as mentioned multiple times the dialogue sucks.Enjoyment: 3I have watched this show twice now. The first because it was related to a a much better show. That time when I watched it my mind went numb. When I watched it the second time as a refresher for the review I grew increasingly irritated. Neither time could I call the feeling enjoyment.Overall: 4After such a negative review, it may seem odd to only rate this show a 4. I don't mind cliches if they are executed well. They are not executed well in this show.  It is below average, with problems in every area of its making. But those problems are able to be ignored on an initial run through. Some people are just hungry for vampire romance. And sometimes people need a break for good anime. So this show wasn't broken enough to completely throw out. Just to ignore until there is nothing left. really doing anything. Such is the fate of anime adapted harem VN.Art: 4To be perfectly honest the art itself is ok, if a bit average. The shot composition is awful. It wasn't noticeable at first, but the longer I watched the more something was bothered me about the art. The director really owes an apology to the artists for that.Sound: 3The opening and closing are legitimately annoying. The overall soundtrack has a total of two good songs that they use at any dramatic moment. The seiyu tried their best, but as mentioned before the dialogue is awful.Character: 4There isn't a single interesting character in the show and they all have cookie-cutter problems. You have seen or will see these types of problems and characters in other shows. In those show they will be most likely handled better. Normally average characters and such would be rated a 5 by me, but as mentioned multiple times the dialogue sucks.Enjoyment: 3I have watched this show twice now. The first because it was related to a a much better show. That time when I watched it my mind went numb. When I watched it the second time as a refresher for the review I grew increasingly irritated. Neither time could I call the feeling enjoyment.Overall: 4After such a negative review, it may seem odd to only rate this show a 4. I don't mind cliches if they are executed well. They are not executed well in this show.  It is below average, with problems in every area of its making. But those problems are able to be ignored on an initial run through. Some people are just hungry for vampire romance. And sometimes people need a break for good anime. So this show wasn't broken enough to completely throw out. Just to ignore until there is nothing left."", 'Well, Fortune Arterial turned out rather decent in comparison to my initial expectations. Just knowing that this show is an adaptation of a standard harem-esque Visual novel immediately smelled like trouble, but surprisingly enough, the story did not degrade into a complete mess. That being said, this anime definitely had a lot of issues, mainly with pacing and a very generic plot. Even the vampire twist in this anime, which was done in a relatively untypical fashion, ended up not making much of a difference.The one flaw to VN adaptations is that, because there are usually multiple heroines in the original source material, adopting all...the storylines into a single coherent plot usually proves to be difficult. In that aspect, Fortune Arterial did a relatively good job of merging all the storylines together. The major issue here is that it did not do a good job with pacing each arc, and with only 12 episodes in the series, I’m not too surprised. For example, Haruna’s route felt way too rushed and, thus, the story and character development suffered tremendously.In fact, I could probably argue that the entire first half of the series, up till around episodes 7-9, were poorly put together with some very cliche plot twists and rushed character development. Even so, as rushed as the development may have been, the characters’ motivation and hard-work ethic is very easy to see, and quite a charming aspect to them in a sense.What the creators did right with this anime was it’s focus on the main relationship of the show; the story between our main protagonist Hasekura Kohei, and the Vice President Sendou Erika, who happens to be of vampire lineage. Their relationship got the most development in the last few episodes, and it was surprisingly well done, with a solid plot and a great atmosphere throughout most of the arc.While the ending to the series felt very much lacking (I seriously think the creators half-assed the final episode, and played it too safe), overall Fortune Arterial turned out into a surprisingly decent show watch. This show most certainly has it’s issues, and although it’s production quality was solid, the art and character designs just screams “generic”. There was a lot of potential in this show, especially the main relationship between Kohei and Erika, but that never quite reaches it’s full potential in the end.Instead we get a somewhat unremarkable slice of life, romance oriented anime. The romance aspect was probably the strongest part to this show, but even that also could have used some work. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching this show for the most part, not to mention this show has a pretty decent OP theme, sung by Lia of Clannad fame.Production Quality: 8.0/10Characters: 7.5/10Story: 7.0/10Setting: 7.0/10Overall Enjoyment: 7.3/10 (rounded down to a 7 on MAL)Feedback and comments (and criticisms) are always welcome :) the storylines into a single coherent plot usually proves to be difficult.

It's a story I've seen a thousand times, but it was one I...welcomed, which is odd considering I'm much of a cliche romance fan.

He almost instantly makes friends upon arrival and is made to be an events committee chairman. The plot sort of meanders after this point. It's about either his activities as a committee chairman, his past (and others he met in the past) or the lead heroine refusing to drink his blood (because she's apparently a vampire) because she wants to live life like a human. The vampire angle...is very poorly played out. You could replace it with the heroine coming from a distinguished family and being forced to find a fiancée at school or find herself being taken back home and the outcome would literally be the same.

It\'s a versatile series that moves between comedic and serious moments while maintaining an unexpectedly good pacing through the plot. If you\'re looking for a school-based harem/romance/comedy without all the tension and goth of Vampire Knight, check out this show.Animation:Though dated in appearance by 2012 standards, it\'s still a fairly pleasant piece of work with good effects and scene-appropriate lighting. A large portion of the...important scenes take place at night, perhaps just they can highlight the red eyes of the vampires. You can definitely tell that shortcuts were taken in certain scenes but at least I didn\'t notice any horrendous CGI blobs. There are some nice touches when it comes to character- siblings actually look as if they share genes, all the way down to ahoges. I do think that Shiro looks a bit too much like an Index clone but at least she doesn\'t end up nibbling on people\'s heads all the time. While the facial animations lack the precision of P.A. Works, they compare favorably to other harem shows such as Hagure Yuusha.This series has a minimal amount of action, most of which actually occurs in a single scene. There is some blood (come on.... vampires here...) but really action series have loads more blood in general. There are a few ecchi moments but they got away without having to use any supernatural lighting. Overall, this was a well-presented series.Sound:The story opens with an OP that can grow addictive after a few viewings and ends with a seemingly overly-dark/calm ED. While some episodes end on a note that merits this ED, other episodes end on a cheerful note that is completely upended by it. The BGM overall is supportive but nothing in particular stands out.The VA cast is unusually light in veterans. Daisuke Ono does a good job as our main protagonist but all of the heroines other than the least interesting older sister are relatively inexperienced. While Erika\'s VA does a good job with Erika\'s dynamic emotions, her voice does sound strained- giving Erika an unusually nasal sound. Regardless of their experience, the VAs successfully brought out each of their character personalities; and successfully made all the third wheels a non-factor relationship-wise.Story:A boy who constantly has to move due to his father\'s occupation finally has had enough and decides to move to a boarding school on an island he once lived on (obviously setting the stage for the obligatory childhood friend). He\'s soon greeted by the Vice-President of the school council, who mysteriously is taken aback when he offers to shake hands.This series follows this pair as early mistrust and misunderstandings soon grow into mutual understanding and friendship, and perhaps more? This main plot line is supported by various other stories involving the other girls that seemingly flock to our main protagonist. Unusually, some of these subplots merge in with the main plot line as if someone had actually done some planning- an outrageous thought considering some of the 2012 offerings in this genre. As Erika and Kouhei grow closer, mysteries arise around Erika and her vampire heritage. What I greatly enjoyed was the fact that you could take the ""vampire"" nature as a metaphor for any family/cultural restrictions and they would apply all the same. Eventually, the series winds to a fairly grand climax and closes with a conclusion that begs more questions than it answers. Unfortunately, the OVA only serves to further these unabated questions.I\'ll agree that there are also some seemingly important setting questions that are never resolved. For instance, all school administrators seem to be missing- leaving open the gaping question of how the school is practically run by vampires. But these aside, the plot was focused and well delivered. Most of the scenes served a valid purpose whether it be character explication or as a plot twist; only rarely was a scene present just for fan service value. While a predictable series, Fortune Arterial is definitely one of the better executed shows in its genre. In fact, it would have been one of the best if only they had presented a more satisfying conclusion.Character:Fortune Arterial presents a varied and satisfying cast ranging from the brash to the shy, and from the utterly carefree to the humorously (almost freakishly) overprotective. Our protagonist is a typical nice guy, but at least one of those who can make decisions when it matters. While the supporting heroines are mostly stagnant, the lead heroine is very dynamic. Her relationship with Kouhei is always under flux as she is torn between her individual values and those held by her heritage. It\'s an engaging dynamic that, in my opinion, is more valuable for character value than wanton shouting, violence, and sex.Almost all of the characters that have more than three lines of words have a good reason to be on screen, and I appreciated the effort to minimize excesses catered to supporters of the original work.Value:While not as stirring and romantically engaging as shows such as Mashiro Iro, Fortune Arterial presents itself well in presentation, styling, and execution. If not for the lack of a true conclusion, this would have made it into the coveted 8+ category. Despite this, it is still a solid show that deserves more than its current ranking.

It\'s an engaging dynamic that, in my opinion, is more valuable for character value than wanton shouting, violence, and sex.Almost all of the characters that have more than three lines of words have a good reason to be on screen, and I appreciated the effort to minimize excesses catered to supporters of the original work.Value:While not as stirring and romantically engaging as shows such as Mashiro Iro, Fortune Arterial presents itself well in presentation, styling, and execution. If not for the lack of a true conclusion, this would have made it into the coveted 8+ category. Despite this, it is still a solid show that deserves more than its current ranking. For this review, I re-watched the series and still found it much more entertaining than most of the shows that came out in Summer 2012. Tired of recent disappointments? Give this show a try.', ""A boy returns to an island to study, as fed up of being transferred around everywhere his family works, breaking up friendships,s and never really settling anywhere.   After meeting some new friends and reacquainting with some older friends from about 7 years before, he gets pulled onto the student council after discovering vampires are part of the school and student council.Despite being warned not to trust the brother our MC of course runs t his summons at the student council buildings before being given the choice of potentially losing all his memories or joining the school council.The plots transparent sadly of the brother...wanting a dependent for his sister, as he is comfortable drinking from victims and then erasing their memories.   His sister however wants to remain as human as possible, with the impossible dream of just feeding of transplant blood.As expected, she fights the urge, eventually feeds on the MC as was manipulated from the beginning, and then tries to avoid the MC after as the nearer she is to him, the worse the urge to a dysfunctional level she will drain him dry.   Stil the brother tries to manipulate the situation to get the MC to give him life and shreds of humanity to be her dependent or feeding bitch/slave.   With the MC, just continuing towards it, until Erika, goes home for the last penultimate episode in an attempt to stave of the urges.It's a bit harem style as a few girls surround him, not the usual vampire tale and very transparent on the brother's motives from start, with underlying tips of romance which the MC denies is like with Erika, but is it just denial, is it just want as shown through the anime of someone just trying to please everyone.   For me it fitted as a time filler, but not anything i would go back too wanting a dependent for his sister, as he is comfortable drinking from victims and then erasing their memories.

Granbelm,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39417/Granbelm,"['""I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.""- Romans, 8:18Have you ever wondered why you’re alive? It seems like such a silly question, one that a lot of people wouldn’t really...take seriously, but then again, there are others that spend their entire lives actively searching for the answer.Now how about this one… have you ever experienced so much loneliness, pain, and suffering that you wished you *weren’t* alive and wondered what the point of living was if it was going to be like that? Now we’re getting somewhere.I’m sure many of us, at some point in our lives, have felt absolutely lost, without direction, wondering what our purpose is and where we should be going, not understanding who put us here or why. And I know I’ve at least thought before, maybe more than a few times, that maybe it would be better if I wasn’t alive, that I was a waste of space, that the world didn’t need me, that nobody would miss me if I was gone, that I was basically nonexistent while simultaneously having to exist.And have you ever dreamed of… have you ever wished with all your heart for something that could miraculously rid your life of all the conflict, pain, suffering, sadness… completely and entirely, forever and ever?Granbelm, an original production that’s very clearly a passion project, hit me exceptionally hard because it explores and really dissects these very feelings that we’ve all experienced. As a matter of fact, the entire anime might be a cleverly masked commentary on finding self-purpose in life through challenges and obstacles. I’d have to say that it succeeds in doing such because it is not inherently obvious that its goal is exactly that until near the very end of the story.The story of Granbelm is driven almost entirely by its characters, and what an excellent job character development does on progressing the plot. At the very start, we as the audience are immediately thrown into a scenario that is extremely chaotic. We initially learn very little about what is going on, mirroring the perspective of our protagonist, Mangetsu Kohinata who also knows absolutely nothing. It is only until we begin to learn about each of the characters’ pasts and their reasons for participating in the tournament known as “GRANBELM” do we begin to find out crucial pieces of the puzzle that piece together to give a more formulated picture of what is truly happening and why. This type of plot development, relying heavily on individual character experiences and background, can ruin a story when done incorrectly – when the characters fall flat and the pieces don’t come together nicely, the plot itself becomes a jumbled mess. Granbelm, however, absolutely excels at tying each of the character’s stories into a beautifully presented package of an overarching plot that will simultaneously blow your mind and slice your heart in half.All of the seven girls participating in Granbelm are ultimately are fighting to become the one true mage, the Princeps, because they have a purpose: something that they’d give everything in the world up for, something so important and precious to them that they’d do anything to succeed by all means necessary. Whether it’s wishing for a miracle, fighting to fulfill what they consider their own purpose, proving their own self-worth, or simply fighting to find their own purpose, what matters most – the only thing that makes a difference in their strength in battle - is how much unshakable conviction they are able to invest into their ambitions. It’s this moral conflict that is at the very center of the premise of Granbelm: how far would you go, how strong are your desires, that you would destroy the dreams of anyone else to obtain them? Is it selfish to destroy everything and everyone in your way for that in which you find your own purpose, your own reason to live? And is it morally right to obtain and use something to which no single person should ever have access, something that shouldn’t exist, a power that could warp the whole world just to grant one wish?In this way, the battles each month at full moon both symbolize and literally represent the characters’ feelings and desires clashing against one another. All skill, practice, and talent are thrown out the window to give way to raw passion and emotion. Each of the characters’ mechs – their Armonoxs – are said to be a reflection of their inner selves and their souls, which ties perfectly into this moral dilemma whereby physical, tangible value of each of their greatest wishes is thrown out the window for the intangible, unmeasurable strength of desire that they possess. To me, this symbolism is an absolutely incredible and thrilling way of representing the many emotions experienced in life through a physical art form that can be seen, felt, experienced, and shared by anyone. Granbelm is able to transcend the limitations of expressing feelings through words by visually representing them, which meshes perfectly with the themes and goals of the story.Each girl has their own internal conflicts and are facing some form of suffering. And although six of the seven girls each have a distinct and obvious reason to fight, Mangetsu is set apart because she has no visible reason to desire becoming the Princeps mage. This is where the theme of suffering and the theme of morality in self-purpose come to clash: is there any meaning to living through pain and suffering, and is it right to obtain and take the “easy way out” by destroying anyone and anything in our way? And does it matter what our intentions are for doing so?____________________Besides the overarching narrative, there are a few other things I wanted to highlight that made Granbelm the masterpiece I see it as.The art and animation, although wonky at times, were outstanding for the amount of people working on the show. Very few animators were involved in this, and yet the amount of detail within every scene and the consistent fluidity in the animation really stood out. The mech designs, while… questionable, are entirely drawn in 2D. As a matter of fact, the entire show is in 2D, it’s just mind-blowing how much passion and love was put into this project. Of course, much of the staff that worked on Granbelm also worked on Re:Zero, so it’s not a surprise to see the quality of this production, especially in the direction, writing, and composition.The writing itself is littered with foreshadowing that I guarantee you won’t notice or understand until your second watch. Lots of things at first don’t make sense because as the audience we are thrown directly into confusion, but seeing how everything has progressed, I’m thinking it was an intentional decision to start this way. The foreshadowing combined with the plot twists take the story from extremely good to masterful.And now for perhaps the most impressive part of the show: the sound direction. I’d first like to give credit to Kenichiro Suehiro for making me absolutely sob uncontrollably during episodes 12 and 13 with his heartwrenching OST. The music altogether is top-notch – very orchestral and classical and reminds me a lot of a John Williams-type soundtrack that you’d see in something like Star Wars.Also like something from Star Wars, the sound effects in Granbelm are fantastic and add to the experience tenfold. The sound design and effects are distinctively “magically ethereal” and non-mechanical and fit the atmosphere of the show to a T.Most strikingly, the vocal performances throughout the entire series are through the roof. I’d like to specifically give a shout-out to Aoi Yuuki, who has given me chills countless numbers of times with her performance as Shuishou.Lastly, the characters themselves are impressively built and developed. None of the characters feel like cardboard cutouts and each clearly have their own unique purpose to the show. The most impressive part is how impressive the ‘villains’ are depicted – they have a distinct amount of depth to them whereby you can actually sympathize with them, understanding how they ended up the way they did. For a show with a cast as large as Granbelm and only 13 episodes to work with, every girl of our main seven was utilized to perfection and important in their own way. They all have their own desires, wishes, and hopes they are trying to obtain, and each of them is plagued by some type of pain.________________While the other girls are all suffering because of specific occurrences in their lives, Mangetsu’s suffering stems from the exact opposite - the LACK of occurrences, pretty much anything at all happening in her life. Her feelings of non-existence, and loneliness because she wants to be acknowledged by at least someone and has never been are what have led to her inner suffering and pain. Because she feels she has nothing, her goal is simply looking for a purpose for her own life, which she thinks she can find by participating in Granbelm, excelling, standing out, and winning. She has no desire in actually becoming the Princeps mage; rather, she desires to exist and be recognized and believes that simply by winning, she will obtain those things inherently. And also unlike her competition, she has no interest in the power that would come with winning. But although she doesn’t desire power, is it still okay for her participate and destroy those in her path for her own personal gain, to end her suffering? Through participating in Granbelm and interacting with the other girls and learning from her experiences, Mangetsu comes to realize that notoriety and recognition isn’t at all what she needed to obtain. Suffering from an existential crisis, she begins to understand that life is what she makes of it, not what other people make of her. Her progression from a person who is suffering and doesn’t care what she does as long as she gets noticed to someone who can appreciate and find purpose in life for what it is reflects the main purpose of the story:Suffering and pain are a crucial part of life. Life is filled with all sorts of challenges and obstacles that might seem impossible to overcome and make you want to give up, but it is precisely because of the fight to overcome our own struggles that we can find purpose in our lives. Furthermore, it is of high importance that we live life in an honest manner – without looking for shortcuts or the easy way out – and make the most of what we have.In the end, Mangetsu is able to fully grasp the opportunity to experience even the just the small things in life, appreciating the beauty in experiencing existence itself. All of life is a precious gift, and she is grateful for the ability to live, even grateful for experiencing suffering and pain. Her understanding of this and her selflessness in the very end ultimately is what liberates her from her chains and frees her soul, giving her true happiness.Like Mangetsu, the intimate and precious experiences of life itself - everything we think, feel, see, touch, and dream of, our wishes, our aspirations - are what give us hope of finding direction and the strength to keep living. It is precisely through finding and fulfilling our purpose in life, appreciating life for the gift it is, that we will truly and honestly be liberated from the shackles that bind us in life. Only then will we find peace and happiness and transcend all our suffering once and for all.The story of Granbelm is one of the best I have ever experienced, and I will never forget it.“Nothing in this world is that simple. But… The world is filled with so many feelings! Feelings like happiness, enjoyment, love… And of course, that’s not all. There’s frustration, sadness, hate… There’s regret, and desire… Hoping things will turn out the way you want, wishing for a miracle…. There are so many wishes that can’t be fulfilled. They’re forgotten, and then they gush forth again, eternally building this world.Humans live on… and that’s good enough. That’s how people can have hope, how they can live.”- Mangetsu Kohinata take seriously, but then again, there are others that spend their entire lives actively searching for the answer.Now how about this one… have you ever experienced so much loneliness, pain, and suffering that you wished you *weren’t* alive and wondered what the point of living was if it was going to be like that?

That’s how people can have hope, how they can live.”- Mangetsu Kohinata', ""The problem with anime and edge is that so often you get edge for the sake of edge rather than edge as the result of well thought out ideas and the natural conclusion of events. And while Granbelm tries to be interesting with its edge, it fails massively and comes off as yet another edgefest that has no idea how to write its ideas well.The biggest rub is that Granbelm does have some good ideas. There is intrigue in a competition where girls compete to be the sole magical entity in the world. The premise is a bit forced but there is a lot to...work with there. You can show why all the characters want that power, how they react when they don't get it, and the lengths that they'll go through for that power. And while Granbelm attempts to hit some of this ideas, and even comes close in some cases, the execution and result is quite lacking and lackluster. For example in the first episode there is a girl who is clearly in the battle, loses, and thusly loses her magical abilities. Rather than exploring this girl and her circumstance and the future that she must now pivot, they just cast her off and focus on less interesting characters. This is a theme with Granbelm.Because despite having some interesting characters in its cast, Granbelm decides to focus on the most bland of the characters. We have the traditional pink haired magical girl who has no talents, no purpose in life, but for some reason seems to be really good at this magic thing despite never having any experience in it what so ever before. And second to her is the magical girl with long black hair, insane skills and work ethic, who happens to be very cold. Both of these tropes have been done to death. And while a good show can be made out of tired tropes, neither of these two are particularly interesting, and it's even more frustrating when they take away time from much more interesting characters in the cast.For example, Anna is a girl from a talented mage family who has a grudge against Ernesta. It is clear she hates her for some reason and has a burning desire to out do her. As the show progresses her mental state erodes and you can see how the stress of the competition and her hatred is effecting her. But despite this she is more of a side character than a main one. There are interesting points to her character and her relation with Ernesta but it's often seen in the lens of Ernesta, the main character, rather than Anna. By focusing on Ernesta more the show willingly focuses on a much weaker and flat character and don't explore the interesting traits of Anna quite nearly as much as they should.This is what the show is like as a whole, it'll bring up good ideas, give hope that it'll explore them and cover something meaningful before diverting back to Mangetsu and Ernesta and ending up failing its potential. The most baffling thing about this show though is despite how edgy it tries to be, whenever the show can actually do something with that edge and give an interesting situation for the characters the show decides to zag in a different route to give a slight less edgy but also a lot less interesting result. It's as if it's trying to both be as edgy and uninteresting as possible. So while the show is very content to make the characters miserable and to make their lives that much worse with each episode, it's also content to take a slightly less miserable path if it means that the characters won't have to react to something interesting or unique.The art is actually pretty good, and would be nice to have in a much better show. Sadly, the problems with Granblem far outweigh the good art. The sound is passable and doesn't help or hurt the show. The production of the show is pretty good although the fight scenes to me are still pretty boring. They can be dynamic, but they lack the power to really make them shine.Overall Granbelm is a massive disappointment and forgoes its interesting ideas for bland uninteresting edge. I don't recommend it for anyone unless you need more edge in your life and have ran out of other options. work with there. You can show why all the characters want that power, how they react when they don't get it, and the lengths that they'll go through for that power.

Well, this is the time to retract and eat my own words. Granbelm is a good show, underestimated and hated by anime enthusiasts for no reason; One cause cannot be that the director of Granbelm is the same as Re: Zero. Besides, a score below 7.0 is not valid for a series that has some substance, emotion, an acceptable story, and some charming characters.From my perspective, Granbelm\'s story is the strongest point in the series. The plot configures two worlds where all the characters interact. These...two environments, a real-world, a combat scenario, are directly affected by magic and are the premise of several details that will appear as the story progresses. The idea of the combat scenario is to create a world where the main characters or the selected magicians can use magic robots called ""Armanox,"" and they fight for all the magical power that disappeared from the world (Magiaconatus). The last standing magician will become the ""Princeps Mage"" and will be worth to use the Magiaconatus. Yes, I know what you\'re thinking, what the he ..., that sounds messy, the story can be confusing at first, but it is entertaining. I can not explain more because it could spoil the plot with small details. Following that order of ideas, the main characters are the mages who will fight each other. I find it very interesting how the authors fused the two worlds with the help of the characters. They compete in the magical world, and they can be friends, enemies, in the real world, and they do not know what could happen after each fight.The characters are the magicians. Unfortunately, one of the things that could have scared many viewers is that the entire cast is feminine, so a large group will think it could be a junk story, a fan service story, cute girls doing cute things, but none of that fits this show.There are two main characters, Mangetsu and Shingetsu. The rest of the cast is secondary because they stimulate Mangetsu and Shingetsu’s traits.Mangetsu or the girl who has nothing. She appears in the magical world without any magical knowledge and is found worthy of using an Armanox. As the story progresses, its complexity and behavior run brilliantly.Shingetsu ""the white."" However, her Armanox is black, but she is wiser than Gandalf. I wanted to give a little magic reference lol. She is one of the strongest magicians. She fights following her ideals and wants to become Princeps for a personal reason. She needs Mangetsu to become a good character. Sometimes her decisions are painful, and she fulfills her role fantastically.Suisho or the girl who will die soon, I thought that. A complex character with a lot of background. You must pay attention to all her information because it is the most complex character in the series.Nene or the magical genius with an exciting story. She is the most resourceful character, and her background is a need for the story progressionAnna or cry and angry girl. She considers herself very special and powerful. Maybe it is, or perhaps it\'s just another aspiring magician. However, she fulfills Shingetsu emotions and boosts her traits and background.Shisui or she will fight for her. She fights for a relative, and she is a need to show the real face of a certain mage.Rosa or the girl who steals some time in front of the screen. She fights ... without further details.All characters contribute to the story in some way. The most important part, they give and add details to the story, and their features are totally different. Furthermore, their background is diverse, so their actions and development vary, which gives the story a refresh of the casual generic characters that appeared in the season * cough tra *.Art and animation are good. The fights are not ugly; the effects are acceptable, followed by good movement and a proper configuration that varies from one mage to another. Also, the powers and Armanox are subtle. The real world has beautiful and vivid colors, and the magical world changes according to the scenario.The sound is excellent and the VO is acceptable. I think the most influential part is how the interpretation conveys some feelings to the public. I know it\'s not a great VO, but it\'s okay. Also, I\'m glad to hear Aoi Eir singing again (well, she came back several months ago, but I\'m happy she has recovered as I expressed to her in the past), the opening is good and has good lyrics.Finally, the show has a different air than the usual magic fight series. It is refreshing, and if it was an experiment, it ended acceptably. I cannot complain about Granbelm. The series has good pacing, the story fragments are explained in the perfect time, and they help the characters to grow and shine. Yes, the show is not excellent, it could have been better, but it is the season\'s hidden gem and deserves to have a second chance. two environments, a real-world, a combat scenario, are directly affected by magic and are the premise of several details that will appear as the story progresses. The idea of the combat scenario is to create a world where the main characters or the selected magicians can use magic robots called ""Armanox,"" and they fight for all the magical power that disappeared from the world (Magiaconatus).

In essence, this work, by the director of the infamous Re:Zero, is an isekai (sort of) magical girl mecha battle royale where the last mage standing will get the mysterious macguffin that grants wishes. We are introduced to the protagonist Mangetsu who is your usual ""do-no-wrong"" character who mysteriously ends up in the Magical World despite only those with mage ancestry being able to, and totally does not have a super power lying dormant within her because plot twist plot twist plot twist. Mangetsu becomes aware...she does not have a personality so she instead joins in the battle royale to help Shingetsu fulfill her wish.In this world, magic existed once back in ancient civilization until it was sealed by a circle of mages who sacrificed their lives to do so, but apparently they didn\'t do such a good job since there are still magic users on Earth and they are able to use magic powers, in and out of the separate world. Despite this magic originally being used by the oldest civilizations of Europe and West Asia, all of the current magic users happen to be pubescent Japanese girls. It would\'ve been much more interesting if it used Japanese history or folklore as to explain this, but alas the writers must\'ve realized that would take effort.Mecha battles within the magic world consist of characters winning based on how many times they say ""envision"" or which character remembers their backstory and motivations the hardest. There are also other asspulls such as characters randomly triggering super powers that allow them to win based on how angry they are or random magic powers that weren\'t ever used prior. The constant back and forth rivalry of Shingetsu and Anna becomes tiring when you realize Shingetsu is just a Mary Sue and Anna is your designated character to hate for that part because she\'s a pompous yandere that would likely just stop being that and become a good person in the future. Unfortunately it\'s not like we can really know because it drops it almost immediately after it reaches its crux to instead turn back to Shingetsu and the alternating path of bullshit.Conveniently, these mecha called ""ARMANOX"" are the ""reflection of the user\'s soul"" or some drivel like that as to explain why characters don\'t ever have to be any good at using the mecha and can just rely on the writers to decide how it should all go. They then proceed to do this for other magical manifestations because yes.The wish granting macguffin of this magical world battle royale only involves the most basic motivations when it comes to character\'s reasons for obtaining it. It\'s not like I was expecting something on the level of the movie Stalker when it comes to philosophy surrounding such a wish granting device but it\'s like they didn\'t even want to try, their motivations never really change or are questioned, they simply exist. It\'s not like there is any room for characters to even philosophize because everyone that is on the ""good side"" is a complete yes man for Shingetsu while every villain is just a crazy woman that lusts for power.There\'s also some conflict between Suishou and uhh the other white haired girl over her sister which is so poorly conveyed that it\'s laughable. This conflict is also poorly concluded before it\'s vestiges are used just to power Shingetsu\'s motivations. At least the creators were smart enough to realize how boring and forgettable the characters were so they color coded them.My initial predictions at the start of the show were aiming for a more ""generic pseudo-deep"" approach and while the show is certainly trying too hard to be deep, I did not account for the sheer stupidity of the writers and their infatuation with PLOT TWISTS. It showers in these plot twists to cover up for a lack of depth to the story, characters, and the narrative as a whole. It actually makes everything worse as it feels like they made it up on the spot with build up to it and roundabout dialogue just being for the reveal itself. Mangetsu\'s reveal encapsulating this with everyone going ""MANGETSU IS...."" and constantly reminding you that Mangetsu indeed is. It\'s soap opera tier of writing. Why do people know of Mangetsu\'s true identity? They just do. What purpose does it serve the characters to reveal this information? None, it\'s all done for the sake of a plot twist. Chalk it up to more shallow writing about ""the soul"" or something if you really want to.As stated twice before the story has this really good trait of building up arcs, concluding them awfully, then adding the characters involved in it to the Shingetsu motivator waste dump, Mangetsu included. She goes from protagonist that is a Shingetsu worshiper to just a Shingetsu worshiper, and quite literally exists to be a useless motivator character because goddamn if anime characters always need someone to pepper them with platitudes across the show before they actually succeed. Then of course, every scene with Mangetsu doing so has the most manipulative music like they really break out the violins when characters are saying ""The world is filled with feelings"" as if it\'s some grand revelation, my god.The artstyle and design is ultimately ""whatever."" There\'s a lot of ""same face"" which also explains the color coding and they over utilize the exaggerated faces for the sake of portraying someone as crazy or mad. Also the mecha have awful designs that look like toys more than anything dangerous.If someone looks at this as a ""dark magical girl"" show and begins referencing Madoka then that\'s when you know it\'s bad. If you want ""dark magical girl"" just watch Utena. If you want mecha, watch Gundam. If you want a story with plot twists and character intrigue, read Dostoevsky. If you want an anime with a cast of bright haired anime girls then go watch whatever waifubait show is on this season.

Don\'t watch this, it\'s a complete waste of time.', 'The dark magical girl genre has been around ever since Madoka, so close to a decade. One could think everything has already been done before, but no, every once in a while a new one comes around that still has something new to show.Granbelm is one of these series. It came up with an impressive combination, it is some sort of a dark magical girl mech battle royale show, something like a Holy Grail War but instead of masters and servants, with magical girls and mechs.The dark magical girl part speaks for itself, if you like the genre you probably will enjoy Granbelm too. By...the genre\'s nature, several characters are pushed to the extremes, looking like they are borderline insane, but they do have their reasons, all of them have, except the main girl, who is kind of a wild card. She seemingly has no reason to participate in this ""Holy Grail War"", she also has strange powers noone can explain, I would say she is the main mystery of the show.Now about the mechs. I am not a big mech fan, but I like them here. They have an unusual, interesting design that I haven\'t quite seen yet. The mech battles are very interesting and great looking. It is not just the usual ""robots are bashing each other"" stuff. They all have different powers, use different tactics and sometimes they can do some random unexpected stuff.So far I am really enjoying the show, from episode 1 to 5 it keeps on improving from episode to episode. It is also not too predictable, so I am looking forward to see where it will be taking us. the genre\'s nature, several characters are pushed to the extremes, looking like they are borderline insane, but they do have their reasons, all of them have, except the main girl, who is kind of a wild card.

(Warning, slight spoilers ahead)Granbelm starts as Fate~ish battle royale with taints of Madoka Magika, employing mechas that are called Armanox, where Mangetsu (our MC) suddenly gets warped into another dimension (If you ask, this isn't an isekai, it's just an alternate reality that takes place each full moon, where our girls will fight) And gets targeted by other...witches until Shingetsu (a mysterious black girl) comes to her aid.Granbelm's best selling point are their characters. And while some of them might be a little annoying due to how edgy they might seem, most of them have their reasons to participate in Granbelm in order to become the Princeps, which will concede them a wish. However, Mangetsu is the only girl among the others who doesn't have a clear goal, taking part on Granbelm as a way to find that something she's missing on her life. Eventually, the rest of the characters will get their background story that carries their motivation, be it family issues, frustration, or even a curse, each story is carefully developed at the right pace and complements the world building, specially about Granbelm and the wizard's lineage.Granbelm's first episodes focus mostly on developing and introducing the main cast while Mangetsu experience Granbelm. However, after reaching a certain part of the story, more and more questions regarding Mangetsu will start to raise: Who is she?, why most of her memories are blank?, why does she have so much magical power while missing her witch inheritance? All these questions have an answer, and while I can say that I guessed correctly what Mangetsu was, the execution of her twist was done greatly, with a dark and psychological tone, driving us towards one of the best parts of Granbelm: How much Mangetsu matured during all this time as she deals with her identity crisis, realizing how there are many things in life that are worth and how beautiful is to live without being tied to the things you think you need, after all, if we had the capability of getting everything we could wish for, would we really be complete? Would we be depriving ourselves of the ability to grow?***Slight spoilers ahead***After Mangetsu's twist, her connection with Granbelm and the Magiaconatus, we will realize, that the real main character here is Shingetsu, the girl who was gifted with powerful magic in order to attend to the trials of the Magiaconatus as she fights on Granbelm. However, having so much power made her unhappy, the only thing she wanted was to have a real friend, to be with someone you could have fun with, to be with someone which you could count on and have the ability to grow. Many times, even after her childhood friend Anna were eradicated from this world, the anime doesn't forget her and shows us many memories of Shingetsu's past as she was hanging out with Anna when they were kids, noticing how Anna was unable to realize how much things she had in life, as she was slowly blinding herself into an spiral of rage and frustration all thanks to the magic, which became the reason why Shingetsu wanted to be the Princeps after winning against all her rivals, in an attempt to free the world from the magic that retains the real happiness***End of spoilers***Another great selling point of this anime, its the animation and the sound department. Granbelm is faithful to the traditional 2D animation as the recent industry is starting to lean towards CG animation, specially seen in the design of the Armanox as all of them are 2D models, which helps a lot in battles as it makes them more fluid. Background scenery is also marvelous filled with many details and beautiful landscapes, all of them with an adequate color palette depending on the tone of the scene. The only thing that might not be that attractive is the fact that the character designs looks for the most part, generic, that, and the odd looking mechas that looks like compacted Gundamns due to how small they are. However, is just a matter of getting used to it. The soundtrack of this anime is really good, with epic music for each battle, sad themes for sad moments or serious themes for serious moments, and what not, the anime also knows very well when to be silent. I've gotta give kudos to the overall voice acting as it was done greatly to portray each character and their personality, specially Mangetsu. The SFX are full hype and add a lot of impact in battle scenes, it reminds me a lot of the powerful SFX Planet With had. I've got one complaint tho, Magetsu's Armanox sounds like Togepi from pokémon xD.And that's all, Granbelm end up being one of the biggest surprises this season and I must say, that despite not looking that appealing, it was worth my time, specially the time invested in the characters, story and the Stunning spectacle it was, being one of the best anime this season. Give Granbelm the chance it deserves.Overall: 7.5/10 witches until Shingetsu (a mysterious black girl) comes to her aid.Granbelm's best selling point are their characters.

Give Granbelm the chance it deserves.Overall: 7.5/10"", 'I simply have NO words to describe the season\'s (based on MAL) top underrated, most criminally overlooked, least-watched show. All I can say is: pure adrenaline and non-stop anger and excitement stemming from the show from start to finish, and before you cry foul at this show, hear me out. And before you ask, I highly request that you DO NOT USE the ""3 episode rule"" as that will seriously detriment the entire show\'s overall imparting values and purposes.The dark fantasy genre stems as far as Madoka Magica, and Granbelm matches it in the same atmosphere. Combine that with the mecha genre of it being...a battle royale show of girls with magical spirits, this show is simply astoundingly stunning in the most flattering way possible. To top the icing on this cake, the production team that is from the phenomenal Isekai show Re:Zero, paired with talented scriptwriter Jukki Hanada, worked together to form this masterpiece of a show in both character design and story settings.NOTE: This review will be kept away spoiler free so it\'s up to you to find out the mystery elements of the show!The story in a nutshell exists in a world where magic used to be commonplace, but for the same reason, it vanished with the resolution that it wages wars for millenia. To this, the netherworld has all the magic sealed to stop the issue from recurring ever again. That didn\'t stop things though, as magic is back with a vengeance via the netherworld entity deciding to hold a free-for-all, no-holds barred tournament of sorts, to find the next successor (or mage rather) of Granbelm. That\'s what you know from the get-go...until the insane plot twists keeps on happening and flushes you off-guard with the character cast and their various one-off motivations to be the next chosen one, to grant a wish of their very own. Yes, it sounds cliche, but when the production staff knows how to utilize these to a great effect, it shows the core strength of the series overall.For the part and cast of characters:Main (Support) Character Mangetsu Kohinata, voiced by Miyuri Shimabukuro (of Carole & Tuesday\'s Carole and Hanebado!\'s Nagisa), her story of getting involved with Granbelm is a very convoluted one. As average as she is, without any dreams or aspirations, she is completely fine with her kindness and helpfulness making up for her lack of uniqueness. The only thing stopping her from doing is the feeling of being ""empty"" inside, a soulless spirit. Unless she does something of value, that is how she gets satisfied deep within that she is nothing more than a ""tool"". Her name means ""full moon"", mirroring...The next (another Main) Character, Shingetsu Ernesta Fukami, voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki (of Kono Oto Tomare!\'s Houzuki and Mahoutsukai no Yome\'s Chise), is more than just being Mangetsu\'s helper and best friend in the crux of getting involved in Granbelm. At start, being opposed with Mangetsu joining the battle royale is a deep challenge, but seemingly as worried as she is, she still coaches Mangetsu to teach her to make a stand in Granbelm and increase her courage to fight for the things that she yearns to protect. Her name means ""new moon"", mirroring Mangetsu (get it? The Two Princeps???). She too also has a friend, whom is jealous of the power that when wielded, can change hearts and minds to the most corrupt...And that character is Anna Fugo, voiced by Yoko Hikasa (of Arifureta\'s Tio). With her family descending from a long line of powerful mages, she was supposed to be blessed with insane magic power (as royal family lineages tend to go), but the moment when Shingetsu appeared in the picture, she was essentially the unwanted child, the doomed/cursed one from the get-go. And as children tend to go with being friends with either friend or foe, it caused the rift between her and Shingetsu until the cold, hard truth came to light, and one of them had to be the sacrifice (I\'m sure you could guess who). The demon actress in the spotlight to Anna is...Suishou Hakamada, the carefree mage with no loyalty and a rebellious heart, voiced by the one and only masterpiece of an VA, Aoi Yuuki. First being an assistant for Anna, she seems like the type to wander around looking for a firm foundation to set her assimilation of a ruptured plan into action of wrecking hearts and mind-game manipulation. Think of her as the kind of person who is like a final villain boss, but only seemingly scarce at the tip of the iceberg that is smart enough to not divulge information about her strengths and weaknesses. Often a manipulator who has survived in Granbelm for time millenia, her coincidence with the next person is one of long-lasting hatred...And that person is Kuon Tsuchimikado, voiced by Iwaka Manami (of Maquia\'s Maquia and the new Fruits Basket\'s Tohru). Between Kuon and Shishou, the fight for justice extends beyond Granbelm, as Kuon is dealt a bad hand at the start when her older sister got heavily involved with Suishou and caused her to be out in the running for Granbelm with a magically induced coma. Man, talk about reverse psychology. Since then, her only motivation is to eliminate Suishou with the hopes that if she was killed, then her sister could be revived somehow. ALAS...that\'s not the end of the problem there...*watch the show to find out*The seemingly random character that is Nene Rin, voiced by Yurika Kibo (of Seishun Buta Yarou\'s Kaede and Love Live!\'s Hanayo). Her relation to Granbelm is through Mangetsu\'s younger sister, and knowing that Mangetsu herself got caught up with the influences that is Granbelm itself, that she started taking notice of Mangetsu and her track record in the netherworld universe, only for said character to eliminate her from the running. That\'s not all though, as she serves as an essential strategist and invesigator into the events of Granbelm and its many secrets.Since this series is character-driven, I must say that the character cast and the respective VAs doing this job is dynamically and incredibly spectacular, especially hats off to some for stellar performances (i.e. Aoi Yuuki, hers was heart-wrenching incredible to the highest degree).The art and animation by the small (but growing) studio that is Nexus, HOLY SHIT is that a production so capable of showing the finest detail and levels of art and smooth, stunning animation that looks and feels like an actual show being made not just for the sake of crap, but actually making out a lot of sense. As Re:Zero\'s director Masaharu Watanabe inputs his most ingenious of a conspicuously original show from the pedal to the metal, plus adding that together with character designer Shinichirou Otsuka, aside from the striking similarities of Re:Zero to this show. this was a well done product through and through.What\'s even better, is the music. Music director Kenichiro Suehiro might\'ve put forth one of the best OSTs ever heard this year, and I\'m not even kidding at the non-obtuse and varied lengths of composed music for this show. Starting with the OP by Eir Aoi, her voice in song is always great, no surprise there, she is always the juggernaut when it comes to shows with action (i.e. SAO and the spin-off Alternative). The ED is one that caught me by surprise, with Uru\'s ""Negai"" (translated ""desire""), while a calm and soothing song, search and translate the song to find its hidden messages that speaks volumes about the characters and how they\'re involved with each other in subtle ways. Especially, the fight/action-mecha BGM set-pieces, *muacks* magnifiqué.MARK MY WORDS when I say that Granbelm is definitely one of the strongest anime of the year, however one that is grossly underrated and overlooked...at the tip of the iceberg. Definitely my AOTS and if I think this is better than Re:Zero, it equals said series with its insane levels of realism and running high at playing the emotion game with us. a battle royale show of girls with magical spirits, this show is simply astoundingly stunning in the most flattering way possible. To top the icing on this cake, the production team that is from the phenomenal Isekai show Re:Zero, paired with talented scriptwriter Jukki Hanada, worked together to form this masterpiece of a show in both character design and story settings.NOTE: This review will be kept away spoiler free so it\'s up to you to find out the mystery elements of the show!The story in a nutshell exists in a world where magic used to be commonplace, but for the same reason, it vanished with the resolution that it wages wars for millenia. To this, the netherworld has all the magic sealed to stop the issue from recurring ever again. That didn\'t stop things though, as magic is back with a vengeance via the netherworld entity deciding to hold a free-for-all, no-holds barred tournament of sorts, to find the next successor (or mage rather) of Granbelm. That\'s what you know from the get-go...until the insane plot twists keeps on happening and flushes you off-guard with the character cast and their various one-off motivations to be the next chosen one, to grant a wish of their very own. Yes, it sounds cliche, but when the production staff knows how to utilize these to a great effect, it shows the core strength of the series overall.For the part and cast of characters:Main (Support) Character Mangetsu Kohinata, voiced by Miyuri Shimabukuro (of Carole & Tuesday\'s Carole and Hanebado!\'s Nagisa), her story of getting involved with Granbelm is a very convoluted one. As average as she is, without any dreams or aspirations, she is completely fine with her kindness and helpfulness making up for her lack of uniqueness. The only thing stopping her from doing is the feeling of being ""empty"" inside, a soulless spirit. Unless she does something of value, that is how she gets satisfied deep within that she is nothing more than a ""tool"". Her name means ""full moon"", mirroring...The next (another Main) Character, Shingetsu Ernesta Fukami, voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki (of Kono Oto Tomare!\'s Houzuki and Mahoutsukai no Yome\'s Chise), is more than just being Mangetsu\'s helper and best friend in the crux of getting involved in Granbelm. At start, being opposed with Mangetsu joining the battle royale is a deep challenge, but seemingly as worried as she is, she still coaches Mangetsu to teach her to make a stand in Granbelm and increase her courage to fight for the things that she yearns to protect. Her name means ""new moon"", mirroring Mangetsu (get it? The Two Princeps???). She too also has a friend, whom is jealous of the power that when wielded, can change hearts and minds to the most corrupt...And that character is Anna Fugo, voiced by Yoko Hikasa (of Arifureta\'s Tio). With her family descending from a long line of powerful mages, she was supposed to be blessed with insane magic power (as royal family lineages tend to go), but the moment when Shingetsu appeared in the picture, she was essentially the unwanted child, the doomed/cursed one from the get-go. And as children tend to go with being friends with either friend or foe, it caused the rift between her and Shingetsu until the cold, hard truth came to light, and one of them had to be the sacrifice (I\'m sure you could guess who). The demon actress in the spotlight to Anna is...Suishou Hakamada, the carefree mage with no loyalty and a rebellious heart, voiced by the one and only masterpiece of an VA, Aoi Yuuki. First being an assistant for Anna, she seems like the type to wander around looking for a firm foundation to set her assimilation of a ruptured plan into action of wrecking hearts and mind-game manipulation.

The premise even though it seems overused actually felt original and with the different twists every now and then it shouldn\'t have had this low of a score. However while watching it I just felt cringe and disappointment.As I stated the premise for this show is quite good even though there is a bunch of shows already with a similar vibe to it, cute girls doing really messed up shit, but I still was semi excited to watch it. However, after watching the first episode I was quickly turned off with how bad it was...and stopped watching it. Later after a few more weeks when more episodes were out I picked it back up again only to be disappointed once again.This show had some good qualities to it though. The OST was amazing and one of the best this season, the uniqueness of some scenes were honestly fun to watch, one which stands out to me was in episode 13 when Suishou was talking with Shingetsu and her shadow was on the pillars and the angle of the scenes actually made me feel terrified and was amazing. Suishou as a character was awesome from her creepy body movements when her body turns into a black figure and distorts as well and her voice at times, genuinely gave me chills. Her backstory was dark and her charisma was a joy to watch. She was what made the show for me and kept me being able to continue watching it.However, even with the twist about Mangetsu and even what happened to her at the end it didn\'t honestly shocked me or get me to say, ""WTF"", I just felt nothing. Maybe it\'s because the rest of the show was such a turn off for me with Anna\'s constant screaming and bickering that even when knowing why she acts the way she acts you still feel nothing for her and just wishes she jumps off a bridge, as well as the rest of the characters just being a bore and an annoyance. Most of the characters were just one dimensional beside Suishou, I would of said Shingetsu as well but towards the end she just became bland.Now, with all this said do I think that this show is not worth watching at all? No, I think it has some amazing qualities which were a joy to watch at times, but the rest of it was such a boring cringe fest that I couldn\'t honestly feel any excitement when the time came. In all I would say watch the first 2-3 episodes and if you don\'t like it stop because the amazing things you will see afterward are not worth the torture of getting to that point. and stopped watching it.

Granbelm, a story about magical girls driving mecha in a Battle Royale competition on nights of Full Moon, turns out to be a fantastic work from a lean yet experienced staff team that combines delicately written characters, excellent mecha animations and a thrilling roller coaster story plot.Story abstract: On a night of the Full Moon,...ordinary high school girl Mangetsu Kohinata accidentally entered straight into a Magical Girl Mecha Battle Royale competition named Granbelm. With the help of new transfer student Shingetsu, she managed to made it through that night and opened up a series of events that would affect every single competitor left in Granbelm, as well as the true nature of this centuries long fight between magician families.The anime seems at first sight to be a mixture of the likes of Madoka Magica, Fate series and chibi Gundam, but notice the staff composition and you\'ll be convinced that there\'s much much more than just a rehash of such ideas. Directed by Masaharu Watanabe, the one director that set off the explosive anime phenomenon known as Re:Zero back in 2016, Granbelm proved to be a roller coaster of a ride from episode to episode, seeing emotional scenes across the whole 13 episodes meshed with interesting mecha fights.What\'s even better is the contribution of Scriptwriter Jukki Hanada, one of the best writers in the whole industry today that has lent his hands on leading the writing of so many well admired creations of recent years (Steins;Gate, A Place Further Than The Universe, No Game No Life, Sound Euphonium, Nichijou, Chunibyo, Beyond The Boundary, Bloom Into You, Princess Jellyfish, Lovelive Series, Hitori Bocchi\'s ○○ Lifestyle etc.). The dialogues between the main characters - notably clashes between Mangetsu, Shingetsu, Anna, Suishou, Nene and Kuon - echoes some of his best writing in his previous works. As a writer well known for writing interactions between young people, he certainly have contributed to the most emotional scenes in this work - ones that have the power to make you cry.The plot might be the weakest part of this work, yet even here the story is well structured and fairly well paced, switching between mecha fights, SOL scenes and dialogues between main characters evenly. While the show starts out slow and perhaps confusing to the casual watcher, this is done on purpose as the true identity behind the tournament and main characters are painstakingly pieced together towards the end. There are hints spilled over the whole series and the production team have managed fairly well in making use all of them by the end, leaving few loose ends.The main cast of characters are probably as well developed as they can within a single season, IMHO even broadly comparable with the well-loved cast of Madoka Magica. Unlike Madoka Magica though, our main characters Mangetsu and Shingetsu are of less straight forward personalities as the famous Madoka/Homura pair, and do not be surprised that you feel disconnected with them initially, for there are good reasons with their seemingly weak and even aloof personalities that would be explained deep within the story. This may be controversial, however they feel even more ""down to Earth"" than many of the magical girls shows around.The best character developments in this show goes to the veteran VAs voiced Anna and Suishou, who prove to be characters that one will approve and fill pity with as their importance within the story unfolds. Other characters - notably Nene and Kuon - also fill in the plot development with moving scenes.VAs have done an excellent job in here too. One doesn\'t have to hear further than the magical voicing skills of famous Yoko Hikasa (Anna) and Aoi Yuuki (Suishou) to become magically attracted to this anime. Other potential future mainstay VAs of the anime world - the likes of Atsumi Tanezaki (Shingetsu) and Miyuri Shimabukuro (Mangetsu) - are also performing well here to round out the interactions between characters. Even the background music are set out well across all scenes, and one must not forget about the contribution of excellent OP and ED from well known Eir Aoi and Uru. There\'s even Yukari Tamura contributing to one of the inside songs in one episode!And then there\'s the artwork and animations. While the mecha design by Jimmy Stone might seems strange, they are more than appropriate for models powered by magical girls. But the most important feature is that almost every single animation is made in 2D - a dying art especially for mecha anime. Yet in here we find mecha fight scenes that even long time fans of Gundam are approving of (and referenced by many of the fighting scenes in Granbelm) - from a lean team of well experienced artists and animators specializing in mecha designs.Their work is so mind-numbing that one of the climax fighting episodes has ONE SINGLE key animator working on it - almost unheard of in recent years! Even in other episodes, the artwork and animation quality never dropped below decent for the whole duration of the anime, thanks to a production schedule that allows for the whole work to be completed early in the broadcasting season with a leaner than usual staff cast. To see this in a lesser known original source anime in 2019 speaks of true dedication and passion from the whole staff team.It is so unfortunate that Granbelm has literally flew under the radar for the whole season, for it probably holds up as one of the best magical girl AND mecha themed anime in the turbulent recent years where these two genres are seeking for new identities. And I truly believe that it will be prove to be one of the keystone anime for their further development over the next decade and beyond.If you feel like interested in this little gem of the Summer 2019 season - GO WATCH IT NOW. You will be treated for a surprise that you will probably come back to re-watch many times in the future. ordinary high school girl Mangetsu Kohinata accidentally entered straight into a Magical Girl Mecha Battle Royale competition named Granbelm.

You will be treated for a surprise that you will probably come back to re-watch many times in the future.', 'When it comes to Granbelm, I feel like you fall into one of two camps: you either get it, or you don’t.I realize that’s a pretty vague and unhelpful statement, so let me clarify. To some extent, your ability to enjoy any piece of media is determined by how well you connect with its specific wavelength. The subtle differences in cinematography, dialogue, visual aesthetic, themes and so on can make all the difference in the world in determining why, for example, I dislike the Haruhi franchise, yet I love a show that starts from pretty much the exact same premise, Chuunibyou. If you can latch...onto a show’s overriding attitude, you’re going to enjoy it. If you can’t, you won’t. Simple enough on its surface right?Well, I feel like that Granbelm supercharges that dichotomy to a far greater extent than I’ve seen in a while. Despite it being one of the least watched anime of Summer 2019, there’s a sizeable contingent of fans who absolutely adore it. On the MAL forums, on Anime News Network, scattered across the internet, there are plenty of people who love this mashup of dark magical girl tropes and mecha action with all their heart, praising the characters and the ideas explored and putting it right up there near the top of their lists for anime of the season. And on the other hand, you have the rest of the anime fandom, who lost interest in it, dropped off after a couple episodes, hated it from the get-go, couldn’t be bothered to care about it, or are still watching but not quite sure why. Something about the particulars of Granbelm’s storytelling leave very little middle ground for an audience to fill you either get it, or you don’t. If you get it, it’s a powerful, resonant piece of art that will stick with you long after it finishes airing. If you don’t get it, it’s a bizarre, disappointing, not really insulting, but overall uninteresting waste of time.The story, an original script from the director and animation team behind Re:Zero, centers around the titular Granbelm, a Fate/Stay-Night-esque battle royale between young mages that occurs every full moon. These mages, all young girls, fight in stout, stocky mecha that channel their magical energy in powerful attacks, shield them from damage, do weird wobbly magic business and all that good stuff. Defeat doesn’t mean death, thankfully; it just means you’re knocked out of the running, and the competitors who last the night pick the battle right back up when the next full moon rises. The ultimate prize? A supposedly unlimited wish from an unseen entity that’s probably got a monkey’s paw or two up its ass, because this wasn’t enough like Fate already.At any rate, into this ongoing tournament is thrust our protagonist: Mangetsu, a seemingly normal girl who gets air-dropped into the middle of a Granbelm match and quickly finds herself fighting alongside everyone else in her own mystical dwarf mecha. No one is quite sure what to make of her, least of all herself; if she’s able to compete, it means she’s descended from a mage’s bloodline, but nobody knows which one, and at any rate, her unwittingly joining up after the tournament is already under way it weird enough itself. But if she’s part of Granbelm, there’s nothing to be done; she can either drop out, or keep competing and fight to have her own wish realized. Mangestu, unsurprisingly, chooses to fight, and thus she begins her quest to beat out the rest of the colorful characters who are participating in this tournament, all while forging an initially uneasy alliance with a fellow competitor- Shingetsu- who’s decided to help her orient herself in this confusing new world. No points for guessing that things are darker than they initially appear, the Granbelm tournament itself might be a lie, and everyone’s got a closet full of skeletons ready to expose when it’s time for Maximum Drama(tm)Honestly, though, for as much as I poke fun, Granbelm’s a lot better constructed than that description would lead you to believe. Calling it a mashup of Madoka and Fate wouldn’t be wrong, but it would also be a disservice to the many original ideas Granbelm comes up with. Even if you can guess the general trajectory of the story, the specifics of what’s actually going on will completely take you by surprise, with enough foreshadowing in the opening episodes for the eventual reveals to make sense. I know I was thrown for a loop when I realized that a couple things that were bugging me about Mangestu’s characterization turned out to be entirely intentional. There’s a damn smart narrative contraption at the core of this thing; no surprise, considering how good Re:Zero was at planting and payoff. And speaking of Re:Zero, another strength its director carries over here is sheer force of hype. The mecha battles are all riveting spectacles, rendered with kinetic cinematography, dizzying displays of power, and lush color palettes steeped in purple and blue. You feel the propulsion of these pieces of psychic armor zooming through the sky, aided by a killer sound design that makes them feel less like lumbering chunks of metal and more like Tron-esque digital programs. There’s so much confidence in every decision that it’s easy enough to get lost in the flow and jam out to the chaos.So here’s the question I’m left with; If Granbelm is so good at crafting an engaging spectacle, with cool action and direction and interesting plot turns, then why did I- and so many other people- keep getting sucked out of it?It’s here that we must turn our focus inward and talk about themes and meaning. This, I think, is where the heart of the divide lies between the people who love this show and those who don’t: do you get what it’s trying to say? Do you connect with how it tries to say it? Because from my perspective, Granbelm goes about exploring its themes in a very, very unclear and unfocused manner. Just take a look at the first episode if you want proof of this; it’s entirely dedicated to throwing Mangetsu right into the deep end of Granbelm and watching her experience it from the ground up. It’s certainly cool, but a nagging question I kept coming back to all throughout that episode was, “Why?” We’re given plenty of information about the players of Granbelm, the mechanics and lore, the cool shit we can expect from the battles, but we’re given no context into the emotional stakes involved. We learn nothing about why these girls are fighting, what’s at stake for losing, what deeper meaning is driving their stories, nothing. We’re given no reason to care about Mangestu until the end of the second episode, and even then it’s such a weak motivation- she wants to be useful to people- that it doesn’t feel worth the wait. Sure, you don’t need to dump the entirety of your show’s thesis on the audience right at the start, but at least some context is needed to help them get invested, right?Unfortunately, I would find myself asking that question of “Why?” plenty of times throughout Granbelm. It takes a while for the scope of the story to really come into focus, and while the eventual reveals are, as I said, cool, it feels like the meaning behind them should’ve been driving the story forward from a lot earlier. Everything feels disconnected and unclear, like every conversation the characters have is meant to be the defining moral statement of an entirely different show. There’s some stuff about self-determination, there’s some stuff about humanity’s natural inclination to abuse power, and I think the ultimate point was something related to accepting the responsibility to evolve, but I feel like I’m scrambling around in the dark trying to piece together an incomplete puzzle. And it’s not a fun mystery where the pursuit of meaning is part of the point; the way Granbelm presents the ideas it explores, it feels like it’s trying to be clear about the point it’s making. But for me, at least, it really wasn’t.Actually, now that I think about it, the real problem might stem from this: Granbelm is bad at connecting its planting to its payoff. Too many times over the course of this show, it would set up a conflict, and then eventually solve that conflict in a way that technically made sense, but also felt incredibly lacking. To use the most obvious example, Shingetsu’s biggest rival is Anna, a fellow witch who grew up as her close friend and adopted sister. They used to be incredibly close, but Anna eventually descended into jealousy and envy as Shingetsu’s talents far outstripped her own, to the point where she would do anything to take her down, even as Shingetsu desperately wants to mend their broken bond. It’s an understandable enough conflict on its surface, and without spoiling anything, the conclusion it reaches is probably the only conclusion it could have in a story of this nature. But actually watching the conflict play out getting to that point is so. Unbelievably. Not. Interesting. Anna as a character is far too arch, far too underwritten to care about. All she does is scream and make rage faces with increasingly unhinged fury, to the point where it’s impossible to buy into the supposed tragedy of her situation. She’s like a caricature of the jealous rival character, and at every point the story could’ve taken to let her indulge in some actual goddamn pathos, it instead instructs her voice actor to blow out yet another vocal chord and the animators to increase the dilation of her pupils. The way her arc resolves makes sense, but the character herself is so broken that it’s impossible to get invested in her.And this isn’t the only time something of this nature occurs. There’s another character whose arc revolves around trying to save their sister from a curse, and the exact nature of how they get to the end of that arc feels just as half-baked and underwritten. There’s a lot of question I still have about the nature of the magic system, whether it was supposed to be good or bad or something in between. Occasionally, the show pulls a magic power out of its ass that feels like it’s supposed to be important and meaningful, but for the life of me I couldn’t figure out how it got there. Granbelm feels like a well-constructed show from the outside, but on the inside it’s just a mess. Not an annoying mess (okay, Anna’s shtick got insufferable at times), but a mess all the same, a plot that felt like it did actually know what it was doing, but for some reason couldn’t communicate that knowledge to me. I kept feeling like these was some missing piece I wasn’t getting, some aspect that I wasn’t picking up on that would make all the pieces fit together. But for the life of me, I couldn’t find that piece.At least, that’s what I got out of it. Like I said, there are plenty of people who really like this show. So maybe that missing piece is still out there, and I just couldn’t find it for whatever reason. Maybe there’s some aspect of Granbelm that just speaks to some people with more clarity than others. All that considered, despite how down I’ve been on this show, I do recommend checking it out. It’s possible you’ll be one of the lucky few who’s able to figure out what it’s going for and thus find a new anime to add to your favorite’s list. And then maybe you can come back and explain it to me, because I’d really like to know what’s so potentially powerful about Granbelm that I just couldn’t figure out. For the moment, though, while I can’t call this show a disaster, I’m definitely frustrated that it never clicked together the way I wanted it to. onto a show’s overriding attitude, you’re going to enjoy it. If you can’t, you won’t. Simple enough on its surface right?Well, I feel like that Granbelm supercharges that dichotomy to a far greater extent than I’ve seen in a while. Despite it being one of the least watched anime of Summer 2019, there’s a sizeable contingent of fans who absolutely adore it. On the MAL forums, on Anime News Network, scattered across the internet, there are plenty of people who love this mashup of dark magical girl tropes and mecha action with all their heart, praising the characters and the ideas explored and putting it right up there near the top of their lists for anime of the season. And on the other hand, you have the rest of the anime fandom, who lost interest in it, dropped off after a couple episodes, hated it from the get-go, couldn’t be bothered to care about it, or are still watching but not quite sure why. Something about the particulars of Granbelm’s storytelling leave very little middle ground for an audience to fill you either get it, or you don’t. If you get it, it’s a powerful, resonant piece of art that will stick with you long after it finishes airing. If you don’t get it, it’s a bizarre, disappointing, not really insulting, but overall uninteresting waste of time.The story, an original script from the director and animation team behind Re:Zero, centers around the titular Granbelm, a Fate/Stay-Night-esque battle royale between young mages that occurs every full moon. These mages, all young girls, fight in stout, stocky mecha that channel their magical energy in powerful attacks, shield them from damage, do weird wobbly magic business and all that good stuff. Defeat doesn’t mean death, thankfully; it just means you’re knocked out of the running, and the competitors who last the night pick the battle right back up when the next full moon rises. The ultimate prize? A supposedly unlimited wish from an unseen entity that’s probably got a monkey’s paw or two up its ass, because this wasn’t enough like Fate already.At any rate, into this ongoing tournament is thrust our protagonist: Mangetsu, a seemingly normal girl who gets air-dropped into the middle of a Granbelm match and quickly finds herself fighting alongside everyone else in her own mystical dwarf mecha. No one is quite sure what to make of her, least of all herself; if she’s able to compete, it means she’s descended from a mage’s bloodline, but nobody knows which one, and at any rate, her unwittingly joining up after the tournament is already under way it weird enough itself. But if she’s part of Granbelm, there’s nothing to be done; she can either drop out, or keep competing and fight to have her own wish realized. Mangestu, unsurprisingly, chooses to fight, and thus she begins her quest to beat out the rest of the colorful characters who are participating in this tournament, all while forging an initially uneasy alliance with a fellow competitor- Shingetsu- who’s decided to help her orient herself in this confusing new world. No points for guessing that things are darker than they initially appear, the Granbelm tournament itself might be a lie, and everyone’s got a closet full of skeletons ready to expose when it’s time for Maximum Drama(tm)Honestly, though, for as much as I poke fun, Granbelm’s a lot better constructed than that description would lead you to believe. Calling it a mashup of Madoka and Fate wouldn’t be wrong, but it would also be a disservice to the many original ideas Granbelm comes up with. Even if you can guess the general trajectory of the story, the specifics of what’s actually going on will completely take you by surprise, with enough foreshadowing in the opening episodes for the eventual reveals to make sense. I know I was thrown for a loop when I realized that a couple things that were bugging me about Mangestu’s characterization turned out to be entirely intentional. There’s a damn smart narrative contraption at the core of this thing; no surprise, considering how good Re:Zero was at planting and payoff. And speaking of Re:Zero, another strength its director carries over here is sheer force of hype. The mecha battles are all riveting spectacles, rendered with kinetic cinematography, dizzying displays of power, and lush color palettes steeped in purple and blue. You feel the propulsion of these pieces of psychic armor zooming through the sky, aided by a killer sound design that makes them feel less like lumbering chunks of metal and more like Tron-esque digital programs. There’s so much confidence in every decision that it’s easy enough to get lost in the flow and jam out to the chaos.So here’s the question I’m left with; If Granbelm is so good at crafting an engaging spectacle, with cool action and direction and interesting plot turns, then why did I- and so many other people- keep getting sucked out of it?It’s here that we must turn our focus inward and talk about themes and meaning. This, I think, is where the heart of the divide lies between the people who love this show and those who don’t: do you get what it’s trying to say? Do you connect with how it tries to say it? Because from my perspective, Granbelm goes about exploring its themes in a very, very unclear and unfocused manner. Just take a look at the first episode if you want proof of this; it’s entirely dedicated to throwing Mangetsu right into the deep end of Granbelm and watching her experience it from the ground up. It’s certainly cool, but a nagging question I kept coming back to all throughout that episode was, “Why?” We’re given plenty of information about the players of Granbelm, the mechanics and lore, the cool shit we can expect from the battles, but we’re given no context into the emotional stakes involved. We learn nothing about why these girls are fighting, what’s at stake for losing, what deeper meaning is driving their stories, nothing. We’re given no reason to care about Mangestu until the end of the second episode, and even then it’s such a weak motivation- she wants to be useful to people- that it doesn’t feel worth the wait. Sure, you don’t need to dump the entirety of your show’s thesis on the audience right at the start, but at least some context is needed to help them get invested, right?Unfortunately, I would find myself asking that question of “Why?” plenty of times throughout Granbelm. It takes a while for the scope of the story to really come into focus, and while the eventual reveals are, as I said, cool, it feels like the meaning behind them should’ve been driving the story forward from a lot earlier. Everything feels disconnected and unclear, like every conversation the characters have is meant to be the defining moral statement of an entirely different show. There’s some stuff about self-determination, there’s some stuff about humanity’s natural inclination to abuse power, and I think the ultimate point was something related to accepting the responsibility to evolve, but I feel like I’m scrambling around in the dark trying to piece together an incomplete puzzle. And it’s not a fun mystery where the pursuit of meaning is part of the point; the way Granbelm presents the ideas it explores, it feels like it’s trying to be clear about the point it’s making. But for me, at least, it really wasn’t.Actually, now that I think about it, the real problem might stem from this: Granbelm is bad at connecting its planting to its payoff. Too many times over the course of this show, it would set up a conflict, and then eventually solve that conflict in a way that technically made sense, but also felt incredibly lacking. To use the most obvious example, Shingetsu’s biggest rival is Anna, a fellow witch who grew up as her close friend and adopted sister. They used to be incredibly close, but Anna eventually descended into jealousy and envy as Shingetsu’s talents far outstripped her own, to the point where she would do anything to take her down, even as Shingetsu desperately wants to mend their broken bond. It’s an understandable enough conflict on its surface, and without spoiling anything, the conclusion it reaches is probably the only conclusion it could have in a story of this nature. But actually watching the conflict play out getting to that point is so. Unbelievably. Not. Interesting. Anna as a character is far too arch, far too underwritten to care about. All she does is scream and make rage faces with increasingly unhinged fury, to the point where it’s impossible to buy into the supposed tragedy of her situation. She’s like a caricature of the jealous rival character, and at every point the story could’ve taken to let her indulge in some actual goddamn pathos, it instead instructs her voice actor to blow out yet another vocal chord and the animators to increase the dilation of her pupils.

For the moment, though, while I can’t call this show a disaster, I’m definitely frustrated that it never clicked together the way I wanted it to.', 'Studio Nexus\' love letter to the dying art of the 2D Mecha, Granbelm, is one of the most interesting rides an anime has taken me on in years. There\'s a lot that could reasonably scare a person away from this series, including a jarring 1st episode that intentionally makes itself hard to follow, aesthetic choices that lean very heavily on the series\' influences, and a hook that can\'t really be explained without meta spoilers. However, the series\' artistic merit shines through with an incredibly wonderful cast of characters, some of the best sound design I\'ve ever heard in an anime, and a very tightly written...story with virtually nothing even resembling filler.Granbelm\'s twists and turns into existentialism hit a very sweet spot, never reaching the cynicism and""edge factor"" of Madoka Magica, while neither being the fluff of the genre both series were born from. Granbelm WANTS you to love life. Granbelm WANTS you to know that loss can be overcome. Granbelm wants you to be a better person and take stock of the fact that the impact of your actions will always live on after you leave this world.The pacing of this show is fine, but it requires the benefit of the doubt in the beginning. After a moderately slow start to the show, it kicks into high gear around episode 4 or 5 and never looks back. There was a stretch in the middle of this series where every week I said something to the effect of ""that was the best episode yet."" because nearly every episode improves on the one previous. One of the things that Granbelm succeeds at is carving out a plot that never takes any of it\'s runtime for granted. Every moment is important. Every moment builds to something. Small details foreshadow future twists so that none of them feel like they come out of nowhere.The character animation of the series does it\'s job, and the art style it what you would expect from the people who made it, but the thing that has to be talked about are probably the most polarizing part of the series: The mechas. I was initially in the camp of these being the biggest misstep the series had going for it, but seeing them in action every week, at some point the coin completely flipped for me. I found myself wanting to own figures of these things, and I never knew when it happen, but I know that seeing them in motion and action is the best possible way to experience them. Fans of SD Gundam will recognize the approach immediately, and I think it\'s a welcome change from the very humanoid approach to mecha that has been the standard since Evangelion.The series sound design and use of it\'s music are absolutely flawless. I would very seriously consider it as the best sound design I\'ve ever heard in any medium. The OST is triumphant when it needs to be, ominous when it needs to be, annd beautiful even when it doesn\'t need to be, but you never complain. The OP/ED and insert songs are all so heavily tied into the series that they have to be mentioned, conveying the emotional messages the series has to offer the whole way.The SFX are ethereal and mystical, with each character\'s mecha (or as Granbelm calls it, the Armanox) creating sounds that capture the essense of their character background. Some attacks sound like anguished screams, some like desperate cries for help, some like loneliness and despair, creating some of the most unique sounding battles in anime.Overall, I think the reduction of art to a number on a x/10 scale is ultimately pointless. I can\'t pretend to tell you that the series has no flaws, only that it\'s flaws are so heavily outweighed by things that for 13 weeks, made me experience such overwhelming love for the series and the people who created it, and that love warrants a Granbelm getting a 10/10 to me regardless. story with virtually nothing even resembling filler.Granbelm\'s twists and turns into existentialism hit a very sweet spot, never reaching the cynicism and""edge factor"" of Madoka Magica, while neither being the fluff of the genre both series were born from.

You have been warned.Based upon an original idea Granbelm is a magic and fantasy genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if within the modern world to which we all live in, that there exist not just powerful magic users called mages but also a deadly competition that pits these young but powerful mages against each other in a deadly battle...where the winner gains the power to wield immense magical power. What will happen if one day when this competition occurs that a seemingly normal high school girl stumbles across this hidden and dangerous world and becomes caught up in the struggle to gain the use of the world’s remaining magic that had been collected and to be presented as a prize for the victor of the said competition. On the surface, the Granbelm itself is similar to most magic-based animes in that it presents itself as a struggle between various magical girls as they fight to gain the power that they need to affect change. However in my eyes what sets Granbelm apart from those is the fact that while each girl may be powerful mages in their own right each has serious personal issues and problems that that they all wrestle with deep inside them and ones that they hope will be fulfilled once they become the victor in the fierce competition that would pit these young girls against each other in a bitter fight to the end using powerful mecha’s called Armanox that are the manifestation of the girls magic when they fight each other. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one in that while doing well in introducing the main characters of Mangetsu and Shingetsu it also did well to showcase one of the series notable trademarks which its fusion of mecha and magic combat and the types of battles that can result from it and ensured that its one series that I will watch till the end.The overall story for the series takes place within modern-day Japan and follows the life of Mangetsu Kohinata a high school student that had until the start of the story been living a pretty standard life that revolved around school, friends, and family. A life that is full of drama and happiness for her and one that Mangetsu can be said to treasure dearly. But all that changed one fateful night when Mangetsu after arriving back at school late at night to retrieve a lost item suddenly found herself transported to an alternate world in which powerful magic users that wield large powerful mecha’s called Armanox  battle each other in a deadly competition to gain the power to become the magus that while gaining immense magical power also gains the ability to make one wish that can forever change reality. After being saved from certain death by a mysterious girl who introduces herself as Shingetsu Ernesta Fukami and being made aware that in this world not only do mages and magic exist but so does competitions that pit each mage and their dearest and most cherished wishes against each other as they fight with all their might to ensure that their wishes that they have made their life’s mission is granted. To Mangetsu whose life until this point had been one of routine and peace the revelation that beyond her normal world was a harsh and dangerous world where girls her age would fight deadly duals to the last with all their skills as a mage and all the passions and determination to attain their wish no matter the cost was indeed a surprising revelation. But even when faced with this reality Mangetsu despite feeling fear also see’s this new world as an opportunity to allow her for the first time to not just walk a path that she had chosen but also in the process help change the lives of the mages that she meets, befriends and bonds with within Granbelm.MangetsuMangetsu Kohinata portrayed by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro of Yuuna and the Hot springs fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student that had until the start of the series had been living a seemingly average life Mangetsu on initial impressions was seen to be a kind, friendly and caring person by nature that approached life with both a friendly attitude and a constant smile on her face that served to ensure that she had many friends within both her class and the school. An innocent, helpful but also open-minded person Mangetsu was someone that while knowing that she was easily taken advantage off was someone that tried hard to help others with their problems whether it was to make food for her schoolmates or to help a friend fight in a deadly battle. Indeed, this overly caring nature of hers can be said to be Mangetsu’s most prominent trait that serves as one of her most prominent motivators. While being able to live the carefree life of a schoolgirl and being able to help your friends and enjoy the praise being levelled at you can be said to be a desire that many people would desire it can be seen that this is something that Mangetsu only grudgingly accepts. While Mangetsu does not view her life as being one without fun or happiness she does accept that she herself has no power that can help others and thus in order to compensate for this and avoid struggles that would be futile she elected to do the best at things that she does best at an attitude that she held until she met a mysterious transfer student named Shingetsu and after encountering a brand new world that only she and her fellow mages can enter.As the series goes on and after meeting both Shingetsu and being introduced to the world that lay apart from her own Mangetsu’s personality slowly began to change. While convinced early on that both Granbelm and the usage of magic within its realm was indeed real Mangetsu initially was shown to be somewhat indecisive about taking her first steps into the world that lay hidden within her own but this sense of indecisiveness soon began to wane as she bore witness to the kind of high stakes that its participants fight with within their fierce battles. As Mangetsu bore witness to this she began to realise that while this world may be one fraught with peril it was also one that can be used by her to affect change within her life for while she thought she was content with just being praised by others for being helpful the discovery of this world proved to her that this was not so for she also desired to be praised and recognised for her own talents and not just for her cooking abilities. After seeing this new world and the countless possibilities that lay within it as well as the types of dangers that she would face Mangetsu instead of stepping back in fear chose instead to step forward and attempt to change her life her way. While at first Mangetsu’s lack of both basic magic knowledge and combat ability made her somewhat of a liability in combat this gradually began to change due to both Mangetsu’s desire to learn more about magic and her desire to become a better mage so as to allow her to better aid her friends. While the progress of becoming an effective mage was a tough one on Mangetsu due to her lack of formal magical education that the other mages had Mangetsu’s determination to both prove herself as well as her desire to help others served to ensure that her progress was rapid. However while developing into an effective mage that slowly proved to be equal to the others in motivation if not in skill it can be seen that even as she becomes an effective mage through her hard work and desire that Mangetsu never forgot her core values of wanting to help others and in this it can be seen that as a mage she is able to do this much more effectively as she is able to both understand the kind of problems that her fellow mages feel but also come up with some surprising ways to solve them her way.As a character, I felt that Mangetsu was a well-designed character that as the series went on was developed pretty well both as a combat mage and as a person. While her default self was understandably indecisive and wary of both the unknown and of taking a path that would take her out of her normal happy life I felt that this when used in combination with her core desire to make her mark on the world and prove to not just others but herself as well served to create a solid foundation that allowed her to change with her ending personality of someone that was not just a brave and powerful mage but also one that was loyal, considerate and perceptive to both the physical and mental pain that one can suffer being the best example of how much Mangetsu had changed as a person.Shingetsu Ernesta FukamiShingetsu Ernesta Fukami portrayed by veteran seiyuu Atsumi Tanezaki of Owari No Seraph and Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl sempai fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main allies of Mangetsu within the series serving as both her close friend and confidant. A teenage girl and a transfer student that had recently returned to Japan from Germany Shingetsu on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and intelligent person by nature that instead of trying to make as many friends and bonds as possible on her transfer seemingly prefers to instead keep her own council and remain apart from her peers. While a quiet person Shingetsu was also shown to be an intelligent and perceptive person by nature that true to her preference for isolation also demonstrated an unusual ability to hold her emotions in check rather than express them as girls her age typically do. However while a quiet person Shingetsu was also someone that wasn’t afraid of expressing her own opinions openly a directness that I felt suited her quite well. While preferring to remain in solitude Shingetsu, however, was not averse to establishing friendships and bonds and indeed it can be said that within the series this act of establishing friendships and bonds with Mangetsu and Kuon served to allow her to grow as a person. When interacting with her friends and with those that she trusts Shingetsu was shown to be someone that was friendly, kind, considerate and helpful and willing to do what she can to help her friends as shown when she helped Mangetsu not just orient herself in her new role as a mage but also teach her the many pieces of knowledge that she lacked.As the series goes on and as the battle within Granbelm gets fiercer and more personal Shingetsu’s personality gradually begins to change. From the onset it can be seen via interactions with others that Shingetsu’s views on both the world and of magic in particular was a grim one for she believed that magic while providing its users with powerful abilities also served to create within the world a sense of hatred and jealousy that can come about between magic users a point that within the series is well proven in the form of the extreme hatred and jealousy that Anna Shingetsu’s one time friend shows her during their battles within Granbelm. This sense of regret that she feels towards Anna can be said to be the very foundation of Shingetsu’s motivation and overall goal within the series for while she understands that fighting against Anna would cause her to once again relive the memories of the past she knows full well that in order to avoid repeating the same mistake that she must achieve her wish no matter the pain she must endure. Due to this tragic turn of events, it can be said that from the onset Shingetsu while knowing what the concept of friendship was had as a result of her past with Anna had chosen to close off her heart and focus on forging a life that was focused on achieving her wish within Granbelm. While somewhat successful at this it can be said that this cut off from society also served to deny her the kind of skills that girls her age would normally have such as social, cooking and the ability to interact with girls her age comfortably. However this aspect of hers that can be said to be her chief character flaw changed when she met an innocent and seemingly rookie mage named Mangetsu who while lacking in both experience and knowledge in magic and combat still brought to the table an innate sense of curiosity, a sense of determination that seems to know no bounds and perhaps most importantly a strong desire to open Shingetsu’s heart to all the good things that can come from genuine friends and the bonds that are forged between people that have been chosen by fate to meet one another. While somewhat reluctant at first Shingetsu’s personality gradually began to soften as she interacted with Mangetsu and later on with both Kuon and Rin and gradually become not just friendlier but also more willing to offer her own opinions on matters both in and outside of battle.Perhaps the most important development was Shingetsu’s gradual realization that friends cannot be friends until they can trust each other immeasurably. Overall the character of Shingetsu I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed over the series with her development from a quiet girl who shunned all personal contact while focusing on her singular goal to one that while still focusing on her goal had also learned of just how much warmth genuine friendships and bonds can bring to one being especially well done. While Shingetsu served as an effective mentor and friend for Mangetsu it can be said that this is a role that goes both ways as Shingetsu through her interaction with Mangetsu also served to gain valuable life lessons as well.Suishou HakamadaSuishou Hakamada portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuuki of Sword Art Online and Youjo Senki fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Mangetsu and Shingetsu’s opponents within the series. A high school girl and initially a member of Anna’s house that served as one of her retainers Suishou on initial expressions is seen to be a quiet, carefree and seemingly loyal person that displayed a cheerful and confident attitude to life. While shown to be a powerful mage she was shown to be content with watching over her master and assisting her in her vendetta’s despite having obvious power that outranked hers. However, as the series went on and as the tide of the war turned against her master Suishou eventually showed her true colours as she betrayed and deserted her master in her moment of need. After her master's demise and Suishou’s ascension to the competition it can be seen that her initial personality was no more than a fake persona for the true persona of Suishou was that of a hunter. While largely retaining her confident nature Suishou’s true nature was shown to be someone that was cunning, malicious and deceitful and was someone that placed herself as a priority and indeed only saw others as pawns to her games.While intelligent Suishou was also shown to be able to demonstrate higher-level thinking being able to think outside of the box and use this to hurt others both physically and emotionally the latter of which she showed considerable talent in. While an expert in the use of psychological manipulation Suishou was also shown to be a powerful combatant that was adept in both spell-based combat as well as in creative use of advanced military tactics that worked well in tandem with her manipulations of people’s ideas. The character of Suishou I felt was an excellent character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from being a seemingly loyal retainer of Anna to a cunning and malicious hunter that showed great skill at not just combat but also in psychological manipulation being especially impressive.KuonKuon Tsuchimikado portrayed by new seiyuu Manaka Iwami is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Mangetsu and Shingetsu’s allies within the series. The youngest daughter of a famed magical house within the series Kuon on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and composed young girl that prefers solitude an attitude that’s similar to Shingetsu. While quiet Kuon was also an intelligent, curious and fast thinking person that had the unusual ability to be able to think outside of the box a skill that’s rare within girls her age. When combined with both her logical nature and her ability to look at things, in the long run, this allowed her to seek out opportunities that will benefit both her and her allies equally without getting emotionally involved a trait that I felt suited her especially well. While far more friendly and diplomatic than Shingetsu Kuon was also intelligent enough to realise that today's allies can also be tomorrows enemies and as a result learned to hide her emotions. Yet even so as the series went on it can be seen that until the end Kuon’s interactions with her friends and allies Shingetsu and Mangetsu can be said to be something that she genuinely enjoyed and seemed to treasure and despite being rivals she had not elected to withdraw from their alliance and re target them as hostiles showing that in her life they were existences that were equal to her idolised elder sister. While seemingly mature for her age Kuon was shown to be someone that was surprisingly fragile emotionally and was easily rattled when exploited by skilled enemies such as her true opponent Suishou. However conversely Kuon was also shown to be able to fight extremely well when her focus is clear and her mind is engaged fully as shown in the high-level duals that marked the end of her arc.The character of Kuon I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. In a way, it can be seen that Kuon’s default personality was similar to Shingetsu’s in that like her Kuon’s nature at the start was that of a quiet, calm and composed girl that took great care in planning her moves in Granbelm while viewing things like bonds and friendships as secondary concerns. However unlike Shingetsu who at the start took deliberate steps to avoid making bonds and, in the process, ensuring that she had little social experience Kuon was the opposite due to the strong bond that she had enjoyed with her sister. Due to the upbringing that Kuon had experienced, it can be seen the bond that she enjoys with her sister was a potent one that she relied upon greatly for advice both in terms of Granbelm as well as in the life that she had outside of it. Indeed it can be said that her sister's fate was the very reason that prompted Kuon to enter Granbelm. This strong bond with her sister I felt was an interesting one as while serving as a potent source of motivation for her it also acted as a double-edged sword of sorts that could be exploited by those that were adept at manipulation as shown in her interactions with Suishou.While Kuon’s interactions with Suishou that served as the centrepiece of her arc grew increasingly fierce within the series and served to introduce significant doubts in her mind to the level of trust that existed between her and her sister this also proved to be a perfect stage for Kuon’s other bonds that she had discovered to materialise and assist her in her struggle this bond being the bonds of friendship that she had established with Mangetsu and Shingetsu. While at first only viewing the two as allies of convenience that were to be discarded when the situation changed Kuon’s views on this gradually changed as she interacted with them more and got to know them more on a personal level. For Kuon whose only true bond until now was the one that she shared with her sister this was perhaps a more profound experience than she expected.  Indeed it is this profound experience that served well to both protect her from Suishou but also allow her to finally realise her sister's true wishes and the steps that she took to ensure that her beloved sister was able to avoid the same mistakes that she had made in Granbelm.AMVIn terms of animations I felt that the series character designs for the individual girls were well designed and served well to show that while each girl was of similar age and came from different backgrounds, they all had one unified goal within Granbelm which was to ensure that their treasured wish came to fruition. This within the series was shown both in the form of the outfits that each girl wore as well as in the location types that defined their homes that served as their sanctuary. In terms of mecha’s designs which served as one of the main draw points for this series, I felt that the Armanox which served as the mages main combat application within Granbelm were excellently designed both visually and also in the types of roles and attack types that each possessed. At the same time true to the fact that the dolls to which the Armanox essentially were I also felt that each doll reflected well on the temperament of each girl with its ability of being able to adapt to the mental state of each girl being of notable interest. While the doll’s ability to manifest weapons as envisioned by its wielder was impressive its ability to invoke magical spells was equally so an aspect that was aided greatly by both the large variety of magic elements that were used as well as the size and complexity of the spells that were invoked. Notable examples of such within the series were Anna’s mass mirage attack and Suishou’s own illusion-based attacks. In terms of combat animations and battles I felt that the battles within the series were both well designed and fluid and took great advantage of the combination of the unique mechas, magical elements, environmental settings and the feelings of the mages involved to create battles that were not just visually impressive but also tension-filled to the extreme due to the sheer unpredictability of the flow of the battles an aspect that only served to increase when spirits are used as well.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Tsuki Wo Ou Mayonaka by veteran singer Eir Aoi and Negai that was performed by Uru. Both of these songs I felt while excellent ones invoked within me a different series of feelings with the former giving me a sense of anticipation at seeing the massed feelings and desires of the girls take flight as they fight with all their might to make their wishes come true in the brutal battles within Granbelm while the latter invoked a sense of peace and calm that reminded me of a war's end and the reforging of bonds between the girls as they looked to the future. These songs and the effects that they had I felt was aided greatly by the visuals that were shown during the opening and ending themes within the series. Voice acting-wise I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Miyuri Shimabukuro, Atsumi Tanezaki, Aoi Yuuki, Manaka Iwami, Yoko Hikasa and Yurika Kubo all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Mangetsu, Shingetsu, Suishou, Kuon, Anna and Nene respectively. In this  I felt that Aoi Yuuki’s portrayal of Suishou and Atsumi Tanezaki’s portrayal of Shingetsu deserve special praise as their hard work truly made their characters shine within the series.Overall conclusionOverall Granbelm I felt was an excellent anime that in my opinion had among its strongest points being its unique premise that combined the traditional magical girl and mecha concepts in a surprising way, an excellent story that weaved an excellent tale of bonds, friendships, wishes and desires together, well designed and developed characters, well designed and executed battles that combined excellent mecha designs with visually impressive magical and melee attacks and excellent voice acting from a talented voice cast. The series overall story and premise I felt deserve special mention in this case as I felt that in both cases they did well in combining elements that are not normally seen much together and in the process creating a solid foundation that allowed the series overall story to base itself and tell us an excellent tale of how a cast of young schoolgirls despite living a seemingly ordinary life in a normal world would as the full moon draws annually ready themselves and put the hard training and their earnest desires to make their wishes come true in the fierce maelstrom that is Granbelm. While the clever combination of mecha and magical based combat serves as one of the series main draw points I felt that this was not the only one as the story also allowed us to see the kind of effects that the battles had on its participants both physically and mentally in the form of the bonds and friendships that are formed between its fighters and the effects that it has on their performance within Granbelm. This is best shown in the character development that this induces within the main characters of Mangetsu and Shingetsu as well as in the secondary characters of Kuon, Suishou, Anna and Nene.In overall I felt that Granbelm was an excellent anime that through its skilful combination of an unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, well designed battles that took great advantage of a creative pairing between magic and mecha and excellent voice acting managed to create an excellent tale that showed just how powerful bonds of friendship can be and how it can aid in both changing the world as well as the lives of those that you hold dear in your hearts in the most dramatic of ways. In terms of final score, I would say that Granbelm easily deserves a final score of 10/10. where the winner gains the power to wield immense magical power. What will happen if one day when this competition occurs that a seemingly normal high school girl stumbles across this hidden and dangerous world and becomes caught up in the struggle to gain the use of the world’s remaining magic that had been collected and to be presented as a prize for the victor of the said competition. On the surface, the Granbelm itself is similar to most magic-based animes in that it presents itself as a struggle between various magical girls as they fight to gain the power that they need to affect change. However in my eyes what sets Granbelm apart from those is the fact that while each girl may be powerful mages in their own right each has serious personal issues and problems that that they all wrestle with deep inside them and ones that they hope will be fulfilled once they become the victor in the fierce competition that would pit these young girls against each other in a bitter fight to the end using powerful mecha’s called Armanox that are the manifestation of the girls magic when they fight each other. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one in that while doing well in introducing the main characters of Mangetsu and Shingetsu it also did well to showcase one of the series notable trademarks which its fusion of mecha and magic combat and the types of battles that can result from it and ensured that its one series that I will watch till the end.The overall story for the series takes place within modern-day Japan and follows the life of Mangetsu Kohinata a high school student that had until the start of the story been living a pretty standard life that revolved around school, friends, and family. A life that is full of drama and happiness for her and one that Mangetsu can be said to treasure dearly. But all that changed one fateful night when Mangetsu after arriving back at school late at night to retrieve a lost item suddenly found herself transported to an alternate world in which powerful magic users that wield large powerful mecha’s called Armanox  battle each other in a deadly competition to gain the power to become the magus that while gaining immense magical power also gains the ability to make one wish that can forever change reality. After being saved from certain death by a mysterious girl who introduces herself as Shingetsu Ernesta Fukami and being made aware that in this world not only do mages and magic exist but so does competitions that pit each mage and their dearest and most cherished wishes against each other as they fight with all their might to ensure that their wishes that they have made their life’s mission is granted. To Mangetsu whose life until this point had been one of routine and peace the revelation that beyond her normal world was a harsh and dangerous world where girls her age would fight deadly duals to the last with all their skills as a mage and all the passions and determination to attain their wish no matter the cost was indeed a surprising revelation. But even when faced with this reality Mangetsu despite feeling fear also see’s this new world as an opportunity to allow her for the first time to not just walk a path that she had chosen but also in the process help change the lives of the mages that she meets, befriends and bonds with within Granbelm.MangetsuMangetsu Kohinata portrayed by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro of Yuuna and the Hot springs fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student that had until the start of the series had been living a seemingly average life Mangetsu on initial impressions was seen to be a kind, friendly and caring person by nature that approached life with both a friendly attitude and a constant smile on her face that served to ensure that she had many friends within both her class and the school. An innocent, helpful but also open-minded person Mangetsu was someone that while knowing that she was easily taken advantage off was someone that tried hard to help others with their problems whether it was to make food for her schoolmates or to help a friend fight in a deadly battle. Indeed, this overly caring nature of hers can be said to be Mangetsu’s most prominent trait that serves as one of her most prominent motivators. While being able to live the carefree life of a schoolgirl and being able to help your friends and enjoy the praise being levelled at you can be said to be a desire that many people would desire it can be seen that this is something that Mangetsu only grudgingly accepts. While Mangetsu does not view her life as being one without fun or happiness she does accept that she herself has no power that can help others and thus in order to compensate for this and avoid struggles that would be futile she elected to do the best at things that she does best at an attitude that she held until she met a mysterious transfer student named Shingetsu and after encountering a brand new world that only she and her fellow mages can enter.As the series goes on and after meeting both Shingetsu and being introduced to the world that lay apart from her own Mangetsu’s personality slowly began to change. While convinced early on that both Granbelm and the usage of magic within its realm was indeed real Mangetsu initially was shown to be somewhat indecisive about taking her first steps into the world that lay hidden within her own but this sense of indecisiveness soon began to wane as she bore witness to the kind of high stakes that its participants fight with within their fierce battles. As Mangetsu bore witness to this she began to realise that while this world may be one fraught with peril it was also one that can be used by her to affect change within her life for while she thought she was content with just being praised by others for being helpful the discovery of this world proved to her that this was not so for she also desired to be praised and recognised for her own talents and not just for her cooking abilities. After seeing this new world and the countless possibilities that lay within it as well as the types of dangers that she would face Mangetsu instead of stepping back in fear chose instead to step forward and attempt to change her life her way. While at first Mangetsu’s lack of both basic magic knowledge and combat ability made her somewhat of a liability in combat this gradually began to change due to both Mangetsu’s desire to learn more about magic and her desire to become a better mage so as to allow her to better aid her friends. While the progress of becoming an effective mage was a tough one on Mangetsu due to her lack of formal magical education that the other mages had Mangetsu’s determination to both prove herself as well as her desire to help others served to ensure that her progress was rapid. However while developing into an effective mage that slowly proved to be equal to the others in motivation if not in skill it can be seen that even as she becomes an effective mage through her hard work and desire that Mangetsu never forgot her core values of wanting to help others and in this it can be seen that as a mage she is able to do this much more effectively as she is able to both understand the kind of problems that her fellow mages feel but also come up with some surprising ways to solve them her way.As a character, I felt that Mangetsu was a well-designed character that as the series went on was developed pretty well both as a combat mage and as a person. While her default self was understandably indecisive and wary of both the unknown and of taking a path that would take her out of her normal happy life I felt that this when used in combination with her core desire to make her mark on the world and prove to not just others but herself as well served to create a solid foundation that allowed her to change with her ending personality of someone that was not just a brave and powerful mage but also one that was loyal, considerate and perceptive to both the physical and mental pain that one can suffer being the best example of how much Mangetsu had changed as a person.Shingetsu Ernesta FukamiShingetsu Ernesta Fukami portrayed by veteran seiyuu Atsumi Tanezaki of Owari No Seraph and Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl sempai fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main allies of Mangetsu within the series serving as both her close friend and confidant. A teenage girl and a transfer student that had recently returned to Japan from Germany Shingetsu on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and intelligent person by nature that instead of trying to make as many friends and bonds as possible on her transfer seemingly prefers to instead keep her own council and remain apart from her peers. While a quiet person Shingetsu was also shown to be an intelligent and perceptive person by nature that true to her preference for isolation also demonstrated an unusual ability to hold her emotions in check rather than express them as girls her age typically do. However while a quiet person Shingetsu was also someone that wasn’t afraid of expressing her own opinions openly a directness that I felt suited her quite well. While preferring to remain in solitude Shingetsu, however, was not averse to establishing friendships and bonds and indeed it can be said that within the series this act of establishing friendships and bonds with Mangetsu and Kuon served to allow her to grow as a person. When interacting with her friends and with those that she trusts Shingetsu was shown to be someone that was friendly, kind, considerate and helpful and willing to do what she can to help her friends as shown when she helped Mangetsu not just orient herself in her new role as a mage but also teach her the many pieces of knowledge that she lacked.As the series goes on and as the battle within Granbelm gets fiercer and more personal Shingetsu’s personality gradually begins to change. From the onset it can be seen via interactions with others that Shingetsu’s views on both the world and of magic in particular was a grim one for she believed that magic while providing its users with powerful abilities also served to create within the world a sense of hatred and jealousy that can come about between magic users a point that within the series is well proven in the form of the extreme hatred and jealousy that Anna Shingetsu’s one time friend shows her during their battles within Granbelm. This sense of regret that she feels towards Anna can be said to be the very foundation of Shingetsu’s motivation and overall goal within the series for while she understands that fighting against Anna would cause her to once again relive the memories of the past she knows full well that in order to avoid repeating the same mistake that she must achieve her wish no matter the pain she must endure. Due to this tragic turn of events, it can be said that from the onset Shingetsu while knowing what the concept of friendship was had as a result of her past with Anna had chosen to close off her heart and focus on forging a life that was focused on achieving her wish within Granbelm. While somewhat successful at this it can be said that this cut off from society also served to deny her the kind of skills that girls her age would normally have such as social, cooking and the ability to interact with girls her age comfortably. However this aspect of hers that can be said to be her chief character flaw changed when she met an innocent and seemingly rookie mage named Mangetsu who while lacking in both experience and knowledge in magic and combat still brought to the table an innate sense of curiosity, a sense of determination that seems to know no bounds and perhaps most importantly a strong desire to open Shingetsu’s heart to all the good things that can come from genuine friends and the bonds that are forged between people that have been chosen by fate to meet one another. While somewhat reluctant at first Shingetsu’s personality gradually began to soften as she interacted with Mangetsu and later on with both Kuon and Rin and gradually become not just friendlier but also more willing to offer her own opinions on matters both in and outside of battle.Perhaps the most important development was Shingetsu’s gradual realization that friends cannot be friends until they can trust each other immeasurably. Overall the character of Shingetsu I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed over the series with her development from a quiet girl who shunned all personal contact while focusing on her singular goal to one that while still focusing on her goal had also learned of just how much warmth genuine friendships and bonds can bring to one being especially well done. While Shingetsu served as an effective mentor and friend for Mangetsu it can be said that this is a role that goes both ways as Shingetsu through her interaction with Mangetsu also served to gain valuable life lessons as well.Suishou HakamadaSuishou Hakamada portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuuki of Sword Art Online and Youjo Senki fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Mangetsu and Shingetsu’s opponents within the series. A high school girl and initially a member of Anna’s house that served as one of her retainers Suishou on initial expressions is seen to be a quiet, carefree and seemingly loyal person that displayed a cheerful and confident attitude to life. While shown to be a powerful mage she was shown to be content with watching over her master and assisting her in her vendetta’s despite having obvious power that outranked hers. However, as the series went on and as the tide of the war turned against her master Suishou eventually showed her true colours as she betrayed and deserted her master in her moment of need. After her master's demise and Suishou’s ascension to the competition it can be seen that her initial personality was no more than a fake persona for the true persona of Suishou was that of a hunter. While largely retaining her confident nature Suishou’s true nature was shown to be someone that was cunning, malicious and deceitful and was someone that placed herself as a priority and indeed only saw others as pawns to her games.While intelligent Suishou was also shown to be able to demonstrate higher-level thinking being able to think outside of the box and use this to hurt others both physically and emotionally the latter of which she showed considerable talent in. While an expert in the use of psychological manipulation Suishou was also shown to be a powerful combatant that was adept in both spell-based combat as well as in creative use of advanced military tactics that worked well in tandem with her manipulations of people’s ideas. The character of Suishou I felt was an excellent character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from being a seemingly loyal retainer of Anna to a cunning and malicious hunter that showed great skill at not just combat but also in psychological manipulation being especially impressive.KuonKuon Tsuchimikado portrayed by new seiyuu Manaka Iwami is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Mangetsu and Shingetsu’s allies within the series. The youngest daughter of a famed magical house within the series Kuon on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and composed young girl that prefers solitude an attitude that’s similar to Shingetsu. While quiet Kuon was also an intelligent, curious and fast thinking person that had the unusual ability to be able to think outside of the box a skill that’s rare within girls her age. When combined with both her logical nature and her ability to look at things, in the long run, this allowed her to seek out opportunities that will benefit both her and her allies equally without getting emotionally involved a trait that I felt suited her especially well. While far more friendly and diplomatic than Shingetsu Kuon was also intelligent enough to realise that today's allies can also be tomorrows enemies and as a result learned to hide her emotions. Yet even so as the series went on it can be seen that until the end Kuon’s interactions with her friends and allies Shingetsu and Mangetsu can be said to be something that she genuinely enjoyed and seemed to treasure and despite being rivals she had not elected to withdraw from their alliance and re target them as hostiles showing that in her life they were existences that were equal to her idolised elder sister. While seemingly mature for her age Kuon was shown to be someone that was surprisingly fragile emotionally and was easily rattled when exploited by skilled enemies such as her true opponent Suishou. However conversely Kuon was also shown to be able to fight extremely well when her focus is clear and her mind is engaged fully as shown in the high-level duals that marked the end of her arc.The character of Kuon I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. In a way, it can be seen that Kuon’s default personality was similar to Shingetsu’s in that like her Kuon’s nature at the start was that of a quiet, calm and composed girl that took great care in planning her moves in Granbelm while viewing things like bonds and friendships as secondary concerns.

TL;DR of the premise is effectively many girls put into a mecha battle royale to battle it out for the chance to become a mage. The 2d mech animation is wonderful and the 3d cg mech animation doesn't exist. The first thing that stood out to me about this show is of course, the mecha designs. They've been squished and rounded out compared to the giant hulking behemoths we're all used to. However, with this comes the amazing blessing of not having to deal with random cuts to CG to completely pull you...out of the experience. All the mecha animation (to my knowledge) is 100% 2d, and I've not noticed any CG.The story is definitely a trip. To not get too much into spoiler territory, the first episode will confuse the shit out of you. The second probably will as well. Maybe by episode 3 you'll start to think, hey I think everything is starting to line up and I'm really getting a grasp on the story. From there, the show stops holding your hand. It opens up with clues that may not be obvious at first glance. It'll tell the story at it's own pace, but leave you enough clues to think you're an episode ahead, only to get blindsided. It definitely takes advantage of the fact that the anime is their first way to experience the story.Currently only at episode 8 with a lot of questions, but every episode so far, they've been consistently nailing the presentation and answering the questions you have to make it hit just right. On top of that though, they're consistently strong with subverting expectations. They'll set up a question in one episode that you'll focus on throughout the week, and then once the next episode hits, they dropkick you with something unexpected.Overall, the show is amazing. Amazing directing, amazing voice work, great visuals that really show out in important scenes without crutching on the easy CG move many mech shows have taken. If you're an active viewer who loves to dig through scenes and find what the director is subtly telling you, you should pick this up before it's done airing. This show has been a consistent 10 on that front. If you're more of a passive viewer who prefers a story that explains everything, you might want to wait until it's over and binge it. Either way, its well worth the watch. out of the experience. All the mecha animation (to my knowledge) is 100% 2d, and I've not noticed any CG.The story is definitely a trip.

Really, its that good!Ok, now if you are still reading this. Its now to state my opinions on why I find it so great.As you probably already read the synopsis, Granbelm is a magical girls\' Battle Royale. And much like the currently popular Battle Royale games like PUBG, Fortnite, Apex Legends, the winner gets the big chicken dinner. In this case the chicken dinner is becoming the Princeps Magician, and having all the magical power in the world to do as they wish.The...unique part of the battles is that they are fought in a magical space through magical SD mechs. SD meaning ""Super Deformed"". Where the face is unproportionally large compared with the rest of the mech\'s body. This kind of mecha is a throwback to the SD gundam mechs, and certain old school shounen mecha animes from the 1990s era.The mecha battles are where this show visually shines. The producers certainly know their mecha animes, from the distinctive SD mechs that reflect each pilot\'s personality, to the big laser lightshows and homing lasers that have Macross and Gundam labelled all over, to the last battle scene being a nostalgic throwback of Amuro\'s Gundam RX-78-2 vs Char\'s MSN-02 Zeong. All these really appeal to the long time mecha fan that lies in me.Story and pacing wise is where a lot of people have divided opinions about this work. I can understand why a lot of anime fans drop this series after watching the first few episodes. The pacing of the first few episodes is REALLY SLOW... So much so that many anime fans get bored and drop it after only watching a few episodes. But if you stay watching till the end, its where you are really REWARDED.The story is intentionally paced slowly during the first few episodes, so that there is an air of mystery surrounding the characters and the Granbelm battle. As the story goes on we get to know more and more about the characters, their motivations and the story unravels. Much like how the town seems to be surrounded by mysterious mist in the beginning, the mist gradually lifts and the truth is revealed. There is a lot of subtlety in the visuals, the dialogue and the story. And its really rewarding for the dedicated viewer to realise all these details when they reach the later episodes, or when they rewatch the series.Characters and Sound are another highlight of this series. Each Magical Girl has a unique backstory and motivation on why they want to become the Princeps Mage. And we can see the strong influence of the depressing ""Puella Magi Madoka Magica"" series here. The mood around each character is somber and melancholic. And just like the Madoka series there is permadeath here. A cool part about this mechanic is that if you visit the official Japanese Granbelm website. The character portraits of those that permadied are greyed out, after the episode of their death aired during the regular TV season. This really drives home the feeling of loss, as it is a sign to the viewers that the character is gone forever, no anime style bending of rules and reviving them. And it also gives the audience a forboding feeling of wondering who will be permakilled next.Both the character and mecha designs are unique and interesting but we don\'t really appreciate their diversity, UNTIL the later episodes where each character gets their due development and we get way more invested and involved in each\'s character\'s fate and the outcome of the battles.Anna\'s mech and her moves are red and flashy because she craves for the attention and recognition of her mother.Kuon\'s mech is elegant, slim and uses fans because of her association of japanese music and japanese folk dance with her sister.Suishou\'s mech is cloaked and features hidden because she wants to remain like a low profile referee in the background, and hide until the final stages of the Granbelm competition where she reveals her full sinister passion and her desires to control, bind and destroy everyone that stands in her way of becoming the Princeps magician.Mangetsu\'s mech is white because she is a blank canvas and an she is the mirror, opposite image of Ernesta (Black). And because it symbolises the full moon as well which is usually pale white.Ernesta\'s mech is black and stealthy like a ninja as she hates herself and believes she is like the hidden demon or ninja stealthily living and killing the lives of the people around her. She desperately wants to remain out of the spotlight and fade into the shadows, hence the black, shadowy design of her mech.And the most obvious design has to be Nene\'s mech as it is has as defensive shell like a turtle with chameleon hiding powers. She likes to hide in the background, doing calculations and making her impact felt from range, preferably from the comfort of her own home. Her suppressed physical growth and childlike body makes her feel like she cannot compete with the other magical girls when it comes to physical battles, yet when it came down to her final battle against Mangetsu, she revealed her full, huge mech size which is symbolic of her actual age and body of a adult, compared to the much smaller and younger middle age magicial girls.There is a lot of subtlety involved in the mech and character designs and colours, but they will go unappreciated if the viewer does not watch the entire series and understand each character\'s background and story.Soundtrack wise both the OP and ED songs are excellent songs that accompany the melancholic mood of the series. But the standout sounds has to be the OUTSTANDING voice acting of veteran voice actresses Yoko Hikasa (Anna Fugo) and Yuuki Aoi (Suishou). I have to give a standing ovation to Yuuki Aoi for her role as the main antagonist Suishou. Even though technically in a Battle Royale there is no good and evil, as everyone is trying to win for their own selfish reasons. But Yuuki Aoi\'s sinister voice as Shishou is such a standout, that her main role as the loli demon girl in ""Youjo Senki"", is a warmup compared to her acting here in Granbelm. It is probably worth rewatching the entire series just to appreciate her voice acting.If you are a longtime anime fan like me (about 30+ years since I started watching anime as a kid). You might have occasionally wondered what a really well voice acted anime character sounds like. How much can voice acting achieve? Look no further, Yuuki Aoi as Suishou in Granblem is the peak of anime voice acting....Overall I gave this series a 9 instead of a 10, simply because I am personally biased towards more cheerful animes. I watch anime as a means of escape and that is why I prefer comedies instead of melancholic battle animes where permadeath is a reality. But for viewers that does not have the same bias as me, this series could easily score a perfect 10. Among Granbelm fans, or just viewers who appreciate the depth and effort put into this series, Granbelm will stand as a legendary, classic piece of anime work that will be hard to surpass.... unique part of the battles is that they are fought in a magical space through magical SD mechs.

But those episodes do not speak for the whole anime at all. They are necessary to set up the story, to build up the actual intense plot that follows up. After watching the whole anime, the  first half become absolutely relevant, and all pieces of the puzzle fall into places beautifully, like true magic!The second half is what gave me a 10/10 rating. Things take a turn drastically, even though there were foreshadowing before, I was still shocked and deeply impressed by the various...twists, predicaments and dilemmas the characters have to face. It has many moments, that can totally be regarded as best in anime history, if other people were to stay with it until the end, sure they\'ll have no choice but agree. After all, the anime leaves  beautiful emotional scars within my heart. The emotions and experiences that I will not soon forget. One of the anime that keeps me feeling sad and empty because a masterpiece come to an end, because of the fates of its colorful characters.The art is absolutely gorgeous. Exquisite hand-drawn fighting animations. I\'ll be brief, the anime\'s fight scene is among the I\'ve ever seen in mecha genre, and among another myriad of ""hot"" anime out there. The dedication put into surpasses everything else.The music is outstanding. I watched scenes again and again to experience those unique sounds. And they only become better and even better with each rewatch. The melody, the instruments used, the syncing, timing, all fits perfectly into contexts. The music itself is an wild emotional ride that will move anyone, guaranteed!I will miss this, and will keep on feeling sadness, emptiness \'cause it was there, it was magnificent, and finally it ended. And of course also being proud for staying with it until the very end, being able to truly perceive the incredible magics it has to offer.

Twelve weeks later, and I'm left fairly impressed with how this project panned out.The show is very much divided into two parts; the fights and the spaces of time between said fights. These intermittent periods are the show's bread and butter, as each girl has a fleshed out reason as to why you'd want to root for them. (My favorite would have to go to Nene- the 20 something year old middle schooler). Granbelm is a show with REAL STAKES,...and REAL CONSEQUENCES; whenever anything happens, its implications and effect remain prevalent all the way until the end. Very reminiscent of Madoka.Again, the character design is done by none other than Shinichirou Otsuka, who might have very well balanced moe faces onto disturbing places. Big props on that department. As for the mechs, while they may not look all that aesthetically pleasing, they sure do leave an impression. They somehow remind me of the Kirby games, for some reason.If you're a fan of Re: Zero, Madoka, Battle Royales, and mechs, it wouldn't hurt to pick this show up for an evening binge. 8/10 and REAL CONSEQUENCES; whenever anything happens, its implications and effect remain prevalent all the way until the end.

Suppose you witnessed as one by one those you loved lost everything and made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of this blessing, all failing and disappearing in the end, surviving only as a lingering shadow burdened with regret within your own heart. Would you be willing to sacrifice your blessing if it meant sparing others from the same cruel fate? Would you be willing to pay that price if it also meant condemning those precious ghosts within your soul to fade as well? Would you,...if what was asked of you was to surrender your only friend's existence? Would you end her to end all suffering, even if she begged you to?The hidden gem of this season came to us in the form of Granbelm, a seemingly insignificant Mahou Shoujo / Mecha Battle Royale that instead of trying to awkwardly subvert expectations and tropes like most animes with such tags in recent years, decided to embrace and refine the core strengths of its small niche as closely to perfection as it could muster. War is hell, and being Meguca is suffering, but the human heart is capable of so much more than what we realize. Selflessness, purity, hope, love. The typical concepts you'd expect from a lesser show exposed in a painfully human manner as principles worth dying for and not only that, but the only meaningful reason to go on living.The introduction of the show was confusing, but it turned out to be diegetic in a way that I could only appreciate upon a second watching of the show. The designs of the mecha were simple, and even infantile at first, but that changed over time and had a beautiful reason to be that way in the first place. The characters were every bit as lovely and tragic, and each choice they made and word they uttered held weight and meaning behind it. And most important of all, every turn in the story was unexpected, captivating and kept me wishing for more. This is one show where you should absolutely stick around for after-credit scenes.In the end, the seemingly clashing elements of the story complemented each other and informed a unique identity, which bravely decided to go for a decisive and definitive end, tying up loose threads and providing us with tranquility rarely found nowadays in the world of storytelling, so often focused on remaining forever relevant and present.Granbelm is not a show I will forget anytime soon, as it encapsulates so much of what I love about the stories that preceded it, while blazing a trail forward into the unknown for the stories yet to be told. After all in a world without magic, we humans only have each other to give us strength, and I do hope this tale will inspire many more over the decades to come.Also, Suishou did nothing wrong and she is the best girl.

Fight me!"", 'This is my first review so bear with me.My first impression was it seems interesting but also lacking of information. In the first episode you are thrown into the show with little to no knowledge of what’s going on. I honestly thought about giving up on watching; BUT I decided I was still interested and gave it a chance, and I’m glad I did. Because as stated in a review I read from someone else, you are thrown into the events of the story with no knowledge of what’s going on because the main character has no idea either what’s going on. All the...”contestants” seemingly train most their life for this, but the main character didn’t, neither did she know about the existence of magic, like most people. The way you learn more about what’s going on is through watching the main character progress and learn for herself what’s going on. (Which if you ask me is pretty cool, it’s different from being told from the get go)I think the characters grow a lot and change. Some for the better and some for the worse (worse being they grow, but in a negative way from how they were, it’s still growth but growth in an evil way). The main character grows somewhat, but for reasons you’ll learn later in the show, her growth is different from others for a reason. She does grow and learn about the world but she doesn’t have as drastic of a change in her character like some.The show overall was really enjoyable. It took a few episodes before I started looking forward to the next episode, but I’m glad I watched it and I recommend it. It’s not cliche nor does it follow other anime’s stories, if you ask me. Would I blame you for dropping it first episode, no. But I think it’s at your loss for giving up on such a different and intriguing story. ”contestants” seemingly train most their life for this, but the main character didn’t, neither did she know about the existence of magic, like most people.

Every episode ends up being a build up for another and then by the end when all the puzzle pieces are together you are just amazed, that most of the answers were right in your face since...the first episodes. The story is unpredictable, every time I tried to predict what will happen in the next episode I  was just egged in the face by how wrong I was.The ending is no exception...The charactersThey were the best part of the story, I loved all of them, Anna ended up being my favourite.Every character from the main cast has it's own arc where their personality and backstory are shown, most of the time you go from hating the character to loving them.The show also does a great job making the characters feel real, the reasons they fight, the reasons the don't give up and the reasons they still go on, you can't help but resonate with them ~well at least in my case~.The animationOne of the best animation this season, from such a small studio, it was really surprising. The fights were so fluid and full of colour, it was just a pleasure to look at them, they weren't hard to follow either. The character designs were pretty good too, I wasn't a big fan of the design for the mechas.The sound designIt was good, the sound effects were decent, and the background music really set the mood when it wanted to. The voice acting, it was... just amazing, all VAs did a great job. Their performances really helped bringing the characters to life. Aoi Yuuki and Yoko Hikasa did an outstanding job, their acting sent shivers down my spineThe OP and ED were decent, nothing amazing, the songs were pretty good and the animation simple, but it did it's job, especially the ending's simplicity, it really helped to set everything for some episodes.It was an enjoyable series, every Friday I was looking forward for a new episode. The ending left me a bit sad but it was fulfilling and I wouldn't change it. From different interviews I read it seemed the team behind the show was very passionate about it. The animators, voice actors, everyone wanted to give an amazing experience, and they did... If you reading this and you aren't sure about starting it or not because of the rating, or because it has mechas or magic, i really suggest watching the first episodes, it could draw you in like it did for me.Overall it's a 9. the first episodes.

The character designs were pretty good too, I wasn't a big fan of the design for the mechas.The sound designIt was good, the sound effects were decent, and the background music really set the mood when it wanted to. The voice acting, it was... just amazing, all VAs did a great job. Their performances really helped bringing the characters to life. Aoi Yuuki and Yoko Hikasa did an outstanding job, their acting sent shivers down my spineThe OP and ED were decent, nothing amazing, the songs were pretty good and the animation simple, but it did it's job, especially the ending's simplicity, it really helped to set everything for some episodes.It was an enjoyable series, every Friday I was looking forward for a new episode. The ending left me a bit sad but it was fulfilling and I wouldn't change it. From different interviews I read it seemed the team behind the show was very passionate about it. The animators, voice actors, everyone wanted to give an amazing experience, and they did... If you reading this and you aren't sure about starting it or not because of the rating, or because it has mechas or magic, i really suggest watching the first episodes, it could draw you in like it did for me.Overall it's a 9."", ""People say: Don't judge a book by it's cover. Granbelm says: Don't judge an anime by the synopsis + half of the episodes...At first glance, the show looks completely unoriginal and uninspiring; a quick cash grab trying to bait fans of more popular genres: magical girl and mecha series into a show which has both of these elements combined into one and placed in a battle royal setting. Granbelm however, proved it's something more. Unfortunately, it only picks up speed in the latter half of the show. If you dropped this series after trying the first few episodes, I don't blame you. It was one...of the most boring series I watched at first, I usually had to rewatch several scenes because it was so boring I almost fell asleep. The latter half however was a huge improvement to the show, it had me glued to my seat wanting to watch more.I hated watching this show at first, everything was just so boring and lackluster. Usually you can say something good about a show like having a good story even if the art is terrible, or having good fight scenes even if the plot doesn't make sense; Granbelm however didn't have any of that, storywise and animation-wise, the show was really terrible. The story felt like the writer took bits and pieces of more popular shows and combined them to create frankenstein's monster. It felt unoriginal, like you've already seen it somewhere before despite being an original series. It was so boring that I barely remember the specific things that happen in the show, and I doubt even the writers remember. There's just too much of the characters talking and blabbering about useless things which 90% of the time isn't even important to the story, it's like they wrote it to be forgettable. Each episode usually had them fighting which was the entire point and story of the series, usually towards the end of the episode, and I barely remember any of them. The biggest problem was that there's not enough hype or buildup in the writing to properly explain why they're even fighting in the first place, it's like the characters just decide to fight and there's no explanation.The animation was probably the worst part, which if you're making a show that involves fight scenes every episode, that's really bad. Usually for niche shows like this, animation is the one saving grace a show can use to make it more enjoyable for the viewers because no matter how badly written or bland the show is, people will still watch if they can see giant robots brawling it out in a good ol' fashion slugfest or cute magical girls casting overthetop magic spells. Animation is the entire purpose of making these shows so niche, so you can use these unique settings to animate things people want to see and get viewers. Because at the end of the day, people just wanna see some action! Unfortunately Granbelm didn't capitalize on this early on despite having a very niche setting.However, the show really picked up a lot in the second half, simply put: everything just got better. It was like watching a completely different show. The story, sound, voice acting, animation, designs, EVERYTHING became better. The animation in the fight scenes had the biggest improvement. In the first half, fight scenes usually lasted about 2-5 minutes per episode meaning majority of the show you weren't even watching the entire point of the show which was the characters fighting in this nonsensical magical war. In the latter half, the entire episode could be just the characters fighting and I was really impressed with the quality of animation, despite having longer and more fight scenes, animation quality was consistently top tier.Storywise the setting of course didn't change, so you could argue that the story is still inconsistent regarding the main storyline which is the explanation of the magical war and the entire world they're living in but at the same time, the individual character storylines got really interesting. The dialogue and backstories of the characters were more fleshed out and explained and it wasn't just for the main characters but the side characters as well. In fact they actually gave the side characters more focus and backstory than the main ones, for example one particular supporting character which was annoying in the first half even got an episode dedicated to her backstory and turned into one of the most memorable characters of the series. If you're talking about plot inconsistencies and writing, then yes maybe overall it's not the best writing but if you're reviewing on an episode to episode basis, the latter half of the show really improved the writing of the characters of the show.If you're a mecha fan who just loves watching giant robots fighting regardless of context, you'll probably like this because they incorporate some unique mechanics and attacks for the machines and their battles. The only problem is all the good fights are in the latter half of the show and the first half is pretty stale in terms of action. But after that all the fights are really well animated and really a treat to watch. Sound direction during the fight animation was also really good, the orchestral soundtrack accompanying the fights really fit with the theme of the show. I really enjoyed watching the show personally and the only reason I'm giving it a lower score is because of its slow start. of the most boring series I watched at first, I usually had to rewatch several scenes because it was so boring I almost fell asleep.

When it doesn't tell you what it's going to do, and you try to guess based on the genre and anime logic you're used to, you end up wrong.I'm not all that enthused by the plot (though depending on what happens in the last few episodes that may change), as Granbelm leans on several standard tropes. That said, Granbelm's execution of said tropes is always excellent: we know exactly what has to happen in episode 7 with angry girl, but the show...carries everything out with such intensity that it doesn't matter that we know. When Granbelm gets like this you can tell its creators were enjoying themselves.

It always reveals only as much as it has to—or perhaps, as little as it must—as it moves forward. Rather than ask (or tempt) viewers to absorb it by rummaging through all the supposed clues it's left, Granbelm lets you enjoy each episode as it happens—and makes sure there's plenty to enjoy.

For me personally, I don't consider myself to be much of a mech type anime fan, but this was pretty solid. I have my gripes, but, it was a show I looked forward to regularly.Story: The story follows Mangetsu and Shingetsu, and their parts in a magical mech battle that occurs every full moon, until there's only one person remaining. At that time, the winner has their wish granted. This is called GRANBELM....This lent itself to a nice mix of action and character development and regular world stuff. It was fairly well balanced in my opinion, and you got to see each characters fighting spirit, as well as their regular personality as a human being. They did a pretty solid job of tossing in a few plot twists here and there as well, to keep you on your toes.Art: The character design was solid. All the girls were visually interesting, and unique. For me personally, I'm only giving the art a seven, because of the mech design. In my opinion, I felt like the mechs looked like they were designed, and then stretched out horizontally, they had this short and wide appearance, which was unique from your typical mech, but honestly just didn't work for me. That aside, the different realms where the fights of GRANBELM took place, where generally beautiful, and very unique from one another. Speaking of the fight scenes, there were a few times where I lost track of what was happening, with all the fast movements, and bright neon lights. Part of that might have just been that this was generally my last anime of the night on Fridays, and by that time, I was normally relatively tired, and lacked some focus- so, I won't hold this against them much.Sound: The voice acting was good, there were some emotional scenes where I think the actors did a good job of capturing the strong feelings taking place. Outside of those scenes though, there wasn't anything too ridiculous in those regards. I felt like the sound track, and music was well timed, and fitting for each and every occasion. They did a good job of setting the mood with the right score. Plus, the opening was solid as well.Characters: There were a decent amount of characters in this, I loved the dynamic between Shingetsu and Mangetsu, the other girls along the way added their own uniqueness, and helped keep each battle unique, as they normally focused on a specific girl or group in each of those fights. Outside of GRANBELM, they all had their own personalities, and backstories surrounding their existence, and their reason for taking place in GRANBELM.Enjoyment: I liked it. It's hard to judge an anime in a genre you're unfamiliar, because you don't have a lot to compare it with, so, I find myself comparing it with just any other anime at the moment. I had a number of times where I was upset to see the end of an episode, and/or excited to get around to the episode the following week. I think the pacing was solid, and I never really found myself getting bored at all, which is always a good thing.Overall: It gets a 7/10. It wasn't perfect, but, it was an anime that surprised me in terms of how much I enjoyed it. A few things I would have liked if they had done differently, but, I think that's more just preference than anything.

Thanks GRANBELM!"", 'TL;DR: Watch Granbelm if you want a dark magical girl show that not only delivers a healthy dose of screaming anime girls battling to the death in mechas but also delivers a compelling story about identity and what it means to be remembered.Long review:You ever just watch Madoka Magica and think, ""man, if this anime had mechs in it and had them fight in a battle royale, it would be perfect""?And then said anime comes out and not only does it live up to your expectations, it also sets itself apart as something wholly unique and special?That\'s Granbelm. In 2019, Masaharu Watanabe, just finishing up...the then-most recent season of critically acclaimed fantasy isekai anime Re:Zero, teamed up with a couple of other notable figures in the Japanese animation industry (original character designer Shinichirou Ootsuka, script writer and series composer Jukki Hanada, among others) to bring us what I unironically think is one of the best entries to ever come out of the magical girl genre.Yes, it\'s derivative; on first glance, it\'s yet another edgy and dark magical girl show that does yet another take on the subgenre that Madoka popularized. Here\'s the thing, though: while other dark magical girl shows stumbled and fell, Granbelm more than exceeds.Take one of the largest pitfalls of said genre, for instance: the tone. Dark magical girl shows tend to take the wrong lesson from Madoka episode 3 (cough cough magical girl raising project cough cough mahou shoujo site cough cough) and dump an excessively dark and edgy tone on their viewers from the beginning. While that\'s not inherently a wrong approach, it will very much alienate a good portion of viewers who view said ""edginess"" as weakness in storytelling. Why do those same viewers like Madoka so much then? Moderation in use of said tone. Madoka didn\'t dump despair and death on its viewers from the beginning: it eased them into it, even with sudden jumps like episode 3. It knew when to use tone to its greatest narrative advantage and it\'s a lesson that similar successful dark mahou shoujo shows, like Yuuki Yuuna, and now Granbelm, learnt and used well. There\'s time for levity, and time for overbearing seriousness, and Granbelm manages both well.The characters are also top-tier. One of the main characters, Mangetsu, simply has a manic, hyper energy about her that simply makes her interactions with the other characters, in particular the other main character, Shingetsu, fun to watch. Shingetsu, quite frankly, is the typical dark mahou shoujo protagonist archetype that Homura from Madoka popularized: an emotional stone wall that\'s ""cool"" and ""stoic"". The creative minds behind Granbelm knew that having yet another Homura-like would not guarantee success, and they ingeniously decided to pair her up with a manic character type like Mangetsu to wring out the emotions. I personally believed it works: as a result, the dynamic between the two main characters never gets stale or boring, and investment in how these two characters\' stories turn out becomes quite easy. The other participants in the battle royale are surprisingly quite decent in the character-building front as well; even the characters like token Chinese girl Nene and stereotypical shrine maiden Kuon get much more development than they needed. The standouts are obviously Anna and (best girl) Suishou; Anna is very much unlike any villainous character type seen in any magical girl show, and her story in Granbelm is compelling in how it unfolds and clashes with the main pair\'s paths. Suishou is best girl. There is no argument, there is no bias whatsoever.The plot and themes, however, are what made Granbelm go from just another seasonal show for me to a personal favorite that I can\'t help but think about every other day. Granbelm didn\'t have to make a deep plot; its fellow members of the dark mahou shoujo subgenre, like Yuuki Yuuna, settled for ""SUFFERING IS THE BEST PLOT"" and found great success. However, evidently the Re:Zero director had enough of that with his primary work, so he decided to actually have Granbelm\'s characters suffer for a purpose and a distinct theme. And he over-performs. Identity is the connecting word of Granbelm, and the core of every single character\'s struggles as they battle each other. The plot greatly benefits from it, making the emotional beats and fights more impactful than they would\'ve been with a normal genre plot. Even the typical twists and ""edgy"" moments that you\'d expected from a dark magical girl show factor back to this theme, and it makes those moments so much more powerful. The staff of Granbelm clearly had a vision for what they wanted to say with the show, and it very much works in its favor.The one ""weak"" point, although this may be up to your mileage, is the animation. The animation, performed by Studio Nexus, is more than up to the task for the characters and plot: the characters are very animated and fun to watch, and the animation helped supplement the engaging plot for the entirety of the show. However, Studio Nexus decided to animate the entire show with hand 2d animation, rather than relying on any CG as the majority of mech shows do that are not named Sunrise. In my opinion, this animation style is good, even rising to exceptional as needed. However, as a 2019 anime, in an era where Sunrise has set the standard of mecha fights in Gundam and related works, the 2d animated style used by Nexus may not be enough depending on your tastes. For me, it worked; for others, it may not, and that\'s totally fair.If you liked Madoka Magica and the subgenre it created, or hell, even think that any aspect of this show sounds interesting, I implore you to give it a try. I sure as hell am glad I did; I nearly dropped this show on episode 1, as did justifiably many others when the show first came out, but something kept me coming back each week, and I\'m so glad I kept with the show. This show is the entire reason why I keep trucking through seasonal anime looking for those hidden nuggets of quality, and is a big part of my faith that small anime studios still can create compelling stories outside of the 999th generic isekai or the 450th CGCDT adaptation.As a certain redhead once said: ""There\'s no rule saying that an imitation cannot defeat the original."" the then-most recent season of critically acclaimed fantasy isekai anime Re:Zero, teamed up with a couple of other notable figures in the Japanese animation industry (original character designer Shinichirou Ootsuka, script writer and series composer Jukki Hanada, among others) to bring us what I unironically think is one of the best entries to ever come out of the magical girl genre.Yes, it\'s derivative; on first glance, it\'s yet another edgy and dark magical girl show that does yet another take on the subgenre that Madoka popularized.

And I believe this is a good way of referring to both Granbelm thematically and how I felt towards the series.Granbelm is a mahou shoujo mecha series, two genres that aren\'t exactly 100% compatible with each other but do share some similarities. Tonally the show is largely melancholic but does get somewhat upbeat and optimistic at times, a la you typical mecha anime, complete with hot blooded ness but not quite as pronounced as say Symphogear. But I will say this, the...tonal shifts aren\'t exactly jarring (not that they feel natural in the first place), so watching the show isn\'t that much of an uncomfortable experience.The series is very much a life-and-death drama type show even if it doesn\'t get there until halfway into the series. I have to say I do respect the show\'s treatment in facing the inevitable, and how dignified some characters go about their deaths. I have to say I can\'t think of many anime that dealt with death in such a dignified way, it\'s usually bombastic or sad or over-the-top, and I commend the show for this. The show does genuinely get quite melancholic at times but not to the point of being emotional I might add.To be honest the first half of the show feel quite pointless in the long run but it did give me a lot of Hikasa Yoko screaming at the top of her lungs so it balances out. The show can drag at times especially in the first half but unlike most other shows by the end it didn\'t feel as if it had overstayed its welcome.Speaking of which it\'s humorous that the main and secondary antagonists of this is voiced by the same people who did the main and secondary protagonists of Symphogear. I kept having the show on my mind throughout.Ultimately it\'s a fine show. Nothing too special but I did like several moments of it. Notably Hikasa\'s screaming and later Yuuki Aoi\'s screaming. Unfortunately, this series may soon be forgotten in a sea of other original anime, doomed to be ignored and fade into obscurity. Then again, maybe that isn\'t too bad a thing...6/10 tonal shifts aren\'t exactly jarring (not that they feel natural in the first place), so watching the show isn\'t that much of an uncomfortable experience.The series is very much a life-and-death drama type show even if it doesn\'t get there until halfway into the series. I have to say I do respect the show\'s treatment in facing the inevitable, and how dignified some characters go about their deaths. I have to say I can\'t think of many anime that dealt with death in such a dignified way, it\'s usually bombastic or sad or over-the-top, and I commend the show for this. The show does genuinely get quite melancholic at times but not to the point of being emotional I might add.To be honest the first half of the show feel quite pointless in the long run but it did give me a lot of Hikasa Yoko screaming at the top of her lungs so it balances out.

It is a really touching story about two girls who meet in really uncommon situation and connect somehow since that moment (Even though they are not conscious of it at first).Shingetu and Mangetsu are the protagonist of this story. They are the typical duo you would ship and love since they relationship develop through time getting stronger and stronger. You would definitely feel some strong emotions with each character. You get attached and feel their desires and sadness, sometimes happiness and at a certain...moment you understand them. They are so human with their feelings and thoughts that I cannot describe how much satisfied I felt afterwards. The animation was well developed.I really liked it.

You can picture Haruhi Suzumiya or Okabe Rinarou or Shinji Ikari in your head and imagine how they react to an event because there\'s a layer of quirks and an aspect of multidimensionality to the way they act. The perception of these parts are the product of a bunch of little scenes, often where the characters aren\'t saying much at all, where a combination of scene...blocking and body language tells us something that runs contrary to the things they say aloud. Okabe and Haruhi may be loud and obnoxious, but these are balanced out by little moments where they work to make peace with the people around them, or display touches of vulnerability and kindness when people are looking in the other direction.Granbelm... isn\'t capable of doing this, and the serious nature of the story was reliant on having characters we could connect to this way. Instead, whenever characters aren\'t showering us with technical exposition (there\'s a lot, and most of it isn\'t used) they\'re telling us their life story, and bashing us over the head with why X character has had a pathetic life. Even during its best attempt in Episode 11, the effect is ruined by lengthy Voice Overs and monologues. Characters are often one-note, and present us little variety beyond being neutral-genki or stoic or streaming mad, and then never really deviating from that. Mangetsu gets some deviation--two modes instead of just one--but in a cast of seven this isn\'t enough, particularly given the number of scenes where she is absent.This makes it even more frustrating when we hit the action sequences. From an animation standpoint, these sequences are PHENOMENAL, and you can see the excellent hand-drawn detail and effort that went into this show. Unfortunately, the resulting battles ring hollow because without strong characters to form a proper foundation, I never felt like cheering for anyone, and the victories and defeats do not carry the weightiness of other \'serious magical girl\' shows like Madoka Magica or Yuuki Yuuna.In all, I\'m happy that I finished this to get the full picture of what my problem with it was, but I don\'t see myself watching it again if offered, nor suggesting it to anyone else. blocking and body language tells us something that runs contrary to the things they say aloud.

Backrounds are especially great to behold in this oneAnimation is ranging from good and detailed to average (worth to note im generally generous when it comes to that). Inside mecha views are especially lovelyI do have to bring out mecha parts in separate because this is pretty much only area in art/animation where i have to seriously deduct points. Yes, they look good (in face value) but fight scenes (and this being a mecha shows, there are...plenty of those). Besides the animation in fights tends to make them stubby looking and quite frankly oddest looking mechas ive seen in anime (and i have seen plenty, despite mecha being one of few genres i find hard getting into)Music:Generally pretty decent, but there are some good pieces in this one.Characters & story:This is toughest part to review as frankly it is quite forgettable. It definetly starts off in strong note as mystery factor in addition to the mecha battles and extremely big stakes right off the bat add certain allure. Characters are also great at first, with their own personalities and goals. However, i would say characters and story were most fleshed out at the start, which is odd thing to say as it should be other way around.But over course of the story,  everything started to become more bland. Ironically enough, it were things that were supposed to make story more interesting that caused it (wont specify because, you know, spoilers). And oh geesh the edgyness of it at times.. too forced. I dont mind show being edgy if it happens naturally, but this one went out of its way. And over time it descended into show you can easily guess whats happening next.Which is kinda sad because it did have few good pearls in it, but it became so forgettable.Verdict:While having strong start and great artwork at times, it does feel like Granbelm limits itself a lot, causing it to decline to rather forgettable and predictable story once you figured out shows tone. However, it is still entertaining enough to finish it- although i do have to say i was quite close not caring about last 2 episodes.I dont know how it appeals to mecha fans, but for me personally it is in ""ok, but not going to rewatch"" category plenty of those).

I decided to watch it a Saturday night and, surprisingly, it was quite fascinating. I stayed till the end. That said, was it good? Well, let's hop on and find out.Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryGranbelm mixes the magical girl and mecha genres to deliver a brand new premise: a tournament between mages where the winner shall be declared the wielder of all magic in the universe. The main character, Mangetsu, joins forces with veteran witch Shingetsu to survive the Granbelm, all while meeting other girls that fight to have their wishes fulfilled. I...actually enjoyed the basic premise of magic robots fighting each other, but I had a huge problem with the show's world-building, or rather, lack thereof.We don't know much about the basic principles and general understandings of magic in the Granbelm universe. We only know that magic was sealed years ago inside a special device called Magiaconatus because humans were misusing magic. It would have been nice if we learned more about the circumstances behind the creation of the Magiaconatus and the Granbelm or how can people use magic outside the Granbelm. The only real storyline in this show is that the characters must win the Granbelm.I didn't have much trouble with the show's tone. It starts off cheerful and light-hearted, if somewhat ominous, but as the fighting continues, things get dark and gritty, especially in regards to certain characters like Mangetsu and Anna. I don't mind shows getting dark and gritty as long as they can deliver a positive outcome, if only to reward viewers for their emotional investment in the characters and their struggles. (5/10)CharactersMangetsu has a great role as the show's everywoman, as she experiences much of the Granbelm universe for the first time and ends up asking the questions we ourselves would ask if we found ourselves in those exact same situations. Her foil, Shingetsu, isn't that interesting in comparison. Sure, her interactions with Mangetsu and Anna deliver some of the most poignant moments in the show, but without a more grounded and emotionally open character like Mangetsu to contrast her, Shingetsu cannot carry the story all by herself, even when the story brings Shingetsu into the spotlight.One of the best characters in the show is Anna, a tragic villain worthy of Shakespeare. She is someone viewers can hate and feel sorry for at the same time, considering she brings much misfortune onto herself thanks to her very serious character flaws, like anger and resentment. The show is really good at portraying Anna in a tragic light. In contrast, the other villain Suishou, isn't that interesting. The show tries to get us to sympathize with Suishou, once again using Shingetsu as a foil, but because that new development happens till the endgame, it just ends up pointing towards character depth that is simply not there.There are other interesting characters in the show, like Kuon, Rosa and Nene, but they just get a few scenes of character development, making it clear that the character writing was all over the place in this show. It's not bad, but it's not great either. (7/10)ArtThe visual quality of Granbelm is nothing short of extraordinary. While I'm not a big fan of the cutesy robot designs, props should been given to the animators for making the fights as impressive and epic as possible. Everything, from the backgrounds to the lighting, looks stunning during fight scenes. The character designs also deserve praise, too. All the character possess distinctive appearances, making them easier for the viewers to tell apart. (8/10)SoundThe best thing about Granbelm is the opener, which has to be one of the best openers of the year. The sound effects during fight scenes are also incredible and go a long way in delivering the magic power these robots possess. Praise should go to the voice actresses, as well. Miyuri Shimabukuro does a fine job in the leading part, while Aoi Yuuki and Yoko Hikasa show their talents with villainous roles. While I'm not a big fan of Shingetsu, I admit that Atsumi Tanezaki delivered an excellent performance. (9/10)OverallThis wasn't a bad show. It's not perfect, but it was still enjoyable. Despite its flaws, it is definitely a diamond in the rough and I recommend it to any fan of the magical girl and mecha genres. I'm sad that this show largely flew under the radar during its broadcasting season, but I'm glad that I watched it.

Goodbye, Granbelm, you shall never be forgotten."", ""This series is marginally above average in every respect. It often gets boring, to be honest, but at the same time carries just enough to keep you interested. Most of that is not in the plot, or the endless fight scenes though. The characters are the strongest point, with Shuishou being my favorite and some obvious chemistry between other characters. Even then the anime fails however, as you're often left with not enough breathing room or information about the characters. What even is Nenene's purpose in fighting, and why would she team up with Mangetsu? If you've seen Fate, you'll be very familiar with the...concept of shifting alliances and team ups.In fact, this series is extremely reminiscent of Fate, particularly Fate/Extra. It's quite possible that if you've played Fate/Extra you will actually be able to guess most of this show's plot twists. But the same could likely be said if you simply have a lot of Magical Girl literacy. I feel like Magical Girl genre gets a bad rap. It's been around philosophizing and subverting expectations for generations before Madoka. However, that means any literacy in the genre will allow you to see how it comes together to make Granbelm.The problem is Granbelm is just derivative of everything else, and bland. There's virtually no artistry in anything. The plot is Fate, the mechs are clearly modeled after SD Gundams (particularly Sengokuden), the music isn't particularly special, the characters are derivative of other characters even past embodying tropes. There is nothing special about this anime.It's just okay.It falls flat in some areas however. I feel like Shingetsu's wish isn't actually properly addressed. If Shingetsu had her way there'd be no technology ever. There'd be no fire because you can burn people with it. Character motivations aren't always clear as well. Sometimes character PLACEMENT isn't even clear. How certain characters got to where they are, or allied with certain people before the series starts, just doesn't feel possible. I get that this could be somewhat addressed in one plot point, but it gets to feel a bit like it's just using the lack of a distinctive background for characters to justify having them wherever the hell it wants.Some other plot points that aren't fully explained also don't make sense. It seems to imply some of these girls are forced to fight, but why? That can't benefit the guys abusing them. The moment the girl you're backing turns into a god, she'll just smite you. It's literally built into the reason they fight that they want to obtain the power of a god. You're just going to get B.B. from Fate best case scenario.All in all the series is just acceptable in all respects. I wouldn't say I regret watching it. It's nice that it doesn't spoon feed you anything, and expects you to keep up. On the other hand, it doesn't exactly offer anything new to mystify or surprise you if you're familiar with the places it's pulling from.If you're watching it and wonder if you should keep watching it, for me it got the most interesting around episode 6. In my opinion if you've watched 3 episodes and don't care for it, you're not losing out by dropping it. Many people seem to feel the series really raises the bar as it progresses, which is true... But not enough. I can't imagine hating episode 1, 2, and 3, but definitively loving 10-13.

To be frank, I am not a fan of the ""mobile suit"" style in this anime (I know they are not mobile suits, but simplest analogy.) The SD style doesn\'t appeal to me, and the action and animation are something of a blur at times, which makes some scenes hard to follow.However, the story ended up being surprisingly good, with a powerful twist, and I was quite engaged halfway through the series.While I do have some issues regarding the SD style (personal preference), you...might like it.

It makes more sense to discuss ""pre-twist Granbelm"" and ""post-twist Granbelm"". I won\'t spoil it below, so please excuse the vagueness, and I strongly encourage people that haven\'t seen it before to avoid spoilers for the show\'s big twist at all costs. You won\'t get the full experience otherwise.About pre-twist Granbelm, there isn\'t really a lot to say.  It\'s more or less standard magical girl stuff, and likely generic enough early on that it caused a lot of people to drop it or give it a poor rating.  It would...be fair to say that the early experience is something like watching Madoka Magica, Fate and Evangelion get thrown into a blender.  It isn\'t bad at all, and there are a few compelling storylines and some characters that you\'ll grow attached to, but the mechs (called ARMANOX in the show) look kinda dorky (with the exceptions of Drosela Nocturne and Ji Guan Long) and battles tend to devolve into non-stop screaming and screen-filling explosions.  It\'s fine, but nothing to write home about.Then, around the 2/3rds point of the series, Granbelm delivers a gut punch of a twist that completely changes everything that you thought you had been watching, and it turns into one of the best shows I have ever seen, anime or otherwise, for the last 4-5 episodes.  The scenes that take place outside of the ARMANOX battles during this last stretch are beautiful and heartbreaking at a rare level.  Mangetsu\'s VA in particular hits it out of the park with these sorts of quiet conversational scenes.  The writing is outstanding, and you\'ll discover some new tidbit each time you rewatch, like a subtle bit of foreshadowing that you missed the first time, or a tossed off line that ends up giving you new insights into a character.  Also, bring the Kleenex, because it gets extremely emotional.  This show is frequently compared to Madoka Magica for a reason, so come prepared for that.It\'s nearly impossible to give specific praise to the ending without major spoilers, so I will just say that the ending is outstanding, one of the best you\'ll see in anime, and a rare example of a deliberately ambiguous ending that is neither vague nor pretentious.  The type of ending that you can talk about with others and break down the various layers of symbolism to arrive at your own interpretation of the meaning of the events of the finale.  One of the real highlights of the series and anime in general for me.Normally, I would not rate a show that has clear flaws a 10, and Granbelm does have clear flaws.  However, I think so highly of those final few episodes and the ending that I consider it to be a masterpiece even in spite of those flaws.  They are minor and ultimately worth overlooking in order to heap praise on a seriously underrated gem of a show.

This can be attributed to shows like Madoka Magica, which gave a darker, more story-based spin on the usual ""girl meets talking animal and gets powers"" plot, and was targeted towards an older demographic, unlike Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura. Before long, a new wave of sleeker, story-based magical girl anime hit the scene, some more obscure than others.Granbelm is one of these shows that spawned out of the shadow of Madoka, but it fails to live up to the show that it\'s so clearly inspired by.The story follows the story...of the pink-haired protagonist Mangetsu, who, on the night of a full moon, is suddenly transmitted into Granbelm, a battle-royale set in another world, where girls fight eachother in massive magical mech suits. There, Mangetsu meets the mysterious Shingetsu, who tells her about the battle for unlimited magical power, and they end up forming a team to fight in Granbelm.Without going into too many spoilers, this show\'s plot is pretty weak and derivative. It borrows a lot of tropes from other anime without really putting any sort of creative spin on them other than ""cool big robot"". There is a plot twist towards the end of the show that kind of shakes things up, but by then there\'s not enough time to get deep into any character development, so the twist ends up coming off as sort of ""fake deep"".Speaking of character development, let\'s talk about this show\'s characters are probably its most lackluster feature. The protagonist features pretty much no unique qualities other than being naive and determined. Granted, this could be explained by future revelations in the show that I won\'t spoil, but it still doesn\'t make for a very interesting character. The same can be said for pretty much all of the other characters in the show; they have very one-note, uninteresting personalities that make it really hard for me to care about them in the slightest. There\'s one girl who\'s only personality trait is screaming in anger, like she doesn\'t have any sort of chill switch.The animation in this show is fine, for the most part. Where it really fails is during the fight scenes, where the show really just tries to throw out as much bright, seizure-inducing visual vomit as possible without really showing any dynamism or fluidity. Not all of the action scenes are bad, but the ones that are are really difficult to follow due to the show\'s need to overload the screen with neon lasers and explosions every 12 seconds. Not to mention that the show\'s opening sequence blatantly rips off Neon Genesis Evangelion in several ways.The soundtrack is decent. It has some pretty tracks, but it\'s not anything too crazy.Overall, this show just didn\'t really click for me. It just felt derivative to the point of losing almost all of its seriousness, from the opening sequence to the show\'s resolution. There were aspects of it that showed promise, but it ultimately failed at providing me with anything that I couldn\'t get out of Madoka Magica. of the pink-haired protagonist Mangetsu, who, on the night of a full moon, is suddenly transmitted into Granbelm, a battle-royale set in another world, where girls fight eachother in massive magical mech suits. There, Mangetsu meets the mysterious Shingetsu, who tells her about the battle for unlimited magical power, and they end up forming a team to fight in Granbelm.Without going into too many spoilers, this show\'s plot is pretty weak and derivative. It borrows a lot of tropes from other anime without really putting any sort of creative spin on them other than ""cool big robot"".

Haikyuu!! Quest Picture Drama,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31675/Haikyuu_Quest_Picture_Drama,"[""I really love this picture drama. Maybe because I'm a gamer as well, and I like the Haikyuu!! characters in RPG style. This is an extra, the whole 3 episodes are about 12 minutes, so don't think, that it adds anything to the original story. I think the implementig is amazing. Five Haikyuu!! characters: Hinata Shouyou, Kageyama Tobio, Iwaizumi Hajime, Takanobu Aone and Kozume Kenma are join forces to fight against the evil and tyrant king: Oiwaka Tooru. The DVD was originally bundled to the Limited Edition of the Nintendo 3DS game: Haikyuu!! Tsunage! Itadaki no Keshiki!! so the story also gives a kind of...game-feeling. The characters are like in a Fire Emblem or The Legend of Zelda game, the milieu is like in a NES game, the music is also 8-bit, so, it's like in an 80s game with the anime characters on the side of the screen. The music is like in the best NES games, which gives great feeling to the OVA. So, I like it very much, as a Haikyuu!! fan as a Nintendo gamer. game-feeling.

The story was small and that it had the major players the from few the teams in the anime and that five of them like Hinata, Kageyama, Kenma, Haijume and Takanobu who are heroes who had to face Oikawa who was the boss in this OVA. A small OVA which has Haikyuu characters in an RPG theme wasn't really...bad. bad."", ""I don't even know where to start with this.Anyways Haikyuu!! Quest Picture Drama, sounds interesting only 3 episodes what's the worse can happen? Well it's a complete waste of time for starters and, is just very boring and i couldn't even care less about it. Like why is this even a MAL entry, come on it's literally for a random version of one of the movies for dvd.Also, it's just a few of the characters trying to take down Oikawa's evil reign but it's just plain boring and, your never gonna get those 10 minutes back.Well it's not all awful, like when Oikawa makes those...faces it's pretty funny and i can never unsee them but, i just wanted to warn you just plz don't waste your time watching it, unless you just want another entry on your list go ahead but if not, just simply don't watch it. faces it's pretty funny and i can never unsee them but, i just wanted to warn you just plz don't waste your time watching it, unless you just want another entry on your list go ahead but if not, just simply don't watch it.""]"
Hikyou Tanken Fam & Ihrlie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1181/Hikyou_Tanken_Fam___Ihrlie,"[""Ruin Explorers are just like the name states: Something you look at in hopes of finding a treasure but you need to first search it in order to see whether you´ll find a treasure or just piles dirt. So what does this 4 episode OVA hide inside ?Story: 7The story takes us to a fantasy world where people called Ruin Explorers do their work in order to either stay alive by finding at least something valuable or they search for mythical treasures of immense power. In this world Ihrie and Fam are on a search for the “Ultimate Power” in order to fulfil their wishes....Along the way they meet a few other characters with the same idea on mind as them, a prince who wishes to avenge himself for the demise of his kingdom and you can pretty much guess how it all turns out. By now you may already think that there isn´t really much of originality in the story or the settings but the way the story is told and how it all unfolds is a rather refreshing return to the good old days when fantasy anime were still all about magic and monsters rather than fanservice and commerciality. But I would also lie if I said that this show is perfect. It has it´s minor setbacks and not all things are cleared or explained in the end but the ending is nice and satisfactory never the less.Characters: 7The number of characters in this show is rather low but who´d need more in a 4 episode OVA, right ? The main duo Ihrie and Fam are done nicely, each having their own distinctive personality which only contributes to the old days of fantasy anime. Ihrie being the headstrong tomboy with mild temper and swords flying around while Fam is the gentle and innocent type that would never hurt a fly and is the main source of “accidents” which put a smile on your face. The rest of the supporting characters  are pretty much as you´d expect them to be. You have the rivals, the greedy merchant, the arch-villain and a handsome prince looking for revenge. The downside (more or less) is that none of the characters is actually looked at deeply. Meaning that aside from a glimpse of Ihries´ and the princes´ background there isn´t almost any character development.Art: 7The art is the same as the entire anime – old school. The character models, the backgrounds, the depth of the colours or the details. Everything is as it should be considering the age of this anime. It all smells of nostalgia and the good old days of anime like Slayers or Gokudou-kun Manyuuki. Of course, it´s no eye-candy like today's shows but it has it´s own ring to it and if you aren´t an addict to the modern looks of anime this will hardy be a distraction or a negative for you.Sound: 7The OP and the ED are nice but you´ll probably skip them after the first time hearing them. They too are in the tone of the old ways but that doesn´t mean they´re bad, just that they aren´t that good either, but how can you judge until you hear it for yourself, no ?Enjoyment: 8It was rather nice to once again see a fantasy anime that actually is a fantasy anime. Don´t get me wrong, I have nothing against modern fantasy anime but it´s just that the old ones seem to be a bit more true to the genre than the modern ones. All in all, the show was entertaining despite how short it was so I don´t see a reason why not give it a try.Overall: 7Ruin Explorers is a nice yet short anime that isn´t that great and doesn´t really stand out that much yet it still manages to bee good enough to entertain you for the entire run of the 4 episodes. The story is nice (yet maybe not so original), the characters are likeable, the art is nothing to be afraid of and the sound is also nothing horrible. So, what are you still waiting for ? ^^Re-watchability: 3/5(5)- Anywhere, anytime, as many times as you like!(4)-Definitely worth seeing more than 3 times…(3)-Once for regular viewer, 2 (or even 3) times for a fan.(2)- Seeing once is more than enough.(1)- Impossible to even reach the end… Along the way they meet a few other characters with the same idea on mind as them, a prince who wishes to avenge himself for the demise of his kingdom and you can pretty much guess how it all turns out.

For a type of person like myself who is looking for something very specific in terms of good fantasy anime with a style unlike that of the hackneyed DND wannabes, with good character dynamics and excellent design, this series is a must.The story, while not exactly unique in it's themes (the search for the handwavy 'ultimate power' that possibly doesn't exist but possibly does.) is excecuted well, and the short series manages to get you invested even in it's fleeting duration, mainly due to...the fact the characters are both interesting and likeable.The setting itself is also compelling, with great ruins spanning huge portions of the mostly wild landscape. Deserts and grasslands, jungles and oceans, this setting has it all, and all of it s beautifully drawn. the fact the characters are both interesting and likeable.The setting itself is also compelling, with great ruins spanning huge portions of the mostly wild landscape. Deserts and grasslands, jungles and oceans, this setting has it all, and all of it s beautifully drawn."", ""Listen to me. The fact an anime like this can exist in total obscurity is proof that there are priceless treasures lying in wait for anyone who dares to go looking. The overwhelming catalogue of anime is like a vast and teeming ocean, and as new seasons add yet more to this unfathomable magnitude, some treasures are bound to go unnoticed, and perhaps be lost forever. Ruin Explorers Fam & Ihrlie is one such treasure. Indeed, with a clumsy name and under 9,000 members on MAL, chances are that I probably would have never known of its existence, were it not for finding it on...an interest stack. It was short and seemed like fun, so I filed it away for when I had some time to kill. Then, from the very moment the intro ended, I was met with nothing short of a masterpiece. Over the course of these 4 episodes, I would be taken along for an epic journey that would give me chills. With every flawless scene, with every perfect note, I scoured for mistakes and waited for it to slip, but my prying efforts were met with quality upon quality upon quality. It left me speechless. It is imperative that I impress upon whoever reads this review the sheer excellence that awaits them. Beginning with the story, we are presented with a classic kind of tale, filled with magic and monsters and a lost kingdom, but it is what it does with this story that is so impressive. Namely, it manages to be both adventurously grand and shockingly efficient. It has an absolute command over its material, putting every minute to its proper use, cultivating a sense of potent immersion which doesn't let up for a second. When I finished it I was devastated to find the manga only has 2 volumes. Indeed, the only mark against this anime is that there isn't more of it. However, this legendary adventure would not be nearly as engrossing without my favorite aspect of this anime, the art.  Every visual aspect of this show is lovingly crafted and eminently engaging. The world is colorful and detailed and alive, the background characters are fully realized and animated in their own right, the main cast boasts striking and visionary character designs, and the animation is smooth as butter, bringing epic fight scenes to life, while breathing a kind of deep, abiding tranquility to scenes of peace. Everything has this sense of presence and scale, it feels like you could go on forever in one direction or the other and then keep going. To reiterate my point about scale, nothing is beyond the reach of this anime. The minute detailing on coinage, the rivets and straps in a suit of armor, the wear and tear on leather and stone, all the way up to colossal architecture, vast ranges of natural beauty, threatening skies and raging oceans, nothing is too big or too small for this art direction to handle, and envelop it all in this unified sense of style. There's even this dedication to choreography which grabs the viewer. When someone is fighting off a group of dungeon constructs, or when an evil wizard glories in his wickedness, or even when friends talk around a campfire, it feels different, almost like they're moving more like real people. Exceedingly few anime manage to look this good outside of major movie releases, and even when compared to them this is one of the best looking anime I have ever seen. The sound is another contributing factor to this masterpiece, standing on its own as this operatic, theatrical score. Similar to the art, it has this same sense of presence and scale, and nothing is beyond it. From the quiet serenade of a nighttime scene, a jaunty theme of a voyage by sea, the pitched strings of a life-or-death struggle, and finally to the triumphant brass of a trial overcome with a mind for the next one in store. This isn't just an OST, this is a score. Masterfully composed down to the final note, you will get chills. Everything else about the sound design steps up to the plate as well, with impassioned voice acting and fully realized sounds of life that make the world feel real and lived-in. Then, of course, there are the characters. On their own, they meet the standards of quality for their day, mostly embodying skillful executions of well-worn archetypes, like the tomboy, catgirl, and the blustering B-list thief duo, but they deviate from these archetypes without you noticing, until the next thing you know they've grown as people. In my opinion, what really vivifies them and makes them special is how the story handles them. It weaves the lives of its characters together with an artistry and authenticity which is rare to see not just in anime, but any medium. It handles their human natures so carefully and plays them off each other at the perfect times, ensuring maximum impact, and ultimately, maximum investment. Overall, Ruin Explorers Fam & Ihrlie is one of the most underrated anime I have ever encountered, and as far as I'm concerned, you owe it to yourself to watch this, and then to keep looking through the decades of anime history for others like it. an interest stack.

Heroes are on a quest to retrieve a set of magical items that a powerful villain is searching for as well. Beyond that are plot points that become disposed of quickly and by the end of the 2 hour run-time you\'re comfortable not knowing the ending to a few sub-plots. The narrative doesn\'t take itself very seriously with a plethora of jokes hackneyed throughout, and at the points it becomes somewhat serious it\'s still rather basic and doesn\'t try anything fancy. Straight forward, but not schlock. Thank goodness. All of this comes together to become a check-list of classic fantasy adventure...tropes that get checked off one by one. That\'s alright, since I wasn\'t really asking for much more after 2 episodes in. It satisfied me enough and I found it pretty enjoyable, even if one episode ends with the characters ship-wrecked and the next episode starts with them in the middle of a desert.Art:I really enjoy the 90\'s rough sketch look of this anime but with that comes some other lazy animation decisions. For instance, the action is non-existent. It became very evident that after the first episode I wouldn\'t be witnessing a shred of combat. I believe there are roughly 3 sequences of actual hack-and-slash while the rest are the heroes surrounding by creatures (a very limited bestiary, by the way) and then the next scene the creatures are defeated. Again, not to bothersome. None of it really questioned my intelligence or made me feel like I missed out on anything. Rather, it\'s like a check-list similar to the tropes that needed to be knocked off in the story.The setting is largely barren and uninspired. Deserts are easy to animated. Oceans are easy to animate. Destroyed locations are easy to animate because it\'s rubble. I would have appreciated some more, I don\'t know, \'definition\' to the setting, but that would require another episode to elaborate on some certain aspects, such as ""this swamp has X history and Y lore and so we must be careful."" And then it turns into filler. More of a story critique, but how the art is handled can affect the story.Sound:The Soundtrack was actually pretty good, but after 4 episodes it\'s repeat songs that lose their effect. Unfortunate, as the directive approach towards the music was pretty fantastical and had adventure at it\'s core. Very cool, but wears thin quick.Sound effects were forgettable and all stock stuff everyone has heard before. One creature repeated the same battle-cry over and over and it became less so intimidating and more-so irritating. I couldn\'t wait for it to die.Character:Sufficient.

"", 'Note: I watched this a few days prior to writing, so i may be a little hazy on a few details. And first review :DI heard about this anime a long while back and in a fit of boredom and curiosity, i decided to take a look. Unfortunately the 2 hours i spent watching this could have been used to watch something more interesting.The plot is fairly straight forward, the two main protagonists, Fam and Ihrie, are two female treasure hunters or ""Ruin Explorers"", on the quest to find the Ultimate PowerOne of the main problems i had with this series is it\'s short length....At only 4 episodes (each around 30 minutes, so around 2 hours in total), i feel that the story could have been much more interesting and memorable if they had more time to flesh out the characters and show us some more scenes of actual ruin exploring, which is surprisingly lacking in the second half of the series. It also doesn\'t help that the story is incredibly generic, the art style is nothing to write home about either. Just typical mid 90s anime style that is similar to Slayers.The supporting cast is rather forgettable, and i found the antagonist to be very generic. The final battle is pretty forgettable and the ending is very bland.The music, is unfortunately no different. The J-Pop intro didn\'t leave an impression on me at all and the rest of the soundtrack is...like i have been saying a lot in this review, generic and forgettable.But one thing i can say is that Ihrie and Fam are fairly likeable protagonists that actually have weaknesses, something which i appreciate immensely and we should have seen more of them doing actual ruin exploring.Overall, rather forgettable. But i can see some people possibly enjoying this more than i did. Fans of 90s anime and fantasy might get a kick out of this.

I watched all 41eps and was thinking if there was a Season 2 which led me to MAL? Anyway, I like quite a few Chinese anime especially Soul Land, Wonderland, and many more.

I wasn't expecting to like this series since I don't usually watch or read donghua stories but this very satisfying to watch & thrilling right until the end. 谢谢.The story aimed to deliver messages about society & the perspective of the world, as well as the illusions we draw for ourselves regarding materialistic desires.

It\'s set in a modern or near future setting, and focuses on many psychological and societal issues that are now part of our lives because of what our world has become. The plot revolves around a low self-esteem, ""ugly"" young women who is bullied and judge because of her looks. She is depressed, in a self-destructive relationship and even turns to self harm as a way of coping. Eventually she overhears of some truths she has been intentionally convincing herself is not true, and so turns to plastic surgery to try to start life anew. Unfortunately, there is...no reset button or new game option, as the past can never truly be washed away. Through this experience she grows as a person, finds that she is not as alone as she thought, and finally embraces both her past, mistakes and takes a step forward without being controlled by the opinion of others.This donghua was very enjoyable. It really targets many issues that stem from modern technology, modern society (like social media), bullying, and depression. It even touches on corruption and manipulation of public opinion by the powerful (or rich). This show is a great critique of our current modern society and what is wrong with it.The show itself presents a good message for us: we should know the sanctity of life, and no matter how hard it is, we can work past it and grow as a person. (Also, we should not be overly conscious of others\' opinions). no reset button or new game option, as the past can never truly be washed away.

I was left after the end with that clammy empty feeling when all emotions are completely wrung out. This is criminally underrated at 6.72 at this time. I can only imagine it is due to a strong bias against donghua and against 3D CGI, and against adult drama in favor of pretty fight scenes. (The stats show a very anormal distribution. This is probably due to dishonest voting.) The visuals here are not the strong point, but I think people rate visuals too...highly. The screenplay, story and direction is pretty much flawless.The story remains tense and nail-biting over the entire series. Nearly every episode feels like a cliff-hanger, and the unease never really goes away even during the most peaceful or romantic parts. It doesn\'t feel cheap, because the direction is such that the tone is very consistent and there is a lot of foreshadowing. It is incredibly well-paced, always on edge. Though the episodes are short, there is enough development of characters and plot-lines that it does not feel rushed.I love the character development on both the MC Han Yuxi and the doctor Ling Huantao. Han is at times timid and at times resolute, and it makes her feel like a full human, and makes her even more brave (bravery isn\'t the absence of fear, but when you are afraid and determined anyway). She grows as she faces challenges and through introspection. Doctor Ling is a complex character who can\'t be reduced into a hero or a villain.The donghua is chock full of social commentary, without compromising the hero\'s story. Some parts are obvious as given in a speech by the MC, but some is up to the viewer\'s interpretation. Is Han living a lie by changing herself, or she asserting control of her own life? It\'s important to have a good view of yourself and not only look at what others see you as. But that doesn\'t mean you can completely ignore what others think.The animation is not bad, but does detract from the overall quality of the work. Unfortunately, the 3D models aren\'t able to convey the same level of emotion through their movements as live-action. I\'m not quite sure why they didn\'t make this a live-action, as it does feel more appropriate for this kind of work. Maybe filling a cast with similar looking beauties would have been hard. I think that the semi-realistic 3D style used here is definitely a better match for this story than some 2D bishoujo style, because the 3D style gives it a certain verisimilitude which makes the story feel more real and scary rather than fantastical. Some of the shading looks too plastic, and some of the backgrounds look too simple, which detracts a little. It doesn\'t look as good as something like Yuan Long. But it\'s leagues better than Berserk.The soundtrack is amazing. The OP and ED play pieces of the same song, which is both extremely unnerving and exhilarating, and it is blended into the episode seamlessly such that the emotional effect of the story combines with the powerful song. A portion of the song will play during the episode. The story-boarding must have been very clever to reach that compatibility. Several other songs play, like a beautiful insert song ""Love You"", the soulful ""茧"", the powerful ""來者是我"". They stand alone well but also fit the theme of the story.

Was it worth it? No, but not because of this show, but rather because most of those films were quite crappy.Besides a somewhat similar premise though, Huang Yan goes in a completely different direction, as it starts with the main character having several surgeries done to her because of all...the shit she was receiving for being ugly, and the surgeon that did them becoming obsessed with her because he can remake her as his wife that’s in a coma.So, out of all the previous movies about the topic, La piel que habito is the one that has the most similar setup.But that’s only the premise, as the series moves forward, it focuses mainly on the main character, as she becomes something of a voice against discrimination on the most watched television show of the moment, which is about women appearing in public after their surgeries are done.I have to somewhat criticize the delivery of the message though, as what she says is contradicted by what she did, but at least it didn’t lead to a change of her personality, and the main character isn’t afraid to voice her opinion and confront people, and yet keeps finding trouble here and there.Besides that, it’s interesting to see how the main character is treated despite her new appearance, and she learning that her change on the outside doesn’t mean that she’s going to become happier just because, and a lot of the series focuses on the mentality of the protagonist realizing and coming to terms with that, with a very good scene near the end where the “two of her” talk to each other.This particular element leads to explore the themes of television industry and social media and how rumours about someone could be fabricated and believed by many people, possibly ruining their lives, and although nothing as extreme happens to the protagonist, it’s interesting to see the hardships she faces and how all of it helps in fleshing her out and completing her character arc.The pacing is very good, the episodes are between ten and fifteen minutes long and yet the show uses its short runtime effectively by constantly moving the plot forward and exploring its themes and fleshing out the main character. Unfortunately, it also means that some of them are inferior than the others because events and characters’ apparitions together in one same place don’t happen very organically.Something that it’s criticized about this show it’s the way it presents its messages and themes, and although I can see that, I won’t criticize the writing on that regard that much, since every bit of information is presented through flashbacks, dialogues, internal monologues and people talking on television, sending a message, doing exactly what they intended to do, so overall I find the script being excused for the way it explores its themes, and I don’t find the exposition awkward despite the handling of them being a bit in your face.What I am going to criticize the writing for, is the way that things play out, as the starting points or resolutions of the conflicts always have to do with someone having a hidden camera or microphone to fabric something about the protagonist or expose someone when they are lying, which feels samey and repetitive, on top of the series not properly showing up the setup of those scenarios.Besides that, there is also another problem regarding the other characters of the show, which is them essentially existing only as extensions of the main character or the themes. Although the plastic surgeon is somewhat explored to show why and how he came to be the way he is, not enough focus is given to him, he doesn’t really develop nor has a cathartic resolution. There is also the other ex-boyfriend of the protagonist, who is easily the worst aspect of the series because of how little and rushed immersion he is given and for how cartoonilishly evil he is presented. It’s a bigger problem because the plot had the chance of getting rid of him at a certain point, but kept getting him back just to antagonize the lead girl.The same thing can be said about all the secondary cast, they don’t have an agenda and exist only as antagonists or support, effectively being a representation of the themes and messages and plot devices, but nothing beyond that, and they can all be summarized with one quick description.Now, there are anime that focus mostly on their protagonists which I rated very highly, most of them among my favourites, which had the same issue, and sometimes I did bring the rating down because of that, or in the cases I didn’t, it was because the focus on their main characters was even better than here, and because the theme explorations and overall plots were far more complicated and meaningful as a whole.The final issue is the resolution, which although solid and overall good for the main character and her arc, and also not idealistic to the point of resolving everything happily just because, it didn’t give a good enough closure to the other plot points, leaving them in a rather ambiguous situation, what happened with the ex, exactly? What about the plastic surgeon and his mother? What about his wife in a vegetative state? The show gives you an idea of what could happen regarding them, but not something that feels really concrete and complete.As far as presentation goes, I’m giving a little bit of an extra point to the visuals, despite having the same plastic and fake looking look and limited motions and inexpressive facial expressions that lots of CGI donghua have. The reason why I’m willing to do that it’s because at the end of the day it does serve a narrative purpose, since the visuals end up representing clearly the lie of the title and the superficial views of the public within the show, as the script intended to do. The backgrounds are good for the most part, but don’t stand out much because the perspective is usually focused on the faces of the characters. There are also some visual metaphors to portray the emotions and visualize the inner monologues of the characters, so the directing is pretty good in that regard, it’s just that the quality of the CGI held those moments back from being as good as the team behind the series clearly intended them to be.The atmosphere is good for the most part, not because of the voice acting, which is appropriate but nothing beyond that, and not because of the sound effects, which are fairly simple and weak for a 2022 production, but because of the soundtrack, which is effective in sounding either sad or sinister, even for the opening and ending songs, something that reminded me of the only good aspects that Aiyou de Mishi had.Despite its issues and it not being as good as I expected it to be, I found Huang Yan to be a pretty good and rather unique and memorable show within the medium of, well, let’s not say anime, but Asian animation as a whole. Compared to the live action movies with similar premises I watched, it’s better than most of them, even the one that started it all, so I consider it a worthy one time watch, despite how unknown it is and how little rewatch value it has.Kinda similar stuff-Les Yeux sans visage (1960 French movie that started the surgeon drama/thriller premise, very basic in plot and writing but for its time solid in atmosphere, visuals and drama).-La piel que habito (2011 Spanish movie and the most solid plastic surgeon drama/thriller out of the live action ones, the plot is basic but overall good for how twisted and interconnected the characters are, and the resolution is pretty great).-Beauty Water (Aeni movie about a main girl bullied for being ugly that changes her whole body with a, well, beauty water, and she also kinda starts a relationship with someone after that, it takes a completely different direction beyond that point, but it’s the only somewhat similar thing to this donghua in Asian animation that I know of). the shit she was receiving for being ugly, and the surgeon that did them becoming obsessed with her because he can remake her as his wife that’s in a coma.So, out of all the previous movies about the topic, La piel que habito is the one that has the most similar setup.But that’s only the premise, as the series moves forward, it focuses mainly on the main character, as she becomes something of a voice against discrimination on the most watched television show of the moment, which is about women appearing in public after their surgeries are done.I have to somewhat criticize the delivery of the message though, as what she says is contradicted by what she did, but at least it didn’t lead to a change of her personality, and the main character isn’t afraid to voice her opinion and confront people, and yet keeps finding trouble here and there.Besides that, it’s interesting to see how the main character is treated despite her new appearance, and she learning that her change on the outside doesn’t mean that she’s going to become happier just because, and a lot of the series focuses on the mentality of the protagonist realizing and coming to terms with that, with a very good scene near the end where the “two of her” talk to each other.This particular element leads to explore the themes of television industry and social media and how rumours about someone could be fabricated and believed by many people, possibly ruining their lives, and although nothing as extreme happens to the protagonist, it’s interesting to see the hardships she faces and how all of it helps in fleshing her out and completing her character arc.The pacing is very good, the episodes are between ten and fifteen minutes long and yet the show uses its short runtime effectively by constantly moving the plot forward and exploring its themes and fleshing out the main character.

Inaka Isha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3326/Inaka_Isha,"['Making sense of Kafka`s work is difficult enough in its original form as prose, but trying to throw a theatrical spin on something as introspective as Country Doctor makes it even more confusing. The story starts with a distraught country doctor who`s horse has died the night before. His maid runs around town trying to borrow a horse so that the doctor might make his urgent appointment, but no one is willing. In frustration, the doctor kicks the door on his pigsty, and he finds a groom inside, and two horses as well. The groom prepares the horses but the doctor realizes he is after...the maid, Rosa. Before the doctor can do anything, the groom sends the horses off, which basically teleports the doctor to the patient`s house, though it is supposed to be 10 miles away. This is but the beginning of the surreal ordeal that the doctor will endure.In the written story, there is a progression of the surreal. It moves from being a rather normal predicament to something vaguely inexplicable, to complete nonsense draped in metaphors and symbolism. The animation though, is trippy from the start. Strange camera angles are used, and bodies are not only out of proportion, but in constantly shifting proportions. It`s not exactly how I would have imagined Country Doctor in my head, but it provides a buffer of sorts that makes some of the more surreal events and images more tolerable, less out of place, in the already surreal looking world. The animation also sticks very close to the text, making sure to visually capture all the little described details. In the longer bits of narration, it adds some unmentioned, original imagery.In an attempt to create the same effect as the first person perspective of the story that enlightens readers on all of the doctor`s thoughts, two black, mini versions of the doctor are used to narrate. The coldness of this narration, along with a general inability of the characters to express emotions makes this film more confusing than the story, which is already painfully confusing. In the story, it explicitly states that the doctor kicks the door to his pigsty in frustration. In the animation, he just slowly walks up to the door and kicks for no apparent reason, almost as if looking inside was his intention. Similarly, lines of narration are rendered meaningless because the cynicism and bitterness of the doctor is replaced with a completely matter of fact tone.The sounds and animation bring to the foreground a haunting atmosphere that is very subtle in the original story, and I appreciate this. A discordant clang of triangles is one piece of music the film used. Though it can hardly be called music, it is certainly creepy. Even when there`s no music, the howling winds, and the creaking of the house just gives a feeling of unease.In the original story, with all the inexplicable insanity that occurs, the one grounding, sensible piece is the doctor himself; the piece that gives you hope of making sense of everything through the confounding events. As ambiguous as his character is in this film, even reading an interpretive analysis of the story will only provide a detached and unsatisfying understanding. It will be little more than animated gibberish without reading the short story first, but the eeriness that pervades the film does make it an interesting representation for those that have. the maid, Rosa.

The coldness of this narration, along with a general inability of the characters to express emotions makes this film more confusing than the story, which is already painfully confusing. In the story, it explicitly states that the doctor kicks the door to his pigsty in frustration. In the animation, he just slowly walks up to the door and kicks for no apparent reason, almost as if looking inside was his intention. Similarly, lines of narration are rendered meaningless because the cynicism and bitterness of the doctor is replaced with a completely matter of fact tone.The sounds and animation bring to the foreground a haunting atmosphere that is very subtle in the original story, and I appreciate this. A discordant clang of triangles is one piece of music the film used. Though it can hardly be called music, it is certainly creepy. Even when there`s no music, the howling winds, and the creaking of the house just gives a feeling of unease.In the original story, with all the inexplicable insanity that occurs, the one grounding, sensible piece is the doctor himself; the piece that gives you hope of making sense of everything through the confounding events. As ambiguous as his character is in this film, even reading an interpretive analysis of the story will only provide a detached and unsatisfying understanding. It will be little more than animated gibberish without reading the short story first, but the eeriness that pervades the film does make it an interesting representation for those that have.', 'From the beginning of its great opening sequence, Inaka Isha catches its audience with a raw humanity right from ""Go"". This harrowing narrative acquaints us with an experience similar to Teshigahara Hiroshi\'s \' Suna no onna (Woman in the Dunes) or the opening scene of Alain Renais\' Hiroshima, Mon Amour : we see beautiful animation in the way the snow envelopes the screen and in the sketchiness of the lines, making this seem more like a painting than an anime.Also, pay attention to the wonderful shadow work in the left most corner of the screen, reminiscent of early silhouette work of Lotte Reiniger (also seen...in the chorus of Revolutionary Girl Utena ).As we are introduced to the character of the Doctor, by way of his two smaller, darker shelves who serve the film as narrators, he looks as if he were a force of nature - a tornado - or perhaps made of smoke rather than a human of flesh and blood. With wild eyes and a distperportion of size, we become engrossed in his woe of a faraway patient and stranded with no a horse or means to reach him. We are flooded with questions the longer this work progresses: How will he get there? What will happen to Rosa in the meanwhile? What\'s really going on here? Well, it\'s Kafka, so just look deeper and the answer *might* be there.However, it\'s the movement and shadows that are the real protagonists here and their job is done masterfully. From the shadow work I mentioned earlier to the wonderful transistions made from human to landscape, darkness to possibility and therefore, light.Movement is used in several skillful, clever ways in this anime, the first being to set and change the pace and perspective as needed. What\'s interesting here is that there wasn\'t one set pace that the director decided on, it changes from somewhat slow to incredibly fast rather quickly, as though you and the doctor can\'t quite keep up with what is happening in the events and surroundings. Which leads me to the second method of using movement in the anime, which is to convey the various feelings the characters are dealing with, from panic or sorrow to feeling stretched too thin -- literally. We are seeing these character\'s emotions (even those of the movement itself in certain scenes) from the perspective of their emotions rather than from the point of view of the characters themselves and the effect is nothing short of chilling.Speaking of chilling, the music brilliantly created by Hitomi Shimizu (found also in Yamamura Koji\'s other work Atama Yama) fits this animation perfectly, setting an eerie mood almost immediately. As an audience we have no doubt how stark and bleak the path that lies ahead for  Ein Landarzt is, because this spectral music is leading the way through the darkness, horseless and blind, while the cold and snow obstruct our path. It actually reminds me of an old production of Faerie Tale Theatre\'s The Nightingale, however it carries a much heavier role in this short film than the uplifting song of the latter.For the part of the ""Country Doctor,"" director Yamamura Kōji chose accredited Kyōgen star and national treasure, Sensaku Shigeyama, a true story teller if there ever was one. Something very powerful was happening on the screen as I watched this man with so much finesse; the music, Sensaku Shigeyama\'s performance and even the unadorned, severeness of the setting all gave the suggestion of early Noh performances which I stood watching, mouth agape.Although I found myself re-watching this 3 or 4 times, I would say this is not an anime for the typical viewer but one who loves the obscure -- anime as an art form. While the presentation is stunning, the anime itself is as stark as the music that leads us and the story in true Germanic-Slavic form is both fascinating and bleak. Kafka himself was Austrian-Hungarian born to German-speaking Jewish parents, so all that struggle really comes through here as is typical with Kafka\'s other works. And while I gave this animation a 10, the average seems to be a 7 by other audiences and I suspect most will feel this way, despite the talent that resides here. Inaka Isha is teeming with it if one only seeks it out. in the chorus of Revolutionary Girl Utena ).As we are introduced to the character of the Doctor, by way of his two smaller, darker shelves who serve the film as narrators, he looks as if he were a force of nature - a tornado - or perhaps made of smoke rather than a human of flesh and blood.

(&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; is available in graphic novel format) But I'm surprised that it's this story, of which I've never heard, was the one.The story in &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; was hard to follow. Perhaps I'd understand it better if I read the story on which it's based. A lot of it is probably supposed to be metaphors for stuff. Like when one character suddenly bit another character; that's probably a metaphor for humans' cruel nature...or some such thing.The art may seem really odd for an anime. Characters are depicted with body parts growing larger, and instead of walking, swinging across the screen weirdly. (It's hard to describe this in words... you'll understand it when you see it.) For this kind of &quot;psychological&quot; anime, it seems an appropriate style of art. It probably also represents the inconsistent ways in which reality is perceived.The sound is outstanding! Just, no other comment than that.Since it's only a twenty-minute film, the characters don't have much time to develop. Worth noting is that when the main character, the doctor, is thinking, two black, childlike figures appear behind him and speak the inner dialogue. It's a strange effect which probably represents the duality of something or other.I enjoyed this a fair bit, just to watch and see what the hell happened next, and seeing if I could find any hidden meanings in it.Overall, though, it has a pretty weak story. I recommend watching this if you're bored, if you're a Kafka fan, or if you're taking a class in philosophy, psychology, cinematography, or one of those classes where you have to find the hidden meaning in shit. or some such thing.The art may seem really odd for an anime.

Not easily deterred, the Doctor (seriously, who?) rubbed his wrinkly shlong all over an unsuspecting horse, in what can only be described as a bizarre case of sexual assault.Franz Kafka, an Austrian-Hungarian writer, wrote A Country Doctor in 1917, during a period where he suffered from stress, migraines, depression, insomnia — SOCIALIST INFLUENCES — and anxiety....This explains why the main character, the Doctor, exhibited a psychosis of sorts, and seemed unable to rationalize in any coherent manner.  The 2007 reinterpretation of A Country Doctor (by Koji Yamamura), accentuated the Doctor’s psychosis by distorting the viewer’s perception of what is truly happening on the screen; hence, the stretching of characters beyond reasonable limits, the unwholesome aesthetic, and the peculiar symbolism.  In essence, Koji Yamamura attempted to engage the viewer by having him/her share in the Doctor’s twisted experience.This is all well and good, mind you, but it doesn’t change the fact that A Country Doctor is severely lacking from a narrative and character perspective.  Yes, the Doctor’s delusions are beautifully portrayed through the “crude” artwork, but it’s not entirely understood why the Doctor suffers from these ailments (besides Kafka superimposing his own mental illness on Doctor).  This lack of detail prevents the viewer from creating a meaningful connection with the Doctor — making his absurdities, seem exceptionally nonsensical.

The story begins with the audience being introduced to the doctor along with his assistant Rosa, who are both hurriedly searching for a horse, having received word of a sick patient in the village. Out of frustration, the doctor kicks open the doors to an abandoned pig barn attached to his home. From the barn emerges a man with two horses who offers his services, to which Rosa remarks ""One doesn\'t know the sorts of things one has stored...in one\'s own house"". A Freudian analysis of this encounter would suggest that the man to whom we are introduced is in fact the doctor\'s id. The doctor has sublimated his id via his work and consequently it has remained repressed until now. This mysterious figure then promptly attacks Rosa by biting her before sending the doctor along with the horses off to the patient\'s house. This interaction marks the beginning of conflcit between the id and superego of the doctor, an issue which will plague him.This whole opening scene is complimented by a powerful use of perspective. The constant shifting of perspectives reinforces the uncanniness of the situation. Moreover, the perspectives express the emotions of the characters who are otherwise bleak in their countenance, instilling a sense of anxiety and stress.Upon meeting the patient, the doctor begins a descent into madness. Torn by conflict between his superego and id, he is unable to concentrate on the patient at hand, instead looking to return to Rosa. Eager to leave, the doctor states that the child is not in fact sick, although the family is unhappy with the diagnosis. The perspective then warps around from the doctor to the family and we are now presented with the daughter who is brandishing a cloth bathed in blood. This is no doubt symbolic of the corruption of Rosa\'s pureness and virginity, who is now at the mercy of the id.From this point, the film descends into complete surrealism. The changes in perspective and movement becomes much more quick and radical. The presence of the family becomes completely overwhelming as it becomes clear that the health of the boy has declined. Dialogue between the doctor and the patient becomes increasingly strange and draped in metaphors. Combined with a fantastic score, the dialogue and cinematography create an increasingly stressful situation, climaxing with the doctor fleeing the house. The journey back home seemingly drags on though, unlike the trip there, which is where we are left.For an incredibly surreal short story rich in symbolism, Yamamura Koji\'s anime adaptation of Kafka\'s A Country Doctor does suprisingly well. The unique art style, combined with eccentric movement and perspective, helps to add to the almost dream-like feel.

''A rural doctor'' is incredible for some clear reasons: first, the story carries the typical Kafkaesque impotence, in which nothing can be done '' Only a doctor, only a doctor''. Nevertheless, this permeates the author's entire work, so the need to justify it for another reason: its explicit synthesis of the Kafkaesque universe, making dialogue with other of the narratives present in the same collection, because there is, at the same time, the theme of the visit, of isolation, and especially of the journey that never comes to an end....The category of the grotesque implies the creation of fantastic universes, the bizarre, and other strange ways of representing reality. In this sense, the artistic choice of the work ''Inaka Isha'' follows a style that, similar to Kafka's work, evokes an atmosphere of nightmare and absurdity. Of course, even though this anime is not a bad representation, it fails to take away everything the work has to offer. For those who have never read Kafka's book, it will be very difficult to understand any kind of implied meaning. Don't get me wrong, it goes without saying that Kafka's works are not at all easy to interpret. However, when passed to anime, it became even more confusing.

Though no footage of this screening has surfaced online.At the end of december the same year, UFOtable announced that a DVD of this OVA would be sold in stores. Though there is no evidence that this DVD was ever released, and no digital rips of the OVA have surfaced online. This may have been due to ZUN\'s strict policy on commercial Touhou content causing legality issues.Credit to this video by Anime Top Scholar for compiling this information""So, really. I don\'t know how this anime got onto MAL in the first place. But when I was still new to Touhou, like many others, and those who use MyAnimeList, will be confused that this anime is here in the database first place.=====Regarding the anime and my own opinion on this, I don\'t remember much and I have no idea how I even managed to watch even a small part of this anime because I can\'t find it anywhere currently.I probably watched this on a piracy website back in 03/18/2017 as cataloged on my On-Hold list.All I can say is that the audio, animation, art, music, are great. It\'s by UFOtable after all.As for the story, they\'re just adapting it so it\'s already based off an already-told story. There\'s nothing much to say other than praising ZUN, the creator himself.You can watch the trailer or some of the partially found footages on lostmediawiki, an article on this matter. But other than that, there\'s nothing else we can do.The legality kind of puts a lot of Touhou content out there into question, but it really is just a confusing part on Japan\'s copyright laws. Like the difference between an Indie & Doujin work. It\'s confusing to those who know nothing about copyright laws.Heck, even if you do, Japan\'s obsolete copyright laws make it more complicated than it already is. final product would be released at Anime ""Ichigo Shiba Shoujo Matsuri"" event (I most likely heard it wrong) on November 20 of the same year.Despite being credited in the trailer, ZUN confirmed on twitter that he had no involvement with the project.As promised, the OVA was shown at a private screening on November 20th. Though no footage of this screening has surfaced online.At the end of december the same year, UFOtable announced that a DVD of this OVA would be sold in stores. Though there is no evidence that this DVD was ever released, and no digital rips of the OVA have surfaced online. This may have been due to ZUN\'s strict policy on commercial Touhou content causing legality issues.Credit to this video by Anime Top Scholar for compiling this information""So, really. I don\'t know how this anime got onto MAL in the first place. But when I was still new to Touhou, like many others, and those who use MyAnimeList, will be confused that this anime is here in the database first place.=====Regarding the anime and my own opinion on this, I don\'t remember much and I have no idea how I even managed to watch even a small part of this anime because I can\'t find it anywhere currently.I probably watched this on a piracy website back in 03/18/2017 as cataloged on my On-Hold list.All I can say is that the audio, animation, art, music, are great. It\'s by UFOtable after all.As for the story, they\'re just adapting it so it\'s already based off an already-told story. There\'s nothing much to say other than praising ZUN, the creator himself.You can watch the trailer or some of the partially found footages on lostmediawiki, an article on this matter. But other than that, there\'s nothing else we can do.The legality kind of puts a lot of Touhou content out there into question, but it really is just a confusing part on Japan\'s copyright laws.

Changye Kaita Zhe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50446/Changye_Kaita_Zhe,"['This will be a two part review, evaluating the work as an original story and as an adaptation.The general plot of Changye Kaita Zhe (Blade of Dawn, original WN chinese name is LiMing ZhiJian which directly translates to Blade/Sword of Dawn) is: a relatively well-educated man from Earth, after death, is isekai\'d into the AI of some observation satellite over an unknown planet. There he observes this unknown planet for hundreds of thousands of years before damage to the satellite activates a preservation program that beams the MC\'s now AI consciousness into the  body of Ga-wen, an ancient pioneer that died 700 years ago....Once in this new body, he accesses the memories of to learn the general situation of the world and realizes a disaster much like the one that happened 700 years ago may soon happen again, prompting him to start to quickly rebuild his fief with his (original body\'s) descendants. Since the kingdom is still in the medieval and feudal era, he applies philosophies from Earth to release them from those shackles and start an ""industrial revolution"".Now onto the review: The premise of the story itself shows alot of  promise, it has fantasy, magical elements and has kingdom building elements. The general animations and art style are quite good, though the action/fight scenes could really use some work (they are too stiff). It\'s quite a decent watch. However, when looking into the plot development and world building aspect, it leaves alot to be desired. There are simply too many plot convenient things that happen, and much of the world building is lacking, especially if you don\'t understand much D&D (it seems it has many D&D elements though I don\'t really know much about D&D). His first time traveling to the shadow realm prompted a ""goddess meeting and status window"" and got him a book that somehow informed him of the king\'s assassination of his brother, like what? Was that really necessary? The plot is also a bit too disjointed, and not much explanation of how the developments went from a to b; there seem to be some measure of time-skip that lead to certain developments that don\'t quite get discussed. (More in the adaptation comparison section). These problems with the plot progression, plot convenient events, time-skips and lack of world-building, can really confuse those who are new viewers. Despite these problems, this donghua is still a decent watch.Now as an adaptation:There are many problems and changes I find quite disagreeable. If I were to describe the general changes to the plot from the novel, then there would be two main points. First, this donghua adaptation changed the serious, world and kingdom building type novel into a more childish comedy fantasy story (with a touch of romance [like between Heidi and the old knight]). Second, when it comes to the plot, it felt like they took a giant ax to the world-building and plot, then strung together major plot points from the novel and made some things up to fill in the gaps.The first major change was the whole meeting the ""goddess"" in the whole shadow realm and the status/save&load screen. That was really unnecessary. There were no game-like moments in the novel, and from there he obtained a kind of cheat book that allows the MC to find out about some assassination attempt that he used to threaten the king to return his pioneer/colonizing rights. In the novel, the MC skillfully used rumors and politics to manipulate and pressure the kingdom to recognize him and return his right to pioneer.The book that allowed him to simulated/view the past and had the Magic Net formula was originally found in the Shadow Realm, and had a back story of why/how it was created. The novel used this to introduce the concept of the Shadow Realm and display the differences between how the kingdom\'s nobility viewed magic and what magic could potentially do; essentially, a low ranking magician was desperate to save his daughter and used the power of math/precise calculations to supplement his low talent as opposed to brute force that the traditional magicians view as important.The donghua also cuts out tons of kingdom building and tech advancement. In regard to the kingdom building, they cut almost all the slow reforms the MC used to increase productivity and reform the feudal order, but slowly enough to lead the serfs to our modern concept of ""freedom"" rather than just drop it on them and cause a culture shock. When it comes to tech development, all of the research and development and the trial and error as MC tried to translate Earth\'s technology to this planet\'s tech were all left out. Instead, what we got was new tech randomly dropping in with little explanation on how it was created.Now comes the problem with the contrived plot: 700 year old humans (like the old knight) and the evil organization he was connected to. Humans shouldn\'t live that long, this change really makes the reappearance of the MC less meaningful (at least among humans). They also worked in some ancient feud between the knight and the evil organization instead of having the paths of the two groups accidentally intersect (evil group was worried about MC and monitoring him but did not want to get into conflict yet). This battle between them also ended up pulling in religion/the saint which didn\'t happen in the novel, these should have been completely separated events.The dream world arc was actually not bad and I don\'t have much complains about that.Finally, the ""final battle"" and the guns/cannon should not have made their way into the story yet. While I do agree it was cool, the MC was trying to keep a low profile while developing his power, so he would not have invited anyone to watch his battle. This battle should have depleted the MC\'s salvaged magic armor and weapons and then the guns would have been invented/deployed after this first defensive battle.Overall, the adaptation was not very good; as I had previously said, it felt like they took an ax to the plot and strung together major plot points with some childish ideas to fill in the gaps left behind.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 4/10 Once in this new body, he accesses the memories of to learn the general situation of the world and realizes a disaster much like the one that happened 700 years ago may soon happen again, prompting him to start to quickly rebuild his fief with his (original body\'s) descendants.

The title advertises a show in which our main character, Duke Galway, founds and expands his realm. But this is better described as the best tabletop RPG anime ever made. The whole story feels like it was lifted out of a good D&D-like campaign, with some political power grabbing, some creative abuse of the magic system, some combat, and no murderhoboing.We follow a party, led by a Warrior, usually accompanied by his trusty Rogue companion and a rotating cast consisting of two Wizards, a Paladin, Druid and more, depending on who could show up...for D&D night. The group is trying to make a place for themselves in the world, and are often confronted by a political plot or malicious villain who they have to figure out and confront. Even as the party acquires a settlement and underlings, they still prefer to solve most problems personally, because this is after all a D&D campaign. The Dungeon Master is benevolent but prefers to keep the story rooted in politics and mystery solving, so the party members are never given overwhelming personal power and always struggle a bit in direct combat. The story can at times be slow to advance and it can even feel episodic.The production quality is good. The 3D animation in particular is very detailed and far above what I\'ve come to expect from Chinese 3D showings. for D&D night.

If we imagined that a game with fantasy, colony sim, rpg and open world tags was adapted to anime on the basis of a power struggle with dnd-like politics and the player was turned into the lead character in this anime, we would be pointing to this anime. A viewer who likes the aforementioned game tags will not regret giving this anime a chance. However, it should be noted that it is not a very high quality production, and it is possible...to see a very fast narrative in terms of story flow and fast progression that cannot normally be achieved in short periods of time.Although we can overlook this negative aspect to some extent since the anime is set in a fantasy universe, it will be quite possible to say that some of the characters fail both in terms of dialog depth and uniqueness, especially the ""evil"" character, a character who has no depth, whose goals and reasons we do not know, and who seems to do evil just to do evil. It could be argued that the motives and ideological justifications of such a character could have been left to the audience, but the fact that the script as a whole lacks such depth makes us conclude that this idea can only lead to good. Until the final scene of the series, because in the very last scene we learn the purpose of our first villain. This is a minus for those who can\'t wait until the finale and like to understand the series as they the plot progress.There is also a Kant sequence that follows, which I felt like I was watching a DnD adventure in my bones, and this sequence is much better rendered, backgrounded and conveyed to the audience to some extent than our first ""bad"" character. The characters that are not rendered deeply and the dialogues that lack emotion, as they are members of both the ""good"" and the ""bad"" sides as a whole, lose the effect of the fiction written in a black and white opposition, thus negatively affecting the progression of the story as a whole.

Chiisana Viking Vickie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2836/Chiisana_Viking_Vickie,"[""Chiisana Viking Vickie is a children's series from the 70s. It follows the adventures of a group of vikings, each of which with their own quirks. The main character Vickie is the son of the viking chief, Halvar, and is considered a weakling and a coward by most people in the village. However, he's very clever and usually ends up saving the others with his quick thinking.PLOTThere's no red thread from the beginning to the end. In about half of the episodes, the vikings are on their way to pillage some far-away land and take away everything worthwhile. Or, rather, this is their intention....Since this is a kids' series, it can't really show the protagonists being evil, violent thieves. As such, the vikings' raids usually get resolved in one of two ways: 1) when they arrive, someone else is already there causing trouble, so the vikings defeat this bigger villain and get a bunch of rewards from the grateful locals, removing the need to steal anything, or 2) the local king or chief is such a massive jerk that by the time the episode ends, the vikings are perfectly justified in taking something for all their trouble.The other half of the episodes take place in the vikings' home village, Flake, and shows them dealing with domestic life, such as working in their vegetable fields or going to the market. It's a running gag that trouble often brews between the vikings and their nagging wives, with the wives usually winning whatever argument there is.CHARACTERSThere's no particular character development for anyone in the series, but all the main characters have clearly defined personalities that stay consistent through the series. Even though the characters aren't very deep, you grow to care about them if you watch enough episodes because they're all funny and endearing in their own ways. All the characters get their moments to shine and in some cases even entire episodes dedicated to them. For me, the highlight of the series was the duo of Snorre and Tjure who're always bickering but are actually good friends.The only annoying inconsistency I spotted was that there was an entire episode dedicated to finding a wife for Faxe, the dumb giant of the group, but his bride was never shown again after that episode. In fact, in a much later episode we see that Faxe is unmarried and in love with a totally different woman.Vickie, who is the main character, stands out amongst the vikings by being far more intelligent than the others. Whenever there is trouble, he gets a brilliant idea that solves all their problems. Sometimes the ideas are actually clever and would work in real life, and sometimes they're reaching and/or entirely implausible. Vickie might be an annoying character with his fast wits if not for the fact that he's a coward who routinely runs away from danger or trembles in fright whenever things get bad. It makes him feel like a balanced character. On top of that, he's genuinely good-hearted and tries to reason with the others when they want to do something evil.ANIMATIONThe animation is simple and sparse, but since the character models aren't very complicated, the style and quality stay on the same level pretty much all the way through, with one exception. Short segments of the first episode are so crude and badly drawn that I simply can't understand what's up with them. Thankfully, there's no sign of this after that, and most of the time I felt that the animation worked perfectly for what they were trying to achieve. But the series definitely shows its age and won't awe you at any point.MUSICI watched the series in German, so the background music was by Karel Svoboda. I think the Japanese version may have a different soundtrack. I have no sources for this, but I know some other old anime series that were shown with Svoboda's music in Europe had entirely different music in Japan. In any case, Svoboda was a genius and his music works perfectly here. It's upbeat and funny but can get dark or touching when needed.OVERALLThis is a fun children's series from which you can watch pretty much any episode in any order, though there are sometimes multi-episode storylines. There's also no need to watch all of the episodes, either. In fact, watching all 78 episodes might make you sick of the series pretty fast, so I would suggest not marathoning it. But an episode every now and then is a nice snack, particularly once you begin to enjoy the characters and just want to see what weird things they end up doing next. The only episode I actively disliked was the very last one because I felt it went against established characterization and was a pretty weak, almost depressing way to end the series.Since there are so many episodes, here are some of my favourites in case someone wants to give the series a try: 25, 26, 31, 32, 34, 44, 56, 59, 63, 68, 70.

Vickie The Viking. Also known in japan as Chiisana Viking Vickie. This was one of thoses animes that i never got to finish watching during it\'s run and yet i still remember the show from the top of my head.And to find out that this also recognized as a german-austrian-japanese anime animated by Nippon Animation. It makes me have the urge to watch the entire anime from beginning to the end.Now, for thoses who are unfamiliar with the anime, here\'s the rundown:Vickie The Viking, or Chiisana Viking Vickie as it was known in Japan is a anime collaboration between Germany, Austria and Japan...based off the books of the same name by a swedish author, Runer Jonsson.It aired on german and japanese televisions in 1974 and it was a huge hit in there. The anime would later get aired and dubbed in other european countries like Portugal for example and much like in Germany, it would also become a hit there, too.Because of it\'s success, it would later on spawn lots of merchandises and other medias. Like a video game for a Nintendo DS, two live-action movies made in 2009 and 2011, a CGI remake by a belgium animation studio, Studio 100 and a CGI animated movie released in 2019.But what i\'m gonna give my thoughts/review for today is the anime that started it all. So how does it hold up after all theses years? Well, here\'s how i feel about it:The story itakes place in a village named ""Flake"" where lies the boy named ""Vickie"". Who\'s timid, physically frail and has a phobia for Wolves. However what makes him special compared to the other kids of Flake is the way of thinking and how he uses his brains to help out others.One day, he secretly hid himself in a barrel to go on a journey with his father, Halvar and his Vikings. There, Halvar and the others found out in the barrel that his son, Vickie, was hidden there joining the journey without notice.At first, Halvar was shocked and concerned about his son to join the vikings on a journey, mostly because he\'s too young and too early for him to become a future Viking.However, thanks to Vickie\'s smart brain, he\'s able to help out the others from many traps and dangers that they have to go through. From there, Halvar was convinced and realized that Vickie could be the ultimate weapon to help Halvar and his vikings when going on a journey.As the story progresses, each episodes tells each stories of how Vickie dealt with many situations. Such as the attacks of Halvar\'s nemesis, Sven, the way how to help out other countries to solve the problems they have and much more.So far, the stories are nice to watch. Each episodes offers some nice, funny and even interesting plots that help the story progress.It\'s also good to know how Vickie solves theses kinds of situations with his own brain.However, not all things go well with the writting. Some parts of the writting of the anime and go a bit off and lead to some minor writting flaws. and while some stories can be fun to watch, there are a few that aren\'t that great. Like one episode about how Faxe, the big viking of the group, was forced to find a wife.As for the animation, well, to be totally honest, it\'s my least favourite part of the anime. Mostly because there are numerous of errors that occur in the anime. Like how the characters are misplaced in each locations.However, i can give it a break, because come on. This is a anime made in 1974. The technology wasn\'t really there and some of the budget is pretty low. So it\'s logical that the animators don\'t have enough sources to be able to fix some of the errors that happens in the animation.But i will say this, though. The character designs do look nice. It does have a nice designs that differentiate from each characters. Even Snorre\'s design looks like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Sure it may look a bit weird at first, but you\'ll get used to it after you watch the anime.The characters, for the most part, are good and enjoyable. Lots of them can have a nice character developments and offer some nice interactions between each others.Outside of Vickie, the main protagonist of the series, you have Halvar. The father of viking and the leader of the group. He\'s one silly father to have. He does have some agressive personality, but he does have a good heart. He is willing to do what it takes to do the right thing when Vickie gets an idea of what to do and what not to do. Although he can find it dangerous at first.Then you have the other vikings like Snorre, Tjure, Faxe, Ulme, Urobe and Gorm. Theses guys are usually taking orders from Halvar anytime he orders to attack or invade the country. However, they do have some personalities that make them stand out from each others.Snorre and Tjure, for example, are some of the funniest characters in the anime. They constantly argue, fight againts each other and insult over the stupid stuff that they do. Whether small or big.There\'s even one episode about thoses two where they were given a race by Vickie himself to find out who\'s better.Other characters like Ylva, Vickie\'s mother, Ylvie and Gilby are only made to be supporting characters. They are okay, but nothing too special.As for the sound, the background music is done by Karel Svoboda. Who would later on work on other animes like Maya the Bee and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.For the most part, they are good to listen. It does offer some nice adventurous-vibe music and sometimes even some blues music.The openings for both the japanese version and german version are absolute bangs to listen to. On one hand, you have the japanese intro, ""Vicke wa chiisana Viking"" sung by the seiyuu, Yoko Kuri, who is the japanese voice of Vickie. It gives a relaxing and cute song to the opening sequence animation done by Nippon Animation.On the other hand, you have ""Hey Hey Wickie"" sung by Andrea Wagner. Which is a song that was translated in other dubs. Unlike the japanese song, this one gives a more Rock N\' Roll type of song. Which is also really good as well. It gives us excitement for what is to come from the show when you listen to it.As for the voice acting. Yeah here\'s the thing: I watched the european portuguese dub version done by Somnorte from 2004. Which features portuguese voice actors like Raquel Rosmaninho and Jorge Paupério.From what i watched from the Somnorte PT-PT dub, for the most part, it\'s good. They do offer some really nice voice acting and performances. Jorge Paupério is also a great in this and the best choice for Halvar.The only issue i had with this dub, it would be the first voice of Snorre, Mário Santos. He gives a more obnoxious voice to the character. But that\'s about it. The actor was eventually replaced by Jorge Seabra Paupério in episode 19-onwards (Not to be confused with Halvar\'s portuguese voice actor who also happens to be called Jorge Paupério).I wouldn\'t say that Mário is a bad actor, it\'s just that his voice doesn\'t fit with Snorre when it comes to voice acting. He\'s better off voicing Gorm.As for the Japanese dub, i actually managed to find the subbed episode 14 on GoGoAnime since it was finally translated into english (although very very poorly).Now from what i heard, people were saying that the Japanese dub had different music. Which is true here. It was more dramatic and comical compared to the german dub and the seiyuus are also different here. I\'m not sure who composed the background music for the japanese dub, though.Snorre here is voiced by Junpei Takiguchi and does sound pretty decent and Halvar\'s seiyuu, Tomita Kosei, actually sounds more gruesome and viking-ish compared to the more older voice type from the european dub.Vickie is voiced by Yoko Kuri, who is the only actress that i didn\'t like her way to voice Vickie. She made him sound a bit more feminine compared to he more young boy-ish voice in european portuguese dub.But Faxe\'s voice in japanese is actually the best one i\'ve heard. Not sure who voices the character, but it seems like his voice in the japanese dub sounds alot more chunkier compared to his european portuguese dub.But overall, despite some of the obvious flaws in writting and animation, i still think it holds up. It was a good children\'s anime and i had fun watching it.The characters are memorable, the music is good, the animation is good and overall, i had a good time watching it. It\'s just a nice kids show to spend time with your kids in case you want to have a good time with it.I would recommend it if you\'re into children\'s shows or you have a child to spend time with and want to watch a anime with your child.Sadly only one episode has been translated into english, in which contained some swearing, ableist and even homophobic words that has nothing to do with what the seiyuus are saying and the english dub is still incomplete.So my recommendation is to just watch the german dub for a complete experience. Unless you want to watch the european portuguese dub if you speak portuguese.But if you do find a way to watch the anime, i\'m very sure you\'ll have a good time. ^^I give Vickie The Viking an 7 out of 10. It\'s not exactly a perfect anime to watch, but i had my enjoyment out of this, even if it is old.Anyway, that\'s been my first review to a anime, thank you for reading and have a good day. based off the books of the same name by a swedish author, Runer Jonsson.It aired on german and japanese televisions in 1974 and it was a huge hit in there. The anime would later get aired and dubbed in other european countries like Portugal for example and much like in Germany, it would also become a hit there, too.Because of it\'s success, it would later on spawn lots of merchandises and other medias. Like a video game for a Nintendo DS, two live-action movies made in 2009 and 2011, a CGI remake by a belgium animation studio, Studio 100 and a CGI animated movie released in 2019.But what i\'m gonna give my thoughts/review for today is the anime that started it all. So how does it hold up after all theses years? Well, here\'s how i feel about it:The story itakes place in a village named ""Flake"" where lies the boy named ""Vickie"". Who\'s timid, physically frail and has a phobia for Wolves. However what makes him special compared to the other kids of Flake is the way of thinking and how he uses his brains to help out others.One day, he secretly hid himself in a barrel to go on a journey with his father, Halvar and his Vikings. There, Halvar and the others found out in the barrel that his son, Vickie, was hidden there joining the journey without notice.At first, Halvar was shocked and concerned about his son to join the vikings on a journey, mostly because he\'s too young and too early for him to become a future Viking.However, thanks to Vickie\'s smart brain, he\'s able to help out the others from many traps and dangers that they have to go through. From there, Halvar was convinced and realized that Vickie could be the ultimate weapon to help Halvar and his vikings when going on a journey.As the story progresses, each episodes tells each stories of how Vickie dealt with many situations. Such as the attacks of Halvar\'s nemesis, Sven, the way how to help out other countries to solve the problems they have and much more.So far, the stories are nice to watch. Each episodes offers some nice, funny and even interesting plots that help the story progress.It\'s also good to know how Vickie solves theses kinds of situations with his own brain.However, not all things go well with the writting. Some parts of the writting of the anime and go a bit off and lead to some minor writting flaws. and while some stories can be fun to watch, there are a few that aren\'t that great. Like one episode about how Faxe, the big viking of the group, was forced to find a wife.As for the animation, well, to be totally honest, it\'s my least favourite part of the anime. Mostly because there are numerous of errors that occur in the anime. Like how the characters are misplaced in each locations.However, i can give it a break, because come on. This is a anime made in 1974. The technology wasn\'t really there and some of the budget is pretty low. So it\'s logical that the animators don\'t have enough sources to be able to fix some of the errors that happens in the animation.But i will say this, though. The character designs do look nice. It does have a nice designs that differentiate from each characters. Even Snorre\'s design looks like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Sure it may look a bit weird at first, but you\'ll get used to it after you watch the anime.The characters, for the most part, are good and enjoyable. Lots of them can have a nice character developments and offer some nice interactions between each others.Outside of Vickie, the main protagonist of the series, you have Halvar. The father of viking and the leader of the group. He\'s one silly father to have. He does have some agressive personality, but he does have a good heart. He is willing to do what it takes to do the right thing when Vickie gets an idea of what to do and what not to do. Although he can find it dangerous at first.Then you have the other vikings like Snorre, Tjure, Faxe, Ulme, Urobe and Gorm. Theses guys are usually taking orders from Halvar anytime he orders to attack or invade the country. However, they do have some personalities that make them stand out from each others.Snorre and Tjure, for example, are some of the funniest characters in the anime. They constantly argue, fight againts each other and insult over the stupid stuff that they do. Whether small or big.There\'s even one episode about thoses two where they were given a race by Vickie himself to find out who\'s better.Other characters like Ylva, Vickie\'s mother, Ylvie and Gilby are only made to be supporting characters. They are okay, but nothing too special.As for the sound, the background music is done by Karel Svoboda. Who would later on work on other animes like Maya the Bee and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.For the most part, they are good to listen. It does offer some nice adventurous-vibe music and sometimes even some blues music.The openings for both the japanese version and german version are absolute bangs to listen to. On one hand, you have the japanese intro, ""Vicke wa chiisana Viking"" sung by the seiyuu, Yoko Kuri, who is the japanese voice of Vickie. It gives a relaxing and cute song to the opening sequence animation done by Nippon Animation.On the other hand, you have ""Hey Hey Wickie"" sung by Andrea Wagner. Which is a song that was translated in other dubs. Unlike the japanese song, this one gives a more Rock N\' Roll type of song. Which is also really good as well. It gives us excitement for what is to come from the show when you listen to it.As for the voice acting. Yeah here\'s the thing: I watched the european portuguese dub version done by Somnorte from 2004. Which features portuguese voice actors like Raquel Rosmaninho and Jorge Paupério.From what i watched from the Somnorte PT-PT dub, for the most part, it\'s good. They do offer some really nice voice acting and performances. Jorge Paupério is also a great in this and the best choice for Halvar.The only issue i had with this dub, it would be the first voice of Snorre, Mário Santos. He gives a more obnoxious voice to the character. But that\'s about it. The actor was eventually replaced by Jorge Seabra Paupério in episode 19-onwards (Not to be confused with Halvar\'s portuguese voice actor who also happens to be called Jorge Paupério).I wouldn\'t say that Mário is a bad actor, it\'s just that his voice doesn\'t fit with Snorre when it comes to voice acting.

One of the main reason is the decreased of otome game fans in this last few years. Being left fall behind with a low mean score also reflects MAL\'s demography. Realize probably won\'t become popular, no. ""It won\'t be popular enough."" in MAL. (since male viewers avoid large cast of bishies), and the fact that it has been adapted from otome game also join the cause.As I see the poster, I thought Realize will be another of one of those reverse harem with cute...bishies and a little 19th-century vibe to it. But after the first half, I realize Realize:""This show is underrated.""If we imagine it, Realize can be depicted as a new recipe to make a fresh topping for pizza. Bringing a fresh idea makes this anime unique.The story is about Cardia Beckford, a girl with a deadly poison in her body, everything she touches can be melted, and thus she lives alone sheltered until she met a man named Arsene Lupin, a thief who brings her to London.""Classical but fresh."" also another phrase for Realize, it can be done well. The only big matter of this kind of anime is how to make a proper adaptation from this 30+ hour of gameplay. Realize pacing can be much better if it planned to be a two-cour so it can justice that hours of gameplay. Realize story revolves fast, but not in the condition where we confused to understand its story (like Occultic; Nine for example). But despite the lack of pacing, the anime drives its plot in the right direction.The animation has been handled by M.S.C. studio (which is a quite less-known studio who works only for Tennis no Oujisama). One thing I adore is the character design, they\'ve been done beautifully (especially for Cardia and Hellsing), the animation is not as fluid nor perfect as modern anime these days, but it manages to meet its standard.In case of sound settings, voice actors did a very well job to bring every character alive. Background sound was decent, not a top-notch. While the opening (kalmia by Mia Regina) & ending (twinkle by Saori Hayami itself) really matching with the story atmosphere.In terms of character, Cardia Beckford really shines as a heroine. Why? It\'s because she can break the sacred rules of a useless heroine. She can come in handy for the rest of the team instead always acting like \'damsel in distress\'. While the rest of the bishies are cookie-cutter, they are somehow related to Cardia\'s past and some of them have their own past as well.In the end Code: Realize has proven its worth until this episode.

But even in this era of prosperity, it can be seen that not all is well as beneath the shadows dark forces are at work hoping to engineer change within the world situation and twist it to their own ends.The overall story follows the life of Cardia a mysterious girl that resided in a mansion on the outskirts of the capital that was widely labelled as a monster after she is rescued by a band of enigmatic thieves that is determined to keep her safe and use her as a means to locate her father and stop a plan that had been in the making for years. Joining Cardia in her quest to discover the truth of her identity is a band of unique characters that include Arsene Lupin the self-proclaimed gentlemen thief, Barbican Impey a self-proclaimed genius but a gifted mechanic, Abraham Van Helsing a former soldier hell bent on redemption, Victor Frankenstein a former alchemist determined to avenge the pain his inventions have caused and Saint Germain an enigmatic count that seems to have a mysterious reason to provide support to the group. As Cardia and her friends fight to find the truth of her origins they soon find themselves caught in a terrifying plot by a mysterious organisation that seeks to change the whole order of the world a plot that is intertwined with Cardia’s mysterious origins.Barbicane ImpeyImpey Barbicane voiced by veteran voice actor Shoutarou Morikubo of Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the team’s chief mechanic. A confident, positive and carefree person Impey acts as the chief mechanic of the team capable of fixing a variety of vehicles that range from an automobile to an airship. A kind-hearted and loyal person by nature Impey while a self-proclaimed genius is actually someone that is able to back up such claims as his skills allow the cast to use many different modes of transport as the series progresses. While Impey may look like someone that doesn’t like to take things seriously it can be seen that this is not actually the case as Impey takes everything that he does with great care and when sufficiently motivated can be relied upon to work hard and provide the support the rest of the cast needs.CardiaCardia voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada Kun and the Seven witches fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A young teenage girl that at the start of the series was labelled by others as a monster and was imprisoned in a mansion that sat at the edge of the capital before being rescued. In the beginning of the series, Cardia as a result of having little to no contact with humans was someone that was at first unsure on how to deal with humans and as a result was also wary and guarded around people. In the beginning, Cardia was an innocent, calm and kind person that as a result of her virus kept a distance from the other members of the gang even as they tried to get to know her. Despite that Cardia at this time was well mannered and polite to everyone that she met. In the beginning of the series as a result of not having any memories as well as her isolation from the rest of the world Cardia was someone that knew nothing about what a human is and how they should normally act in the world and as a result knew very little about them and of the world as well. she also wrestled with the thought that as a result of the virus that is housed inside her that she is lethal to anyone that approaches her bringing them misfortune.As the series goes on and as Cardia got to see the world that lay outside of her mansion and got to know the members of the gang on an emotional level her personality starts to gradually change. While Cardia, in the beginning, was a withdrawn, indecisive and fragile young woman this starts to gradually change as the series goes on. As Cardia got to know more about the world and saw how determined the rest of the team is in wanting to protect her Cardia’s personality starts to gradually open up becoming more positive, cheerful and friendly and willing to speak to others and try to understand the problems that they are burdened with arguably becoming more human as she does. While still conscious of the curse that lays within her Cardia gradually starts to realise that letting her curse restrain her was merely limiting her life and destiny shackling them to Twilights plans. As a result of this Cardia gradually starts becoming braver, more determined and more willing to take the initiative as she tries to find a purpose and a role for her in the world that only she can control.  The character of Cardia I felt was an interesting and well-designed one and her gradual change from a young quiet and easily rattled girl to one that had resolved to take control of her own life and destiny and in the process becoming more human I felt was well done. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did a fantastic job in voicing her.VictorVictor Frankenstein played by veteran voice actor Tetsuya Kakihara of Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang. A calm, quiet and honest young man Victor though intelligent and logical is also someone that seems to be more at home in a lab creating some new mysterious element that can be used to better humanity than being part of the gang. While Victor is a quiet person by nature it can be seen that Victor is not someone that is scared or awkward around people and indeed can actually be a pretty good negotiator in the most unusual of times. As the series goes on it can be seen that Victor is someone that views science and technology as a means to advance humanity and as a result fiercely opposes its use in military matters which caused him to resign from his previous position within the kingdom and come to help the team. As the series goes on it becomes clear that Victor’s reason for helping the team in their fight against Twilight and their role in guarding Cardia was a more personal one as it can be seen that he felt immense guilt at creating the poison that caused Cardia to experience immense emotional and psychological pain and seeks to atone for his mistake by helping her get her life back.ArseneArsene Lupin voiced by veteran voice actor Tomoaki Maeno of Kiznaiver and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of the thieves group that protects Cardia. A kind, calm and logical person by nature Arsene emphasises the ideal image of a gentleman thief not just because of his combat outfit but also because of his mannerisms and how much he prides himself on being to steal anything without killing.  On the surface, Lupin is someone that is intelligent, perceptive and is someone that takes his role as a thief rather seriously.  Beneath this, however, it can be seen that Arsene is someone that despite being a thief is someone that believes firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and is also someone that can be surprisingly loyal to his friends and allies as well. In line with Lupin’s belief of justice and fairness, Lupin is someone that treats everyone with respect and kindness regardless of their social standing something that was influenced by his guardian and mentor that he held in high esteem. In the beginning of the series Lupin and Cardia had a rather sudden first encounter as she was rescued and in a sense kidnapped by him to protect her. As the series goes on and as they interact and get to know each other more it can be seen that the two of them gradually bond with each other and form a strong friendship. Though Cardia at first was guarded around him as she was around everyone else it can be said that as a result of Lupin treating her like a normal girl instead of as a monster that their relationship started to improve and cause Cardia to gradually open up to the others paving the path for her to break out of her shell.The character of Lupin I felt was an interesting and well-developed character that showed that despite being a thief Lupin was still someone that believed firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and unlike many of the characters that the cast meet along the way treated everyone with respect and kindness proving that one should never judge a person by their profession alone. I felt that his voice actor Tomoaki Maeno really did a great job in voicing the character of Arsene Lupin.Saint GermaineSaint Germaine voiced by veteran voice actor Hirakawa Daisuke is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A calm, composed and collected person by nature Saint Germaine initially served as the groups mysterious supporter providing them with both their main base of operations and intelligence but not showing his face until much later. After this reveal, it can be seen that Saint Germaine despite being a member of the countries nobility displays none of the arrogance that they usually do and instead Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that cares about people and treats all with humility and respect. While a quiet person Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that is very intelligent and adept at both analysing situations and creating plans that can be used to deal with them. This aspect of having a noble that actively cares about the people of the kingdom be part of the team that’s secretly protecting it I felt was an interesting move as it symbolises the fact that the battle against Twilight is one that transcends social classes.AbrahamAbraham Van Helsing voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Bungou Stray Dogs and Fate Stay Night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A veteran soldier of the crown Abraham is a calm, composed and serious person by nature that fits the ideal image of someone that had seen military service and seen the realities of what war is like. A quiet person by nature and one that doesn’t like to speak unless they have someone useful to offer in addition to being quiet Abraham is also someone that is also rather direct in the way that he deals with people and threats and is someone that dislikes cutting corners. In the beginning of the series Abraham was shown to be someone that was fiercely antisocial and because of his past experiences trusted others warily which often caused some element of mistrust within the team after he joined them. However, it can be seen that beneath this attitude of his Abraham is also using it to mask his true feelings of the matter as well.As the series goes on and as more of Abraham’s past and backstory is revealed it can be seen that Abraham is actually someone that hates injustice dearly and is someone that believes that everyone should be treated with fairness no matter what social standing or life form that they are. As a result of his rather tragic backstory, it can be seen that Abraham is someone that bears a great deal of burden upon himself and indeed he is someone that looks upon his title as Van Helsing the vampire hunter with something that approaches hatred instead of the pride that they feel he should feel. This tragic backstory was what ultimately caused Abraham’s personality to change from loyal member of the crown to someone that is determined to eradicate Twilight and get atonement for the part that he played in exterminating an entire race. Though this journey of atonement and revenge forms a large part of Abraham’s reason for joining Cardia and the gang it can be seen that as the series goes on that it slowly diminishes as Abraham got to know and understand both Cardia and the rest of the gang. While still determined to end the head of Twilight who gave that fateful order to him it can be seen that as a result of the interactions with Cardia and the rest that Abraham’s personality gradually changes becoming more talkative, caring and more willing to help his friends and comrades and slowly begins to break out of his shell. While still wanting to atone for the grave crimes that he had helped Twilight enact it can be seen that Abraham after meeting Drac has determined that the best path would be to live on and honor the memories of the past and do not let a repeat of what happened then happen once more. The character of Abraham Van Helsing whose namesake is that of a well-known daemon hunter I felt was a well designed and developed character that as the series went on saw a great deal of development that really fleshed him out. His backstory that ultimately caused him to change his personality and focus it around revenge and atonement and its conclusion I felt was done really well as it not only served to show us how evil Twilight was but also showed the effects that its actions had on people as well.FinisFinis voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel World and Black Bullet fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the series main villain. A malicious, rude and blunt person by nature Finis serves as the leader of the Twilight a secretive intel organisation that works from the shadows orchestrating events in the kingdom from behind the scenes. While seemingly childlike in both appearance and personality it can be seen that Finis is someone that is arrogant, haughty and looks down on people quite easily and is someone that is loyal only to himself and to no one else. Throughout the series, it’s also apparent that he is also someone that does not bow down to authority even when in the presence of the queen of the realm Queen Victoria herself. While rude, malicious and arrogant in the beginning as the series progresses it can be seen that Finis is also someone that’s sadistic, cruel and manipulative and has a rather interesting relationship with Cardia as he loves to torment her both physically and mentally. As the series goes on and his role in Cardia’s mysterious origins is revealed it can be seen that Finis only see’s Cardia as something akin to a tool to their plans and as such doesn’t see her as a human being something that Cardia is extremely sensitive to. Despite only being loyal to himself it can be seen that by the latter half of the series that Finis is also pretty loyal to the idea that his father has created and indeed is someone that is willing to sacrifice everything that he has in order to bring that plan into fruition even if it meant bringing destruction to the kingdom that he was supposed to be serving. The character of Finis I felt was an interesting one as his manipulative and cunning personality along with his seemingly strange obsession with Cardia made him a character that was both challenging to deal with in both combat and in determining and foiling his many plans.AMVThe animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially the portrayal of Victorian-era London that was in the throes of the industrial age. The character designs for each of the main characters I felt was also well done as it highlighted the roles that each of them played within the team pretty well. The combat scenes of which there were many within the series I felt were well designed and developed particularly the ones that showed multiple members of the gang engage enemies in combat. The designs of Twilights main henchman who wore bird shaped masks and looked like medieval doctors I felt was an interesting choice given that the role of Twilight in the story was to destroy rather than heal. In terms of music the opening and ending themes for the series which was Kalmia which was sung by Mia Regina and Twinkle which was sung by Cardia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami I felt were both very good and contrasted greatly with the feelings that they invoke with the former invoking mystique while the latter of calmness. In terms of voice acting I felt that Saori Hayami, Junichi Suwabe and Tomoaki Maeno who portrayed the characters of Cardia, Abraham and Arsene respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters.Overall conclusionIn overall Code Realize was a series that while starting slow started to get more interesting as the series progressed and was one that I actually really enjoyed watching. The series main strong points I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting. The premise of the series itself I felt was interesting as Victorian-era London is one setting that’s not often seen in anime. In the great industrial revolution that brought great prosperity to the kingdom inserting the creation of a mythical new substance and resource that can be used to create things that range from military-grade nerve gas to airships I felt was an interesting aspect as it resonated well with the age of great breakthroughs that took place in that era. While the premise of a semi-fictional Victorian London was interesting the fact that beneath this advancement existed beings that co-existed with humans yet were feared and hated by all I felt was an aspect that matched well with the theme of human advancement as even as humanity advances in tech traditional human feelings like hatred, jealousy and superstition will continue to exist within the world and that even the most peaceful of products can also be re purposed to deal with beings that the public fears. Matching well with this premise of a great industrial revolution that is paired with a shimmering fear and distrust of beings that are considered monsters by others is the overall story of Cardia and her journey to reclaim the life and memories that she had lost and in the process of discovering what it meant to be a human being.The overall story of the series itself I felt was one of the series main strong points as not only did it allow us to see how Cardia a being that was widely considered by many to be a monster gradually evolve as she got to see the large world that lay outside of her prison but also get to see her gradually learn to take control of her own life and destiny. And in doing so gradually become more human as she learned to forge friendships and bonds with people and develop trust for everyone that she encounters in her journey to find out the truth of her existence and later to stop Twilight from enacting their plan.  While the overall story was split between discovering the truth of Cardia’s identity and stopping Twilight’s plans its important to note that the story also incorporated a number of themes that defined it foremost among them is what makes a human being one. Is it our emotions, feelings, mannerisms or physical appearances? What separates us from the monsters that the army protects us from and that society fears of. These themes and questions I felt were skilfully woven into Cardia’s backstory as well as in her development and served to only enhance her journey to develop into a human that’s willing to stand up to the stigma and prejudice that society have against her due to her origins.Overall, I felt that the series had an interesting premise that was paired with an excellent story that was populated by some well-designed characters. Cadia’s gradual development from a girl that was insecure, indecisive and fragile to one that was both strong-willed and understanding of others and was determined to live her life the way that she wants while defying her father’s plans for her I felt was one of the main highlights of the series. In overall, I would say that as a final score that Code Realize would deserve a final score of 8/10 as though the series had an excellent premise, story, characters and voice acting I felt that some characters were underdeveloped and the setting of Victorian era London while interesting to see I felt was lacking in effective world building and as a result it didn’t particularly stand out something that i thought was a waste. the creation of technological breakthroughs like airships. But even in this era of prosperity, it can be seen that not all is well as beneath the shadows dark forces are at work hoping to engineer change within the world situation and twist it to their own ends.The overall story follows the life of Cardia a mysterious girl that resided in a mansion on the outskirts of the capital that was widely labelled as a monster after she is rescued by a band of enigmatic thieves that is determined to keep her safe and use her as a means to locate her father and stop a plan that had been in the making for years. Joining Cardia in her quest to discover the truth of her identity is a band of unique characters that include Arsene Lupin the self-proclaimed gentlemen thief, Barbican Impey a self-proclaimed genius but a gifted mechanic, Abraham Van Helsing a former soldier hell bent on redemption, Victor Frankenstein a former alchemist determined to avenge the pain his inventions have caused and Saint Germain an enigmatic count that seems to have a mysterious reason to provide support to the group. As Cardia and her friends fight to find the truth of her origins they soon find themselves caught in a terrifying plot by a mysterious organisation that seeks to change the whole order of the world a plot that is intertwined with Cardia’s mysterious origins.Barbicane ImpeyImpey Barbicane voiced by veteran voice actor Shoutarou Morikubo of Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the team’s chief mechanic. A confident, positive and carefree person Impey acts as the chief mechanic of the team capable of fixing a variety of vehicles that range from an automobile to an airship. A kind-hearted and loyal person by nature Impey while a self-proclaimed genius is actually someone that is able to back up such claims as his skills allow the cast to use many different modes of transport as the series progresses. While Impey may look like someone that doesn’t like to take things seriously it can be seen that this is not actually the case as Impey takes everything that he does with great care and when sufficiently motivated can be relied upon to work hard and provide the support the rest of the cast needs.CardiaCardia voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada Kun and the Seven witches fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A young teenage girl that at the start of the series was labelled by others as a monster and was imprisoned in a mansion that sat at the edge of the capital before being rescued. In the beginning of the series, Cardia as a result of having little to no contact with humans was someone that was at first unsure on how to deal with humans and as a result was also wary and guarded around people. In the beginning, Cardia was an innocent, calm and kind person that as a result of her virus kept a distance from the other members of the gang even as they tried to get to know her. Despite that Cardia at this time was well mannered and polite to everyone that she met. In the beginning of the series as a result of not having any memories as well as her isolation from the rest of the world Cardia was someone that knew nothing about what a human is and how they should normally act in the world and as a result knew very little about them and of the world as well. she also wrestled with the thought that as a result of the virus that is housed inside her that she is lethal to anyone that approaches her bringing them misfortune.As the series goes on and as Cardia got to see the world that lay outside of her mansion and got to know the members of the gang on an emotional level her personality starts to gradually change. While Cardia, in the beginning, was a withdrawn, indecisive and fragile young woman this starts to gradually change as the series goes on. As Cardia got to know more about the world and saw how determined the rest of the team is in wanting to protect her Cardia’s personality starts to gradually open up becoming more positive, cheerful and friendly and willing to speak to others and try to understand the problems that they are burdened with arguably becoming more human as she does. While still conscious of the curse that lays within her Cardia gradually starts to realise that letting her curse restrain her was merely limiting her life and destiny shackling them to Twilights plans. As a result of this Cardia gradually starts becoming braver, more determined and more willing to take the initiative as she tries to find a purpose and a role for her in the world that only she can control.  The character of Cardia I felt was an interesting and well-designed one and her gradual change from a young quiet and easily rattled girl to one that had resolved to take control of her own life and destiny and in the process becoming more human I felt was well done. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did a fantastic job in voicing her.VictorVictor Frankenstein played by veteran voice actor Tetsuya Kakihara of Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang. A calm, quiet and honest young man Victor though intelligent and logical is also someone that seems to be more at home in a lab creating some new mysterious element that can be used to better humanity than being part of the gang. While Victor is a quiet person by nature it can be seen that Victor is not someone that is scared or awkward around people and indeed can actually be a pretty good negotiator in the most unusual of times. As the series goes on it can be seen that Victor is someone that views science and technology as a means to advance humanity and as a result fiercely opposes its use in military matters which caused him to resign from his previous position within the kingdom and come to help the team. As the series goes on it becomes clear that Victor’s reason for helping the team in their fight against Twilight and their role in guarding Cardia was a more personal one as it can be seen that he felt immense guilt at creating the poison that caused Cardia to experience immense emotional and psychological pain and seeks to atone for his mistake by helping her get her life back.ArseneArsene Lupin voiced by veteran voice actor Tomoaki Maeno of Kiznaiver and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of the thieves group that protects Cardia. A kind, calm and logical person by nature Arsene emphasises the ideal image of a gentleman thief not just because of his combat outfit but also because of his mannerisms and how much he prides himself on being to steal anything without killing.  On the surface, Lupin is someone that is intelligent, perceptive and is someone that takes his role as a thief rather seriously.  Beneath this, however, it can be seen that Arsene is someone that despite being a thief is someone that believes firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and is also someone that can be surprisingly loyal to his friends and allies as well. In line with Lupin’s belief of justice and fairness, Lupin is someone that treats everyone with respect and kindness regardless of their social standing something that was influenced by his guardian and mentor that he held in high esteem. In the beginning of the series Lupin and Cardia had a rather sudden first encounter as she was rescued and in a sense kidnapped by him to protect her. As the series goes on and as they interact and get to know each other more it can be seen that the two of them gradually bond with each other and form a strong friendship. Though Cardia at first was guarded around him as she was around everyone else it can be said that as a result of Lupin treating her like a normal girl instead of as a monster that their relationship started to improve and cause Cardia to gradually open up to the others paving the path for her to break out of her shell.The character of Lupin I felt was an interesting and well-developed character that showed that despite being a thief Lupin was still someone that believed firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and unlike many of the characters that the cast meet along the way treated everyone with respect and kindness proving that one should never judge a person by their profession alone. I felt that his voice actor Tomoaki Maeno really did a great job in voicing the character of Arsene Lupin.Saint GermaineSaint Germaine voiced by veteran voice actor Hirakawa Daisuke is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A calm, composed and collected person by nature Saint Germaine initially served as the groups mysterious supporter providing them with both their main base of operations and intelligence but not showing his face until much later. After this reveal, it can be seen that Saint Germaine despite being a member of the countries nobility displays none of the arrogance that they usually do and instead Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that cares about people and treats all with humility and respect. While a quiet person Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that is very intelligent and adept at both analysing situations and creating plans that can be used to deal with them. This aspect of having a noble that actively cares about the people of the kingdom be part of the team that’s secretly protecting it I felt was an interesting move as it symbolises the fact that the battle against Twilight is one that transcends social classes.AbrahamAbraham Van Helsing voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Bungou Stray Dogs and Fate Stay Night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A veteran soldier of the crown Abraham is a calm, composed and serious person by nature that fits the ideal image of someone that had seen military service and seen the realities of what war is like. A quiet person by nature and one that doesn’t like to speak unless they have someone useful to offer in addition to being quiet Abraham is also someone that is also rather direct in the way that he deals with people and threats and is someone that dislikes cutting corners. In the beginning of the series Abraham was shown to be someone that was fiercely antisocial and because of his past experiences trusted others warily which often caused some element of mistrust within the team after he joined them. However, it can be seen that beneath this attitude of his Abraham is also using it to mask his true feelings of the matter as well.As the series goes on and as more of Abraham’s past and backstory is revealed it can be seen that Abraham is actually someone that hates injustice dearly and is someone that believes that everyone should be treated with fairness no matter what social standing or life form that they are. As a result of his rather tragic backstory, it can be seen that Abraham is someone that bears a great deal of burden upon himself and indeed he is someone that looks upon his title as Van Helsing the vampire hunter with something that approaches hatred instead of the pride that they feel he should feel. This tragic backstory was what ultimately caused Abraham’s personality to change from loyal member of the crown to someone that is determined to eradicate Twilight and get atonement for the part that he played in exterminating an entire race. Though this journey of atonement and revenge forms a large part of Abraham’s reason for joining Cardia and the gang it can be seen that as the series goes on that it slowly diminishes as Abraham got to know and understand both Cardia and the rest of the gang. While still determined to end the head of Twilight who gave that fateful order to him it can be seen that as a result of the interactions with Cardia and the rest that Abraham’s personality gradually changes becoming more talkative, caring and more willing to help his friends and comrades and slowly begins to break out of his shell. While still wanting to atone for the grave crimes that he had helped Twilight enact it can be seen that Abraham after meeting Drac has determined that the best path would be to live on and honor the memories of the past and do not let a repeat of what happened then happen once more. The character of Abraham Van Helsing whose namesake is that of a well-known daemon hunter I felt was a well designed and developed character that as the series went on saw a great deal of development that really fleshed him out. His backstory that ultimately caused him to change his personality and focus it around revenge and atonement and its conclusion I felt was done really well as it not only served to show us how evil Twilight was but also showed the effects that its actions had on people as well.FinisFinis voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel World and Black Bullet fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the series main villain. A malicious, rude and blunt person by nature Finis serves as the leader of the Twilight a secretive intel organisation that works from the shadows orchestrating events in the kingdom from behind the scenes. While seemingly childlike in both appearance and personality it can be seen that Finis is someone that is arrogant, haughty and looks down on people quite easily and is someone that is loyal only to himself and to no one else. Throughout the series, it’s also apparent that he is also someone that does not bow down to authority even when in the presence of the queen of the realm Queen Victoria herself. While rude, malicious and arrogant in the beginning as the series progresses it can be seen that Finis is also someone that’s sadistic, cruel and manipulative and has a rather interesting relationship with Cardia as he loves to torment her both physically and mentally. As the series goes on and his role in Cardia’s mysterious origins is revealed it can be seen that Finis only see’s Cardia as something akin to a tool to their plans and as such doesn’t see her as a human being something that Cardia is extremely sensitive to. Despite only being loyal to himself it can be seen that by the latter half of the series that Finis is also pretty loyal to the idea that his father has created and indeed is someone that is willing to sacrifice everything that he has in order to bring that plan into fruition even if it meant bringing destruction to the kingdom that he was supposed to be serving. The character of Finis I felt was an interesting one as his manipulative and cunning personality along with his seemingly strange obsession with Cardia made him a character that was both challenging to deal with in both combat and in determining and foiling his many plans.AMVThe animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially the portrayal of Victorian-era London that was in the throes of the industrial age. The character designs for each of the main characters I felt was also well done as it highlighted the roles that each of them played within the team pretty well. The combat scenes of which there were many within the series I felt were well designed and developed particularly the ones that showed multiple members of the gang engage enemies in combat. The designs of Twilights main henchman who wore bird shaped masks and looked like medieval doctors I felt was an interesting choice given that the role of Twilight in the story was to destroy rather than heal. In terms of music the opening and ending themes for the series which was Kalmia which was sung by Mia Regina and Twinkle which was sung by Cardia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami I felt were both very good and contrasted greatly with the feelings that they invoke with the former invoking mystique while the latter of calmness. In terms of voice acting I felt that Saori Hayami, Junichi Suwabe and Tomoaki Maeno who portrayed the characters of Cardia, Abraham and Arsene respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters.Overall conclusionIn overall Code Realize was a series that while starting slow started to get more interesting as the series progressed and was one that I actually really enjoyed watching. The series main strong points I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting. The premise of the series itself I felt was interesting as Victorian-era London is one setting that’s not often seen in anime. In the great industrial revolution that brought great prosperity to the kingdom inserting the creation of a mythical new substance and resource that can be used to create things that range from military-grade nerve gas to airships I felt was an interesting aspect as it resonated well with the age of great breakthroughs that took place in that era. While the premise of a semi-fictional Victorian London was interesting the fact that beneath this advancement existed beings that co-existed with humans yet were feared and hated by all I felt was an aspect that matched well with the theme of human advancement as even as humanity advances in tech traditional human feelings like hatred, jealousy and superstition will continue to exist within the world and that even the most peaceful of products can also be re purposed to deal with beings that the public fears. Matching well with this premise of a great industrial revolution that is paired with a shimmering fear and distrust of beings that are considered monsters by others is the overall story of Cardia and her journey to reclaim the life and memories that she had lost and in the process of discovering what it meant to be a human being.The overall story of the series itself I felt was one of the series main strong points as not only did it allow us to see how Cardia a being that was widely considered by many to be a monster gradually evolve as she got to see the large world that lay outside of her prison but also get to see her gradually learn to take control of her own life and destiny.

When you feel their warmth, this [heart] starts to beat.’’Code: Realize is about a young woman named Cardia who has been living in isolation in 19th century’s London because of a deadly poison that resides in her body. Because of this curse, anyone or anything she touches with her skin rots or melts. As one might expect, Cardia has been shunned by everyone throughout her life so she’s never experienced friendship or romantic intimacy. One day a witty thief, Arsene Lupin, saves her and...decides to embark on a journey with her to unravel the mystery of this curse and to possibly find a cure. Gathering fragmented clues in every episode, both the characters and the audience start piecing them together to shed light on Cardia’s past.This sounds like a very refreshing and novel premise, right? I was really intrigued by it having not read the visual novel; loving someone and having friends but not being able to touch them sounds heartbreaking. This show had tremendous potential for greatness despite the record of unsuccessful or dull adaptations of otome games. However it’s exactly because of its potential greatness that I was let down. Being a one cour, Code:Realize unfortunately suffers the same fate as most visual novels’ adaptations do: the pacing is unsteady and in order to skim through the whole plot quickly within the strict time limit of 12 episodes, it sacrifices vital character development, depth and analysis of numerous plot points. In other words, we get no significant insight into the characters’ perspective or feelings other than some fleeting moments at the beginning or end of the episode.The atmosphere of the show is quite unique and being set in industrial London really compliments the mystery. Cardia, our female heroine, is very kind and sweet. She might seem like your typical dandere at first but her intriguing background reveals that she’s far more than that. Along with Arsene, Victor, Saint, Van and Impey she discovers the warmth of friendship, developing strong bonds, relying on others and being supported. I would have loved to be able to examine her feelings and thoughts more thoroughly, but unfortunately we only got a few (but heartwarming) glimpses at them. Lupin, our main male character, is a very witty and cool guy. He’s romantically interested in Cardia and he has vowed to help her get rid of the curse. He’s the first person to treat her with respect and affection. However his character is not explored any further than the usual caring and fun, boyfriend-material type of guy. The rest of the gang is not given enough screentime either, with the exception of Van Helsing. Lastly, the villain, Finis, is not engaging either because, despite provoking sympathy in a few scenes, he remains a quite bland and forgettable type of villain.While you want to unravel the mystery and see Cardia fulfill her wish, I’d say the most satisfying and exciting thing during my watching was not the showdowns but rather the intimate, heart-warming moments between Cardia and the rest of the group. And obviously the romance. That being said, it is still an entertaining weekly watch; it gets you interested in getting your hands on the original source, so I think it has fulfilled its purpose. decides to embark on a journey with her to unravel the mystery of this curse and to possibly find a cure.

Enter Arsene Lupin the gentleman thief, and Cardia sets off on...a journey with Arsene and his gang to eradicate her father\'s plan to save the whole of London from the (initial) attacks of Twilight (aided by Finis) and as far as confronting her father to stop his plan.As you would for any Otome fan: 1 girl, many guys, a reverse harem. But even for a romance sucker like myself, I know that Cardia would only be attached to that one person (end card spoilers) for eternity. Honestly, nothing to write off about.Characters:The single girl, Cardia Beckford, unassumingly is not active, but always becoming the damsel in distress, but that\'s the trait in otome games, so I\'ll pass it up there.The guys however, are a part of the problem. You know it when you have characters named after historical figures (which surprisingly enough work just like the counterparts), showcase their best talents and hopes that the girl can rock her boat towards them in each single way.Art/Animation:M.S.C, the studio famous for the Prince of Tennis series, seems very underwhelming for them to undertake a project based on an otome game where they don\'t have any doubt of the final product of the anime and assumed it\'s just the game developer, idea Factory, who wanted what\'s contained in the game to explicate itself in the anime adaptation.Sorry to say that they quality is very bare bones in conducting itself to people watching it, even for fans of the otome game. Sure, nothing is ever constructed consistently, but somehow they are able to pull off a nice, looing visual all the way through towards the ending, and yes, this adaptation has an ending.Sound:The OST and BGM are nothing noteworthy to say of fortunately, because it feels like its all filler and no substance...with one exception, and that being the ED ""Twinkle"" by Cardia\'s VA, Saori Hayami.

Every episode something that looks important happens, but in the end nothing changes, I cuold skip from episode 1 to 6 (maybe more, the last one I watched was 5) and the only thing I would lose is the presentation of the vampire boy, mad scientist and ""Herlock Sholmes"" (really?), but the first one is irrelevant and you can easilly guess the other two\'s roles.Animation and sound aren\'t anything remarkable.In the end, I would say this show is like ""neither stinks nor smells"". It goes to the bad side since since any enterteinment is supposed to be good. the beginning and relevant things should happen.

The story was fresh and unique, the characters were quirky and I was kept at the edge of my seat with each episode. 10 out of 10. This was one of the most underdog animes this year that deserves more praise than what it received.I loved how they created characters that followed well know stories, but with a twist. Hellsing, Fran, Lupin, even Dracula. I...hope more people find this anime and give it a chance. I am glad that I did.Both the Sub and Dub voice actors were amazing. J.

Naturally, this anime has drawn my attention to watch it for the guys, the pretty art as well as the romance.And I realized that when I stopped thinking about the logic behind the premise of the show and simply hop along the ride, I actually had a good time watching.I personally haven\'t played the visual novel so I had no idea what to expect but surprisingly, I was charmed by the characters of the series. Their personality quirks and constant ""frienemies"" arguments are cliche but unexpectedly refreshing. I found...myself giggling here and there.Perhaps I just found myself welcoming the way Cardia is being treated by the guys in the show. It is very nice to see the guys being gentle around her. I\'ve seen way too many otome theme anime that have the guys treated the main girl harshly so it was a nice change of pace to see the main guy isn\'t a Tsundere jerk for once.The art and the animation of the show isn\'t exactly top-notched but it\'s no way un-watchable. The drawings of the characters are consistent for the most part but you would notice the obvious lazy drawing during the wide shots. The animation is just ""okay"" to carry the story.The OP and the ED definitely fits the vibe of the show but I don\'t personally find them memorable.

Who played the otome game before watching this anime, the story would still seems connected, but for the viewers who know nothing about this anime/ otome game it would very confusing.I understand that they would like to introduce...the character as much as possible in the anime to somehow promote the otome game too. But, by mixing the story I feel like it just twisted the plot even more.It was sad that they barely show the story for Saint-Germain. Even though he is not my favorite character, I think his story was one of the best in the otome game. I can't  even imagine how confusing his character and his background story in the anime to viewers that didn't play the game. I think he was barely introduced or explained.It was sad to see the stories getting cut and altered.

I was so excited for this anime and honestly yes it is a good anime. However I do understand the low scores.For me it is a solid 7/10. To be frank, 12 Episodes was NOT enough for Code Realize.There is too much content in the game, the backstories are better explained and the character development is much more deeper. Especially the growing bonds of love and friendship between Card and Party.The pros of...this anime  are (in my humble opinion)Music- although it can't compare to the game, the music is good. I found the OP to be extremely addictive and enjoyable.Character- I was so worried about how Cardia's personality would be interpreted in the anime, but she is extremely likeable. I liked her and she fulfilled my expectations of MC in the anime. She is not just a pretty face. She is kind, brave and goes through a lot of inner turmoil that you can't help but relate to at times. They really did a good job representing her and her voice to me was very fitting!Story- Although rushed, the story is entertaining.The story progresses very quickly so that contributes to wanting to continue watching, for me there was never a dull moment in the series.On the downside, as I said 12 Episodes is nowhere near enough it needed at least a MINIMUM of 25 Episodes.As a result, the character back stories suffered and so did the plot. I'll be honest if I had not played the game, I wouldn't know what was going on.(Not saying go buy the game but you might be lost without knowing the background)It was very rushed, we hardly knew much about Impey and ESPECIALLY Saint-German's backstory (which is heart-wrenching in the game) was so watered down, you don't get to really understand or feel for him.However, Abraham Van Helsing I think had the most screen time to dwell into his backstory yet still a lot was left out (i.e his feud with Aleistor)I felt sorry that we did not see more of Impey or Saint, not to mention Victor and Lupin's stories were very brief but they really did deserve a lot more attention to them.THAT ASIDE, it really is a good anime. It's not just a romance/reverse harem, there is action, comedy and a darkness to this series even though it is crunched into 12 small episodes; I would still recommend this anime.There are times you can't help but laugh, you can't help but feel for the characters (Especially Van, Drac and Cardia even Finis!) And at the end I literally cried just like I did in the game.Definitely watch it, its a fun, heart-warming anime with a little bit of everything that you can't help but like all the characters!ON A SIDE NOTE: stay tuned for the after credits of each episodes because there's a small scene that leads into the next episode. I missed these and had to go back a few times to find out what was going on.I hope they make Code Realize Future Blessings! :D this anime  are (in my humble opinion)Music- although it can't compare to the game, the music is good.

Like I said in my Danganronpa review, you cannot put 30 hours of content into 12 episodes unless you want a mess.Code: Realize seriously had a lot of potential, but it really blew up in its face after a while. Let\'s begin.Story; 5/10The story seriously was an amazing concept! But after a few episodes, it got rushed and very boring....Art; 6/10The art was okay, it had lots of times when the characters would look stiff and awkward, their faces would shift in shape, and sometimes their eyes would be on their forehead.Sound; 5/10The voice acting had lots of emotion, it had it\'s times when it\'d sound really forced.Character; 4/10Like I said before, this story is very rushed, and rushed stories create boring and flat characters. literally, the only thing Cardia would complain about was that she couldn\'t touch anything, like, we get it, you can\'t touch anything.Enjoyment; 3/10In the begginning, I was rooting for Cardia. I was like ""omg eeeeeee"" when Cardia and that theif had their moments. It was exciting, but soon it just got boring. I stopped going ""omg eeeeee"" and I started going ""Oh, okay."" by episode 5.Overall; 4/10Like I said in the beginning, I do give them props for trying to make this anime watchable, and for a certain time, it was. I\'m glad they tried their hardest and I\'m happy they enjoyed what they put out.

While the heroine's existential crisis was an interesting discussion, she spent most of her time passively where she ends up in situations where she had to be rescued by her love interests. The male leads were also uninteresting, sticking too close to their archetypes instead of acting like human beings.My one nitpick is that the writing of Code:Realize was so poorly done that the characters' relationships weren't fully justified. Everyone kept on saying how the heroine meant a lot to them, but the sequence of events made it hard to see what do they see in her....The only exception was the love interest for the anime.The artwork was beautiful, but the animation was really stiff. The OST wasn't memorable, though the English Dub was well done despite the story. Overall, Code:Realize wasn't a frustrating watch. Rather, it's another run-in-a-mill reverse harem.

As a devoted fan of the otome game (now on switch), I was very disappointed in this adaption. I know things are undeniably going to have to be cut to make one cohesive plotline when it comes to making otome anime, but there were just so many things left out or butchered that would\'ve greatly helped the plot and showcase to anime-onlys the depth of the characters to let the story really shine. ~Spoiler Free~Story:  5As it is nearly the same story as the...game, obviously that is good and unique. Being a steampunk English romance about a girl that can\'t touch those she loves is obviously very compelling. However there were fights omitted I\'m sure due to budget, deeper world-building plot lines skimmed over for times sake, and one character\'s last scene was drastically changed to give a better ""feel good"" send off. There were also bigger mystery reveals just randomly dropped like it was common knowledge or placed at the beginning of an episode like it wasn\'t the single biggest turning point for the main character, thereby butchering a big chunk of the overall story. There was also a big moment for the pairing they chose to cover, however instead of showing it properly cut it down to just be an image for the ending. I couldn\'t believe they did that, it\'s one of the biggest moments in the whole game. Overall just messy, underwhelming, and nowhere as good as it could have been but I guess it gets the job done.Art: 3Sometimes, it\'s pretty. Other times they look like slender man. Opening and ending obviously showed a lack of budget, again proven by the poor cgi that reveals itself later on. There was also a scene where a character falls and it\'s supposed to be all scary that they could be dying, but the animation is so poor it looks like they cut around their body and literally just click and dragged the drawing down the screen. I couldn\'t believe that was left in and accepted as is. To their credit, I did keep replaying it because I couldn\'t stop laughing at the sight of it.Sound: 6No complaints with sound quality, though the song choices and OST were reallyyyy lacking, especially compared to the soundtrack of the game which is so unapologetically itself and memorable. Voice acting was great, but that was expected as they\'re the same seiyuus as the game. So, it was fine.Character: 2This is the part that really grinds my gears. Due to their need to try and show a little bit of each character but only having 12 episodes (+ OVA), you\'re just left wanting more. I feel they could\'ve absolutely gone more in depth especially with Van Helsing, Saint Germain, Frankenstein, and the Queen. But the worst part I think, was how Cardia\'s development got practically halved compared to the game. She has basically no personality here besides being nice and sad. She feels like your run of the mill otome main character when in game she is meant to just be a clean slate of a person, slowly learning to smile and figure out who she is as an individual. In game, she often has moments of strength, self-sacrificing, and humor. She even learns how to be selfish and calls Lupin a troublemaker, (something this cardboard cut out of Cardia would never do), showing their bond and understanding. But even here where they pushed aside everything else for their relationship, it feels forced and immediate with no build or clear show of their feelings or how we got from point A to point B. It all just makes no sense to me on the decisions while putting this show together because as any dating sim gamer would know, the romance is all about the characters and their slow building bonds.Enjoyment & Overall: 3Of course I was able to somewhat get through this anime with sheer nostalgia of the love I have for the source material, so I can\'t say I absolutely hated it. But I\'m just disappointed because anime is really for seeing the works you love come to life before your eyes, and I was left wanting to go back to one of my saves just so I can hear the OST and read the story properly. And to be fair that\'s probably why this was made, to draw an even bigger crowd to buying the game. But I think it more so hurt than helped, and was a waste of everyone\'s time. What\'s the point of adapting a story if you\'ll only give/be able to give it low quality visuals and music as well as cut down the story that made it so special in the first place?So again, I\'d strongly recommend if you happen to find this show somehow and come by this review, I vehemently suggest you skip and instead go for the game.

I liked the overall story, thought it was unique and could have been explored more, I'm excited to buy the game to experience the full story. I would say its fine to pass the time with as a romance anime. It had an ending which is a big plus for me although be it a bit convenient. 6/10"", 'For someone who already played the Code:Realize games on PS VITA, i have mixed feelings with the anime.PS. This will be a short review only. no in-depth explanations whatsoever. just my very own opinion.Anyway, as i have said, i have mixed feelings with the anime. As for someone who finished playing the game on PS VITA, i recommend only to watch this anime for those who already played the game as the anime has skipped so many things from the FIRST game. and that is to be expected because of the time frame of each events on the game. it will be too long for...it to fit for only 12 episodes.BUT, if really are a fan of reverse harem, you can at least watch it, just dont expect too much.I DID enjoy the anime but it lacks the sense of understanding every characters because it was rushed due to having only 12 episodes.Cardia is a really good heroine and i like her character. not like your typical damsel in distress. And the bachelors? well, they really are much better drawn in the games (TBH). it to fit for only 12 episodes.BUT, if really are a fan of reverse harem, you can at least watch it, just dont expect too much.I DID enjoy the anime but it lacks the sense of understanding every characters because it was rushed due to having only 12 episodes.Cardia is a really good heroine and i like her character. not like your typical damsel in distress. And the bachelors? well, they really are much better drawn in the games (TBH).', ""YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS ANIME.SPOILERS ALERT:I will try to keep them to the minimum without involving any actual details and explanations, but the main plot is written down. You will kinda find them in the CHARACTER and STORY parts of the review.It's so underrated, I can't believe now that I watched it. I would recommend it for art, sound, and interesting characters.ART:I love the design of the characters and the clothes they wear....The animation is pretty and nicely done through most of the anime.Dresses and suits are so pretty and detailed.The houses and the city too.Everything is designed with little gorgeous details.Here and there you will see some scenes (static scenes) where the characters look like they draw them in the last 5min.Though it did happen just a few times and you can see that in every anime, especially one with so many details to character design.That would be the only thing that I didn't like about art.The dog's leg is so pretty and I definitely did not expect to see soo much effort put in such a small detail.SOUND:I think they did a good job with their voices and songs. They even added a lullaby.CHARACTERS:All of the men show some unique, interesting personalities.For the main heroine, she is pretty and she brings their personalities to shine through the story. That's why I recommend you to watch the OVA too after the anime, it's the best.She is kinda boring character. I mean, she knows how to defend herself and she can do things herself which is great because usually, that's not the case.She is just too kind and obedient. Like she has personality, but because of the others, it's not really showing that much.I would prefer something more sarcastic and straightforward as Ani Inako from Damepri Anime Caravan.I think that kind of personality would bring much more fun and life to the story.I do understand why she is as she is in the beginning, but later, I think they could have changed it.STORY:I tried to make the review long enough so that you can read about art and sound without any spoilers for the story or main plot.It's a really unique way of representing a basic plot that you can find everywhere - the main heroine, pretty boys around her, destroying/saving the world.She is not a classic helpless idiotic heroine wich is refreshing.She actually can walk and do things by herself. Of course, she needed to be saved, etc, but it was pretty nice.I personally loved the whole anime, though I have to say that the last part was a kinda basic story in saving a heroine and saving the world plot, it was done in such a great way.The idea of a thief as a hero is really nice. It remained me of some movies with thieves and magicians.Overall I enjoyed watching this anime because of its pretty art and unique, interesting way of bringing a romance, world-saving story.I would recommend watching OVA too because I find it may be the best episode of the whole anime, but to understand it you need to watch the anime first.
