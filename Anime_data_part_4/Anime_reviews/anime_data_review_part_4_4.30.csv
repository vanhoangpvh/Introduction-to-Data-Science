Ginga Senpuu Braiger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4240/Ginga_Senpuu_Braiger,"['EDIT 12/23/2022: After being wrong for many years, Braiger actually has an ITALIAN dub! If you speak the language I highly recommend you check it out, the opening and endings are wonderful.It seems like someone should finally write a review for this hidden gem of an anime. I don\'t exactly remember how I came about finding it or even who recommended it to me but I was extremely glad to have sat through it. During my initial viewing, the entire series was not subbed in English, only up to 37 or 36 I believe, the last couple of episodes being a multi part finale to...bring it all together. I had to watch the final episodes in Portuguese, a language I know not a single word of, but this didn\'t hamper my viewing experience. I highly suggest those who speak Portuguese try to find the Portuguese dub as both the ending and opening are entirely different songs that are just as good as the original Japanese versions. EDIT 12/23/2022 After years of being incorrect, I came to realize it was actually the ITALIAN dub of the show. My point still stands though, please check out the Italian dub if that is your native language! It is still a very unique experience I could only vaguely understand what was going on during the finale but even with only a vague understanding I still loved my journey up until the point. Fast forward years later and the last couple of episodes are finally subbed. My love for it never changed and my misunderstandings were cleared up. But enough of this preamble, onto the actual review!Story 9/10:While I tend to be pretty lenient on anime stories of this time period, Braiger still surpassed my expectations. Don\'t go in expecting any masterpiece of storytelling or that equal to those of a literary great because you most certainly won\'t get that. What you will get is an episodic story for a majority of the series until it eventually gets into a much tightly focused story about stopping a space madman. I tend to have issues with episodic animes in general as they either work really well or just entirely fail. What works for one genre doesn\'t exactly work for another, but Braiger is able to pull it off without ever making the viewer feel bored. It is your typical ""monster of the week"" affair where the titular mech always make an appearance by the end of the episode to save the day. Where it shines though is that everyone of the main characters gets their own episode, by which I mean we get a deeper insight into why they are the way they are as well as their weaknesses and history. This honestly saves the story from getting boring as even the smallest amount of depth leads to a more fleshed out world. In essence J9 are just a bunch of mercenaries for hire who help people from all walks of life solve problems. Their price isn\'t cheap but they do help those that are in dire need of help for either financial or even personal reasons. Nothing inherently groundbreaking but it makes for interesting stories and situations.Art 8/10:Not much to talk about here as the art is what you would expect of the time period, though I do not remember seeing any egregiously awful frames or perspective issues so it gets a high praise for me. If you like this era of art then you will love it, if you like more newer/recent anime then it probably won\'t be your cup of tea though it shouldn\'t look too awful in comparison.Sound 10/10:The soundtrack has no reason to be as good as it is! It is just pure 80\'s music through and through and it is not ashamed to show it. It touches upon the popular genres of the time, so if you are a fan of such a decade you will feel right at home. Both the Opening and Ending themes are undeniably catchy and after a few episodes you will be singing right along, the final ending is my favorite though. The music always feels appropriate and fun, but also campy enough to remind you of how silly it is at times.Character 8/10:Despite me loving the entire cast and every re-occurring character in the show, they aren\'t inherently anything special. If you have watched more recent anime they fit pretty well into cliches such as  ""cold and aloof"" type, ""attractive and promiscuous"" type and of course the staple ""cuteness for the sake of cuteness"" type. But that doesn\'t mean they don\'t occasionally break the mold and act out of their element. While not very often, the colorful cast of characters show their diversity in decision making and reactions. Personally, design wise everyone is pretty memorable but by the end of the show I doubt any of them will make your ""Favorite anime characters of all time"" list. Braiger itself even has a bit of a personality if you keep a close enough eye out.Enjoyment 9/10:It is just a fun anime, plain and simple. It is a fun filled adventure from episode 1 all the way to episode 39. The show itself also isn\'t afraid to get a bit more mature at times which definitely surprised me at times. Another aspect of the show I enjoyed is how it explained the ""Super Robot"" qualities of Braiger itself, bringing a bit of science into it and how it is able to transform across three different forms. I cannot say how accurate it is but it definitely feels believable enough that you could see it happening. It also doesn\'t feel condescending when offering an explanation for things, respecting the viewers intelligence, which is always nice.Overall 9/10:A must watch for mecha fans, by all means it is a wonderfully done series that seems to have flew under everyone\'s radar. If you are a fan of older anime I also give it a strong recommendation, though your enjoyment may vary depending on your tastes. For newer and more recent fans of anime I cannot recommend it very much but at least check out the Opening and Ending, they are great pieces of music.  ABAYO! bring it all together.

Gurazeni Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37990/Gurazeni_Season_2,"[""Gurazeni's first season went largely undernoticed and underappreciated, but it was a refreshing slice-of-life take on baseball with a likeable cast and very limited production qualities. With a break lasting only a single season, Gurazeni is back to...mainly do the same thing again, but ever so slightly better.Production-wise, absolutely nothing changed. It's all passable but decent at best, including the CGI used for the (quite infrequent) action cuts during the baseball games, mainly Bonda's pitching. Even more telling is the fact that both the OP and ED have been recycled from the first season, albeit with different visuals. Now both of the songs are quite...nice, but it goes to show that Gurazeni doesn't exactly have any resources to spare. Anyone making it past the first season will likely not mind that too much, but don't expect improvements.That being said, story-wise Gurazeni only got better. While the first season perfectly got by with workplace slice-of-life, the second season builds on that and gives some payoff, though without any excessive fanfare or drama. Most characters from the first season make a return to build on their previous appearances, and usually they go a little deeper into the specific topic, usually regarding their future as athletes. Special notion should go to Yuki, Bonda's love interest that took up the entirety of season 1's ED despite only appearing in the final episode. This time around she's got a far larger role, and her perspective as an outsider is even cleverly used against Bonda's insider look a few times. On top of that she is cute as all hell.In truth, Gurazeni season 2 really is just more of the same. It's a realistic look at the lives of athletes operating within a giant mechanism called baseball, with specific attention towards the monetary goals of it's cogs. It's neither overly optimistic or too cynical, and ultimately gets by on the down-to-earth and likeable cast. In a landscape filled with stories in which the athletes are heroes and their sport nothing less than their life, Gurazeni is absolutely a fresh, almost unique anime. nice, but it goes to show that Gurazeni doesn't exactly have any resources to spare.

There are plenty of non-sports fans who actually enjoy sports anime. The reason being that those shows are closer to anime than they are to the sport they are portraying in the story. Gurazeni does not follow that pattern. It\'s a sports anime that portrays the sport as close to real as one can in the medium.Story:The story follows a middle relief pitcher in a Japanese baseball league modeled after Japan\'s NPB. He plays for a team stylized after the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, with many other teams being...modeled after other real teams in the NPB. The main point of the story is about the pitcher\'s pursuit of that big payday. His understanding that he must make as much money as he can playing baseball fuels his performance. This creates a very realistic story about a guy just trying to get what he can before his luck runs out. The story really caught me, as it wasn\'t the typical chase for glory, but the chase for stability. It mirrors how baseball works in real life, where the non-star players basically have to skate on thin ice 24/7, knowing that a few bad games can cost them their job. It\'s really captivatingArt:The show isn\'t extremely impressive for the most part. It\'s mostly standard 2D animation, though they do use 3D animation during action scene on the field and with the usage of vehicles. There\'s nothing I would call ""bad"" from an art standpoint.Sound:The theme songs for this show are actually really catchy. The opening theme is called Merigo by Cypress Ueno to Robert Yoshino. The ending theme is called Shadow Monster by Asako Toki. Both songs can easily get stuck in your head after hearing them enough, and are not in any way annoying. The BGM wasn\'t super noticeable, but didn\'t suck either.Character:The main character, Natsunosuke, is a very great main character. He\'s not you typical anime protagonist with a hero streak. He\'s just a regular, everyday normal guy who just happens to play baseball. He has his insecurities in regards to his standing with his team, and is constantly thinking about the possibility that his baseball career could come to an end. This makes him very realistic and relatable. They was his friends and teammates are portrayed is also hyper-realistic. The struggles they all deal with in regards to their professional careers is what helps drive the show when it\'s not focused on Natsunosuke.Enjoyment:This show never felt overwhelming or over-dramatic. Each episode had a great story that helped you dive deeper into the lives of Natsunosuke and his teammates. The situations portrayed covered many topics of his life, and helped make the show feel diverse and alive. It\'s the easiest-to-watch sports anime I\'ve ever seen.Overall:It\'s the best sports anime I\'ve ever watched. This show does not have a single anime bone in it\'s body. It\'s all about the game. No long anime speeches. No fundamental moves with fancy names. No over-the-top reactions. Just the realistic portrayal of a middle reliever trying to get that bag before his career ends.

It's just about life of medium mc who is pro baseball player in Japan ). Compared to strong willed sport animes, Gurazeni is heart healing ones.Bondo injured in end of season. After 4 months fully healing he climbs back to major. Some of his teammates ends their dream like bugs. That could be harsh if art were realistic. But Gurazeni's art kinda calms me. They just shows sad ending story with very calming animations. Also in this sequel romance punch lines were really good. They really enjoyed me...:3.They didn't changed op and ed's theme song. They just changed background video. That was really good choice. I really liked that.Character developments was great. New characters with well roles in this season.I can't type lot of this anime cause it's anime that you have to watch it and feel. btw really enjoyed and satisfied Gurazeni season 2.Hoping there's season 3 in 2019. :3.They didn't changed op and ed's theme song.

Fireball Charming,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10348/Fireball_Charming,"[""Story: 7there's really nothing to work off of here given that each episode of this anime is only a minute long, and that the review has only watched the first episode of the series. So for the story I will review the premise.A sleek, shiny, (sexy... for me) white female robot of royal descent and her partner in comedy, a large four legged spider like robot with a red eye, colored yellow which would make anyone think that it belongs in a construction site.Very nice base to start building off of. But I'm currently not expecting anything more that short comedy skits you see in...the commercial breaks.Art: 10The art explains completely why it's only a minute long. It shows that much money and effort went into making this anime sex for the eyes. Animation, lighting, art, it's all there in 3-D CG. Reminds me of Cat Shit One.Sound: 8The BG music is great, Voice acting is kickass, the little robotic sounds (whirring and clanking) were well done.Character:8The designs are excellent, although generic, the personality of each of the characters makes them completely unique despite their physical appearance. You can tell each and every movement of the robots were carefully thought out and that really adds to their character.Enjoyment: 9This is REALLY easy to enjoy. Gets right to the point, smart on the jokes and the best thing and the worst thing at the same time is that it's only a minute long. you can rewatch it over and over, savoring the art and animation, catching little details that you've missed the last time, some parts even get addicting to some level. You can enjoy as many times as you want without investing too much time.And of course it sucks cause it's not longer. this kind of quality takes time to make so i guess that's something to deal with.Overall: 9Now ANYONE will be able to watch and like this. Why? Because it's a minute long and simple enough to cater to watchers of various individual tastes. This is a must watch! short but hella good, it's a bargain deal you can't miss. the commercial breaks.Art: 10The art explains completely why it's only a minute long.

Because it's just that good. Most writers start off with a great concept. It's unique, it's captivating and it's ripe for the picking. But they just don't know how to use it, and you get a mess of something that should have been fantastic(this review was spurred on by that regret from SAO). And in my opinion, Fireball Charming is the perfect example of how not to make a mess of that idea, even if it's a not...so great idea to begin with. In simply 2 minutes of comedy and wonderful scriptwork, Fireball Charming can convey nearly any emotion in any way, and leave you wanting more.Story:Through the past millennium, robots and humans have evolved to a point of separation, and have eventually declared war on each other because they can no longer coexist. In the middle of this battle is the Tempest Tower, essentially a robotic Tower of Babyl, where the great robot duchess Drossel Von Flugel and her servant, Gedächtnis reside, weathering the ongoing war and attempting to uncover the past through ancient pieces of human and robot technology. The best part? This all plays the background to a much simpler and lighter comedy. Essentially, you get slice of life comedy with 2 clueless robots and the occasional guest. Some people may be turned off by this decision, but it works amazingly, it manages to be deep yet superficial at the same time. An air of absurdity accompanies every joke, the feeling that greater things are at stake, but then you realize, these are robots, which live forever and have no need for a sense of urgency.Art:It’s CGI Anime. Take of it what you will, but while the original Fireball was mediocre even at the time of its release, Fireball Charming is a vast improvement. Visual flourishes are everywhere and the environment of the Tempest Tower has a serene beauty accomplished only from its massive size and repetitive nature.Sound:Because each episode is less than 2 minutes long, you won’t ever be hearing more than the main 10 second theme. But it’s a nice short tune and actually surprisingly memorable. The robotic sounds are a bit stock-effect sounding but they work. The voices are great, but the superior part is the way that the voice actors speak in a nonstop, fast stream of words. Robots like Drossel and Gedächtnis do not need to spend the time a human would analyzing each other’s speech and considering a reply, they talk immediately after each other, as quickly as a computer can process. Absolutely perfect.Character:Here is where Fireball Charming excels the most. Despite having only 2 main characters, and a small cast of random visitors, each character is memorable and enjoyable. Somehow, these robots are just as lifelike as humans. Drossel seems to be your typical snooty 14 year old anime princess, yet she’s got an entire range of unexpected personalities and emotions that are surprisingly consistent for her character. Gedächtnis, who acts as her loyal and often abused elderly servant, is the ground for Drossel’s sanity and the one who explains the outside world. Both are immensely charming(no pun intended) and truly great.Enjoyment:The comedy in Fireball Charming is top notch. The original Fireball had excellent puns, wordplay and irony that made it an intellectual comedy that could still make one laugh out loud. Fireball Charming has added a range of slapstick to the mixture, without lowering the overall level of intelligence. The polar opposite ends of comedy go hand in hand in a way you’ll never have thought possible. The banters between Gedächtnis and Drossel are easily the most memorable duo lines made in anime and every word has been painstakingly arranged for maximum comedic relief. Make sure you get good subs, because they will make a major difference if you don’t speak Japanese.Overall:A true masterpiece. Don’t let the Disney production tag, short run time or CGI aspects fool you. This series is a wonderful gem of comedy that everyone should watch. And with the small episode lengths, you’ll only be wasting 30 minutes of your life for a whole season instead of 12 hours. Each bite sized episode is small but brimming with flavor and personality, one can only hope Disney will treat us to another season sometime soon. so great idea to begin with.

The anime was created by Jinni’s Animation Studios in collaboration with Disney Japan and aired in 2011.Actually this is not the first time that this happens; in fact in 2008 the same collaboration produced Fireball a series of shorts that is the sequel of Fireball Charming.STORY: 7At this point in a normal review you will get at least a synopsis of the plot, the problem here is that said plot doesn’t really exist. Although in both Fireball and Fireball Charming some context is provided...Fireball Charming is set in a distant...future where robots and humans are at war with each other and feature the duchess Drossel von Flügel a female humanoid robot and Gedächtnis a robot that is her servant and guardian.  The characters never leave the huge mansion where they live so you will rarely see the outside.As I said before there is no real plot, the episodes are small random comedy skits that are well thought and beautifully executed.I will assure you that you will laugh at some of the jokes.ART & ANIMATION: 10Fireball Charming is entirely done using CGI like its predecessor Fireball. Anime that are 100% CGI are rarely good and this one is an example of that small group.In 2011 this was probably the best 3D anime produced with Cat Shit One as a close second, and even for today standards Fireball Charming is a beautiful anime.If you focus on the graphics and animations you will note a lot of minute details in the 3D models, especially notable on Drossel, such as the arms and legs joints that accurately modeled and move appropriately based on the pose.Drossel’s random gestures are hypnotizing to watch thanks to beautiful animations and help accentuating the feel that the robot is alive.SOUND: 7The music in the anime good, but it’s nothing special in my opinion. The sound effects on the robot movements are good and noticeable.  The voice acting is spot on, to get characters that feel alive you need: good voice acting, good animation and art and an interesting personality so far we are two out of three.CHARCTERS: 8Finally the characters, probably the most important part of this anime, as said before we have two main characters lets start analyze Drossel first.You can think of Drossel as the star of the show, she act like a spoiled princess that does what she wants. Usually she runs the gags and sometimes she seems aware of the viewer. Even if she doesn’t speak her character is characterize by random movements and strange poses.Gedächtnis is the servant and guardian that acts like an older person and tries to contain Drossel, without him some of the jokes would not exist.ENJOYMENT: 9The jokes are good and easy to laugh at, since the episodes are short it’s almost impossible to grow tired of the characters and after the last episode you will probably want more.OVERALL: 8In my opinion this is a must watch, if you are not sure look at it this way, even if you don’t like it you will not “waste” a lot of time, so I will recommend to watch it.On a final in my opinion you should watch Fireball Charming first and then Fireball because in the chronological order you will miss additional quotes that at first (in Fireball) don’t make sense. future where robots and humans are at war with each other and feature the duchess Drossel von Flügel a female humanoid robot and Gedächtnis a robot that is her servant and guardian.

Honoo no Alpenrose: Judy & Randy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3807/Honoo_no_Alpenrose__Judy___Randy,"[""Honoo no Alpenrose is a fairly predictable and by the numbers World Masterpiece Theater clone but that's not necessarily a bad thing since those shows were always pure , Had likeable characters and good moral lessons and this show is no different . I found myself invested in the first half of the story as the struggles the main couple faces and their search for answers amidst the WW2 setting were really interesting . Unfortunately the quality of this anime takes a massive nosedive after Judy resolves the situation at her homeBefore that the only downside to me was the amount of times they managed...to escape from the comically over the top and almost Looney Tunes at times Nazi army because it clashed hard with how they portrayed them outside of those occasions . There's also 2-3 episodes that felt like nothing but filler but I would be able to overlook both problems if the final stretch didn't suck so badlyBeyond the show ending abruptly and never giving a proper send off to many of it's side characters , From out of nowhere a previous rather uninspired villain returns for no reason with a completely new motivation for his actions thus making the earlier conclusion in a previous episode feel utterly meaningless . Worst of all he gets a good ending despite never truly having a change of heart and only stopping because his plans were foiledThe first half and a bit more is worth it but the rest is just really bad with very few highlights like Tarantula for example .

If Alpenrose have been a 100 episodes...anime I think it would have been a solid 9! Because the length of the episodes gives no room to do anything and the writers fill each episode with a new twist without even trying to solve the rest. Which ended up by solving everything through luck. Can you imagine how almost EVERYTHING that happens is pure luck! Characters get their motivations and dreams through luck too.They always get away from danger through luck. They go out in broad daylight without wearing anytype of disguise and somwhow they are never captured even though they have posters with their face on all around cities!Characters: 7/10+ Here is the part where I I become biased. The characters are flipflop cookie cutter flat but I don't know why they are LOVABLE! I love all the gang and even the side characters thatshow up once or twice for a plot device and then disappear for internity.. like if they meant nothing just off with them and make more screentime to develop the stuffed plot!- ON THE OTHER SIDE, when it comes to villains it's not the case at all. One of the biggest fails in the anime is Villains. They are wacky, cocky, good for nothing, disgusting, and inconsistent.Art: 9/10+ The art is really beautiful! Most of the characters have beautiful looks and hair! Always dressed neatly and nice. As of all the old classics Alpenrose's art is one of my favorites! It really ages well and the animation isn't as bad considering the age of it. It's obviously the main reason I rated the show so high.Enjoyment: 6/10+ The art and characters are a joy if you're into old anime shoujos.+ the music was really nice and captivating. I loved the flute piece that Laundi and Judi play. Love the Alpeenrose~Alpenrose song, and of course whenever Leon plays anything.- The stuffed undeveloped plot that makes it seem ss if the episodes have been truncated from 1.5 hours to 20min is somewhat hard to sit through.- The discomfort we are left to feel after knowing Judi is 12 or younger with all the things that she goes through and does!Recommend: Yes, if you're into old shoujo classic and appreciate the 80s art,  want to enjoy the good music, and if you don't mind to fill in the gaps inbetween episodes.No, if you want a worthy classic old shoujo, there are far better ones. anime I think it would have been a solid 9!

Let me repeat: NINETEEN EIGHTY-FIVE. Graphically, comparing this show to anything contemporary to the time of writing this review would be unfair, ye? So I'm going to compare it with other shows from around this time: Macross, Gundam, etc. Graphically, this show is ok. It's in fact got its own charm for what it is and actually...a little reminiscent of disney cartoons. Yes, graphically, this show will remind you of disney... A LOT.A stern warning on the graphics: This show takes place on the start of World War 2. If you are sensitive to controversial symbolism, the symbols used by a good deal of the villains might put you off. I will note that the whole goal of pretty much all of the protagonists is to resist them though.Sound wise, this aspect does not stand out either. It's rather forgettable unless you like the style of music offered here (classical, the  more bland kind, not the kind with dramatized flairs). Alpenrose is pretty much the only track that is worth noting but keep in mind how many times this tune plays throughout the show. It's not likely you will sing it or want to listen to it after the show's over though.Now the plot and characters...I'm going to start by noting that there is something charming about the main couple. Jeudi and Lundi (or Judy and Randi, depending on who's subbing it) are cute together. This is also all there is to them. This show has a lot of tropes precisely because it is old. The characters do not really grow either, they basically get chased their whole screentime.However, as simple/cliche as they are, they DO have their charm. This is further enhanced by the side characters, some of whom evolve their morals, others realize their feelings. Some never really grow but there are enough that do that all the story arcs have some sort of charm to them to keep you watching.The main issue in the story is that, the main couple being chased/hunted by various villains is also more or less all there is to the story. The staff totally did try to spice this up and add more depth and complexity; this is obvious given how the show could have ended on episode 11 or 12 but dragged on all the way to 20. However, given the chase-run nature of the premise, the story is basically stuck having to tell everything in separate arcs, some of which do not really have enough depth on their own to be interesting.That said, the show did more or less wrap up all its loose ends and if you can overlook the potentially offensive symbolism from the villains, this show has the charm of your typical disney princess movie. a little reminiscent of disney cartoons.

Hikari to Mizu no Daphne,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1082/Hikari_to_Mizu_no_Daphne,"['Daphne in the Brilliant Blue is really a hidden treasure amongst anime. This series was a pure enjoyment, from beginning to end. So on to the review...Story! Like the title suggests everything in this anime revolves around the sea. In (not so) distant future people are living in mega-hi-tech cities that resurfaced from the ocean floor when Earth recuperated from pollution and could once more sustain life on the surface. In one of this cities live our main protagonist Maia Mizuki who has a case of amnesia and as story unfolds begins a quest for discovering her past. She and her female friends trough series...of adventures finally come to the conclusion of the main plot which also as of near everything in the series has to do with the sea. It\'s not by any means revolutionary plot but it grows on you and is spiced with great humor and funny situations like those deja vu gags that always make you smile!Characters! Main characters are females, the part of the organisation called ""The Nereids"" (nymphs of the sea from Greek mythology-name suits them well indeed) which are somewhat rather stereotypical in characterization but all for the better! E. g. Maia is a sweet and nice girl next door type who doesn\'t really enjoy bullets flying over hear, on the other hand Gloria is that Revy type: shoot first and ask questions later type and also case of pathological materialist... It is that different characters of our female heroines and their contrasts that produce those great comedy moments and plot twists! Maybe it\'s overdone sometimes but it\'s never like that it becomes a nuisance!Art! I could easily call it an eye candy! Everything is done very well with fluid animations and what\'s easily a ""trademark"" of the series are beautiful paysages: palms, vast skylines, cities, sunsets and of course brilliant sea and its depths! It gives that nice Seychelles/Balearic touch to it! I must make notice of outfits that our heroins wear which are rather hmmm ""provocative"" showing curves and are in my opinion to please more a male audience:) Also there are nice little details throughout the series which sometimes serve as a tribute. Gloria is e. g. wielding a PSG1 sniper rifle and a SOCOM gun which is tribute to MGS I believe-really nice to see those and other well implemented remarks and details! And in the end the whole title of the series is symbolical and has connection to the plot (meaning of Daphne).Music/Sound! Koh Otani! Need I say more! Those who are acquainted and love his work shouldn\'t miss this one! Beautiful soundtrack all round with truly excellent main theme! This has my highest recommendations!Conclusion/Enjoyment! Daphne in the Brilliant blue was a great show! Beautiful presentation, funny moments, emotive and climatic ending, nice details, exceptional music score...

Just from looking at the art that is attached to this you will see women barely...clothed and say Oh its gonna be some stupid ecchi show with very little story well. In factThe story is decent not the best, it starts to pick up towards the end however the beginning sets the entire ending up to be a good one. Just to say i did enjoy this great character developments along every episode the twists and turns of the main protagonist. the last 4-5 episodes are very good and yeah it might have been a little predictable but its okay, it was a heartwarming story that just made me feel good after seeing all the episodes.The art was fair i thought nothing great just about as average as you could get so if you are big into how it looks this isnt for you, its got an old school feel to it so if you like bebop, GTO style art then you might want to check this out.Sound was another meh not great not bad just luke warm i thought, not really much to say. The op was good the Ed was not, but sound is not a big deal breaker for me but for some this might be the deal breaker.characters, what to say about them..... Great, honestly the character were lovable, violent, strong, weak, you basically had every type of character you could have thought of in this anime. yeah they are wearing almost nothing during there mission\'s but i enjoyed it, i mean it wasnt like there boobs were bouncing around or anything like that.my enjoyment was about a 7 give or take some decimal points depending how far along the anime was. when i sat back and added everything up my overall score would be a 7 this should get more looks than what it has the score well lets say it sould be about a 7.5 not in the 6\'s i would almost guarantee people didnt even finish this and just gave it a 2 or 3 just because they can starch at it and say ""it was a crappy fanservice show"" when in fact it wasnt.IF you like police work, bounty hunter types of anime mixed in with some nice female characters, and a pretty decent story with some funny situations you should check this out. clothed and say Oh its gonna be some stupid ecchi show with very little story well.

I tried watching it all but near the end it just got too painful to watch:(', 'Speaking of the opening theme song sequence, I might as well talk about it right now to get it out of the way. It is a very standard J-Pop song with an aqua-style bubbly underwater tone and it is listenable for a while and I didn’t have the need to skip over the opening song and the ending theme has more of a softer tone that does go along with the show’s more serious episodes but kind of distract it from its’ comedic episodes and the show does often focus on the comedic elements in the first half but delve into the main storyline in...the second half.The plot starts off In the future, water has covered much of the Earth due to the effects of global warming, leaving the human race to live on neighboring floating cities.The orphaned Maia Mizuki, 15, just graduated from middle school and has already applied for employment in the elite Ocean Agency, part of the futuristic world government. Only the best, most intelligent, and physically fit students are eligible for admission. She was set to become one of the few people but unfortunately it all falls apart as she fails her entrance exams despite her high grades.Okay, I always wonder why do anime like this got to have the main character failing an entrance exam. I feel like I seen this situation one too many times and that does gets a little old there.Oh yeah, it gets worse. She also gets evicted from her house, pick-pocketed and taken hostage (which is one of the running gags of the show) and eventually she is saved by an unorthodox help-for-hire organization called Nereids and ended up joining them, taking jobs from capturing wanted criminals to chasing stray cats.Here’s a little info on the rest of the Nereids crew:Rena Honjo (the one in Red) is the de facto leader of the Kamchatka branch of Nereids. She is capable and elegant when doing her business and uses her sharp instincts to know the weaknesses of other people and she also seduces others for manipulation, weapon use and sometimes sex. However, she does come off cold at some times and one of the running gags involving her are deducting pay from salaries under the slightest pretext.Shizuka Hayama (the one with purple hair, glasses & busty physique) is the smart mechanic of the group who has a friendly and casual personality among the crew and is very trusting towards people (albeit on a later episode, she needs to know when not to trust anybody) and she has a very voracious appetite for food, as in the girl can eat and damn, she can eat. The flaw about her is that she can’t aim or shoot worth an s**t.Gloria (the blonde one) is the loud, spontaneous, tomboyish, and reckless trigger-happy marksman and weapons specialist.  She often clashes with Rena all because of deserting her on a past mission and occasionally bothers her about her pay although it has something to do with her being greedy with money, as in, if one coin dropped on the floor, she’ll get to it in a flash.Yu Park (the blue-haired one) is the silent, brooding, nihlistic, and a loner who specializes in being a strong fighter and hand-to-hand combat specialist, especially since most of the time I don’t feel worried for her since we all know she’s going to kick some ass. The best thing about her and Gloria being paired up on assignments is the fact that their pairing as boke and tsukkomi to each other is actually hilarious in my eyes.Other side characters include Tsutomu Hanaoka, the branch manager of Nereids but he is more of a pushover to the girls and especially towards his daughter; Tsukasa Takagi, Maia’s best friend who got accepted into the Ocean Agency despite having average grades and promises them both they would work with each other; Millie, Shizuka (and later Maia’s) friend, who’s a skilled race car driver inspired by her great-grandmother Ai Mayuzumi and of course, the Wong-Chang-Lee brothers with their sister May, which they are the only recurring criminals on the show who usually take Maia as hostage and their goal is to find the treasure of Elpida, which is the part of the subplot that happens midway that concerns Maia’s journey to retrieve a time capsule to find about her past.Now I got two questions about this series and the first one being:Why this show is called Daphne in the Brilliant Blue?The word, ""Daphne"", Greek for ""Laurel tree"", in the title refers to Maia\'s grandfather last words. ""Brilliant Blue"" refers to the fact that this is a world covered by water with almost no land. The world consists of vast oceans, a few islands, and floating cities.Okay, and also this question:What the hell is with those outfits they’re wearing?It looks like they’re nothing at all, especially from Rena & Shizuka and maybe Yu to an extent. Gloria’s choice wardrobe is well, not risqué, but still skimpy and Maia’s outfit……well, what do you say when a 15-year-old dress like this during her mission?But, seriously, it isn’t much of a problem because the show doesn’t always ogle at them dress like that nor does it get too in-your-face about them being dress like that. Its fan service but its tolerable and sometimes subtle fan service, which is actually sexier than just shoving it front and center and speaking of fan service, guess who did the animation for this series?Oh, hello, J.C. Staff, I haven’t heard you since a month ago and so far, this animation………is slightly better than their usual shtick of anime. It is very vibrant and bright with some fight scenes looking decently animated even from the opening sequence, although the second ending sequence does better in the animation than the first since it’s mostly a zoom-out picture of what I assume is Maia’s in the ocean floating.As for the voice acting of the English dub (yes, I watch the dub of this), it is an okay dub by veteran voice actresses Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Megan Hollingshead & Erika Weinstein. Carrie Savage was decent but the whole “cute/shy girl voice” does get a bit irritating and that is mostly Savage’s bread and butter in her earlier gigs. She’s still an okay voice actress but that shtick can wear out. Don’t believe me? Try watching the dub of another show she did by the same exact animation company that was distributed by a former anime distributing company.Also, there is only 24 episodes in the series and 2 bonus episodes on DVD release, which the episodes is mostly the comedic ones that have nothing to do with the plot.FINAL VERDICT: At times, this is a fairly good show with some decent comedic moments happening in between them with a subplot that doesn’t go underway until the near end of the series’ run. Characters are fairly decent and likable with some human-like and medium flaws and I did laugh at the funny moments throughout this. The fan service isn’t distracting or irritating but I did notice some and honestly, it didn’t stick out. But would I recommend this to you? Well, for those who want something that isn’t an ecchi-fest but still has a few fan service moments, this is it for you. the second half.The plot starts off In the future, water has covered much of the Earth due to the effects of global warming, leaving the human race to live on neighboring floating cities.The orphaned Maia Mizuki, 15, just graduated from middle school and has already applied for employment in the elite Ocean Agency, part of the futuristic world government.

Sadly this really isn't one of them.The art isn't that great but it's decent considering this anime is quite old. Although the ending credits are just stills from the manga with a very bland song.The story itself is terrible. It starts with a girl called Maia Mizuki trying to get a job at the elite Ocean Agency. Supposedly she is one of the most promising agents there and aces the exam, but gets rejected anyway. At the end of the first episode,...she then gets shot in the chest. But in the following second episode she is not only fine and fully recovered, but she appears to have no wound and hasn't even been to hospital. The rest of the story revolves around her working for the Nereirds (a group of awful women who do jobs...reluctantly and badly).The main problem with trying to enjoy this anime is that none of the characters are remotely likable. I had some symapthy with Maia in the beginning (although a bit confused as to how she was still alive) but she goes on to get kidnapped or knocked out in almost every episode, and basically has no use. So how she supposedly was excellent at the exam I don't know because she fails in every episode from there on.Rena is the leader of the Nereids but has no leader-like qualities. She is spiteful and bullying towards Maia for no reason, and is incredibly bitchy to pretty much every character. She is greedy and will only accept jobs that pay well. She's also a shameless slut who sleeps with random men.Shizuka seems nice at the start but ends up freeloading off Maia and others for free food. She is obsessed with food, never pays anyone back and also is a complete idiot. Don't accept drinks from strange men in seedy parts of town. That's obvious!Gloria is loud and obnoxious, and is also bullying towards Maia and any extra characters. She's also obsessed with money.Yu is probably the most likable character since she doesn't seem particularly greedy or bossy. But she's very quiet and never has a real backstory established.In fact, apart from Maia, none of the main characters are given a backstory. They are simply annoying just because.There's two main questions that I desperately wanted answered during this series. Firstly, who is Daphne? Secondly, why did Maia get rejected from the Ocean Agency. The answer to the first question is just ridiculous and very disappointing. The answer to the second and the mystery of Maia's past is finally revealed but considering you have to watch over 20 episodes of filler, it just feels frustrating to watch. she then gets shot in the chest.

This episodic format fits well with the series, for it's mainly just Nereids doing odd jobs and getting Maia out of trouble. The great story was probably good enough to turn this from an episodic to a serial anime, but in the end, I believe the choice was justified, giving the show the ability to basically have as many episodes as it wanted, while still remaining flexible enough to add in whatever kind of story they wanted. But that is just what I would expect from an episodic...show of this nature. However I would've maybe liked to see some more mini story arcs that lasted for at least 2 or 3 episodes just to ease up the monotony a bit.STORY / SETTING: (7.2)Up until the 20th episode, the story was just basically the cast saving people, and beating up bad guys. Clearly nothing that hasn't been done before, but some formulas just never get old. The mini-plots in each episode weren't super original or exciting, but it did the job. The idea of Maia having amnesia and forgetting her childhood could've been spread out a little more throughout the series as it was only really mentioned in eps. 11 and 12, and at the end. The mysterious figure made a few appearances though, which helped remind me that there was at least a little bit of story happening behind the scenes. The ending really took me by surprise though. The last four episodes were a real treat to watch. Everything was wrapped up very nicely, and the plot twist at the end utterly shocked me, and the way the truth was reveled was very nice indeed. I would've rated this section much lower if not for the epic conclusion. The setting was certainly intriguing, but it could've been utilized much better. The story and various episodes DID make a little use of the vast oceans, and floating cities, but they really should've squeezed a little more out of it, because there was still so much more more milk in the tank at the end of the series setting wise. Even still, the setting really did grab my attention, and is what made me want to watch this in the first place.CHARACTERS: (4.3)I would expect the characters in an episodic anime such as this to be varied, interesting, and to be able to synergize well with each other. Was this the case in this show? Well, kind of. Gloria, Yu, and Shizuka were well made, and I loved their designs and personalities. Rena and Maia on the other hand, not so much. Rena; despite being the leader of the group, we don't see her as often as we should, and when we do, she's sitting in an office yelling at her underlings. She has a good character, but it really wan't utilized well. And finally we get to Maia. The main character Maia was without a doubt the worst character in the whole show. I get the idea of intentionally creating the main character to be bland and uninteresting to make the other more unique characters shine that much brighter, but this tactic only works well in large-scale anime with a huge diverse cast like Hunter X Hunter or One Piece. I don't know if this is what the producers were going for but Maia is the most annoying, clueless, oblivious, and most air-headed character I've seen in a long time. For the entire show she's just moping around depressed over the tiniest thing, and then she gets herself into trouble for the 47th time, and the crew has to go save her again. The way she reacts to the little events in the series, and her use of language, and her portrayal of emotions just really makes me cringe. They could've used ANY character but her for the main. As far as supporting characters go, there was nothing to complain about. The trio (later a quartet) that kept kidnapping Maia every now and then were a fun, and interesting bunch, and the various staff at other Nereids branches and the Ocean Agency were good too.AUDIO / VISUAL: (6.2)The art was a solid pro throughout the series, and while the animation was only average, the art made up for it. Facial close ups looked really nice, and the style really helped to distinguish the characters from each other and bring out their best features. The music is about what you would expect from this kind of show. It was used tastefully, and although it didn't take precedence over the art, nor the animation during high action scenes, it helped add a nice sweet layer on top of things.OVERALL: (5.6)This show is a gem. A dull one. But still a gem. It could shine much brighter if only not for the horrible MC, and the lack of utilization of the otherwise brilliant setting. show of this nature.

I started watching Daphne as a mindless action/comedy.  To my shock and pleasant surprise, what started off as light fair (big guns + big tits), ended up being a smart, well thought out story with a lot of heart, depth, and enough plot-twists to keep you engaged all the way till the end.It does start out a bit slow and the ""uniforms"" are obviously over the top (which is why I couldn\'t give...it an overall 9/10) but i found myself actually laughing out loud which made me wanna come back for more.From the beginning, there\'s a slight tone of despair (or maybe ""abandonment"" is a better word) but is quickly bypassed with campy humor and the aforementioned ""uniforms"" paraded about.  Almost every main character has their own introductory episode and the series is set up fairly episodic with no real thread.But when the tone turns more serious as the lead character\'s history becomes the main story arc, the series truly starts to gain real traction.  Never leaving the humor too far behind, the emotional development, interesting plot-twists and smart writing won me over. What was also a nice surprise was that characters and events that seemed to have little importance in the beginning become major elements during the 3rd act.  So it\'s worth watching the whole thing through.It\'s  silly, smart, campy, action packed, and character driven.  By the end, you\'ll fall in love with the ladies of Nereids.Oh, and the music perfectly captures the playful atmosphere and emotional highs & lows.

First off, its a typical ecchi-harem anime and i use the word harem pretty loosely. Because after episode one the main character will be a trap. YES a trap (man dressing up...as a woman). If you don't feel comfortable watching that sort of thing please feel free to drop it. Because you're not missing much. Don't worry, everything will set itself out in episode one. Including the perverted old men trying to sneak ecchi pics of school girls as a running gag. All this stuff is all fine and dandy, but I thought traps usually gear toward a more female or FYG-type audience.Once the story layout is exposed, it's all downhill from here. Every episode has been done in other school SoL (slice of life) anime. And they're not even done very well in this show. But for what it's worth the girls are pretty cute and moe and it does a fairly decent chemistry between Hibiki and his/her students. You'll also pretty much guess how the ending will be from the start as well. But the path from start to finish, despite it being very cliche with a trap twist, isn't all THAT bad but it fairly decent at best.Another thing that's lacking in this show is the art quality. Which is kind of important in an ecchi/comedy/SoL/school/drama/romance show. You can tell it has a mediocre style artwork to it with over accentuating character outlines and very VERY simplistic school outfits. Its one of the worst school outfits i have ever seen in ANY show, period. It's a weird tank top/skirt compilation with this HUGE white sailor collar covering their shoulders. I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to be that huge.One thing this show does have going for itself is definitely the school girl characters. They're all cute and moe in their own way. And you actually feel sorry for some of their slice of life situations. It still doesn't help the fact that this show is very mediocre and and a lot of times just wrong (in 'funny' ways of course). Its obvious this show is drawing a male audience with all the ecchi, but at the same time its pulling a female audience by how a man has to adjust himself to a women's lifestyle. If that sounds like something you want to see give it a shot. But if you don't like mediocrity in your story or art work stay far away from this one. There are a lot of better ones out there. as a woman). If you don't feel comfortable watching that sort of thing please feel free to drop it. Because you're not missing much.

So without any further ado let us review.Story- Like I said the story in this was great, the ending was a real heart jerker, and the laughs I enjoyed were pretty genuine. The only thing that prevented it from getting a ten was some lack of substance and how short the series...was.Art- Okay yeah this series definitely lost points with me here mostly because everything was not well drawn. I understand that this series is kind of old but I have to draw a line somewhere.Sound- Okay I liked the voice actors in japanese and the voices really did match the characters; in terms of sound effects they did a decent job there too so yay good job.Character- Well for the important characters yes there was some development but there were sometimes where I just felt uneasy as to what a character was like...what I mean to say is either the character was as easy to read as a book or about as readable as Latin is speakableEnjoyment- I liked this series a lot it wasn't my first experience watching an anime that was at least roughly based around school life but it was definitely one of my more enjoyable experiences; it actually makes me expect great things from school life based animes unlike some series which will remain un-named cough cough super gals cough cough.Overall- If you like a heart warming kind of story and enjoy a little bit of drama here and there I suggest this series if not I'm not sure why else you would pick it up unless the aspect of a man cross dressing to get a job as a teacher is just your thing... was.Art- Okay yeah this series definitely lost points with me here mostly because everything was not well drawn.

Strawberry Eggs four years ago. It was one of my first forays into anime tinged with yuri and crossdressing, both elements that have become more popular in the years since. Now revisiting and finishing it, I feel a very strong appreciation for a show that tackles rarely handled topics such as reverse sexism and above all, what really matters when you fall in love with someone.Admittedly, Strawberry Eggs fails spectacularly as a comedy. The jokes are stale, the timing is terrible, and the visual gags are just lame. Its only existence in comedy seems to be to keep the...series light-hearted, because when it dives into drama, it tends to dive deep. No surprise given the premise involves a man who crossdresses to teach at a school that only allows women to teach falling in love with one of his female students. Barriers invoking melodrama include age, gender, and sexual orientation, as well as the negative stereotypes that men typically have to bear. These issues are handled quite delicately while both the teacher and his students, both operating under entirely wholesome premises, attempt to understand each other in an environment that breeds discrimination on unwholesome assumptions. The way these issues are tackled and resolved are Strawberry Eggs\'s true strength and with great fortune, is what it blossoms toward, especially in its incredibly impressive final stretch.The characters are also a mixed breed. No one really stands out besides Hibiki and Kuzuha, but everyone is a well-rounded character and no one is entirely a cliche. The characters, despite their lack of discernible personalities, never come across as fake... well, except the apartment patrons. They\'re a joke and have no real puprose or need for existence within the series.The art is decent, not necessarily pretty but certainly not ugly. I suppose ""tolerable"" would be the right word which is coincidentally (or not) appropriate for this series given its message.The voice work is impressive and passionate, especially Yuki Masuda as the female voice of Hibiki. However, the BGM and OP/ED accompaniments are beyond bland.In short, though looking rather uninspired and bland, Strawberry Eggs ultimately blossoms into something strong, thoughtful, and sincere. A real treat for series of this nature that proves in many ways that looks are not only deceiving, but also not what really matters.Overall, I give I My Me! Strawberry Eggs a 7 out of 10. series light-hearted, because when it dives into drama, it tends to dive deep.

But it doesn't bother and instead just has the most basic messages that could've been done. Even by 2001 standards it's downright primitive.Also that stuff takes a backseat in the mess of a love square that eventually ties back into another message about true love or something. The romantic subplot also has hilariously little interesting things to say despite trying it's hardest to be inspirational.The art was not very pleasant to look at. It almost gave a cursed feeling. I don't know how many...songs in the ost there are because I was hearing the same song over and over again.The characters are flat and Kuzuha's essentially a perfect angel. The mc has the level of personality of your average harem protagonist. It's not funny and very disorienting to watch. There's not even anything to make fun of, which would be a saving grace.Also I reeeaaally wasn't into the whole teacher-student romantic relationship it was pirating so hard. It was more creepy and disturbing more than anything else. Surprised very little reviews mentioned it.This show isn't a masterpiece. It's a strange, almost pretentious mess that wasted my time. I was disgusted, confused, annoyed, but I never smiled. How in the lord did I make it through this I don't even know. songs in the ost there are because I was hearing the same song over and over again.The characters are flat and Kuzuha's essentially a perfect angel.

How in the lord did I make it through this I don't even know."", '""Aiii Maiii Miiii Strawberry Egg"" is undoubtably, unashamedly aimed at those otakus that spend a lot of their time fantasising about unlikely, perverted romances. It doesn\'t bother trying to disguise this fact. The premises is a total farce: a newly qualified school teacher Hibiki Amawa wants to work at Seito Santomiya school, but there\'s just one problem: the school only hire female teachers because of the principal\'s dislike for men... and Hibiki is a man. So, in order to prove a point, Hibiki dresses up as a woman and is successfully recruited into the school. One of the female students Fuko Kuzuha soon falls in...love with him despite Hibiki\'s appearance as a female teacher... and yeah, things gets messy from there on. With more fan service and hackneyed breaking of taboos to shake a stick at, I really ought to have loathed this show with a passion.But I don\'t. Despite all its shortcomings, ""Strawberry Egg"" actually exhibits a charm that is typified by the warm, sunshine opening theme (something that reminds me a little of ""Fruits Basket""). But with the exception of a couple of episodes, this series is mostly predictable trash. And even in the episodes that are not pure trash, only a few moments truly shines out amidst the absurdity. The best example is probably the parents visit episode, when Hibiki, being a PE teacher, gets the parents to go on a run with their kids. The whole activity is hilariously bad - PE seemed like the only lesson of the day, as though there was nothing else to do; the runners were not told the route; people could just quit and go back whenever they felt like it; not to mention the idea that someone who\'s incredibly unathletic could just go and outlast the rest of the class through determination alone is totally unbelievable. It was clear that the whole thing is just a contrived set up for the scene at the end of the run. But when that scene came, I couldn\'t help but feel moved by it, even though everything leading up to it was so poorly thought through. There was another scene in the last episode, where Fuka gives a speech. Though the speech itself is terrible and the reactions predictable, again, I was touched by it.Perhaps the secret is in the two characters, Hibiki and Fuka, that the anime revolves around. Being the anime that it is, there is no shortage of thinly veiled excuse for fanservice moments and lecherous characters and their dubious activities, but through it all, Hibiki and Fuka both managed to pull off their roles rather well. It feels as if Hibiki genuinely has the welfare of the students in mind (unlike his lecherous flatmates), and Fuka also comes off as the sweet, caring individual that she\'s meant to be, perhaps due to some rather skillful voice acting. The only facet of her character that feels too cliched is the whole clumsy, constantly tripping routine, which is way too exaggerated and has been done far, far too many times already.Even though ""Strawberry Egg"" does have some subtle redeemable qualities, I really hesitate to recommend this as a genuinely good watch because, let\'s face it, it\'s not. It\'s a mostly manipulative show with a story progression that, more often than not, feels forced and shallow (something that\'s exemplified by the big ""twist"" at the end that made no sense). But it must have done something right, otherwise I would be treating it with a lot more distain that I am now. It may not offer anything intelligent to chew on, but it does provide some aesthetic pleasures. love with him despite Hibiki\'s appearance as a female teacher... and yeah, things gets messy from there on.

Strawberry Eggs.*SPOILER ALERT*At the beginning I was really put off by this anime, and I would be lying if I didn't say it was corny and trying very hard to be sentimental, which it did achieve to an extent. I think I would have liked it a lot more if they would have went with an innocence route and not put in the creepy fan-service. It is rather uncomfortable to see direct panty-shots and cleavage of fourteen-year-old girls.Even so, I decided to watch it any way due to the awesome concept...of an ambitious male youth cross-dressing as a female to become a teacher at a sexist woman's school. (Still kinda creepy, but...)It was interesting to see how this kid's viewed each other too. The girls had been brainwashed by the principle and vice-principle to hate men, and then the boys boycotting the school for gender-equality, because they were oppressed and forced to be the school janitors. The anime did express slight homophobia though, which I'm not happy about, but oh well.But the corniness dropped away as the anime progressed.  It was like a slap in the face when they discovered he wasn't a woman and actually Bra Man-san. I knew they would take it like they did. They assumed he was a filthy pervert. It was good they remembered him with appreciation at the very end there, though, and realized he wasn't. I actually really liked the ending. It ended appropriately and realistically. I hope him and Fuka will get together someday when she is older.the art wasn't that good. It really could have been better, but It's easy enough to adjust to. It's just that vintage style I guess.The voice acting was alright. I really liked how masculine the male lead's voice was. It made it funny when he used a female's voice. As for Fuka, her voice was incredibly annoying at the beginning because all the 'wahs' and 'uhs' she was making every time she stumbled made her sound like a baby, but I became used to it.I feel like the music could have been better, but it set a certain feel for the anime so it still worked. It was really pushing towards sentimental, especially the opening. It did work well at the emotional parts, though.As for characters, I think they could have fleshed them out more. Especially Fuka. They also didn't really touch much on the side characters. A few of them were just there.At first I really didn't like Fukae. He was a jerk to everyone he didn't like. And I didn't get why the Karate girl fell for him. When she tried to punch him out, he overpowered her and said she'd never be able to defeat him because she was a woman. Wtf? But he really redeemed himself in episode twelve, and showed a lot of emotion. I liked him after that.I didn't like Fuka at all at the beginning, but she grew on me. Sure she tried hard at everything, but I just didn't like how helpless and defenseless they made her. I feel like she would be the first one to die if zombie apocalypse happened. Even so, she was certainly not weak. She chose to speak up for Hibiki, in front of her entire school. It was also brave and sweet how she decided to stay in the burning building beside her unconscious teacher. That is an intense love.As for the Hibiki, the male lead, they made him a really good person. Caring about heart over body, comfortable enough in his masculinity to cross-dress, caring about his students, protecting them, etc. And he became the most popular teacher in his school because he was so awesome. It just really made me uncomfortable how he fell for innocent fourteen-year-old Fuka(even though his mind was in an innocent place most of the time, despite the fan-service-y world around him)Though, he knew it was an inappropriate love, and didn't go for her in the end, so that's good.And I really, really loved the land lady! Who knew she was actually a man!(?) She was a badass, and kept the two creepy perverts in line. She was so tiny, yet was probably the toughest character in the show. And she was amazing in her mecha motorcycle.Lastly, the principle was sexist and horrible, but the vice principle was worse. I hated her pathetic obsession over exposing Hibiki as a man, and their plot to drive all the boys out of the school.Overall, I liked this anime, and recommend it. It confronted concepts like gender and homophobia, and ended on a bitter-sweet note, It was a good anime, and so I give it a well-earned 7. of an ambitious male youth cross-dressing as a female to become a teacher at a sexist woman's school.

The series has certain foibles inherent in the premise. Ultimately, the character isn\'t ~*~actually~*~ trans, so a lot of what it has to say about trans people is oblique at best. It came off like they hadn\'t actually talked to a trans person before. Of course, """"this is a product of the time"""" to a degree and perhaps that is to be expected. I got similar vibes from the yuri element, which plays second-fiddle to the straight romances for most of the run and goes in uncomfortable directions by the end. No, I am not going to root for...the teacher and student to get together in a real world scenario, so please do not bother. Especially the premise requires a deferred anvil drop when she finds out the teacher is actually a man. I dreaded that day all the while I spent watching this and it was not great when it happened.But, nevertheless, I found myself enjoying it in the middle there. As awkward as the queer representation is, there are some moments that are really cool. I like depictions of the liminal space where a girl hasn\'t realized she\'s a lesbian yet, and some of that was good. There was a great scene where the teacher realized he was performing the mannerisms of a woman off-the-clock and the old lady affirms that that\'s OK. A lot of the middle is about how he\'s realizing that he actually likes the experience of being a woman and, just barely short of the text, is wondering if he is a transwoman. I liked all of that. The show should have been building up to that.But, unrelated to these matters, the ""this was written by men"" anvil drops. You see, another part of the premise is that the people who run the school are extreme parodies of radical feminists who hate all men. As a man who doesn\'t feel put out by people expressing their frustration at a horrific system like that, the vast majority of what they did with these characters were bad takes. They treat the boys at the school as if they are second class citizens, and if the joke is supposed to be that this is how girls are treated in real life, then it REALLY does not work. It comes off less tongue-in-cheek than it does as a straight-faced critique of ""the world women really want"" written by men where men are the victims. No. No, no, no. Start over. Cut it out. Please go back to the transwoman idea. ...And then the second half of the series deals with the boys\' plight almost more than the trans teacher or the lesbian... Sigh.Oh, and the series\'s running antagonist is a woman who suspects the teacher is secretly a man, and so she spends the whole show trying to out her co-worker. If this was a trans-positive commentary on why policing gender is bad, there are possibilities in a sideplot like this. But what it actually ended up being was naive representation for TERFs. And she succeeds. And the transwoman is exiled. The TERF doesn\'t face any comeuppance. The most balance to this that we get is the fact that she\'s just a bad person in general, but that\'s portrayed as a consequence of her man-hating nature and, therefore, her feminism.Token reference to the fact that the art is from the early digital period and is shabby most of the time.There are positives to it, but it just doesn\'t work. If you\'re pointed to this show by clips of the good trans scenes buried in this, enjoy those. Don\'t bother watching it. the teacher and student to get together in a real world scenario, so please do not bother. Especially the premise requires a deferred anvil drop when she finds out the teacher is actually a man. I dreaded that day all the while I spent watching this and it was not great when it happened.But, nevertheless, I found myself enjoying it in the middle there.

I admit, the story is a little bit stupid and, yes, VERY far-fetched. However, you have to be willing to keep an open mind and look deeper, because the truth is, this story is about love, gender equality, and acceptance of others and of the self. Specifically, though, it is about the equal treatment of MEN. I enjoyed that they focused on this, because these days everything is usually about women being mistreated.The art is nothing special, and neither is the soundtrack. It's like any other school kid drama in that aspect.

DO NOT WATCH THIS IF YOU ARE EASILY SHOCKED/DISGUSTED BY SOCIAL SCANDALS. Though you're all anime connoisseurs, so I'm sure you're used to it by now ;)Weird stuff aside, I can say that the main protagonist, Hibiki, is one of the most admirable characters I have ever encountered. His goal in life is to become a gym teacher and change the lives of children for the better. When he enters Seito Sannomiya Private School disguised as a woman, he enters with the intent of proving a point to the man-hating administration: that people should be judged by their character, not by their gender. As for the school kids, they were actually a very realistic group of middle schoolers. You know.. hormonally messed up, unsure of what's right, impressionable.I think that the LGBT community (or anyone who supports) would enjoy this because it has themes about accepting sexuality.

The beginning of his career and towards the end was quite coherent, and was very entertaining and tear-jerking.However, the ending parts of this series left me a lot of questions, and there were quite a cliffhangers as well... seeming to lead to another season, but there doesn't seem to be one. Therefore i felt that the ending pulled the score down.Moreover, the romance between the some of the characters in the series were...not fully expressed, so this story is not so much of a romance type but rather an inspirational and tear-jerking one.O yea, the op was excellent, as they show you a few snap shots of what is going to come up later on in the episode in the first few secs of the op. And the op was great, lovely song. I didn't like the ed so much though.Overall, I enjoyed this series very much and I think it is quite rewatchable as well (7.8/10 for rewatchable-ness) not fully expressed, so this story is not so much of a romance type but rather an inspirational and tear-jerking one.O yea, the op was excellent, as they show you a few snap shots of what is going to come up later on in the episode in the first few secs of the op.

But the lack of episodes couldn\'t allow greater depth to be developed. As it stands, it is an 8.From the above criteria, it brings to wonder why on the whole it is a 10, because I enjoyed it.I just simply love how forbidden...concepts like a cross-dresser, teacher X student love and concept homosexuality came into play. In the minds of junior high students who are around the age of 14-16, what is their concept of love? This anime takes upon all of these elements and made a story. It is unfair, unjust and stupid to judge the anime from the POV of an adult or someone in their silver hair days. It showed how teenagers who are struggling with understanding what is love and are there limits. One might say that homosexuality, age difference and all other ""taboo"" things in society are bad but I beg to differ. I have no problems against these concepts because I believe that if that is where you feel most happy, you should go for it. And this anime does it. It delve into how these concept would work in reality and dug out a path which a person who accepts such ""taboo"" elements would take.

It touches subjects such as cross dressing, hebephilia and rabid feminism, which aren\'t exactly uncontroversial in the west (or I suppose in Japan). Even if you approach this series with an open mind, you\'ll still have to get past the whacky story, the wierd jokes, the fanservice... All I can say is that Strawberry eggs hits a perfect wavelength for me personally.Graphically it actually looks really good, especially for a high school anime, and even more especially considering it was made in 2001. Vivid animation, nice lighting effects and above decent character design.The voice acting is...good enough, the OP and ED have both been in my ""good anime music"" folder for over 10 years and the background music is varied and fitting.Very few high school animes manage to pull off a good combination of comedy and romance, but Strawberry eggs hits a sweet spot. The story itself, despite the whacky themes, isn\'t ground breaking but it\'s well paced and directed, and inhabited with great characters.This happens to be one of the very first animes I watched, so I guess some of it comes out of nostalgia, but it has turned out to be one of my absolute favourites. good enough, the OP and ED have both been in my ""good anime music"" folder for over 10 years and the background music is varied and fitting.Very few high school animes manage to pull off a good combination of comedy and romance, but Strawberry eggs hits a sweet spot.

I won\'t get into story details because most of people have written about it - a man starts crossdressing to get a job in a school to become a good teacher and make sexist female superiors realise that everyone deserves to be treated equally.Topics such as men-women relations, prejudices, sexuality and love are unwrapped in these 13 episodes.

I\'m sure you frequently encounter topics about gender pay gap in media or discussions, this anime is an artificial laboratory where such things are experimented and boosted to make bigger impression.

When I first heard about this anime, I thought it might be something like a Magical Girl Shoujo anime just from the title alone but when I read the summary, I found I was wrong. But still, the plot line of a man, desperate to become a teacher, crossdresses to do so after being turned down due to his gender. It was rather interesting, to say the least...and it kind of reminded me of another anime and manga called Gokusen which had a similar plot, only it was a woman born to a Yakuza (Japanese mafia/gang family) becoming a teacher at an all boy's school and having to hide the fact that she's a yakuza woman.I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs has an interesting story and interesting characters, even if the animation style isn't what you usually see in an anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Story;Like I said at the start of this review, I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs is about a man named Hibeki Amawa, after being refused a job as a teacher at a prestigious school with an all-female staff, requests the help of his landlady, Lulu, to get a job, which is by turning him into a woman. While this sounds like a comedy plot, the comedy in this anime is a bit... weak. And the drama that unfolds is the strong point, albeit, it's all rushed. There's no real story arc except for Hibeki constantly having to keep his true gender a secret from the feminazi of a principal and vice-principal. I used feminazi (albeit a bit loosely) because the head of the school and her vice principal are completely against men due to various unexplained reasons and that's pretty much it. Everything is mostly one-shot adventures until around episode 9 or 10 when a huge love triangle forms between Hibiki and a few of his students.Other than the close to non-existent story arc, what I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs have is still an amazing story. It does have it's funny moments, most of the comedic moments are of Hibeki nearly getting busted for being a man or close to being found out.Art:The art/animation isn't exactly breathtaking, but once you get used to it, it is pretty to look at. It has a lot of pretty scenes and the characters are animated fairly well, except for a few cases where they make some of the male characters that are perverted look even creepier than usual.Sound:Well, the sound is pretty good. The English dub was.... let's say the voice acting was well done. The characters sounded exactly as I would imagine the characters to be and the voices convey exactly what the characters are feeling and going through, though I do feel Lulu's voice could've been done a bit better. Other than that, I also think the opening and ending songs are a bit catchy. They're not the best openings and endings to an anime but I still find myself humming the songs out loud. As a matter of fact, the opening is stuck in my head right now.Character:Well, as I said, the characters are definitely drawn well and voiced well, but are they realistic and enjoyable? Are they developed? My answer is... yes, they're realistic enough for me to enjoy watching all the hilarity that ensues from Hibiki trying to keep his secret. All the characters have their own personalities, especially Hibiki, Fuko, and Lulu. As for the more supporting and background characters, they're distinguishable and enjoyable enough, but they don't stand out like Hibiki and Fuko do though. While I loved watching all the interactions between Hibiki and all the other characters, whether it's as a woman or a man, I do wish that there was more character development. Hibiki, Fuko, Akira, and Fujio are the only ones who get any kind of character development at all. It'd be nice if there were more episodes for the other students to grow because there seems to be something going on between a few of the background characters that never get fleshed out. It's just a shame that there weren't more episodes to flesh out all the characters properly.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show a lot. I mean yeah, the comedy wasn't all that enjoyable but the characters, the music, and the show... everything was really enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Fuko experience her first love and Hibiki trying to persuade the evil feminazi Principal and vice principal to change their minds about segregating the girls and boys and seeing him stand up for all of his students and encouraging them to do their best, as both a man and a woman, was really touching. As a matter of fact, I thought Hibiki was going to be a typical manly man who would be perverted and think of cross-dressing as disgusting, but nope.This show proved me wrong. It definitely tackled a lot of issues that normally aren't featured in animes, let alone a tv show. It touched upon, reverse-sexism, feminism, well the extreme version of feminism, cross-dressing, and of course, the one thing that makes us all human: Love. Of course, Hibiki does have a few perverted moments but honestly, if you were convince to share the same bed with someone of the opposite gender (albeit it was for one night lol) then you wouldn’t be able to help, but notice how the other person looks while being so close to them in a small space.Overall:Overall, I would say this is a damn good anime. It's not among the best animes I've watched, but it's not the worst by any means. The characters are all enjoyable enough, the plot, what little there is, is entertaining and lighthearted, and everything ties together... mostly. My only complaint is that the story could've been developed just a bit more so that the characters could be fleshed out. I mean there was something in the final episode, something about the Headmistress, that had me very intrigued. While I feel that this anime is a bit rushed, I still loved it and I highly recommend it if you don't mind a slightly rushed plot or a short Slice of Life anime. But it's not recommended if you're looking for something with more depth and character development. Why do I say this? Because there are only 13 episodes of this anime and it has a lot of potentials to be a good lighthearted story with a smidgeon of drama to spice it up.So with that said, if you really are interested or don't think my review doesn't convince you to watch I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs, then see for yourself why this anime is good at what it does. and it kind of reminded me of another anime and manga called Gokusen which had a similar plot, only it was a woman born to a Yakuza (Japanese mafia/gang family) becoming a teacher at an all boy's school and having to hide the fact that she's a yakuza woman.I, My, Me!

Strawberry Eggs is about a man named Hibeki Amawa, after being refused a job as a teacher at a prestigious school with an all-female staff, requests the help of his landlady, Lulu, to get a job, which is by turning him into a woman. While this sounds like a comedy plot, the comedy in this anime is a bit... weak. And the drama that unfolds is the strong point, albeit, it's all rushed. There's no real story arc except for Hibeki constantly having to keep his true gender a secret from the feminazi of a principal and vice-principal. I used feminazi (albeit a bit loosely) because the head of the school and her vice principal are completely against men due to various unexplained reasons and that's pretty much it. Everything is mostly one-shot adventures until around episode 9 or 10 when a huge love triangle forms between Hibiki and a few of his students.Other than the close to non-existent story arc, what I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs have is still an amazing story. It does have it's funny moments, most of the comedic moments are of Hibeki nearly getting busted for being a man or close to being found out.Art:The art/animation isn't exactly breathtaking, but once you get used to it, it is pretty to look at. It has a lot of pretty scenes and the characters are animated fairly well, except for a few cases where they make some of the male characters that are perverted look even creepier than usual.Sound:Well, the sound is pretty good. The English dub was.... let's say the voice acting was well done. The characters sounded exactly as I would imagine the characters to be and the voices convey exactly what the characters are feeling and going through, though I do feel Lulu's voice could've been done a bit better. Other than that, I also think the opening and ending songs are a bit catchy. They're not the best openings and endings to an anime but I still find myself humming the songs out loud. As a matter of fact, the opening is stuck in my head right now.Character:Well, as I said, the characters are definitely drawn well and voiced well, but are they realistic and enjoyable? Are they developed? My answer is... yes, they're realistic enough for me to enjoy watching all the hilarity that ensues from Hibiki trying to keep his secret. All the characters have their own personalities, especially Hibiki, Fuko, and Lulu. As for the more supporting and background characters, they're distinguishable and enjoyable enough, but they don't stand out like Hibiki and Fuko do though. While I loved watching all the interactions between Hibiki and all the other characters, whether it's as a woman or a man, I do wish that there was more character development. Hibiki, Fuko, Akira, and Fujio are the only ones who get any kind of character development at all. It'd be nice if there were more episodes for the other students to grow because there seems to be something going on between a few of the background characters that never get fleshed out. It's just a shame that there weren't more episodes to flesh out all the characters properly.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show a lot. I mean yeah, the comedy wasn't all that enjoyable but the characters, the music, and the show... everything was really enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Fuko experience her first love and Hibiki trying to persuade the evil feminazi Principal and vice principal to change their minds about segregating the girls and boys and seeing him stand up for all of his students and encouraging them to do their best, as both a man and a woman, was really touching. As a matter of fact, I thought Hibiki was going to be a typical manly man who would be perverted and think of cross-dressing as disgusting, but nope.This show proved me wrong. It definitely tackled a lot of issues that normally aren't featured in animes, let alone a tv show. It touched upon, reverse-sexism, feminism, well the extreme version of feminism, cross-dressing, and of course, the one thing that makes us all human: Love. Of course, Hibiki does have a few perverted moments but honestly, if you were convince to share the same bed with someone of the opposite gender (albeit it was for one night lol) then you wouldn’t be able to help, but notice how the other person looks while being so close to them in a small space.Overall:Overall, I would say this is a damn good anime. It's not among the best animes I've watched, but it's not the worst by any means. The characters are all enjoyable enough, the plot, what little there is, is entertaining and lighthearted, and everything ties together... mostly. My only complaint is that the story could've been developed just a bit more so that the characters could be fleshed out. I mean there was something in the final episode, something about the Headmistress, that had me very intrigued. While I feel that this anime is a bit rushed, I still loved it and I highly recommend it if you don't mind a slightly rushed plot or a short Slice of Life anime. But it's not recommended if you're looking for something with more depth and character development. Why do I say this? Because there are only 13 episodes of this anime and it has a lot of potentials to be a good lighthearted story with a smidgeon of drama to spice it up.So with that said, if you really are interested or don't think my review doesn't convince you to watch I, My, Me! Strawberry Eggs, then see for yourself why this anime is good at what it does."", ""First of all this anime is quite under-rated. It really disappoints me seeing the score below 7 on MAL.

Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8277/Hyakka_Ryouran__Samurai_Girls,"['Oh man.. It\'s another samurai harem. What\'s with Japanese people and turning historical figures into high school girls? Anyways, this anime series is based on a light novel series written by Akira Suzuki. Wait a minute. I know what are you wondering.. ""Hey isn\'t the main male lead name is Muneakira?"" Yes you\'re right. I mean if you\'re writing a story about a harem, wouldn\'t you want to be the center of it? And let\'s just add ""Mune"" to your name and nobody would even notice.(Yes, I know Mune can also mean breasts..)I really had high expectations with this one. No kidding. It\'s been a...long time since I\'ve watch an anime about samurais. Unfortunately, as promising as this anime looks, here comes the hundreds of unnecessary fanservice and fillers to drown out the story. Oh sure, I\'ll like a few fillers now and then but they\'re rush the entire plot buildup right to the end of the series.Now on the positive side, the reason why I sticked to this anime (No it\'s not because of the fanservice...) it\'s the astounding art this anime brings forward. It\'s a bit nostalgic as this reminds me of the game I used to play about a b*tch.. Umm I mean about a wolf (Ookami was it?)Anyways, rarely I\'ve seen an anime which uses the traditional ink style for all it\'s censorship and transition point however it gets annoying over time.I have no complaints about the sound either.And here comes the characters. What? Only three girls in his harem?? Lame.. However, all three of them have some useful personalities to assist with their ever useless male harem lead. And Im suprised there\'s more tsunderes than Ive expected! As usual, as the story develops, each girl had their chance to express their feelings to Mr ""Breast"" Akira here.Oh boy, once again the male harem lead is there as a wallflower for every battle. Every battle when you think Muneakira is going to take charge and battle, prepare to get disappointed. Remember, this anime is aimed for people who loves fanservice so they wouldn\'t want to see a guy in the battle now would they? Hey, at least he isn\'t dense unlike some other male harem leads.And what about the villains? Twisted as usual. Nothing new here.Personally, I quite enjoyed this anime. That\'s because unlike others, I did not take the story seriously from the start after watching a few episodes of fillers. If you\'re looking for a nice samurai story with a decent plot then go look elsewhere. As entertaining as this may be, I wont be watching it again as this sort of anime is where you watch it once and you\'re already content. I mean, can you watch 12 whole episode about ""Love"", ""Honor"", and ""Bond"" all over again?Overall, it\'s a good time killer if you have nothing better to do. Definitely a must watch anime for all you harem lovers. Just don\'t let the whole ideology of ""Love and Honor conquers all"" get stuck with you.

It is not the best series out there and it's not for everyone either, but it can be a good time waster.The series does have a plot but it only significantly advances in the final episodes.  So like many ecchi comedies out there, there is very little plot and when there is it's pretty weak. However not every series requires a strong plot to succeed, in fact there are many series out there that are successful with no plot.  All...a series really needs to do is satisfy it's viewers and I would say it satisfied me. There were a lot of attempts at comedy in this series, some worked and some didn't and there were some moments that were just hilarious.The artwork was really stunning and beautiful. The style of art seems really unique and the detail is just amazing, even in the background.  The last couple of minutes of the final episode were full black in white which was visually pleasing to me too. The battle scenes are also well animated and looked nice too. I'm amazed at the amount of detail that were put into each one of them. Then there was the censoring. The ink dots that were used to censor inappropriate body parts could really get annoying especially when characters were moving around, since the dots would have to move with them.  But it really depends on the person, some may be bothered by it and some may not be.The sound department did an okay job.  The opening sounded great with an intense rock song to get you pumped up for action.  The voices seemed to fit each character's role. There's really nothing else to say about the sound.To be honest, the characters could have been done better. Although the protagonist, Muneakira, may be unique in some aspects (he's a samurai for crying out loud), he seems a bit generic. He's useless and usually doesn't have a clue what's going on, yet somehow almost every girl manages to fall for him. I still don't the sick magic that makes girls fall for useless protagonists.Our main heroine,Jubei, actually has two sides, her normal form and her bad-ass form.  She's usually only in her bad-ass form during battle, in this form she's really strong but also pretty smart as well. In her normal form she has a really innocent personality and refers to herself in third person to be cute.  I like how both personalities contrast from each other.Of course a harem would not complete without our 2 love rivals, Sen and Yukimura. They both seem bland. Yukimura is our short, flat chested character she is a bit tsundere but at least it's not overly done. Then we got Sen, at first I hated her because of her jealousy but by the end she was tolerable. Both of these characters aren't bad but they both really don't have the qualities that separate them from your typical harem characters.We also have some side characters and they sometimes do add to the jokes in the series especially Kanetsugu but there's nothing really notable about them.The series as a whole however is enjoyable. Although some of the jokes weren't well executed the others were hilarious.

However, it represents everything that went wrong with today\'s anime industry.ART:Series like \'Gankutsuou\', \'Mononoke\', \'xxxHOLIC\', \'Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei\', and \'Yojouhan\' have such distinctive and unconventional art style or character designs that you\'ll never forget once you\'ve seen it. Sounds pretty cool, we should do it too! And there we have it, sumi-e (wash...painting) style backgrounds, ink drops and brush strokes for censorship and scene transitions.I have to admit that the style was unique, background is visually pleasing, and there were couple of breathtaking scenes. However, this art style was executed very poorly in many aspects. For one, the character designs were rather ordinary and they looked out of place in the picture even with the thick outlines as a buffer. The presence of modern day gadgets and use of CG made it seem awkward at times because it did not conform to the era or the style. The censoring technique was fine in still pictures, but it was unsightly and annoying when character is moving because the way ink dots follow and disappear screams of ""look at me! I\'m different!""The action is cool, and labeling of people and attack move\'s names were done rather well though.The animation in this series will certainly be remembered, but it simply did not work for the most part.SOUND:Yagyuu Juubee\'s voice is really cool when she\'s transformed into Master Samurai, but sounded way too cute/loli despite her appearance in normal form. Muneakira sounds too girly for the macho hero who\'s supposed to be all about samurai honor. Otherwise, the side characters\' voices were done pretty well and sound like they should.BGM was pretty generic. OP is a really good intense rock song, not only is it very catchy, it also had the Japanese flavor, and the vocal was amazing.STORY/CHARACTER:The title ""Hyakka Ryouran"" has two meanings. The first, more literal meaning is ""Profusion of Flowers Blooming in Chaos"", as in girls (flowers) of various (profusion) backgrounds are unlocked (blooming) into master samurai and wreak havoc (chaos). The second meaning is ""Appearance of Abundant Talent in a Short Period"", which describes the resurgence of Master Samurai after a considerable draught in awakening. This series has a great naming sense in its own title, and also the names of signature moves for each character. For example in Sen\'s ""DenKouSekka"", a lightning attack which reads ""Lightning Fast"" in Japanese, ""Kou"" is deliberately written in wrong kanji that has same pronunciation that means ""Royalty"". D\'Artagnan\'s ice attack that seals enemy movement ""Zettai Reido"" means ""Absolute Zero"", but written ""Absolute Slavery(Imprisonment)"".A lot of moves have such creative names like that. However, the originality ends there.The setting is really, really bad. Sure, it\'s an alternate universe where the Shogunate rule survives, and there\'s zero Western influence in Japan, but then you have all the advanced technology (from the West) like air planes, cameras, and computers. It got so bad at one point that commando units holding guns were guarding ninjas and samurais. Talk about awkward.The premise is basically Evangelion ripoff, you have a chosen hero who unlocks the power of super-powerful beings to fight ones that want to end the world, and an organization trying to prevent that. The secretive organization functions through unethical practices (human experiments/sacrifices vs child labor), and yes, there was mass production of the super-beings to build up the force.Then all the characters were for manufactured harem. All the girl fighters except Sen have names of MALE historical figures or fictional characters of major literature with similar attributes. It\'s not even \'Sora no Otoshimono\', and girls literally fall from the sky, and yes, one of the them is a cyborg. The initial villain is identical to Vegeta, he thinks he\'s above all others (emperors and kings), he does have a good purpose but uses any means to achieve his goals, he even wears a Power Level Scanner, and of course, he joins the hero and heroines in the end.There were many other similarities to DBZ, from ""Her power level is over half a million!"" to ""They are far beyond our capabilities, we can only watch"". The girls basically power up like Super-Sayan, and then a heroine even flies like one, before getting spirit bomb-like power recovery from allies. The whole action is like \'DBZ\' meets \'Sengoku BASARA\' with ridiculous power and constant yelling about love, honor, and justice. While this could\'ve been quite funny if it was parody, there was nothing in this series to suggest that was the case.And there\'s these random fan-services with explosion ripping off girl\'s clothes, a girl wearing thongs all the time (historically some men did, but still...), dumb activation of power (kiss), and \'Sailor Moon\' ripoff naked transformation.Character behavior in general made no sense, and things happen just to advance the plot.ENJOYMENT/OVERALLIt\'s nearly impossible to create a completely original story or characters in this day and age. For example, one of the villains in this series also had a magical eye like Alpha Stigma, a ripoff of Geass, which is a modified Sharingan, which is a souped up version of Hiei\'s evil eye, and then you can trace that all the way back to Medusa.However, good storywriting can camouflage similarities well enough that they won`t be easily noticeable and bother us. On the other hand, the mix of themes and reference in this show is blatant and shameless. They are so poorly executed that the apparent lack of originality is obvious to the viewer. And then you have excessive moe and ecchi fan service, failed art style innovation, and manufactured harem environment to distract us from the flaws in story and production. Like many similar harem anime today, \'Hyakka Ryouran\' was a very poorly produced and forgettable series.That said, the story is shallow and cliché, but it does have a good pace and some of the tried and true formula do work, and the action scenes are exciting. The show is a true mix of previous anime and lacks originality, but it does offer quick entertainment. painting) style backgrounds, ink drops and brush strokes for censorship and scene transitions.I have to admit that the style was unique, background is visually pleasing, and there were couple of breathtaking scenes. However, this art style was executed very poorly in many aspects. For one, the character designs were rather ordinary and they looked out of place in the picture even with the thick outlines as a buffer. The presence of modern day gadgets and use of CG made it seem awkward at times because it did not conform to the era or the style. The censoring technique was fine in still pictures, but it was unsightly and annoying when character is moving because the way ink dots follow and disappear screams of ""look at me! I\'m different!""The action is cool, and labeling of people and attack move\'s names were done rather well though.The animation in this series will certainly be remembered, but it simply did not work for the most part.SOUND:Yagyuu Juubee\'s voice is really cool when she\'s transformed into Master Samurai, but sounded way too cute/loli despite her appearance in normal form. Muneakira sounds too girly for the macho hero who\'s supposed to be all about samurai honor.

However, there is more to the story than just action fan service scenes.Whether it’s standing still or in movement, it’s really a rich and attractive art design. The environments feel like a sharp watercolor painting, and the characters blend in with a darker, deeper color.Hirakawa, Daisuke (School Days, Omamori Himari) and Kugimiya, Rie (Toradora!, Hayate the Combat Butler!) share the majority of airtime on the first episode. Both of these voice actors have had their share...of different roles, so expect nothing but a perfect performance from the both of them. The sound effects match the soundtracks used in intense, dramatic, mysterious scenes, and also match the amusing, make-fun-of-the-size-of-my-breast scenes.Each characters outfit/weapon shows a lot of creativity, detail, and personality. Although, not much characters were revealed my favorite characters so far are Yagyuu, Muneakira and Sanada Yukimura. Yagyuu feels mysterious, and Sanada is hyperactive-ish.Overall I enjoyed my visit in the world of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls and I can’t wait to view more episodes when they air.

Having watched 4 episodes till now, it still makes for some good entertainment with great artwork and editing with decent comical situations. Don't watch for the story or even character development as i feel the creators want it to be light with a pinch of mystry and drama, not too much brainwork that is.So i'll give it a 7 - watch once, enjoy, then amnesia.

Another harem series rated with mild nudity!” --- MeI’ve been a fan of harem series as long as I can remember. I don’t know; maybe part of it was because it won’t happen for me in real life. I know I’m not the only one who projects themselves as the protagonist, and that’s why, maybe, I don’t watch shoujo series at all. Enough about me spouting nonsense. Let us proceed further into my review of Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls.Story: 7Hyakka Ryouran’s story isn’t that great. But the setting will pique a bit of your interest. Why? It’s because of...the odd setting of the story. If you think that the story happened in the samurai era, which was in the past. You are wrong, mister.The story happens in the early 21st century, in an alternate reality where the Tokugawa Shogunate has remained in power.  21st century, meaning computers (in fact they’re using Microsoft OS on their computers), airplanes, trains, etc. exist. So don’t get confused. I like the fact of mixing modern and feudal-era in the story. The setting is unique in its own way.As for the story, a girl mysteriously appears in front of him descending from the sky and steals his first kiss. And voilà, he gained one of the girls he’ll be adding into his arsenal of samurai babes! There’s more to it than that of course. Buuuuuuuuuuut! You halfta’ watch the series yourself to understand it more. Considering that Hyakka Ryouran has only 12 episodes, (second season not included) it is in fact very short. The story’s really easy to grasp so you don’t have to worry about it.You can say I’m lazy for not telling you the plot. Half of its true, half of it is I just don’t want to spoil you.Art: 9Hyakka Ryouran’s art is great. Or it’s just a biased opinion of silly self. Either way, Hyakka Ryouran’s art is very appealing to me. Everything that was drawn was surrounded by these heavily inked borders around them. And the fight scenes weren’t half bad, too. In short, everything was bloody messed up with ink. But it comes with colours, too! Like black, purple, white. INK, INK, INK!!! Even sword slashes were inks.Characters: 8Considering Hyakka Ryouran’s a harem series, we should have a lot of bishoujous surrounding our MC. Oh and yes, did they deliver. An air-head; a loli (who is voiced by Rie Kugimiya); and a jealous-type girl.  The supporting characters were decent, too. The lack of male characters in the story is quite disturbing. I’ve only seen two guys in the story. Oh whelp, who cares about males. What am I even saying? This show’s for guys anyway.Sound: 7I don’t know why, but the background songs in the fights scenes seem really familiar to me. For the OP theme and ED theme; I did like the ED theme which was done by Rie Kugimiya! The OP theme’s made by Faylan. They also made songs for Seikon no Qwaser, which, incidentally, is like Hyakka Ryouran. Although it’s a lot more mature than Hyakka Ryouran.Enjoyment: 7Did I enjoy it? Of course, my inner male did. But my inner plot-centred-self isn’t quite as happy as my inner male did. Why? It’s the lack of legitimate plot. What I irked me the most was the progress of the story. The first few episodes were good, explaining some things how this and that happened. But continuing to the middle episodes it got boring. What I mean is, the plot of the story doesn’t progress that much until the last few episodes. Nevertheless, the simple punches and sword swings that could tear the girls’ clothes really made me happy.Overall: 7Hyakka Ryouran’s far off from being called a masterpiece. It lacks a lot of essentials on how to be a great series. Looking at the fan service it provides, especially to adolescent boys, it’ll be a decent show, or better, a great show (for them). Let’s all face it, boobies and panties aren’t enough to wow viewers these days, or even make them watch the series.My verdict: Hyakka Ryouran’s a good watch, not a “must-watch” series. But it’ll definitely entertain you. the odd setting of the story. If you think that the story happened in the samurai era, which was in the past.

I've just about had it with Sentai Filmworks and their ridiculous line of anime titles. At this point in time, I've completely seen four of their titles and every last one of them rank amongst the worst anime I have ever seen including Samurai Girls. Despite not getting into the trailer at all, I came into this completely from a level-headed perspective. I gave this anime the benefit of the doubt and it made me literally cringe during the entire duration. Samurai Girls is almost completely devoid of all imagination, and it heavily relies on those same tired old harem comedy clichés. It features the same old mousy loser who's completely afraid of pussy, and is surrounded by a host of women for the flimsiest of reasons. The tired old love triangles, the girls who berate him for things that's not his fault, it just goes on and on. I am so sick and tired of this weak shit.In all honesty, and I'm not trying to come off offensive or like some type of elitist, but Samurai Girls is for that type of anime fan who either has no standards at all, or are completely new and really haven't experienced the absolute best titles the genre has to after. The only positives I can think of lies in the visuals and music score. The anime is indeed stylish with a heavy manga influence filled with dark lines, and very nice looking backgrounds that reminds me of Super Street Fighter IV. Visually, there's just nothing bad to look at here and the character designs are very sexy for the women. There's some great detail in the loads of fan service provided. In addition, black ink blotches frequently drop down to the screen, and later on in the series, they feature different colored blotches that really does look cool. The action scenes contain many flashes and light shows reminiscent of Bleach and Dragonball Z. The BGM which is provided by Tatsuya Katou complements the anime well, when working for the action and comedy. Unfortunately, although these things stand out, they really didn't make getting through this anime any easier.Samurai Girls was a chore for me. The visuals tend to overshadow the characters, plot, action, and story, because none of those things are anything special. The plot spins its wheels very early with little to no progression at all. The characters soon learn that the female samurai's can be transformed into Master Samurai's by kissing Muneakira, this pits at least three of them in this unoriginal, by the numbers love triangle that grows boring and annoying very quick with lots of bickering. To add to the lack of originality and completely insipid, the main character Jubei goes through a Lucy/Nyu-esque of Elfen Lied fame transformation, from powerful samurai warrior to an infantile retard that is nowhere near as annoying as Nyu, but is annoying as hell in her own right. None of the characters were the least bit interesting to me. If it wasn't for the fact that they were named after real samurai's of the Sengoku and Edo periods, I would have never even known their names.This anime features one comic relief after the other, and even though I chuckled here and there to the characters antics. I felt the writers were trying way too hard to be funny, and more than half of the time the jokes were completely flat. They get even worse due to the constant rehashing. Later on around the ninth episode, something of a plot develops when the heroes learn they will have to face a demonic threat that could wipe them all out. Unfortunately, it's too badly paced and thanks to all of the filler before it everything feels too tacked on and very rushed. The action, which should be a stand out, is made up of flashes of action and falling bodies, with way too many high energy attacks. The writers cut way too many corners as there aren't any choreographed sword on sword exchanges, which is completely ridiculous for a show with a samurai setting.There's no doubt that I personally believe I sat through a certified shitcapade, but what keeps these DVD's from being certified coasters, is that the anime never attempts to take itself too seriously. There are no tonal shifts, it's a straight forward light hearted ride meant to be fun; but the problem is that it doesn't accomplish any of its goals in the areas it set out to excel in as far as I'm concerned. This anime is an ant amongst giants when compared to series close to its type such as Excel Saga and Slayers.Samurai Girls is a very poor excuse of a samurai/harem show. The only area it really stands out in is the prodution values; character designs, flashy action moments, fan service, music score, and for me, this just isn't enough. I hated the characters, their played out interactions, non choreographed action scenes, that troll final episode. It was just a bad experience for me. I only recommend this to the very easy to please. If you enjoyed Needless and High School of the Dead, then you'll love this.Highs: Production valuesLows: Plot, characters, comedy, etc. passes out after the fight. Who is this girl?

I hated the characters, their played out interactions, non choreographed action scenes, that troll final episode. It was just a bad experience for me. I only recommend this to the very easy to please. If you enjoyed Needless and High School of the Dead, then you'll love this.Highs: Production valuesLows: Plot, characters, comedy, etc."", ""Ahh, the classic ecchi action show. I am not a fan of the genre in general, but the first episode seemed like it could turn out well. It also seemed like it had a plot. The art also seemed rather unique in its genre of bright and happy. Yes, it was all what it seemed.Expectation: 6Episode scores:-,-,-,-, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6Actual: 4 BadYet the plot is quickly put aside for the last episodes, nothing unusual, as the harem tries to become master samurai. Now what can be wrong with that? Well, i don't mind the cliche random guy getting all the...chicks, and the fact that at first they are essentially just trying to use him as a stepping stool. Yet, while there is some actually relationships that seem to do well, any interaction is transformed into interaction between a master and his samurai. Well at least for the dense lead anyways. Even the kisses are lame, and insignificant because of the same property.With Samurai you would expect some good battles. Yet, we are bombarded with poor fight after poor fight. Either it is a master samurai beating the crap out of somebody defenseless or them pulling off their 'named move' once or twice inbetween talking. The only exceptional scene is the climax, but they sacrifice any logic for the  pretty effects.There was a lot more comedy that i enjoyed which was unexpected. It might of been one of the few redeeming qualities of this show, but even then they are not that good. i might of just felt like enjoying slapstick humor for some reason when i was watching this.The characters are not very deep. The harem consists of tsunderes with a side dish of servants and energetic idiots that fell of of the sky. Their characters are not really anything special, nor do they have at least one oddity about them. At least i was a Rie fan so i was able to appreciate something about at least one character.Overall, not that much different from any other ecchi show. The plot is pretty lame, and the comedy is not up to par with a lot of better actual 'ecchi comedies' out there. I would call this average for this genre, but the standard is set pretty low as far as i am concerned as of late. chicks, and the fact that at first they are essentially just trying to use him as a stepping stool.

But for Hyakka Ryouran, you'll be thinking, why have I not heard of this earlier?! (unless this was in one of your first 10 anime, ignore that whole paragraph.)Story: 7/10A martial arts anime with harem, romance, comedy and school. Except, the genre that was least shown was of course, the school genre. Probably just to make everything look more interesting. This type of story isn't for your light hearted, slice of life type anime fan, because there's also mild violence. The romance genre can...be really sweet sometimes, as each character builds a bond with Muneakira Yagyuu. The story keeps you on your toes, but sometimes gets off track, which may be really boring. Other than that, the story is solid and doesn't drag too much.Art: 9/10Why a high rating, you ask? The art is very unique, having very dark and thick outlines on each character, not to mention the smooth animation. The theme of the anime is set on the Tokugawa era, so not a lot of vibrant colors and more of a dark, ancient style of art.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack for each scene is mostly Japanese-themed, sticking to the roots of the anime. The OP goes nicely with the anime, fitting the action+romance. The ED is all about love, so I guess that fits the romance genre.Character: 7/10Each character stayed with their role, Muneakira being the protagonist and of course, all protagonists are heroes. The only thing I hate about him is the voice actor, he sounds like he's still in his teens, because of how his voice can crack very often. Not very fitting for a strong, kind character.The 3 girls that are mostly around Muneakira:Yagyuu Jubei, having the cutest sounding VA in the anime, Yuuki Aoi. She's a very cheerful, kind and friendly character but she's a klutz. Her 'alter-ego' is similar to Akashiya Moka, from Rosario to Vampire. She is the complete opposite when she is in her 'alter-ego'.Sanada Yukimura, having the voice actress of the 'Queen of Tsundere', Kugimiya Rie. Tsundere, flat chested, but a genius too.And lastly, Sen Tokugawa, the childhood friend of Muneakira. A strong, smart, and the type of female character who would misunderstand any perverted situation. She is also the student council president.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed this season because of the story PANTYSHOTS, the smooth animation TITS, the characters themselves BOOBS- oh forget it, this anime has a lot of Ecchi. Pantyshots every minute, ink-censored nipples, but that enough won't get you from the story. Would I re-watch it? Maybe.Overall: 8/10If you're looking for an anime that is similar to:Rosario to VampireHighschool DxDand more harem+action anime, then look no further, this anime is just for you. be really sweet sometimes, as each character builds a bond with Muneakira Yagyuu.

The animation quality is stellar, probably among the best I've seen short of full studio movies.  The art is good enough that I sometimes get distracted and end up missing the dialogue.  The cel-shading may offend some, but I've never had an issue with this style of animation.As far as being categorized as ecchi...I'd consider this to be very mild.  While there are the usual scantily clad (or no clothes at all) scenes and plenty of fanservice, none of them are directly explicit(at least so far.)  This anime does not use the...excessively over-distorted proportions common to other series (like Godannar or Koihime Musō)There is apparently a great deal of back story as several conflicts and a touch of intrigue was revealed during the first episode.The action sequences are only fair which I found surprising considering the high quality of the artwork.  There has not been much combat to rate this show with but some low-quality (shadows, off-screen sequences) tricks were used to avoid drawing them outright.Still I'm looking forward to seeing more of this series and seeing how the plot unfolds. excessively over-distorted proportions common to other series (like Godannar or Koihime Musō)There is apparently a great deal of back story as several conflicts and a touch of intrigue was revealed during the first episode.The action sequences are only fair which I found surprising considering the high quality of the artwork.

From titles like Kiss x Sis, High School of the Dead, and even Seikon no Qwaser, it makes one think that Japan has had a rise in lonely boys who are buying into this stuff like ice to Eskimos.Hyakka Ryōran: Samurai Girls is no different in that all it really is, is a show about samurai with breasts set in neo-Japan. Die-hard fans of historical anime/literature may feel insulted to this as famous names like Sanada Yukimura, Yagyū Jūbei and even Senhimé are...made to cast as moé characters.Story - 6Ryōran takes place in an alternate world where the samurai co-exist with modern technology. How Akira Suzuki(author of the light novels) came up with the idea is beyond me but its definitely not unheard of if your a fan of Gintama. In this reality, master samurai are like guardian deities who serve their shogun as well as protect the populace with their godly powers that differentiate them from your average samurai.Sound good so far? I thought so too until I realized this series was more a rom-com harem then an action anime.  Don\'t get me wrong, there definitely is action in the series but there just wasn\'t enough to outweigh the lame overdone comedy. For those who have seen the series Sekirei may see some similarities(like the norito kiss) in this anime, and will probably get the same disappointment in regards to Ryōran\'s plotline.Art - 7If there\'s one thing Ryōran will be remembered by(if it ever gets remember by next season), is its art and animation. From background to character design, everything is presented in a unique fashion that is different from your typical 2D or CG anime. Of course that doesn\'t mean that characters are drawn in a weird way as first and foremost, this is an ecchi anime that has samurai girls showing off their assets. One thing I have to commend the director with is the method to which they use to censor the ladies naughty bits. Instead of using the traditional white light or white fog, we are shown ink blotches which coincide with the series artwork.Whilst I wouldn\'t say animation is first class for Ryōran, I\'d definitely rate it higher then other battle anime that\'s come out recently(like Nurarihyon no Mago)Sound - 7Another component I guess I enjoyed for this series would have to be its sound. With J-rock band Faylan performing the OP ""Last Vision For Last"", your easily swayed into thinking this series is well worth watching as it pulls you in with the beat like any good shonén anime should. The ED ""Koi ni Sesse Tooryanse"" performed by the leading ladies of the series is not bad either(nor is it any good) and the BGM is nicely set in place giving you the right ambiance and pacing.I really have no complaints with the voice cast, asides from that anyone who has seen School Days may be clearly reminded that the main lead for this series is Makoto. Thought I\'d throw it out there  :DCharacter - 3This is where the series fails. The characters of Ryōran are shallow and there is not one character in the anime that I could say is solid. We are reminded time and time again through each character, that this really is a two-bit harem. The main lead at first showed some promise but quickly fell into the endless spiral of uninspiring harem males and the supporting ladies are a joke. If someone was to ask me if I\'ve seen Ryōran, my first reply would be ""Oh, that boobies show?"" because that\'s all the women of Ryōran is all about.Enjoyment - 6Watching Ryōran is like riding a bicycle through a mountainous valley. There are so many ups and downs to the series that its not worth counting. As long as your not looking for a deeper meaning to what this show portrays, then its all downhill in regards to enjoyment.Overall - 5Hyakka Ryōran: Samurai Girls is first and foremost an ecchi anime.

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but anything else is not so good.well first of all anime setting is in some alternative world where ""great japan"" is attacked by outside forces and ""great japan"" instead of using their millitary using ""master samurais"" who are a sexy females in patsu. no theres no males. only females. and only in patsu. and those master samurais is somehow japans only hope to survive attacks or something.and so we see the first and most ridiculous scene where few bitches jumps to FUCKING SKY and cuts bomber jets with katanas... ok this is not just stupid and imposible but just... a cheap copy of Dragonball?? oh shit not another one...now from the beggining theres no logic in this anime. not at all. not even a little bit of logic you will find here. and story is complete bullshit. a female fell from sky into protagonists arms and he kiss her and activate her superpower so she became a master samurai and we have transformation scene similar to those from sailor moon and here she is a legendary Jubei Yagyu who\'s power level is way beyond 9000. and so that bitch who fell from sky can transform into a master samurai if she is kissed but in regular life she is retarded stupid girl with big boobs and 3 year old brains just like that fucking Lucy/nyu from elfen lied. well she ofcourse not the only bitch, theres a whole harem that includes every type and every size from boobless loli to enormous boobled childhood friend. and yes they show boobs openly, no censoring. well if it would be hentai it would be so much better but we have what we have...so also the whole story is just pure nonsence. have no point. it would be as good without story at all. it actually is without any story at all... like just nothing, I repeat NOTHING that would make sense. just a boob/ass show that pretends to be about samurai honor.. somehow...so yeah samurais! yes theres also katanas and ""sword fights"" (if you can call that bullshit fights). yet these fights are so cheap and stupid that it just makes me angry... well dont expect ANYTHING similar to that Rurouni Kenshin historical japanese mood and sounds of coliding katanas in those (almost) well animated sword fights. nooooo here we have A FUCKING NUCLEAR EXPLOSION every time some bitch draws or swings her katana. like BOOOM and fight is over! yes fight is over. a nuclear explosion ends fight really fast. oh you might think that there\'s no survivors after nuclear explosion caused by katana.. somehow.. but nooooo the only damage that those massive nuclear explosions inflict to human beings is that it rips off their clothes. yes rips off clothes. so you can see a boobs. thats the damage you get after nuclear explosion somehow caused by katana.....in short there\'s no sword fights at all. only those regular energy blasts, explosions and similar bullshit we seen so many times since DragonBall times (1989). and sailor moon type of transformations that you will see EVERY FUCKING TIME before ""fight"" starts.in short all this anime is offence to Japans culture and history as it uses historical names and pretends to be japan historicaly based or something...and also we have that stylish green haired dickless pussy main protagonist Yagyu Muneakira. he\'s not just bad character... he\'s not really even a character. he have stylish katana and suposed to be a brave samurai ready to die for great japans sake yet soon he turns out to be ""general"" of several bitches who\'s the only one who can activate their ""hidden power"".. by kissing them.and that all he do. in entire show his only job is to kiss his bitches and act like a complete fucktard. and most important - whining, crying, worrying and act like a fucking dickless pussy shit kirito bitch kasanova shit for fuck sake. seriously this is one of the most boring, stupid, stereotypical, useless and regular harem character I\'ve ever seen. arguably worse than kirito kirigaya itself... guess how many times he fought in those 13 episodes?? how many??? huh? your guess?? NONE!! he never even fucking fought a single time in entire 13 episodes! he only hidding behind womans back like a fucking pussy!! whenever enemy comes he hides under the backs of his bitches! ""save me girls! I m in trouble"" .....is he even a man? isn\'t its a man who suposed to protect a woman? but yeah lets not forget this is alternative twisted world where womans protecting those weak mans who are all pussies like Muneakira. also millitary is made exclusively out of womans. yes all the soldiers in this world is females only and no man serve in millitary forces... mans here can only be ""generals"" (harem masters, kasanovas).... seriously...this should\'ve been made as Hentai and that would be almost ok... almost..but now its a fucking disaster...this is one of the shitiest anime I\'ve ever seen.2/10why not 1/10? because some nice boobs out there.. yeah if you want to watch this nonsencial bullshit just for the sake of boobs go on!also theres a 2nd season for this shit called ""samurai bride"". didin\'t watch this one and not gonna watch it. not for me... so one day I downloaded that hyakka ryouran samurai girls and started to watch. well they show boobs so...yes they show boobs there.

It's a warning you perhaps do not wish or care to hear but one i must inform you thusly. There will be positive comments throughout but they will all fall eventually into a melancholic tone to highlight certain disappointments.This show can be summarised in the following sentence; that is to say if i do not go off on a random tangent instead, big breasted female samurai fight against villains. That is, there are only two villains of the...show but one of them isn't really that bad. He's just extreme. There are also only two males who actually do something. I believe there to be a third but he would hardly count and you do hear about other males but they are never seen. Expect a lot of harem clichés to slither their way in and out of the plot. I say out but to be fair they never leave. They stick around to the end. I will not claim Hyakka to be great and groundbreaking for its genre or claim it to be so terrible it's an insult.The setting for this show is a hard one to grasp. At first you start thinking perhaps it is set in the edo period or a period similar but then a character whips out a computer from nowhere. Unless the writer of this show knows something the rest of the world doesn't. I don't think they had computers that far back, at the very least, we do know it is set in Japan and that it is set among very traditional Japanese people; Dojo's, Kimono's, those sliding doors. Not really surprising. It would be weird having a samurai show in modern day Tokyo or something. It's one of the shows facets that help it differ from the likes of Sekirei and Ikkitousen.Each character from this show i found out (help from wikipedia was much appreciated) shares their name with famous Japanese icons from the past albeit gender flipped and huge personality changes. I mean ALL of the characters do, not just a couple or a few. There are two who do not however rendering my previous inflection on 'all' moot. Muneakira is our harem protagonist and to be fair to him he is a lot better at it than most HPs but he isn't that great. He actually does very little but what he did do was pretty bad ass. Yukimura is a small flat chested girl and is basically the 'smart' one of the group. Sen is the Ojou type who is incredibly bossy but does lessen as time goes on. These two become quite obsessed with the HP at times, i know, a pain right? Jubei is a slpit personality of sorts and claims the family name Yagyu, the exact same as our HP, yes they managed to throw in the classic non blood related little sister. Her 'other' half is so cool, that it can be forgiven. Matabei, Kanetsugu and Hanzo are pretty much there for the fan service. I mean, Matabei only ever wears a loincloth and a small shirt, Hanzo's attire consist os the standard maid uniform and Kanetsugu looks like Hatsune Miku of Vocaloid fame. With the abundance of clichés you should expect these characters clothes to get shred to pieces. I watched the blu ray (oh boy the blu ray) so everything was revealed in full HD. Something of which is hard to explain to people walking by glancing at what i am watching and having to explain not all anime is tentacle and boobs. Ah yes. I do believe i forgot to mention there are in fact two separate tentacle monsters and an invisible fiend. If you do not possess the ability to see me through your computer monitor i am as of mentioning the three monsters, shaking my head. You do have a blond haired big breasted d'Artagnan to look forward to (or straight at if you tend to perv).The music was an area i don't have any particular feelings towards. The opening is enjoyable as far as openings go. I will listen to it for one minute thirty every episode but i will not hunt down the full mp3 anytime soon. Same goes for the ending. Had i not watched this on my tv but instead on my laptop i would most certainly have skipped it. Now holding my hands up in regret, i did not pay an attention to the background music for the most part. That is not a good thing, if it didn't stand out it was probably out sounded by speech or destruction or just wasn't very good at all. My money being the latter. One thing i did notice a couple of times. The battle music sounded awfully similar to Black Lagoons opening theme song.The voice actors did an ok job. I watched both sub and dub. Well only about a thirds worth of it subbed but still subbed non the less. Now there were a couple of moments in which phrases such as; 'Ooooh' and 'Aaaah' would uttered from my lips in reply to the occasionally badly acted line but i would put the blame on the scrip more than the actors. This is a show in which the sub out ways the dub but i would recommend watching the dubbed version due to the reason stated in my next paragraph.The best part of is the art. Not necessarily the greatest compliment you could get. In fiction i consider the story and characters to be far more important than how good something looks. Here though it should be seen as a compliment as had this show used a regular art style it wouldn't stand out in the least. Everything is drawn with a thick black outline compared to a normal thin line that may not even be black. Often when looking at a still you could compare it to a more traditional western comic book. They also had some fun with color. The entire final abttle is in black and white. Not the kind of black and white where it's drawn in color and then a black and white gradient map in Photoshop has been applied leaving a more grey feel to. No. This is drawn verbatim. Black shadows and outlines. White everything else. It really did make it look quite nice. They also used blood splatter on a regular basis. Even in calm moments just to pan from scene to scene. It was a nice change. Even during battle certain characters had different color motifs.The art is the single part of Hyakka that sets it apart from the crap you usually find in battle harems. It is also why i probably would never recommend Hyakka Ryouran to anybody. Because what am i supposed to say? 'Watch Hyakka, it looks pretty', i'll likely get replies along the lines of 'Sod off' or 'anime always looks good idiot' or 'So does Gankutsuou and that's better'. Anyway, i find this show to be top of it genre, not really a compliment in as much, the rest is just shite. Quite frankly my dear the bad far out way the good and i can fully understand why it has the MAL rating it does. show but one of them isn't really that bad. He's just extreme. There are also only two males who actually do something. I believe there to be a third but he would hardly count and you do hear about other males but they are never seen. Expect a lot of harem clichés to slither their way in and out of the plot. I say out but to be fair they never leave. They stick around to the end. I will not claim Hyakka to be great and groundbreaking for its genre or claim it to be so terrible it's an insult.The setting for this show is a hard one to grasp. At first you start thinking perhaps it is set in the edo period or a period similar but then a character whips out a computer from nowhere. Unless the writer of this show knows something the rest of the world doesn't. I don't think they had computers that far back, at the very least, we do know it is set in Japan and that it is set among very traditional Japanese people; Dojo's, Kimono's, those sliding doors. Not really surprising. It would be weird having a samurai show in modern day Tokyo or something. It's one of the shows facets that help it differ from the likes of Sekirei and Ikkitousen.Each character from this show i found out (help from wikipedia was much appreciated) shares their name with famous Japanese icons from the past albeit gender flipped and huge personality changes. I mean ALL of the characters do, not just a couple or a few. There are two who do not however rendering my previous inflection on 'all' moot. Muneakira is our harem protagonist and to be fair to him he is a lot better at it than most HPs but he isn't that great. He actually does very little but what he did do was pretty bad ass. Yukimura is a small flat chested girl and is basically the 'smart' one of the group. Sen is the Ojou type who is incredibly bossy but does lessen as time goes on. These two become quite obsessed with the HP at times, i know, a pain right? Jubei is a slpit personality of sorts and claims the family name Yagyu, the exact same as our HP, yes they managed to throw in the classic non blood related little sister. Her 'other' half is so cool, that it can be forgiven. Matabei, Kanetsugu and Hanzo are pretty much there for the fan service. I mean, Matabei only ever wears a loincloth and a small shirt, Hanzo's attire consist os the standard maid uniform and Kanetsugu looks like Hatsune Miku of Vocaloid fame. With the abundance of clichés you should expect these characters clothes to get shred to pieces. I watched the blu ray (oh boy the blu ray) so everything was revealed in full HD. Something of which is hard to explain to people walking by glancing at what i am watching and having to explain not all anime is tentacle and boobs. Ah yes. I do believe i forgot to mention there are in fact two separate tentacle monsters and an invisible fiend. If you do not possess the ability to see me through your computer monitor i am as of mentioning the three monsters, shaking my head. You do have a blond haired big breasted d'Artagnan to look forward to (or straight at if you tend to perv).The music was an area i don't have any particular feelings towards. The opening is enjoyable as far as openings go. I will listen to it for one minute thirty every episode but i will not hunt down the full mp3 anytime soon. Same goes for the ending. Had i not watched this on my tv but instead on my laptop i would most certainly have skipped it. Now holding my hands up in regret, i did not pay an attention to the background music for the most part. That is not a good thing, if it didn't stand out it was probably out sounded by speech or destruction or just wasn't very good at all. My money being the latter. One thing i did notice a couple of times. The battle music sounded awfully similar to Black Lagoons opening theme song.The voice actors did an ok job. I watched both sub and dub. Well only about a thirds worth of it subbed but still subbed non the less. Now there were a couple of moments in which phrases such as; 'Ooooh' and 'Aaaah' would uttered from my lips in reply to the occasionally badly acted line but i would put the blame on the scrip more than the actors. This is a show in which the sub out ways the dub but i would recommend watching the dubbed version due to the reason stated in my next paragraph.The best part of is the art. Not necessarily the greatest compliment you could get. In fiction i consider the story and characters to be far more important than how good something looks. Here though it should be seen as a compliment as had this show used a regular art style it wouldn't stand out in the least.

I saw the trailer, and was unbelieving. I watched the entire series, and now am a believer. This is one of the most unique and well done art styles I have seen in an anime in a long time. The heavy lines, softness of the colors, detail, all combines to make it very nice to watch.Granted, there is a lot of fan service. And I agree with others assessment, the ink blots used to cover naughty bits was annoying, especially in combat. However, getting the blu-ray version obviously fixed this problem.I don't have...a problem with naughty bits, in fact it is a plus for me. (I am a guy duh) But I don't like that it will take away from some of the demographic because of that. With such great art, action and story, I know there are people that will miss out because of it. a problem with naughty bits, in fact it is a plus for me.

The main charecter is only stereo typical in that he is a tad shy about sex (like most maile leads in ecchi anime), but that forgivable aspect aside he is a highly skilled samurai.  With fresh visuals and a good use of sound to compliment them you should have a good time with this show.Story: I would have given this show a lower value if is wasnt for the last 2 episodes.  So far the story has been very bland, but as of episodes 10 and 11 the plot has...finally begun to move and its much more enjoyable.  Basically something evil is moving towards japan and the two sides that can do anything about it are fighting each other, because one wants total power and the other group is made up of our free spirited protagonists.Art: Wow.  The first episode should give you an idea of the art style they choice for this show, and I have to say it is fantastic.  I know that some people might be turned off by black paint strokes in the middle of the screen and dripping paint for a transition, but it works for me, if only because its very unique.Sound: The sound is also fantastic and it compliments the tone and the visuals quite well.Character:  The characters that make up samurai girls start off one dimensional but grow into fully fleshed out people while the show itself grows in scope.  I find this to be a pleasing formula and some how they pulled it off.Enjoyment:  Fun, funny and action oriented this show should if nothing else entertain you for its duration.  But by no means will it leave you with any lasting impressions. finally begun to move and its much more enjoyable.

Of course to get through this you have to be ok with Ecchi, but if you enjoy Ecchi then this is right up your alley.  There are great fights, and intriguing premise, and moderately well developed characters.  Sure alot of the things in here have been done before, but this anime manages to have fun without losing sight of the importance of the plot.  Sure there is fan service and the requisite awkward situations, it still maintains a serious undertone since the fate of Japan is riding on them.  Overall a great little...series, more than worth watching. series, more than worth watching.', ""I figured for my first speed review I'd try to do my best not to completely berate an anime or worship it as a deity (Edit: I failed). What better to do it on than Hyakka Ryouran?Possibly the worst anime I've ever watched. However, it DID manage to get on my watched(completed) list, instead of the pile of crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, the (dropped) list. Which makes me ponder how I ever finished it.I can't really be unbiased, because I honestly hate almost every single aspect of this show. The story is border line retarded, there is little character development,...and none of the characters are all that likable. (save maybe the sadistic side of Yagyu Jubei, but then again, I seem have an affinity for crazy psycho bitches)The main character was as interesting as a pile of dog crap, and that's as far as I'll go into. None of the girls had any depth. The main heroine (the mya~ side of Yagyu Jubei) had the personality and intelligence of a 5 month old kitten. Don't get me wrong, I quite like kittens, I just wouldn't want one for a girlfriend nor a main heroine.One of my biggest gripes with this show is, the main villain general guy... douchefag. This is one of the most hated characters on my hated characters list.One of the biggest pet peeves I have, are guys who treat girls like shit, and guys that wear dicks on their heads. This guy is both.Often times villains fall into four categories. Ones which you can hate with all your heart, ones you can fear and admire, ones you can connect with, and the random bunches of monsters demons and angels that want humans dead. The only downfall with the first type of villian, is for some reason, more than 50% the time, they get forgiven, have a change of heart and do a 180.Bullshit! These villains spend the majority of the anime fueling my hate, keeping me watching and hoping for the satisfying moment when they get their heads torn off and necks shatted down à la Duke Nukem style. But no, they often give some bullshit reason for why they did what they did, in hopes of having the viewer connect with them.Too late!! I already hate them with all my heart. They doesn't deserve retribution, they just needs to dieee.But on to why I started the show. The animation is.. amazing. It is one of the best animation styles I have ever seen. The whole entire feel of the anime is like a 1950's samurai movie. The ink tones, outlines, and colors are beautiful. Random ink splotches filled the screen at times, making the anime feel like a beautiful work of calligraphy. Even the censors are brilliantly done (via conveniently placed inkblots). Which makes it such a shame, that the story and characters are so god damn awful.This well done animation (and the hopes of seeing the main villain murdered brutally at the end) is the ONLY thing that kept me watching. With knowing that *SPOILER*, that asshole doesn't die in a complete satisfying bloody mess, nor the main character, nor any of the other retarded characters in this show. It's really hard to recommend this.If you want to see mindless action and fan-service go for it. You might actually get enjoy the wonderful animation, that is if you don't blow your brains out halfway through due to the complete retardedness of all the characters.(Alright I confess. As my first review, it was a little rushed. It's prolly been more than 3 years since I've watched it. During which I was half dazed, in awe of the animation, and half trying to blow my brains out from the god awful storyline/characters. So it's not as in depth, well put, and unbiased as I wanted.

The fact that there are a lot of ''nude'' (censored but still) scene's bothered me at first but well, i guess some people are into that.I really liked the way the main characters are introduced because you know from the beginning what they are like and how they react to things. I also really liked the fact that Jubei had two personalities and at the beginning you thought they were opposite from each other but...at the end they had a lot in conmen.I liked the art and sound but didn't love it but that might be because the videos i watched were bad quality. I think it's a bit to 'blurry' (That's not the right word for it but i can't think of the right word, but it is close) buy the sound was fine, nothing special really.Overall i did really enjoy it but the 'nude' scenes could be, well, scripted out i guess ;).

A storyline revolving around samurais? Check. Edgy visuals that make the anime stand out from the rest? Check. Fan service? Double check. All the ingredients to make a great anime series are present, which makes it all the more perplexing that Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls turned out to be a complete failure of a show.Let’s start at the beginning. Taking place in Great Japan in an alternate timeline where the samurai tradition has been kept alive through modern age, the show...starts off with the arrival of protagonist Muneakira Yagyuu at a samurai academy, where he accidentally stumbles upon Yukimura Sanada and her bodyguard Matabei Gotou as the two undress, encounters childhood friend and princess of the Tokugawa clan Sen Tokugawa, meets the quirky Jubei who he seems to share a special connection with, and otherwise gets to know a good deal of other female students. However, no one seems to be aware of the fact that Great Japan is standing before a grave threat; one that shares a long history with the country.It’s hard to get a good sense of what Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is about during the first episodes, because when it comes to story progression, the series is all over the place. Taking a look at the first half of the show’s episodes, close to nothing happens that is relevant to the plot. It seems as though the anime forgot that it actually has a story to tell, concentrating too much on trying to deliver as much entertainment value as possible, but ultimately failing in that respect as well, with many jokes simply falling flat and the amount of humour ending up to be rather insufficient overall.The second half of the series isn’t much better either. Whereas the earlier episodes seemed to go nowhere, the final ones feel extremely rushed. Characters are introduced on the go, the antagonistic threat literally appears out of the blue, and the plot suddenly rises in scale with no explanation whatsoever. In addition, despite having so much time on its hands to allot for character development (early on the episodes are basically just various interactions between characters put together to reach the twenty minute mark), most characters end up feeling rather underdeveloped, with protagonists such as Jubei and Muneakira turning out to be nothing more than cardboard cut-outs of anime stereotypes as the show concludes.The only thing preventing Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls from being a complete waste of time is the visual department, where the series clearly stands out. Boasting an unconventional look, the show features a stunning art style comprised of detailed—albeit not particularly original—character design, backgrounds in wash painting style, and ink drops marking scene transitions and censorship, in case you’re watching the censored version. The animation is also relatively well-done, though for an anime revolving around samurai warriors, the amount of fight and action scenes is surprisingly sparse.Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls also lacks in scope. Aside from a number of scenes that I can count on the fingers of one hand, only the characters relevant the plot are shown, making the anime unbelievably disconnected from the world the story takes place in and causing the experience of watching the show to feel like a far-off and underwhelming venture.

What purpose did it really serve?  Maybe I just don't remember.  Then there is Matabei and Yukimura.  Both of them are the bad guys, or at least that is what it seems like when the show first starts.  Then all of a sudden they are not the bad guys.

I had never heard about this until I watched it, and DAMN was I happy with it.This is a harem series as it follows our main male protagonist muneakira and the band of big-boobed, (with one exception) weapon-wielding girls that follow him around all the time. He appeals to everyone, be it; a princess, her archenemy, a few servants, and all the naked girls falling from the sky... Yes, naked women rain down on this guy all the damn time. After this I decided that I should move to wherever the hell this takes place, because the climate here sounds way more...awesome than where I live.Back to the harem part, whats a good harem without high amounts of meaningless fanservice? This show is like tits en masse! Be it all the girls jumping in baths together, or just grabbin on each other all the time, or whippin em out for muneakira's sake there are enough titty flashes to sink a really big ship!The story kinda just floats along with the happy harem on one side, and the devious plot to fight an ancient enemy on the other. The nice thing with this show is that it doesnt wait until the last episode to do something, it actually gets some fights and shit going halfway through which as far as anime goes, is pretty good. The downside is that we hear samurai and we want some amazing fights, well thats not gonna happen here, we get some okay fights, and of couse a big showdown, but we have to remember that the main part of the story is going to be focused on the harem/ romance stuff.The art is pretty cool to me because it is actually quite simple but it looks so good at the same time.The characters are all good, shallow perhaps, but c'mon its harem! all they have to to is have big jugs(with that one exception) and they're in!I enjoyed watching this alot, in fact once i finished, I immediately watched it again, and thats what you should take away from this.Also, I am a firm believer that a shows music can make or break it, and I loved the theme songs for this, they were fucking awesome!!This is all i have, if you like romance, tits, humor, more tits, and an interesting story this is definitely something you should consider watching. awesome than where I live.Back to the harem part, whats a good harem without high amounts of meaningless fanservice?

The male protagonist has the ability to transform the females into overly powerful warriors called Master Samurai, and that's basically it. It kind of reminds me of Sekirei. The plot had a LOT of potential, but was drowned out by the fan service and comedic attempts, and so many character introductions. If the anime wasn't so short, and they focused on the plot more, this could have been an incredible anime that was very different from all of the other ecchi/harem anime. Overall, the plot was poorly executed...and the comedy isn't all that great either.Art:The art is beautiful. The style has a nice look to it, and I particularly like the character design of the male protagonist. The background artwork looks like something you may see in an old Asian painting. The animation is smooth, and the few fight scenes that were there were pretty cool. The fact that they integrated ink splotches to make the anime seem like a painting was very nice. However, I feel like they over did it with the ink transitions; they happened way too frequently and kind of got annoying. The ink censorship was also very distracting in the censored version, but I watched the uncensored version so I didn't mind much.Sound:There was nothing particularly good or bad about the music in my opinion.Characters:The characters were the basic characters you'd expect in a harem/battle anime. We have the oblivious, yet pure-hearted male. We have the super-smart loli female, arrogant yet beautiful female, cool headed female, masochistic female, annoying female that is unimportant, and an antagonist who treats his female partner like trash. We received barely any character development for any of these characters since there were so many to be introduced, so when love scenes started, they seemed a bit rushed.Enjoyment:Even though the love scenario was rushed, I still sort of enjoyed it, and the art was very nice to watch. The fan service may have been to much, though. I had a feeling the plot wasn't going to be performed as well as it had potential for while watching this series, but I still hoped that it would pick up, and it didn't. The end, like all of the other developments, was rushed. I still managed to enjoy it though.Overall:This anime wasn't very well executed in the story or character department, which is essential for a successful anime. The art was incredible, but it would have been nice to see more serious battle scenes rather than so much fan service. How can so many breasts be exposed so easily!? Either way, if you really enjoy ecchi anime, or nice artwork, and don't mind the bad characters and storyline, then you might want to give this one a try.

Almost. A fascinating introduction informs us that this show will combine historical elements with fantasy and science fiction elements. Somehow, in this world of Zeppelins, DragonBall-style scouters, and bio genetic mutations, the Tokugawan Shogunate is in charge. And this re-imaged version of the Tokugawan Shogunate maintains its grip of power by utilizing attractive female super-warriors that it calls ""Master Samurai"". Now, this is all pretty far out there, but its also kind of cool, and after the first episode I was eager to see where they were...going with it. The premise felt very promising.The show becomes more and more complex, with naked Samurai-girls mysteriously descending from the sky, and angles relating to a government conspiracy unfolding. I don\'t shy away from complex stories, but its clear that they bit off more than they could chew with this one. As far as the romance goes, wait did i say romance? This isn\'t meant to be a sweeping love drama. It\'s a harem anime; you get your typical haphazard sexual tension with jealousy at first. It certainly never takes itself too seriously in this aspect, but as a result it\'s never particularly moving either.The Characters in Hyakka Ryouran are, as a rule of thumb, flat. Occasionally we\'ll get a flashback that attempts to inform us more of that characters resolve, but these flashbacks usually aren\'t very exciting or interesting and mostly forced and not properly integrated into the experience. Most of the characters don\'t even receive this treatment, and we are instead left with stock characters pasted into the story to fulfill their purpose. Among these are the hotheaded, pampered princess, Sen Tokugawa, the super genius-tsundere Yukimura Sanada, and the male character who does absolutely nothing but act as plot-glue for the girls, Muneakira. I don\'t want to give away spoilers, but you will see when you start watching it. What exactly is the MC\'s main role?They are not, however, without their positive qualities. Aesthetically, almost all of the characters have an interesting design (at least the female ones.) And despite being generic, the characters aren\'t unlikable. Characters such as Yukimura fulfill an archetype that works; and it would take a person without a heart to hate the adorable Jyuubei. Aside from that though their really is nothing redeeming or inspiring bout the characters in this show.This show\'s artistic style boiled down to one word: ink. This was never meant to be a series that looks ""normal"" like other animation. Character outlines here are strikingly bold, but the thickness of the lines vary as if it were done with a brush stroke. Backgrounds appear to have been painted in a similar way. It never looks bad, but it\'s also strange to see this application of style in an anime.  It appears more to be a style used in visual novels or video games. Still, it looks great when animated; screen captures do it little justice. Hyakka Ryouran\'s love affair with ink doesn\'t end with the character and background lines though. During battles, the ink blots actually splash off of the characters weapons onto the ""camera."" During transitional screens, the ink blots are again prevalent. In fact, even the rain is drawn boldly in black, as if it were meant to be ink. Not even the opening and ending videos are spared the splatter. This effect is really incredible in episode one, but by episode twelve, it begins to feel really stale. They did something great, but they went back to the well too often with it. This is perhaps my personal most favorite aspect of the show, no joke. It reminds me of some video games like ""Okami"" or Muramasa the demon Blade\'s visual anesthetic art style.Now speaking of the music.  I will say that the opening song is what actually drew me to this show in the first place, the opening is very catchy and a great j-pop with a mix of rock in it. I truly enjoyed the opening and it even gave that unique artistic style in the first episode, the moment i watched the opening, i was drawn to the series. As far as the music in the series it self, it was pretty mediocre. The music did improve towards the end of the series.The animation quality is high, and the visual effects look quite good. Unfortunately, none of the battles in the show have any punch to them. They feel as though just pretty pictures of still images on screen flashing back and forth during transitioning of scenes.I do want to say that one thing I found appealing was that the girls each have their own unique attacks which appear on the screen (written in ink of course.) I found this aspect kind of cool. I am not sure if different fansubs differ in that regards but i watched the Ryuumaru fansubs and each character, along with attacks had their own colored texts.Final WordsHonestly, if you\'ve read this far you\'ve probably already decided whether or not you\'re going to watch this show. It\'s an ecchi. If you\'re planning to watch it, it\'s for the blend of comedy and the fan service even though the comedy was not that hilarious to me. I had a few chuckles here and their but thats bout it. You\'re going to get all of the breasts shots, tits and even ass. Lots of soft core nudity as expected with most harems. Think about (Sekirei). If moments like that are what you\'re after, you won\'t be disappointed.Aside from that, Hyakka Ryouran doesn\'t have much going for it, though. Everyone should watch at least one episode just to get a sense of the unique style, since it is something different, and it\'s something kind of cool. Ikki tousen ( I am taking bout the 1st season of course) came to mind well watching this, but as sup bar as ikki tousen is, i would say that ikki tousen does a more improved job of integrating the story and not just heavily focusing on ecchi as a primary core element of the series. Taking into account everything, else, story, plot, character development, i am going to say pass on this one.  Their are much better samurai girl anime\'s out their. going with it.

It actually had some very good moments in it.Unfortunately those moments were few and far between.Overall though this isn't the worst anime I have seen and I did enjoy it. It's a good anime if you just feel like binge watching an anime, but only have one day to do it.Also this is a good anime if you want to see boobs, lots of boobs. Also if you aren't into anime like that then this is not the anime for you. "", ""Though it's harem and a bit too erotic, I like Hyakka Ryouran. The lineart is good. The characters are cute, especially Juubei. What I love most of all is the setting. Imagine if the Tokugawa era really went on until the 21st century. Wouldn't it be fun. It's classic yet modern. "", 'I liked the premise behind this anime especially the fact that it was set in an alternate Japan during the 21st century where the Tokugawa Shogunate is still in power instead of Imperial rule being restored.  I like how each character has a name that is related to actual people who existed in the past.  One thing about the anime I really enjoyed was the animations.  This is the first anime I have ever seen where the animations remind me of a manga, it is a very clever idea.  Although the story was clever I think they should have put more...of an emphasis on the main character I am referring the General.  Although his samurai’s followed him without question I couldn’t get over the fact that he seemed like he had no ability.  The anime shows a flash of his ability in the first episode which is what originally made me want to see this show; however, they really stopped developing him as a character as the show progressed.  The ending was spectacular but the finale left me quite angry and disappointed.  I do hear that there are some new ova’s coming out though so maybe that will sooth the anger.

My overall thoughts are: The artwork is oustanding but the story inst that good this is just another fanservice harem anime with amazing artwork ^_^ "", 'This is a review of the censored TV version of the show:Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls is another representative of a show that started with potential but failed due to bad direction. I\'ll state my main gripes first before stating the main aspects that were appealing. First off I\'ll say that if you seek echii content, this ""may"" be an ok anime to watch (which I\'ll explain later); if you seek story then you should turn to a different anime.The story overall was pretty generic and in my opinion, was pretty forgettable for about half of the season. Hyakka Ryouran is a harem, and being...a harem, it suffered at multiple points. The whole general-sword master idea reeked of the near identical Ashkabi-Sekirei relationship which only stopped pissing me off when I realized there were no more new characters to be introduced. Character development was nothing special, I would say that the only thing that was different is that the male protagonist was not \'as\' pitiful as other shows. My biggest pet peeve is probably the overuse of the ink blot effect. It could have been an extremely enjoyable effect but it ended up being the one thing I hated most since it was blatantly used to censor any nudity.That being said, Hyakka Ryouran does have some nice artwork, not the ""best"" but pretty good. The art took on a sort of pastel look multiple times and at multiple times the animation was recognizably different from most animes, sort of how Bakemonogatari had a unique feel to it. If you take out the bad ink effects, the ink blot during the fight scenes really caught my eye in a good way. Also, I did like how the colors ""white"" and ""black"" didn\'t necessarily mean ""good"" and ""evil"". I said above that ecchi seekers may like this anime, which is true if you watch the uncensored DVD version. If you watch the censored for echiiness, you may notice the ink blots even more than I did, though it isn\'t to the degree of Seikon no Qwaser (which I did watch for echiness). I can\'t post my final positive since it may be considered a spoiler but its more on the lines of the lack there of than something that was in the anime.I finished this anime with a feeling of disappointment and will be highly surprised if a sequel is made. Watch once if you\'re interested in some of the art concepts but don\'t get your hopes up for anything else. Rated \'6\' for fine a harem, it suffered at multiple points.

Unfortunately my cable was out and so I was stuck here lol. But seriously, I have been watching a lot of serious titles recently, including the new season of Samurai Jack. So i wanted to take a break and watch a light hearted rom-com. Seeing how this too was about samurais, I thought why not. So let\'s slice into this one.Story: 6I have to say, I barely recall the story from beginning to end. I remember the set...up well enough but the details of each episode more or less are foggy. I can already see you going ""Duh, its a harem. The plot was going to be boring and forgettable from the start"". To you I say, yea I know. But I honestly tried to care. Set up wise, you have a guy who is called to an academy to help look into a string of disappearances but suddenly catches a girl who fell from the sky. When he catches her, she turns into what the story calls a ""master samurai"" and it turns out he has the power to make people (girls) into them. The story then put the investigation part on the sidelines and focused on what harems normally do, the girls. Like I said, this story isn\'t much that will stick with you. It does make headway in the end and does manage to have a conclusion. They also shoehorn a revival at the last minute. No dialogue, no build up, just boom..... alive.Art and Sound: 7 and 7This is one of those times where the artists said they wanted to have a unique theme and would never stray from it. They went for the brush painting look, which means that aside from the characters, the setting, transitions, and effects will look like they were done with a brush and ink. At first it will look cool and unique but believe me when I say it gets annoying. I ended up getting used to it, but still cringed when the scree would get splattered with ink when people powered up or landed blows. The sound good too. The opening was actually really catchy (and I listened to it the whole time I wrote this too lol). I had a really nice beat to it; I would probably pin that to the electronic bass. The ending is also a really cool track as well that I actually listened through to the end instead of just hopping to the next episode. Although, much like the story, I don\'t remember any memorable tracks that played during the episode. Voice acting was also pretty as nobody really sounded out of place.Character: 6Speaking of characters, let\'s open this bag and take in the smell of tsundere for a minute. Yea, a harem that used a different flavor of the same archetype. Before that let\'s talk main male lead. Our piece of Osmium (the densest element the naturally forms for you chemistry fact of the day) is Muneakira (yes I had to look up the spelling). He is a normal samurai who got roped into the role as piece of meat that girls seem to like. The guy at least knows how to fight, but ends up letting the girls do much of the work for him. Morally in the right place and emotionally hopeless. Although he at least admits he can\'t decide from them. Now for the fifty shades of tsundere. Well our first girl actually acts like a dimwit most of the time but she has a hidden tsundere who when in battle. The next girl is a smart tsundere whose ego for her brain is meant to cover her lack of features. The third is the tsundere childhood friend who can\'t help but continuously boss the lead around. It ends there for the fawning girls but there are other pieces of eye candy. The problem with these characters are that they only follow their archetype, which just gets old when they consist one type.Enjoyment: 7In a way, I could of just stopped watching this and not given a damn about the ending. Although, I stuck with it because there was still a story to follow, and it came through in the end. I probably won\'t rewatch this but considering how I forgot most of the plot by the time I wrote this, I may just rewatch it just to remember. All in all though, it was an alright show and left me with enough energy to watch season 2.Overall: 7 up well enough but the details of each episode more or less are foggy. I can already see you going ""Duh, its a harem. The plot was going to be boring and forgettable from the start"". To you I say, yea I know. But I honestly tried to care. Set up wise, you have a guy who is called to an academy to help look into a string of disappearances but suddenly catches a girl who fell from the sky. When he catches her, she turns into what the story calls a ""master samurai"" and it turns out he has the power to make people (girls) into them. The story then put the investigation part on the sidelines and focused on what harems normally do, the girls. Like I said, this story isn\'t much that will stick with you. It does make headway in the end and does manage to have a conclusion. They also shoehorn a revival at the last minute. No dialogue, no build up, just boom..... alive.Art and Sound: 7 and 7This is one of those times where the artists said they wanted to have a unique theme and would never stray from it. They went for the brush painting look, which means that aside from the characters, the setting, transitions, and effects will look like they were done with a brush and ink. At first it will look cool and unique but believe me when I say it gets annoying. I ended up getting used to it, but still cringed when the scree would get splattered with ink when people powered up or landed blows. The sound good too. The opening was actually really catchy (and I listened to it the whole time I wrote this too lol). I had a really nice beat to it; I would probably pin that to the electronic bass. The ending is also a really cool track as well that I actually listened through to the end instead of just hopping to the next episode. Although, much like the story, I don\'t remember any memorable tracks that played during the episode. Voice acting was also pretty as nobody really sounded out of place.Character: 6Speaking of characters, let\'s open this bag and take in the smell of tsundere for a minute.

When I saw nearly naked chicks taking down B29s in flight and ignoring .50 cal machine gun fire. I thought this has to be some sort of idiotic stroke fest.Man was I wrong.Once you start watching this it's really something else. The artwork leaps out at you and is easily the most unique and interesting I have ever seen. Instead of trying for the usual not quite realistic art that most anime strive for, Samurai Girls shoots for Sengoku Period art for the settings/( Height of the...samurai era). It's a really welcome change. There is real work put into making the backgrounds look Japanese and interesting.   Everything from the palette choice to the shading is just spot on.Samurai girls doesn't stop with just really unique background art. The characters are the absolute best you are going to get outside of a CGI movie. You have faces with shading, actually having noses, proper profiles and all well animated. Their bodies are equally well done. They are well drawn and realistic. And yes you will be seeing a lot of them, enjoy.You can watch Samurai Girls just for the artwork and never regret it.The English dub has some fantastic voice acting. The actors consistently hit the right tone and have a wide range. When someone is shocked and forced back on their heels, the voice acting conveys it. Anger, Happiness, to sheer irksomeness are all distinct  (Man there really needs to be a separate rating category for voice acting).I really wish the story was as good as the art. It definitely works but has too many stupid moments and cliches. You get the usual bait and switch going on when it comes to people trying to finish any plot related action. Death isn't necessarily death. Characters power up/ power down on a whim. It's not just girls that drop out of the sky for no reason.On the plus side the story is fast paced so any particular problem doesn't linger long and is never rubbed in your face. The jokes are pretty good and well executed. It also has a well defined arc that does conclude.TL:DR Samurai Girls is a treat to watch enjoy. samurai era). It's a really welcome change.

The art work was unique and the fight scenes were enjoyable, but the plot was underdeveloped. I felt like the anime was rushed and it seemed like the standard harem anime. ', 'To be honest, I was deceived by popularity and great animation of this series.There’s a long review coming…..About the STORYThere was nothing new about the story. A typical harem accompanied with gigantic bouncing boobs of girls who would always show it to the male lead. Harem type of story is one of my most hated genres of all. It is always about a boy who would be surrounded by so many girls and usually they are the ones who protect the boy. And the indecisiveness of the boy is another irritating thing. In this series, like always the boy needed physical contact with the...female leads as so they can transform and power-up. And to make the complete cliché of all, the girls were always doing lewd things or exposing themselves to the male lead. I mean come on! What is so amazing about a large number of girls fighting over one single guy? One of the irritating thing, the drama was too over-the-top. The dialogues were also so damn cheesy and too dramatic. It’s not touching at all and worst, it became so irritating. The plot and storyline is not interesting at all. It’s very much like, “I’ve seen that before” . The main plot seemed very interesting at first but it was not realized at all until the series ended.About the CHARACTERSOf course, the characters were also too cliché. A guy so indecisive and so naïve that he was easily manipulated. He was always protected by his samurai girls and he was supposedly an amazing person enough to be qualified as a general. I didn’t felt his supposedly amazing character at all. All he did was shout some over dramatic lines whenever they are in pinch and that was it. And the girls are like always, would fight over him. They were complete with tsundere type girl, chivalrous girl, childish girl, and so on. Typical type of girls surrounding a male lead. All of them were not likeable at all. Almost all the character was so irritating at one point.About the ANIMATIONThe only thing that was amazing about this series was the animation. In fact, this was one of the reasons why I was interested in the first place. It was not just one of the best. You can even consider the animation of it as great or even better compared to some of the most famous animes of today. It was very original and such a refreshment. The illustrations and artworks were so brilliant. It was like a breath of fresh air from your typical animation. It made all the visual effects and fight scenes so magnificent. The characters and landscapes are made amazingly and very unique.The worst thing for a viewer to feel is to wonder why they are even watching this thing! Having an amazing animation is definitely not enough. Ah! I’ve done it again! I always do this. Thinking that because it is popular and have such an amazing animation, I would always expect an anime to be such an amazing one. I never learn. Lesson learned: Just because it is great for so many that doesn’t necessarily mean it will great for me as well. female leads as so they can transform and power-up.

It's a good time waster but to be honest the only reason I watched it was because of the art, and because of that I give the art a 9/10. The art is very unique compared to other anime. At first I thought it was cool but at the same time didn't like it, but within time I began to love it. Overall this anime isn't really for those who...are looking for cool samurai fights. (You have been warned) are looking for cool samurai fights. (You have been warned)"", 'tl;dr: An anime that has a plot that isn’t particularly deep or well told, but that is still pretty enjoyable due to good comedy and action.This anime is centered in a strange world that’s kind of like Japan in the late Edo era, but with modern and even futuristic technology. So you get steam locomotives and cell phones, katanas and flash grenades, hacking supercomputers to uncover masterplans and chopping firewood for the bath, etc. The architecture is also consistent with this dichotomy, wherein it’s either Edo style or futuristic. It’s a bizarre mix, but one that I’ve seen a few times in a couple other...places, mainly in JRPGs, and one that I’ve grown fond of. As is generally the case with such settings, there’s a very strong emphasis on samurai, at least at a superficial level, wherein the protagonist, Muneakira, is a skilled samurai that was called in to take over the Yagyuu dojo at the base of Mount Fuji. It is stated at the beginning that he was called in by the student council of a certain high school and is expected to attend said high school but that’s never really brought up again and he never actually goes to school.Rather, the anime becomes one that for the most part is set essentially entirely in the Yagyuu dojo where a bunch of girls end up surrounding Muneakira after it is discovered that kissing him results in the kisser gaining the abilities of a Master Samurai. The first main heroine is Juubei, who has a split personality of being a weak airhead in her sealed form, but incredibly powerful and somewhat cold in her Master Samurai form. The other two main heroines would be Sanada Yukimura and Tokugawa Sen both of whom are sharp tongued, prideful, and somewhat tsundere. In addition to that there’s Sanada’s servant Matabei and Sen’s servant, Hanzou, both of whom are incredibly loyal, though that loyalty manifests in different ways, as well as Kanetsugu who is basically just dumb and is there for the purpose of getting picked on. You may have noticed that all of these heroines are based on actual historical figures, or at least legends of them, though the connections are mostly just window dressing.The first seven episodes are solely dedicates to introducing these characters and establishing the relationships they have with one another as they all fight each other. There’s some hints of a larger plot beyond that here and there, but for the most part its character focused and only on those six characters. The presence of characters outside of those few is incredibly minimal. It’s overall not too bad in concept, albeit the implementation is pretty generic with character’s feeling somewhat flat. The bigger problem is that it felt overtly slow. It being somewhat slow in plot isn’t too much of an issue if things were picked up in other areas, but it also felt pretty slow in terms of action and comedy. The action and comedy were both really solid, but it just felt like there wasn’t enough. Thus, it really did feel like it was dragging on a lot.This changes in the final four episodes where the plot gets moving and more characters play a prominent role. Though at this point another issue pops up. The plot and character motivations for characters outside the main six flow pretty badly, with most explanations for things occurring after the fact with no build up. Furthermore, beyond the issues with how it was conveyed, the plot is still only decent, and though it feels character’s have a bit more to them they’re still not particularly deep. Still, in this portion, and to a degree before this, character’s are best when they’re just being amusing or cheesy cool, and this combined with the action getting a lot more intense and well implemented manages to be enough to make the anime pretty solid overall.This anime also felt pretty well produced. The art style is pretty unique in that it has very bold edges and the use of color somewhat resembles Edo paintings, though with the designs themselves being pretty standard for anime from about a decade ago. There’s also the use of lots of ink effects for transitions and during battles, with different colors for the ink for different factions. It’s mainly black vs white, and that focus on black and white is used really well in the final battle. The animation overall is decent, but really manages to shine during certain action scenes, especially the final battle. The soundtrack was better than I expected, especially the tracks used during key scenes during the final few episodes, and overall I found pretty great.

It\'s not a bad film, but doesn\'t offer much other than the typical comedy found in the series yet doesn\'t really have that ""horror vibe"" displayed in the two previous movies. The highlight of this feature is the ending as it portrays Nube once again resorting to a tough life changing decision which adds to his responsibility as an adult & mentor.Not much action, not much horror, nor that much comedy making this film very optional to watch with its only solace being a few pieces of visuals such as the higher quality opening & the conclusion of the film which delivers those ""heart warming moments"" found in the anime series. more rural location & the battle against sea creatures instead of the typical yokai or ghosts.

Juusenki L-Gaim,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2598/Juusenki_L-Gaim,"['Heavy Metal L-Gaim was one of several mecha series director Yoshiyuki Tomino created during the mid-80’s before Sunrise had him working on Gundam practically full-time. As such it provides you with an original story that while sharing certain similarities to his other works, is completely self-contained and can be watched at any time.L-Gaim takes place in the Pentagona system, a system of several planets, ruled by the immortal Oldna Poseidal. The show focuses in particular on Daba Myroad, a teenage boy who pilots the titular mecha L-Gaim, and his various friends including the goofy Mirao Kyao, the aspiring actress Fanneria Amu, former member of the...Poseidal military, Gaw Ha Leccee and the fairy Lillith. One of the few still living members of the Yaman Clan, a group of people wiped out by Poseidal, Daba takes a key part in rebel movements, with the overall goal of someday overthrowing Poseidal’s rule.Tomino’s shows typically alternate between being dark and depressing and lighter hearted and this show is more in the latter camp. While the show is not on the level of say Xabungle or Gundam ZZ, it has a lot of comedy and fun to it. For example the characters are designed as if they are from an 80’s heavy metal band. Kyao and Amu are often providing a lot of comedy relief, as does Gavlet Gablae, a common antagonist for our heroes; the conflict arises because he stole their soup. Yes, that’s right, a series long rivalry comes out of something as incidental as that. Stylistically the show is a lot of fun. There’s not just the design of the characters, but also the music, the mecha, and several different worlds all coming together. As another reviewer pointed out, each episode features a brief shot of an upcoming character, mecha or other plot point, which is unique for a Tomino show (and often treats us to some hilarious engrish).From the other side though the show features a plot that is one of the more complicated from Tomino’s works, especially toward the end of the series. The show features numerous factions, all with their own intentions and each hoping to come out on top. The number of characters is massive, and since this is a show that doesn’t feature a lot of death, the cast just grows bigger and bigger over the course of the show.  Plot twists are both intriguing and deserved.Supposedly the show had a lot of conflict behind the scenes between director Tomino and character/mecha designer Mamoru Nagano. I think the influence of Nagano on this show is quite notable and you will find many similarities with his later work, Five Star Stories. Nagano doesn’t have the strongest character design, but his mecha designs are almost without fail quite beautiful and he’d continue to work with Tomino in Zeta Gundam. A great addition!The show does have a few flaws. Like many 50+ episode Tomino shows, the pacing can be tough at times, especially in the first half of the series. Although I think there generally isn’t a stretch of more than 3-4 episodes where the plot doesn’t start moving in a new direction. Certain characteristics can be annoying to some. Daba having multiple female characters after him throughout the entire series, when he never shows much romantic interest in any of them can get old to many. And while I love how complicated the story gets later, I can certainly see that as a turn off for some people. It’s highly unlikely you’ll fully get everything your first viewing.Overall though, this is a show where the good side outweighs the bad by far.

He was talking about the film ""Dreamcatcher"", but I think that sentiment could easily be applied to Heavy Metal L-GAIM.I will start off by saying that no, L-GAIM is not really a good anime. But it IS entertaining, and if you are a big fan of either Yoshiyuki Tomino or Mamoru Nagano, I would consider this a must-watch series. L-GAIM was the series that Sunrise released right before Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and some of the characters (Daba Myroad and Fanelia Amu...for example) superficially resemble characters that would later appear in Zeta Gundam. And many of the characters and aspects of the world they appear in are recycled by Nagano in his first manga, Fool for the City, released in 1985 right on the heels of this series. It was the very beginning of his epic Five Star Stories manga. L-GAIM mostly feels like two very different creators with very different ideas dueling it out.The story itself really suffers a lot from the poor pacing and direction of the series, but I agree with a friend who described it as ""Star Wars on crack"". L-GAIM takes place in a star system called ""The Pentagona System"" and the main character, Daba Myroad, is the last surviving ruler of a civilization that was exterminated by the empress Poseidal. The list of characters in this series would make your head spin, and they all have crazy names and ridiculous hairstyles and clothes courtesy of Mamoru Nagano. Every other episode ends with a title card that says NEXT DRAMA, NEXT CHARACTER or NEXT HEAVY METAL to give you some idea of what is coming next. All of this makes for very entertaining viewing especially if you have some people over and enough beer for everyone.On to the show\'s actual strengths. First of all, the mechanical designs are, for the most part, really good, which is only to be expected of Nagano. I think the actual L-GAIM itself is one of the best mechanical designs I\'ve ever seen in a mecha anime. Secondly, the characters have a lot of personality and are really what keeps you watching the series. A lot of people complain about the humor and slapstick and whatnot (this show has more animation smears that any other mecha anime I have ever seen), but first of all, it succeeds in actually being funny, and secondly, it endears you to the characters so that later in the show when the conflict intensifies, you actually CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. I won\'t spoil it, but there is a scene in one of the last few episodes where a character I had grown to love is stuck underwater and I was actually on the edge of my seat worried about whether he would live or not. That\'s not something that happens in most Tomino-directed series (sadly) because in most series he\'s directed, the characters feel more like action figures there to warm the seat of the model kits -- I mean, robots. This strategy of using humor to facilitate character development would be re-employed later in Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam to great success.The other aspects of the series, animation, music/sound, etc. are par for the course for a nearly 30-year old television anime. Nothing really to write home about but nothing that really impedes your ability to enjoy what\'s going on. And the two opening theme songs are really quite catchy. If you\'re like me, you\'ll be at work the next day singing ""SAY MARK TWOOOOO"" under your breath hoping nobody can hear you in the next cubicle.In the end, I feel I can only recommend L-GAIM to mecha enthusiasts. A novice probably wouldn\'t appreciate it as much as someone who has already seen at least most of the classic, more well-known series, and you really need to be familiar with both Tomino and Nagano to get maximum enjoyment out of it. But if you\'ve already seen MD GEIST and Garzey\'s Wing a million times and need a new anime to watch on the weekends with your friends while you\'re getting blazed you could do a lot worse than L-GAIM. for example) superficially resemble characters that would later appear in Zeta Gundam. And many of the characters and aspects of the world they appear in are recycled by Nagano in his first manga, Fool for the City, released in 1985 right on the heels of this series. It was the very beginning of his epic Five Star Stories manga. L-GAIM mostly feels like two very different creators with very different ideas dueling it out.The story itself really suffers a lot from the poor pacing and direction of the series, but I agree with a friend who described it as ""Star Wars on crack"". L-GAIM takes place in a star system called ""The Pentagona System"" and the main character, Daba Myroad, is the last surviving ruler of a civilization that was exterminated by the empress Poseidal. The list of characters in this series would make your head spin, and they all have crazy names and ridiculous hairstyles and clothes courtesy of Mamoru Nagano.

Most of the run time is just the 7th and 8th episodes of the series in nearly their entirety.  It contains some flashbacks of episode 1.  It contains a few small additional scenes sprinkled throughout with a new character that only appears here.  It does not really add much to the story and can easily be skipped.A 12 episode OVA series with a recap episode that only really recaps 2 episodes seems very strange and there's a particular reason for that.  The director of the first 6 episodes of the series, which were...all released across four dates in one year, died during production.  A new director was brought in for the remaining episodes but from that point on production slowed and the last 6 episodes were released 2 per year for 3 years.  The longest gaps in production were between episodes 6 and 7, and episodes 10 and 11, each being nearly full year gaps.  This recap film was released during the second gap.

That is  why I wanted to watch Miller's Report to see if I can get some more from this anime that ended to soon. I was hoping for a side story, but  unfortunately it did not live up to the anime and was just a recap episode that dumbs down some of the best scenes from the anime.Story: There is really no story to this. Miller's is a earth fed that has to write a report on  Shiro Amada...if in fact he is a double agent  for Zeon. So basically all they do is recap what has happened in the anime so far that has led up to this point. They had some extra footage with most of the characters with great dialogue but it was short. I was hoping for more of this, like stuff that was going on during the base when Shiro was under house arrest since they were vague in the anime, but nope we get 40 to 45 min of recaps from the anime.I am not going to write about sound and animation because it is similar to the anime since most of the recap footage is from the anime it self.Character:The new character introduced is Alice Miller a earth fed internal in fairs kind of person and she is pretty tough on Shiro because of her job and also a personal reason. All the main cast makes small appearance in the extra footage except for mabey Kiki but definitely everybody is in the recaps.Enjoyment. My enjoyment was killed by the recaps first of all they took up most of the time on the film and second the recaps were taking away from the series because these episodes they tried to recap were some of the most beautiful and entertaining episodes in anime. I don;t believe those great scenes should be watched in a recap and if you want to see them you should just watch the series again like I have. It is way more enjoyable just to watch the series again than this movies recap.Overall: I don't recommend watching this unless you want to see that 5 to 10 min extra footage with your favorite characters from the 08th Ms Team. This movie could have been much better if they eliminated the recaps and just added some dialogue for the characters and thrown in some fights just for fun. 6/10 if in fact he is a double agent  for Zeon.

This 50-minute movie, ""Miller\'s Report"", takes place two thirds of the way through the series. I watched it hoping for a decent amount of new footage since it\'s framed with an original story as intelligence officer Alice Miller investigates Shiro Amada. Sadly, this ended up just being what it was meant to be: glorified padding between releasing episodes of the OVA. The movie recaps most of the events surrounding Shiro and Aina\'s relationship, and combines it with the aftermath of what happened when the OVA took...place with some footage cut out and some footage added. Structurally, it\'s very weird in this way. It\'s chronologically consistent at the beginning, then delves into a long flashback, then goes back to chronology and follows the OVA in an abridged format until it ends before the final act. Miller is only given basic characterization and is only seen in a few minutes of the total running time. I guess if you\'re super desperate for more of The 08th MS Team then this could do as it retcons some additional detail into certain episodes, but it doesn\'t really improve the experience much. The best part of watching this was OZC\'s encode, which was absolutely incredible. If more encodes of old series got this treatment then maybe life wouldn\'t be so terrible.

From the very start to the very end, you feel as if nothing really happened, and things were the way just because. The movie is pretty and charming (which is expected), but exceedingly lacks inspiration, purpose, sophistication. It's incredibly bland, almost generic.The basic setup of the story is the same as other Lupin specials/movies. This special doesn't do anything new. "", 'This is a great special in general. However, the style deviates from traditional Lupin animation. If you\'re open to that, this is highly recommended. I think it\'s great for anyone new to the Lupin franchise as well, since the animation fits well with current styles.ART: Well, the level of animation is stepped up to present day, but something about the way the main characters are drawn seems off, Lupin in particular. I don\'t know, the franchise has a very particular style. It almost seems like there\'s the main quartet (and Zenigata)...and then everyone else. Which isn\'t bad, mostly. I mean, it\'s like saying, ""Hey, this...is temporary. It\'s not going to stick."" Occasionally they try too hard to make things fit, and that doesn\'t happen here (which is appreciated). Additionally, we\'ve got the obvious CG every once in awhile, mainly with anything that flew.STORY: This is your typical ""Lupin meets a mysterious damsel in distress, usually age inappropriate, and she has a massive secret that drags the group in"" story. The girl, though, is actually not completely useless, though, which makes her interesting. I ended up liking her quite a bit by the end. It seemed like it might have a Disney ending and didn\'t, which I respect.Another problem in attempting to update Lupin for present day is technology and such. This was a major ""ugh"" factor in Green vs. Red. While Lupin certainly masters everything he comes across in order to be the best thief, it gets to be too much to swallow when he suddenly has all these devices, or a Batcave-esque hideout, or suddenly knows EVERYthing about hacking. This special/movie thankfully didn\'t do that, as it seemed to have learned from past mistakes, and technology isn\'t addressed at all. In fact, one of the major plot devices is using steampunk-age airships. I took that as a tongue in cheek message from the producers saying, ""We got the hint. It won\'t happen again.""CHARACTERS: This special/movie features one of the ugliest babies in anime ever and a scene with the baby pooping...and then you get to look at the poop. Completely unnecessary. But the characters are wonderful, as usual. There\'s always at least one scene that for me makes the whole special/movie worthwhile and makes me laugh out loud. In Princess of the Breeze, it was this one:I love all the main characters in this franchise. Goemon has his own checkered past, so he really has no complaints as to how the group conducts their business. Even when people expect him to have a stereotypical samurai reaction (this happens numerous times in series 2, like the Kooky Kabuki episodes), he still just goes with the flow and is almost always loyal to Jigen and Lupin (except if a woman is involved).***SPOILERS BELOW...sort of***This scene is a great example of that. Goemon walks in, all stoic like, sees Jigen and Lupin with a baby, blushes, and walks out. Jigen says, ""I think Goemon has the wrong idea."" But we don\'t see him again until later in the movie at which point he returns with a traditional Japanese toy. So during the scene when he was blushing he was actually crazy excited and was leaving to go get a toy (all the way in Japan) for the baby that his group apparently adopted (and, by the way, is the weirdest and ugliest baby in all anime). He didn\'t care about the circumstances, he was just going with the flow. I love it.As for the other mains, Zenigata\'s presence is negligible. Jigen\'s chainsmoking is addressed momentarily, and Fujiko is doing her own thing, showing that she\'s a formidable thief as well.A couple of things didn\'t make sense. What was Shion\'s position, exactly? If the girls\' parents were royalty, why weren\'t they regarded as royalty? Why was the baby so important? It belonged to a royal guard, not anyone important (as the movie may make you think), but it still plays a large part in the movie.

The plot summary and promo art raised my hopes pretty high, but this ended up being one of my least favourite Lupin TV specials. It tries too hard to be epic and touching and ends up accomplishing none of what it's attempting to do. There are individual scenes that are funny or well done, but there is rarely any natural flow between the events.The premise is that Lupin and Jigen take an ugly baby along as they go on a new treasure...hunting adventure. Well, there's also a European nation that went through a coup d'état, a rebel group consisting of people still loyal to the old royal family, a legendary treasure and an evil businessman pulling the strings, but none of that was particularly interesting or well-developed. Lupin, Jigen & ugly baby really were the best part.As I said before, the movie's main problem is that it tries too hard. There are entirely too many characters in it, and most of them barely get anything more to them than a catch phrase that they repeat in a desperate attempt to come off as memorable during their short screen time. This is particularly obvious in the evil enforcer who leads the villain's men. There's also a completely unnecessary doctor character who really stands out as overly hammy and a princess character who does nothing. Now, the Lupin franchise rarely has new characters who are particularly memorable or interesting, but that's never a problem if the main cast gets to shine. More about that later.With all the characters and the various plot points, there's enough material in this movie to fill a normal anime series. As a result, the movie just moves from one point to another without taking the time to develop anything properly. There was no time to get attached to the new characters, so when their done-by-the-book emotional scene came along, I didn't feel anything, except embarrassment that everything was so predictable. Perfect examples of this are when two characters sacrifice their lives to protect the others and when one of the villains has a break-down towards the end. The movie makes you watch a tired cliché after another and you can always tell what they're trying to make you feel, but it just doesn't come together.The most cringe-worthy part for me was when the movie used the opening song from the Castle of Cagliostro as background music. That did nothing except highlight how Princess of the Breeze can't even hope to reach that level of quality.With so many new characters, the only members of the Lupin gang who get to do anything are Lupin and Jigen. As usual, Goemon is written out of the plot for almost the entire duration of the movie, only to show up when there's a fight. However, the reason he leaves (twice!) is actually really charming and funny, so this time I give it a pass. Fujiko does disappointingly little (aside from positioning herself so that we get a good shot of her butt or boobs) as does Zenigata, even though he actually gets quite a lot of scenes.The animation and backgrounds are mostly great and the characters look fine, even if they sometimes made me feel like they didn't belong in a Lupin title. I liked the detail put into the rebel group's clothing, which I think was supposed to be traditional to their country. The only visual part that bothered me was the car chase that was done with CGI because it stood out so much next to the 2D animation.With all that said, the movie isn't total trash. There's enough to keep you interested, especially if you like stories about fallen royalty and their hidden treasures. It's mostly beautiful to look at and the beginning is quite enjoyable, about up to the part when the rebel hideout gets attacked. And as I said earlier, Lupin and Jigen interacting with the baby is quite fun. Seeing the baby pull Jigen's beard made the movie worth watching for me.In short, I feel that this would have been better if it had been a series and if it had been an entirely original title without any connection to Lupin III. As it is, the Lupin characters don't get to spend enough time in the spotlight and it feels too much like they're supporting characters in somebody else's story. This isn't the only Lupin movie to have that problem, but that doesn't make me any more forgiving.PS: I lied about the most cringe-worthy part.

The character models sometimes go off-model, they are mostly still in every shot, and whenever they have to perform movement, it just looks awkward. What would you expect when they adapt another crappy romance light novel? Yup, there\'s nothing else to comment on other than the word ""bad"" plastered. Even their main promo picture looks like it was made by an amateur.When I comment about bad anime, the majority of them would be a lack of character detail or inept storytelling from the author, and this anime is no exception. This anime is filled with tropes that pathetically tried their hand to subvert tropes, only to be for naught. Kashima is a socially awkward otaku who got forced into dating the most fake gyaru ever written. It never tries to develop layers beneath their persona, since the anime is intent on only focusing on the cute romance scenes that don\'t feel earned whatsoever. The awkward guy in love with an extroverted girl relationship has been tested and succeeded multiple times by different anime like Hyouka or Bokuyaba, but whatever this relationship built up to has been squandered by the mediocrity of the author\'s capacity to write a compelling romance story. Then you have the most generic friends just to remind you that they have friends, where you\'re forced to sit through supposed yapping about online creators, trends, or anything just to appeal to the young demographic, but it feels like some old man throwing gestures without understanding the meaning behind it. It just wants to include Gyarus and Otakus for the sake of it.What\'s worse about the storytelling is that the premise is not all that bad. Of course, it is generic with the usual relationship, but it had an interesting node with Luna\'s past suggesting that she was mistreated by her past boyfriends, but never proceeded to expand that hook after Episode 1. It has been used plenty of times before like in other anime, however, it would have made Luna into a more interesting character other than this fake, robotic, and insincere character who just acts nice to everyone she meets. And the anime expects us to believe she\'s sincere and empathetic to everyone she holds close? It doesn\'t try to suggest that maybe Luna was a victim of abuse, doesn\'t try to show that Luna was traumatized by it, or have Luna somewhat push people away from being afraid of being hurt. No, instead you get Luna being too nice that she\'s willing to let go of people and somehow that\'s good enough. Then what\'s the point of the multiple boyfriends then? You could throw away that detail and the anime would work just as fine. With this statement, Luna Shirakawa is the epitome of an AI girlfriend who has no flaws to be explored and made up drama for the sake of its romance.Luna was such a bad character that even Maria, the supposed love breaker, is more well-written than the main love interest, and that\'s saying something. Before it decided to make Maria suddenly submissive and willing to let Luna win, she had actual grounded motives and feelings, though it\'s pretty stupid if it happens in real life, but it\'s still something that can be understood. A girl trying to get back someone she rejected, only to realize she squandered her chance with a potential boyfriend. Her character is easily the most interesting and holds actual drama behind it. Even the bad boy had more presence than Kashima, who had most of the show\'s screen time. I get that introverts don\'t hold a candle against these guys, but when you have the main character and his otaku friends just spouting about streamers and FPS games all the time without any actual meta-reference, it feels like a cheap throwaway just to attract younglings.I have made my point clear enough. Thank you for reading. By that point, it\'s obvious that Kimizero is another anime catered towards romance suckers.

Not even komimasai, there’s silence!He lets the misunderstanding grow...here we are not talking about a cultural difference from Japan but about a hero who has more communication problems than an autistic person...As is often the case in school romcoms, the main character is a cliché of the extremely shy...kid who makes a big deal out of touching his girlfriend\'s hand except that here, the girlfriend was up for everything barely 5 minutes after they got into a relationship.So, unlike other romcoms of the genre, this time, all the moments (and there are many) where the hero makes plans to hold hands, the indirect kiss, all the classic clichés no longer have any meaning ... it\'s ridiculous to do a fake suspense and whole episode with tricks and everything because he wants to hold her hand while she\'s ok for the whole thing.Ok, there is the ""real feeling of love"" that they want to develop first but the main character is too shy and annoying compared to the girlfriend for that to be credible. Plus, it looks like she has over 50 exes so it\'s going even less well.It\'s typically the kind of romcom that we watch more out of curiosity because the scenario is very bad and we watch it anyway... but once it\'s over, we only remember that it\'s very bad and that we should never watch it again...It\'s rare that at this point we have a romcom where we constantly wonder why the girl has an interest in this kid who is a big drag, annoying as hell and who when he speaks shows that it\'s is a big geek who really isn\'t made for her.The secondary characters are as hollow as possible and the animation music is basic.I\'ve seen the 5th episode, it\'s certain that it\'s not going to get good all of a sudden, like by magic.I\'m going to pause this series and watch in fast motion when all the episodes are available and put a mark ""to delete, forget and especially not watch this anime again. kid who makes a big deal out of touching his girlfriend\'s hand except that here, the girlfriend was up for everything barely 5 minutes after they got into a relationship.So, unlike other romcoms of the genre, this time, all the moments (and there are many) where the hero makes plans to hold hands, the indirect kiss, all the classic clichés no longer have any meaning ... it\'s ridiculous to do a fake suspense and whole episode with tricks and everything because he wants to hold her hand while she\'s ok for the whole thing.Ok, there is the ""real feeling of love"" that they want to develop first but the main character is too shy and annoying compared to the girlfriend for that to be credible.

As the title of the show suggests, she's experienced and he's not.We've seen this before in 'dress-up darling', 'horimiya', 'my first girlfriend is a gal' and several other shows. The premise of this show is not immediately obvious however and the subplot slowly starts to develop as our couple get along. In true soap opera fashion a girl returns from the past who also happens to be related to Runa.Supporting cast is decent but nothing special, the show almost only revolves around the main love interests.Some of the misunderstandings can be a little grating and predictable. Why a 7 (good) instead of a 6 (fine)? Because while a lot of shows milk you for time and just push the conclusion, this one does have a good point to its story and drama and can be more relatable than I think most romance shows, the pair dynamic aside. It's also not littered with fan service and 'kyaaa' peeks, which is a relief.I've already given you the plot summary and what to expect, so go no further if you don't want to know more.The rest from here are my thoughts on how the characters and how the story develops.---The reason I stated that this is useful for boys is that one of the 'mystifying' elements of girls, when you're young, is that they flip-flop emotionally depending on the social expectations they experience and set for themselves and others.To many Runa is going to be a frustrating character - Despite her investing herself in whomever her boyfriend at the time is, her positive outlook and romantic ideals, she's insecure and very quick to run away from confrontation. Her having had many boyfriends has only given her experiences in a shallow way and when Ryuuto starts mattering to her she gets hurt so much quicker.Insecurity is by no means exclusive to girls, but it is especially prevalent for them since its common for them to ascribe meaning to social interactions that isn't intended or seen by others (something that can continue well into adulthood), which is why women moreso than men are thought of to be prone to drama.Please do not take this as a 'literally all' generalization, all people have some measure of insecurity but because girls mature quicker they experience this faster than boys. Also boys tend to be insecure from a lack of achievement from which they primarily derive self worth.That little tangent aside, the point is that I think the show does a good job of showing you some of the issues you can expect from a school relationship. Not so much repeated impossible timing misunderstandings, but misunderstandings in general and what others might see as an issue even if you don't. And, also to not give up and to figure out what you want and go for it.I don't think Runa is particularly realistic, but I recognize many facets of her behaviour from past relationships and I think it makes for a decently considered story.Ryuuto himself is nothing to write home about, he's mostly an everyman who makes a few good observations and starts steering his life in a long term direction which is admirable and a good approach. I think his limitations are what you could expect from an inexperienced boy, so his weaknesses aren't annoying or particularly unrealistic, at least for a somewhat socially awkward nerd. accepts.

Most viewers will most likely end up either liking it or disliking. I belong to the third group. I can\'t say I liked the three episodes that have been released so far, but I also won\'t say I totally did not enjoy watching them.Apart from okay direction, decent animation and nice looking art (especially when it comes to close-ups), I don\'t see anything unique about this show. There have been plenty of romance stories following exactly the same pattern, I mean stories set in high school, with flashy and popular female student getting into...a relationship with male one, who\'s rather unpopular, nerdy even. Following patterns popular in certain genre is nothing wrong or uncommon, but with each next episode of Kimizero I couldn\'t not think about how gradually clichéd this show is becoming. Even the supporting characters feel bland and hollow, as if they were to follow specific tropes in their most basic variants.What I can see special about this anime is the concept itself. While I\'m not into the romance genre, I can\'t recall when was the last time, if it ever was, when I saw one of - let\'s call them - generic seasonal romance anime placing huge emphasis on one of character\'s sexual past and making it one of the driving forces of the romantic relationship described in the show. Here, in ""Keikenzumi na Kimi to, Keiken Zero na Ore ga, Otsukiai suru Hanashi."", as the title suggests, we have a situation where one main character is sexually experienced in a promiscuous way, which causes fellow students to gossip about, and the other one is - surprise - not experienced at all in this sphere. Sexual intercourse happening in a relationship is nothing unusual, but this anime, at least in my opinion, offers the worst possible way of portraying it and makes social degeneracies look like they were actually nothing wrong at all. I know at the end of a day it\'s just a cartoon, but come on.It\'s not an anime dedicated to adults, but mostly to the teenage audience. That kind of message feels quite unfortunate to appear in such show and will surely be a reason for many to just drop this show early on. That\'s while I find the aforementioned element as ""special"", it doesn\'t have be equal with considering as something undoubtedly positive.While I find this controversial way of handling romance as weird, even if this anime has had a few cute scenes so far, the rest may see it in a different light. Some people will surely find it as outrageous; others might be neutral or even enjoy it, calling this relation as wholesome. What group will you, dear reader, belong to? I can\'t tell. Everyone must see with their own eyes whether this series clicks with them or not.Anyway, as for me, I don\'t see any reasons to continue watching this show. That\'s why I will just pass on it, just after watching its first 3 episodes. I was moderately entertained with what I\'ve seen so far, but due to reasons mentioned before, I can\'t leave any other recommendation than ""Mixed Feelings"". Still, I think it\'s worth of checking out. Just out of curiosity. Who knows? Maybe someone reading this review will enjoy it way more than I did. a relationship with male one, who\'s rather unpopular, nerdy even.

Maybe someone reading this review will enjoy it way more than I did.', 'There’s almost always one random anime that will get some controversy no matter if for something that is minimal or stupid yet will become the center of criticisms about the show, and in this case the series that got this treatment was KimiZero. For some reason, the main girl made some people go crazy with part of her gimmick, which in this series is that she already had relationships with other boys in the past and even had sex with them. That’s all, and as it was proven in the past by series like HigeHiro where you could complain about basically anything like bad writing,...bad animation, badly written characters, etc, but instead people ignore them and whine about a completely unrelated thing, as the main complain there was also that the girl in the cover wasn’t a virgin.Some people will say that the writing of this series seems like it was made by an incel, and I have to disagree, after all, that kind of people are the most likely to complain that the girl had sex before. In fact, I can’t comprehend how such a simple series like a romcom got so misunderstood, the memo that you get from here is not that having multiple relationships and sex with literally anything is good, no, the series paints this in a negative light and Runa regrets it because it happened due to her bad decisions on how to make a significant relationship. The fact that this simple fact gets over so many people’s heads is surprising to me, as it is something very easy to pick up from so many episodes, the one in the festival in particular is extremely blatant about this. This series at least tries to make sense, as some people will have a sexual life earlier than others, and they might regret it later if it isn’t with someone that matters to them in the first place.But now, is KimiZero a good series? Of course fucking not, as much as I want to side with the fans of this series, that simply isn’t possible for me. At the very least, I think this series is commendable for actually having the main girl who is super popular and beautiful interacting with boys, and having had relationships in the past, because in most romcoms God forbid that the main girl has ever interacted with any boy except the MC. The series obviously suffers from average romcom and light novel writing, nothing actually exciting happens, and when it does, it is written like a Mexican telenovela, like, do people think that the twin sister of a girl faking to be her is not something ridiculous? As it happens, the MC is also bland as hell and the relationship came to be in a completely unnatural way, it happened because Tanjiro asked Runa to become his girlfriend after he lost a bet with his friends and she simply accepts like it was nothing, no one in their sane mind would see this and think it isn’t forced, and even if some moments between Tanjiro and Runa were fine enough, it isn’t enough to see this series and think it was anything meaningful. I can stand the telenovela tier writing because I grew up watching a lot of them, so that’s why most romcoms are not something that bother me at all, and this one is not exception, this series is simply boring most of the time and not much more, it isn’t actively annoying, and it was a good enough joke when a character started talking about something they are very passionate about and the other was completely lost without understanding anything.Nicole acting like a bitch towards Tanjiro was always something weird, she constantly told him that he shouldn’t do anything bad about Runa, when he looks so inoffensive and his personality is literally “I’m nice”, I can only wonder if she was doing the same for previous Runa boyfriends or if she saw Runa being hurt so many times she started being overprotective coincidentally with him, I want to believe the second one, especially because Runa seems to ignore a lot of her advices, but there’s nothing to tell me that she isn’t like this because the current guy is the protagonist and apparently she must annoy him. There’s also other romantic relationships happening in the background with Tanjiro’s friends and the other gyaru, but they go nowhere and fail miserably at it. And Maria is probably the side character that is most important, her deal is really weird, she is also in love with Tanjiro and he even confessed his love towards her in the past but she rejected him, so why is she seeking for his love now even after she rejected him before? Is it just to have more drama in the show, as it happens she is jealous of Runa, but at the same time wants to be more noticed by her because of their relationship? She acts like a bitch half of the series and then victimizes herself, she clearly has problems in her, and it all revolves around Runa and Tanjiro.As it stands, KimiZero is basically just a generic romcom with more drama than it should have, but at the same time has a female MC that seems more plausible than other girls from other romcoms, thanks to her not being an untouchably pure virgin. I seriously cannot make an effort to be on either side of the conflict about the series, since I for one think that anyone can have any relationship with anyone they want, so I cannot agree with the haters, but I also disagree with the people saying this is a wholesome show, as nothing about it stands out as actually meaningful or even cute.Thank you for reading. bad animation, badly written characters, etc, but instead people ignore them and whine about a completely unrelated thing, as the main complain there was also that the girl in the cover wasn’t a virgin.Some people will say that the writing of this series seems like it was made by an incel, and I have to disagree, after all, that kind of people are the most likely to complain that the girl had sex before.

""Bound by Fate: His High School Love Affair""? The title should\'ve been my first warning sign, and yet, I trudged on—my curiosity is a curse, I swear.As a devoted anime enthusiast and a connoisseur of light novels, I\'m no stranger to characters that tread outside the realm of \'typical\'. Yet, this narrative, my friends, goes beyond that. Here, we are introduced to a female lead who frolics through the plot like a flagrant libertine, compromising the very essence of character development.What\'s worse? Our \'golden boy\' main character seems to be ensnared by this...inexplicably promiscuous siren. It\'s as if he\'s stuck in some bizarre vortex where common sense has taken an extended vacation. Let me say this, my fellow readers: there\'s a fine line between quirky character traits and unmitigated disregard for the values we uphold.Chastity and fidelity might seem old-school, but they\'re the pillars of any profound relationship narrative. However, in this tale, these elements have been kicked aside, replaced by an insidious message that it\'s all fair game in love. Oh, but it isn\'t!Now, I get it, authors often push boundaries. But remember the line between \'bold\' and \'ill-conceived\'. Our dear authoress here, I\'m afraid, has crossed that line and ventured into the abyss of the latter.The female lead, as seductive as she\'s meant to appear, feels more like a caricature than a fully fleshed-out character. It\'s as if the author\'s idea of being \'different\' is creating a character who is, for lack of a better term, off the rails. Her behavior, far from being quirky or edgy, simply feels inappropriate.Then there\'s our unfortunate male lead, the supposed \'good guy\', who is inexplicably drawn to this whirlwind of a woman. Despite his previously established principles and the author\'s attempts to paint him as an upstanding character, he falls for her. I mean, is this meant to be a love story or a cautionary tale?I could ramble on, but let\'s be succinct: there\'s pushing the envelope, and then there\'s sending it off the cliff. This story? It\'s doing a swan dive right off that precipice. inexplicably promiscuous siren. It\'s as if he\'s stuck in some bizarre vortex where common sense has taken an extended vacation. Let me say this, my fellow readers: there\'s a fine line between quirky character traits and unmitigated disregard for the values we uphold.Chastity and fidelity might seem old-school, but they\'re the pillars of any profound relationship narrative. However, in this tale, these elements have been kicked aside, replaced by an insidious message that it\'s all fair game in love. Oh, but it isn\'t!Now, I get it, authors often push boundaries. But remember the line between \'bold\' and \'ill-conceived\'. Our dear authoress here, I\'m afraid, has crossed that line and ventured into the abyss of the latter.The female lead, as seductive as she\'s meant to appear, feels more like a caricature than a fully fleshed-out character. It\'s as if the author\'s idea of being \'different\' is creating a character who is, for lack of a better term, off the rails. Her behavior, far from being quirky or edgy, simply feels inappropriate.Then there\'s our unfortunate male lead, the supposed \'good guy\', who is inexplicably drawn to this whirlwind of a woman.

It’s ok that she’s not a virgin, but there’s a limit to stupidity that she crossess.That’s my issue with the characterization of her. How is it that she is quick to have sex with the idea of pleasing her boyfriend, gets dumped every time, and doesn’t learn her lesson. It would make sense if she was obsessed with sex more than love, but the story, from what I’ve seen from others explain it (I haven’t read it), makes her character the opposite: disinterested in sex...and interested in pleasing her partner.So she falls in love with the MC. But how is it that she spent so much time getting used without learning ‘I’m being used for sex’ ‘I’m dating shitty men’ ‘if I found someone serious they wouldn’t even want sex so quickly in the first place’ etc. So since she isn’t absolutely obsessed with getting ran through, then she must have a really, really, really low iq or a learning disability. Which if this were the case, then she wouldn’t have the social awareness and skills to maintain herself to be beautiful, stylish, and top-caste.I want to give it a chance, but I have a fear that the MC won’t change much in his nature and remain as the small fry he is, characterization of Runa would become hard to explain through plot without creating plot holes, and a different story without such extreme non realism would have been better.Example: Runa had a small amount of boyfriends that used her, and she changed her demeanor because of the rumors that came with it. OR Runa is sex obsessed but begins to change when she meets the MC who was the only guy to turn away her direct advances.I find the current characterization to be one of the most unsettling things I’ve ever witnessed because it combines pure of heart and impure of mind and body. Yet this unsettling feeling is also interesting in itself. But if someone who’s read it has an explanation for why Runa’s pure heart didn’t protect her body’s purity or why her impure body didn’t change her heart’s purity please let me know. Because if we were to say that she lost her virginity and was dumped, I feel like most people with normal observational skills would realize that they were used and not continue to pretend that sex is something you do to keep a partner if you are not sure of their intentions. Like the Mc saved the heroine but instead of the antagonist being social pressure, depression, desperation, or lust, it was her own naivety.Another thing I wish to see and I’ll just throw this out there but given the story, Runa is an innocent girl who has been used a lot and it affects the mc. Thus, the ex boyfriends are evil in a way. In this kind of situation I would wanna see the Mc become a social force to be reckoned with and absolutely wipe the floor with the ex bfs. This kind of story demands a need for schadenfreude to put those characters in their place, prove them wrong, and destroy their egos. The reason for this is that usually a male protagonist is fine being messed with, but if they mess with someone they know, it gets serious. And I’m assuming that Runa at some point shows regret for her past? If this revenge or schadenfreude exists in the story I’ll definitely watch it and read it. If it doesn’t then oh well I’ll give it a try but put it no where near the top animeTalking about the actual review This is hell of a boring anime like a soap opera where things and characters don't make sence. and interested in pleasing her partner.So she falls in love with the MC.

""Kimizero"" is like the fast food version of a romcom, and not the good kind. The character dramas are so dull even a sloth would ask for a refund on its time investment.Four episodes in, and I\'m still wondering if this anime was created as part of a secret plot to test my patience. The characters themselves are similarly dull, some borderline hateable. Ryuuto and Luna make for a boring main couple, Ryuuto\'s ""friends"" are insufferable, Luna\'s friend(s) are barely fleshed out, and the lone character with...a bit of personality, Maria, plays the tired role of a derivative romance antagonist: Family Drama edition. It\'s like they attended a ""Romcom Writing 101"" class and followed the syllabus to the letter. Whatever conflicts that do arise are uninventive, and I could hardly care about how they affect them in the slightest. You\'re set up to root for them and their romance just seems pure, perfect, and infallible, only set back by the difference in personality between the two and the romance drama including Maria.The most entertainment value it gives is watching Ryuuto geek out while Luna plays catch-up, or the inner debates of the turbo virgin\'s deciding whether to go full hornball mode or keep it in check, who, to his credit, often opts for the more virtuous path. However, let\'s not even get started on his dreadful friends, whose entire existence seems to revolve around being equally inept and dripping with envy over their friend landing a girlfriend. Luna is the naive hopeless romantic female lead and Ryuuto, unremarkable as he is, means well for the most part is the outlier, the loner who ""treats her better"" than her exploitative exes. Wow. ""Kimizero"" has as much appeal as watching paint dry, and the humor is about as uninspired as a blank canvas.If you\'re in the mood for a similar wholesome romance between a gyaru and a loner, there are far better options out there. This anime is basically a wish-fulfillment fantasy where a socially awkward loser treats the popular girl better than her exes did. It\'s almost as if the target audience consists of guys who genuinely take ""nice guys finish last"" as a life mantra. The fact that it implies everything would be static in Luna\'s love life unless Ryuuto\'s friends dared him to confess just further appeals to that type of crowd, even if that wasn\'t the goal.To be fair, I threw in the towel, so there\'s a slim chance it might improve later on. But given everything else I\'ve witnessed so far, I\'m not holding my breath. Nothing has convinced me to keep watching.Oh and the animation\'s seasonal fodder. The art/character design is subjective (I personally find Kimizero\'s pretty plain.) but the production or animation quality isn\'t anything special to make up for the lackluster concept.I do like the peppy opening tho. It\'s cute. a bit of personality, Maria, plays the tired role of a derivative romance antagonist: Family Drama edition.

It\'s cute.', 'As an anime fan, I don’t really have a specific genre that I prefer over others. Each genre has its own charms. An anime of the romance genre like ""Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me"" usually consists of an emotionally driven story focusing on the romantic relationship between two people. The centrepiece of such a work is the process of falling in love and the organic growth in the relationship, which usually resolves into a lovely romantic ending.Our Dating Story is a bit of a departure from the traditions of the genre. The premonitory signs of its arrival are present in...other titles from recent times, signs indicating that the Ani-Manga industry is beginning to pick up on emerging patterns in our society. The result is a title that mirrors how our romantic relationships are changing in ways that I do not think is for the better. With this review I will try to explain my thoughts.The AnimationLet’s address the least negative aspects first by mentioning its animation. Our Dating Story has a typical romance art style where the characters are the main focus the majority of the time. The backgrounds are either not shown or just blurry and not as detailed as the faces of the characters. One good thing is that there wasn’t any fan service that would have made the show even more awkward than already is.The StoryOur Dating Story has the same setting as in any other typical romance anime, pairing up the most popular girl in school, Runa, with our old boring male MC, Ryuuto. How original. Although actually, it is original to a degree. The character descriptions in the title aren\'t there for no reason: while the girl, ""The Experienced You"", is famous for having the experience, the young man, ""The Inexperienced Me"", is about as popular and experienced as ... well, the inexperienced me. And it\'s this central premise, being an accurate reflection of societal trends, that gives the anime its spark of originality.However, the presentation of how this love story plays out sits uneasily with me, and furthermore raises serious questions and concerns about the romance genre in general.Why has the male role in Anime become so pithless and low on esteem?Why has the standard of the female role become “highly experienced”, degrading and even shameless?There is a sense of disrespect in the whole story directed at both sides. As an example of how it disregards and disrespects the male role, let\'s consider why Ryuuta fell for Runa in the first place. The anime tried to make it look as though it\'s all natural attraction, but when you dig deeper, you find the real reason he\'s attracted to her is because she\'s famous amongst the other guys - he\'s basically just a fanboy!In addition, the story propagates the idea that a boring but nice, traditional anime male protagonist would likely choose an experienced, non-traditional girl over an innocent, traditional one. The show does this by presenting a secondary love interest in the form of Runa\'s sister, Maria. Maria is more in the mould of the traditional anime girl in that she is inexperienced. But the anime made her character manipulative and unlikeable, and I feel like this was done just to make us like Runa more.Our Dating Story also disrespects the female role. While the boy stays somewhat traditional, the girl on the other hand is so lost that it\'s actually saddening: she doesn\'t even understand how relationships function, and the anime treats her like a senseless person, using ignorance as an excuse for negligent behaviour. Runa had slept with a few other guys in the mistaken belief that this is what dating and relationships are all about, and the story glosses over it like it\'s not a big deal. The main message this sends is that it doesn\'t matter because Runa doesn\'t know what she\'s doing. To be fair, she did make some progress towards the end as she slowly realised her earlier mistakes and came to appreciate how dating and relationships really work. However, this progress wasn\'t particularly deep.The final straw for me came when, at one point in the anime, the boy actually said: “I want to be worthy enough to be your boyfriend.” At that point, I closed chrome, turned off my computer and just sat there for long minutes trying to understand when and how did romance anime end up like this. With all due respect, how is this even remotely entertaining or enjoyable? I honestly feel anger that this type of plot elements are allowed to become the norm.As a sensitive person myself I can easily get depressed by the smallest incidents, gestures and even thoughts, so why would I want this modern generation and everything that is happening in our worn out society to influence the only source of escapism that I have left? I started watching anime because I felt in it a world that was more enjoyable and less stressful than real life. So when an anime brings real events into its premise, it can be demanding and difficult to watch. This anime is just one of myriad attempts within a short period designed to pollute the only refuge from real life left, the anime industry. That said, I am not totally against the dramatization of real life in anime, but at the very least, the drama should be believable and arise from the natural interactions between the characters. In Our Dating Story, the presentation of the drama does not feel genuine: it feels forced into the writing and the settings.Premise / InfluencesWhilst the premise of Our Dating Story can be seen as a factual presentation on how injured the state of our dating scene and relationships are, as the story progresses it also shows the male MC leading the relationship in a more traditional direction. When Ryuuto was offered sex by Runa early on he actually turned it down as he was on a ""mission"" to show her how a genuine relationship is built. Although this is a worthy end goal in the story, I still can\'t get behind the representation and normalisation of the current hookup culture found in the plot, because it sets a bad example for our society. Runa from Our Dating Story is just one of many recent characters inspired by this trend, with other examples including Elina (Mushoku Tensei), Ogiwara Saryu (Hige wo Soru), Himeno (Chainsaw Man), etc.I really believe that women like Makise Kurisu (Steins;Gate), Hyuuga Hinata (Naruto), Yatogami Tooka (Date A Live) are not only great examples of loyal waifus, but their like also exist in real life. Similarly, the likes of Vanitas (Vanitas no Karte), Todoroki Shouto (My Hero Academia), Houtarou Oreki (Hyouka) and Roronoa Zoro (One Piece) are male characters that as a man I feel I can look up to. As their models are exemplary loyal.It\'s obnoxious when romance is reduced to sexuality, and when any show containing ecchi elements is becoming so increasingly sex-centred that it\'s not funny or cute any more. I miss the times when talking, a hug or even just a pat on the had were considered romantic gestures; when we waited not for when or how these characters lay down together, but for merely a kiss to seal a relationship. This show on the hand is completely lacking in this kind of genuine emotional chemistry that I consider enjoyable.ConclusionOur Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me, is the final straw for me thanks to its uncomfortable and distressing plot elements. Although it draws inspiration from reality, to be instructive to the audience it must provide good examples to emulate. Despite some positive progression, in general this anime does quite the opposite. For this reason I cannot recommend it. In fact, I strongly suggest you watch something else, for example these romance anime:- ReLife- Darling in The Franxx- Nisekoi- Plastic Memories (drama)- Snow White with the Red Hair- Date A LiveIf you are new to anime, please watch Date A live instead of this destructive act on our ani-manga industry. By instilling these characteristics traits as obligatory, Our Dating Story reinforces the current societal trends, sending us on a downward spiral that will devastate our social lives in the future. I am honestly afraid that plot elements like this will be used more and more often, so I felt I had to express my thoughts and feelings for the sake of the Ani-Manga industry.I also know that this is just an Anime, but every media can make significant impressions on our lives. Thus I believe you can judge an anime based not only on its animation and characters, but on its core principles and how its premise influences society.Much appreciation goes to kekekeKaj to his generous contribution on improving my review for submission!Thank you for reading! other titles from recent times, signs indicating that the Ani-Manga industry is beginning to pick up on emerging patterns in our society.

I’ve said it many times on reddit, crunchyroll etc. This girl neither has any parents or she has intelligence on the same level as your average only fans model. Authors really tried to make something innovative and different as so many generic romantic comedies and yet, they did one of the most generic things out there. So many things are wrong both morally and ethically. Next problem is contradictions. We will look on this topic mainly in my interpratation about characters, but main girl has so many issues...not only contrasts in her character, which makes this anime unenjoayble for me.Story: 5/10Narrative isn’t that big of a problem if it would be executed better. As I said earlier, there isn’t anything which would surprise you so far.Expect average young couple from high school has fun and dates in anime. Progress of the story and evolve of their relationship is your classic romcom cliché, but if you’re really big of a romcom enjoyer, you will have fun anyways. How many romance anime have you seen, where couple goes to shopping as a first date, going on the beach, boy has jelaous classmates, girl has toxic friend, hiding relationship (like why i wouldn’t give a fuck about some idiots), childhood friend in love incoming, should i continue?On the other hand it still wasn’t big reason enough for me to quit or don’t enjoy it. Thing is it tries to be serious, but it gives you so many reasons not to do so. Way how story portraits relationship of someone who should be experienced, yet she doesn’t know a shit about dating, although she dated and slept with 5-10 guys (btw. She’s 16, yes 16! If you think it’s normal, it isn’t).That’s the reason, why I expected different progress of they’re relationship and I get average type of romcom cliché.Characters: 2/10There’s not a single enjoyable charater yet, which would either make sense, be innovative or at least be funny. Main hero is typical boring Mr.Nobody with a good heart and with unpopular friends, in other words SIMP.He has every character trait of average spineless Japanesse romance anime MC and that’s it.Now my biggest issue of all... main girl.Either way she has no parents, her friends are dumb as her or her moral values and dignity were no existent since she was born.I really doubt there is 16 years old girl in Japan with similar background as Runa from solid family, who would start dating with somebody and right away offered him sex after 2 hours meeting with him (She would have to be nymphomaniac, which she’s not.)She’s 16 years old a freaking kid! Japanese are known for sexualizing children, but making a promiscous thot from a girl and portrait it like it’s all right... Line was crossed at this point.Why she didn’t learn from her previous mistakes? Clearly she’s just a kid, but againg here should come parents and friends on the scene which were surely nowhere to be found. Runa is like most popular girl in the school yet nobody told her something?Authors are trying to portrait her like a innocent and pure, but it doesn’t fit her character and past at all - contradiction.How can you date so many guys yet still know shit about a dating?Let’s talk about her ""best friend"" for a while. Why she’s trying to discourage only boy who actually cares about runa.Trying to be cautious after so many bad experiences is on point, but where she been when her best friend was banged by so many other dudes? Why she wasn’t trying to tell her she’s doing something wrong and discourage the actual ""bad"" dudes?She is such a hypocrite and fake person I cannot stand her. What the fuck was she talking about in 5th episode?Talking about balance in their realtionship and stuff like that...Main girl is bringing so much emotional demage from her past she shouldn’t be dating at all. She should think about herself, grown up, spent some time on her own and even visit a psychologist. Gosh so stupid it kills my brain cells.Other characters are medicore. Boring ""nerd"" friends of a MC, childhood friend which is in love with MC and others which you can see in so many animes out there.Lot of you probably seen Wotakoi, where MC dates an experienced girl and he’s virgin. That’s the way it should be portrait. Guess what? Girl is 26 not 16 so it’s naturall to have some experiences in this age, because you are older and through the life meeting new people. She had also past trauma, because of her scumbag ex-boyfriends and she’s dealing with this. Yet she’s still not trying to throw herself on the MC in the first occasion and it’s so much more credible.I would also prefer to date girl with some previous experiences as me, because you know what to expect. On the other hand there is solid line between being experienced and being clueless promiscous person.Art: 8/10Most possitive way in my opinion is art style. No doubt it looks pretty and stylish.It reminds me something like My Dress Up Darling style a little bit. If you’re the kind of person for which are nice animations enough to enjoy the whole piece, you should go for it.Sound/Music: 5/10Nothing to be praised for, but won’t offend you either. Opening is again repetetive and similar to many of the others animes of same type. I enjoyed the ending which is in my opinion solid song. Music througout the anime is nothing special and you almost doesn’t pay attention to it thanks to it’s genericity.Enjoyment: 4/10Honestly I’ve seen a lot worse animes so my conscience doesn’t allow me to go lower. If you can shut your eyes and overlook so many issues, you still have some fun. I’m not that kind of person and if something bothers me so much that it disrupts my overall experience, I’m usually loud about it. I enjoyed some moments, but they does not balance negative aspects at all.Overall: 4/10To sum it up you can give it a shot if you are undemanding spectator and you want to see some typical couple moments in anime and cheap entertainment. Don’t expect something which make sense and has some deeper value in it.I wouldn’t mind so much if it was a comedy, but authors clearly want for me to take it more seriously, so I did.I’m gonna go back after watching whole thing, but I doubt I change my mind. not only contrasts in her character, which makes this anime unenjoayble for me.Story: 5/10Narrative isn’t that big of a problem if it would be executed better. As I said earlier, there isn’t anything which would surprise you so far.Expect average young couple from high school has fun and dates in anime. Progress of the story and evolve of their relationship is your classic romcom cliché, but if you’re really big of a romcom enjoyer, you will have fun anyways. How many romance anime have you seen, where couple goes to shopping as a first date, going on the beach, boy has jelaous classmates, girl has toxic friend, hiding relationship (like why i wouldn’t give a fuck about some idiots), childhood friend in love incoming, should i continue?On the other hand it still wasn’t big reason enough for me to quit or don’t enjoy it. Thing is it tries to be serious, but it gives you so many reasons not to do so. Way how story portraits relationship of someone who should be experienced, yet she doesn’t know a shit about dating, although she dated and slept with 5-10 guys (btw. She’s 16, yes 16! If you think it’s normal, it isn’t).That’s the reason, why I expected different progress of they’re relationship and I get average type of romcom cliché.Characters: 2/10There’s not a single enjoyable charater yet, which would either make sense, be innovative or at least be funny. Main hero is typical boring Mr.Nobody with a good heart and with unpopular friends, in other words SIMP.He has every character trait of average spineless Japanesse romance anime MC and that’s it.Now my biggest issue of all... main girl.Either way she has no parents, her friends are dumb as her or her moral values and dignity were no existent since she was born.I really doubt there is 16 years old girl in Japan with similar background as Runa from solid family, who would start dating with somebody and right away offered him sex after 2 hours meeting with him (She would have to be nymphomaniac, which she’s not.)She’s 16 years old a freaking kid! Japanese are known for sexualizing children, but making a promiscous thot from a girl and portrait it like it’s all right... Line was crossed at this point.Why she didn’t learn from her previous mistakes? Clearly she’s just a kid, but againg here should come parents and friends on the scene which were surely nowhere to be found. Runa is like most popular girl in the school yet nobody told her something?Authors are trying to portrait her like a innocent and pure, but it doesn’t fit her character and past at all - contradiction.How can you date so many guys yet still know shit about a dating?Let’s talk about her ""best friend"" for a while. Why she’s trying to discourage only boy who actually cares about runa.Trying to be cautious after so many bad experiences is on point, but where she been when her best friend was banged by so many other dudes? Why she wasn’t trying to tell her she’s doing something wrong and discourage the actual ""bad"" dudes?She is such a hypocrite and fake person I cannot stand her. What the fuck was she talking about in 5th episode?Talking about balance in their realtionship and stuff like that...Main girl is bringing so much emotional demage from her past she shouldn’t be dating at all. She should think about herself, grown up, spent some time on her own and even visit a psychologist. Gosh so stupid it kills my brain cells.Other characters are medicore. Boring ""nerd"" friends of a MC, childhood friend which is in love with MC and others which you can see in so many animes out there.Lot of you probably seen Wotakoi, where MC dates an experienced girl and he’s virgin. That’s the way it should be portrait. Guess what? Girl is 26 not 16 so it’s naturall to have some experiences in this age, because you are older and through the life meeting new people. She had also past trauma, because of her scumbag ex-boyfriends and she’s dealing with this. Yet she’s still not trying to throw herself on the MC in the first occasion and it’s so much more credible.I would also prefer to date girl with some previous experiences as me, because you know what to expect.

There's really nothing original about the show at all, and none of its elements are executed particularly well or with any elegance.The show puts a lot of surface level emphasis on the dynamic between the main romantic leads(unpopular nerdy guy vs very popular and extroverted gyaru). This isn't exactly a novel dynamic, in fact it's one of the more common ones for shounen romcom stories, but the emphasis placed on it and the explicit acknowledgement of sexual...experience added on top could have lead to some interesting explorations of teen relationships, romance, and sex. Could have. I think the first episode does decently enough at handling Runa's(the main girl) warped view of sex and romance, and how that has lead to her reputation as a promiscuous person willing to sleep with anyone. The show clearly presents her views as unhealthy and self destructive ones enforced on her by past partners who convinced her the only way to make them happy was sex. Other people on the internet have approached this show from a frankly misogynistic viewpoint of claiming Runa's sexual proclivity is inherently wrong, but I feel it's important to note that her viewpoint is wrong because she isn't doing it for her own self fulfillment, but because she believes it's what's expected of her by the men she dates. And the show does luckily make that clear. Unfortunately, this is where I stop having anything good to say about the show, because that element only ever comes up again to allow Ryuuto to turn down her offers of sex every so often as if that makes him a Paragon of moral virtue. From episode 2 onward, this anime becomes a distillation of the most bland elements of every shounen romcom from 2010-2015. Every character, every plot beat, all of it is just a series of overdone tropes played entirely by the books. The main character Ryuuto himself is a cardboard cutout of a man whose only discernible personality traits are: 1. Likes watching gaming livestreams 2. Likes cars 3. 'nice guy'. He's the kind of audience insert I thought had been relegated to bottom of the barrel seasonal isekai.The art and animation are the definition of mid, as well. While there's nothing egregiously bad about either, the stills and characters all just look slightly wonky and the animation feels stuff and unexpressive. The characters facial expressions barely change aside from their mouths being either tilted upwards or downwards, and the occasional but of red on their cheeks. The colours are very nice, but they're kinda wasted on character designs that are sometimes actually difficult to tell apart from one another.I mentioned at the beginning of this review that this anime is like oatmeal that was frozen for a month, and I'd like to elaborate on that metaphor. Oatmeal, if prepared correctly, can serve as a delicious and fulfilling breakfast you can be satisfied eating. However, his anime lacks any flavour whatsoever but is somehow actively unpleasant to consume because the blandness only highlights the mushy gross texture it got from being frozen for a month.

Do not watch this anime."", ""Have you ever wondered what makes a good romance anime? Well, this anime is the opposite of that. Let me tell you the story of a shy high-school student Ryuuto Kashima who is forced to declare his feelings for Shirakawa Luna, the most popular girl in school, because of a pledge. And of course, to everyone's surprise, she agrees to go out with him, and you can tell from the start that it's going to be a real drag.Turning to the characters, there's Ryuuto Kashima, a stressed-out guy who can't hold a simple conversation. Then there's Shirakawa Luna, the most popular girl with an IQ...close to zero, who's been in a relationship countless times before getting dumped and has notably no personality. Thinking we couldn't get to the bottom of the characters, let me introduce you to Maria Kurose, the famous childhood friend from college who refused our protagonist's advances because... well, I don't know! After that, she'll be transferred to another school. But later she'll be transferred to the same high school as Ryuuto, and we'll learn that she was in love with our protagonist. But when Ryuuto loses interest in her because he's in a relationship with Shirakawa, she learns from her mistakes and moves on. No, I'm kidding, she's going to STRUGGLE, constantly trying to make a pass at him, until she comes up with a genius plan: she's going to pretend to be Shirakawa... Yes, you heard me right, she's going to call Ryuuto pretending to be his girlfriend and ask him to come to the gym, even disguising herself as Shirakawa. When Ryuuto arrives, she tells him she wants to have sex LMAO and you can't imagine how cringe that was. But our protagonist wasn't fooled by his sharingan, and knew that she wasn't his girlfriend with the help of a hug. In the end, a photo of the two of them leaks out, creating a mini-drama and, well, you can guess the rest...Well, to sum up this unreadable pamphlet, the anime is pretty cringe, I had to pause it several times, so it's going to take a mind of steel to watch it in one sitting, plus the fact that it's pretty boring, the characters suck and have no personality. As for the animation, it's okay, but the OSTs aren't very good.So if you're here looking for a quality romance anime, you're on the wrong side, but if you're just here to put your brain down and enjoy the moment, well, maybe you'll like it, you never know on a misunderstanding.I therefore give this anime an exceptional rating of 4. close to zero, who's been in a relationship countless times before getting dumped and has notably no personality.

The dynamic can be summarized as the loser nerd stereotype is hooked on the easy girl that blames her exes for her poor choices. I would respect the idea of already experienced protags more if it weren\'t one-sided and using all the classic excuses for her bad choices. It comes off like they are trying to glorify a girl not properly exercising her right to say no to ""entanglements"" with guys that don\'t take her seriously. Had they gone with a premise of a girl doing it once and losing the guy...due to him being a legitimate cunning snake or to even his passing, I could definitely see this doing something new and interesting. However, the premise and execution feel more like a delayed adult film than anything.Making it worse is the horribly played out ""virgin guy that nearly has a heart attack over even accidentally brushing hands"" trope that is far too pervasive in romance anime. Seeing it in this kind of story and the resulting one-sided dynamic make the story fall flat and makes him look like the ""woman"" in the relationship. It\'s unappealing to see boys and men act that way, as if their sexuality is inherently to be feared.If they really wanted to write a compelling and mature story, they would have both partners have some experience and navigate the resulting fallout from doing so, while they work to build a healthy relationship between the two of them. Neither of them would have extensive histories, two partners at most, and they would show that they learned from their experiences without needing to repeat the same mistake excessively. I believe a wise man once said ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, can\'t put the blame on you"". I\'ll skip the rest, because he suggests violence at the third time, and that is too far. Showing that people, even teenagers, don\'t have to repeatedly make the same mistake to learn a lesson betters sells that they actually learned the lesson. It also prevents too much baggage building up and avoids Jerry Springer levels of undue drama.The art is good and the music is fine as well. The pacing is also fine. The key problem is the poor execution of the premise and really just a bad premise to begin with. If they fixed that beforehand and made sure to execute it properly, they could potentially have a real gem on their hands. due to him being a legitimate cunning snake or to even his passing, I could definitely see this doing something new and interesting.

While its overall production is average, it is still occasionally a refreshing take on the high school romance genre.To the story’s benefit, Ryuto and Runa start dating in episode one. This development allows the show to explore romantic themes that are interesting, but often unexplored due the genre’s emphasis (and dragging out of) ‘the pursuit’ of the relationship. It may feel refreshing to a romance fan to see this show discuss regret from previous relationships, the social consequences of dating, perceived (and real) social status differences between dating partners, dealing...with your boyfriend/girlfriend’s friends, jealousy, communication expectations and inferences, missing your opportunity to date someone you like, and exploring each person’s philosophies towards dating.Consequently, though I think these themes are underutilized and the characters are often less interesting than they could be, the show does successfully pull these themes out of its characters. Ryuto is mostly your run of the mill dorky guy who is compassionate when it is appropriate, perceptive when he needs to be, and scared the rest of the time. However, he can be interesting when he occasionally overwhelms Runa and wrestles with how others will perceive their relationship. Runa’s weakness is that she is too loving, too loyal, and too pretty, and has been just unfortunate regarding romantic partners. However, her regrets are relatable and their mutual attraction to each other seems natural.The supporting cast ranges from uninteresting and unlikable to interesting but two-dimensional. The production quality between animation and sound design is average. Not distracting, but not exceptional like My Dress Up Darling. The OP and ED are fine.In conclusion, this show so far has a good premise for a romance but under-utilizes its most interesting themes and over-relies on common character tropes to tell its story. Those who already enjoy anime romances will probably enjoy this one as a 7 or 8 and is relatively unique compared to other high school romances, but ultimately is not novel enough to draw in new fans. with your boyfriend/girlfriend’s friends, jealousy, communication expectations and inferences, missing your opportunity to date someone you like, and exploring each person’s philosophies towards dating.Consequently, though I think these themes are underutilized and the characters are often less interesting than they could be, the show does successfully pull these themes out of its characters.

This was back in middle school.  They eventually got seperated because her dad had different work situations that didn\'t allow her to stay at the same school.  Now, Ryuuto is tricked by his...friends Yuusuke and Ren to confess to another girl.  The pick this time?  The ever so popular Runa Shirakawa, known for going on lots of dates and dating... a lot of different dudes.  After confessing, they both basically start dating to ""try it out"".  It\'s a pretty weak premise, and may make you appreciate anime where the lead up to the final episode is where our main duo start to date.  Despite all this, the stories about our main characters are actually filled with a decent amount of drama and pull!Ryuuto and his friends game a lot, and have taken a liking to a streamer named KEN.  Together, they watch streams and discuss the latest happenings in the gaming world.  But, being high school friends, they tease each other in ways that many others might.  Including making Ryuuyo somehow confess to one of the most popular girls in his grade AND get her to say yes.  Runa comes with her own baggage, in that the whole school somehow how this unfair opinion on her as a girl, and it puts her in a weird position.  The rumours?  That she dates guys for a short time, sleeps with them, then is single again after a month or two.  It\'s not flattering.  That in itself could have built up more drama that it did, but still, it brings up a good point that the quiet and introverted Ryuuto dating a popular and outgoing Runa brings about a solid story.  The ""nice guy"" act?  Is Runa looking for what, and what parts of the rumours surrounding her are true?  I really liked what they did with her story because they aren\'t exactly easily answered.Nikoru is Runa\'s best friend and one of my favourite archetypes - the friend who always has your back.  Not only this, but she backs up those words EASILY.  She isn\'t one to mince words and makes it perfectly clear that she\'s watching out for Runa, including what nasty rumours float on about her.  If I didn\'t love her enough, she had a few plot points sprinkled around the season, and they do a good job displaying those sides of her.  As mentioned previously, Ryuuto\'s friends Ren and Yuusuke don\'t really amount to much outside of being included in a few episodes as being ""kind of there"".  They could have added more to their characters with what little we saw, but it never amounted to much.  Same goes for Shuugo Sekiya, a friend of Ryuuto\'s that he goes to cram school with.  His view of love is weirdly skewed in a certain direction, and I didn\'t feel like he added much to the series at all - outside of basically having one job in the series, which I didn\'t even like.  Maria joins the cast and randomly appears in Ryuuto\'s life for portions of the series.  And what does she do?  Immediately cause drama.  Her character does a really good job at giving this series a bit of a different feel, and her connections to Runa also add another solid layer to a series that keeps adding some stronger plot points.  Not everyone will like her because of certain lengths she goes through to see Ryuuto, but she\'s still a strong add to the series, and she develops quite nicely by the end.In case it wasn\'t obvious already, this series basically seeks to ask two questions: How will Ryuuto handle the most popular girl in his grade, especially when he isn\'t experienced at dating, and how will their very differing personalities clash?  These are strong storylines that, when done well, create some fantastic moments in romance anime.  And you know what?  I think it was handled pretty well.  Experience in dating is obviously what the series\' title is referring to, and watching the person who is ""experienced"" in dating going about her life with someone who isn\'t, was actually quite magical for me.  What\'s she expecting out of person number-x?  Her personality is quite bubbly and happy, and it lends itself well to having a partner with literally zero experience in dating.  Could she have pushed harder?  Yeah, maybe.  But seeing someone like Ryuuto try so hard for his partner is always a joy to watch.The strength of the series lies in the stories told in the middle, as these are the moments when Ryuuto and Runa are trying to sort out what makes them different, and how best the past the time when they have time together.  Some of the choices are somewhat predictable, or far too common in anime, but at the very least, they are executed well enough.  My personal favourite was a place that they went to with some other classmates because it was both different, and gave us time to see their personalities fleshed out a little more than usual.  Outside of our main duo, their many of Ryuuto\'s classmates don\'t interact with each other much, so this was a good moment to see that.As we get to the final episode, we expect a wrap up of sorts, but this series doesn\'t really do that in a conventional way.  Instead, they try and add a lot of ideas into the finale, and they\'re all really rushed.  They\'re strong, but they needed time to breath a bit more than they did.  With that amount of content, you could easily stretch it into two or three episodes and create more great moments between characters, and I wish they did that.  (Story: 8/10, Characters: 7/10)Art: This series probably wasn\'t very high budget, but the animation does it\'s job for the most part.  There\'s nothing too offensive in the movement or nicer moments, which is good to see.  For a series that sports a character with some questionable backstories like Runa, I was expecting some random fan service shots, but these were basically all kept out, thankfully.  (7/10)Sound: No real complaints about the sound either.  Again, it mostly does it\'s job here.  (7/10)Overall: Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me has some fantastic story moments, even if they could have been given more time to breath a little - specifically with some of our side characters, and the finale.  The low-ish production value didn\'t bother me all that much because getting to know two very different characters with our main duo was the draw of the series.  This is a decent school-romance pick up, even if it\'s not exceptional.  (7/10) friends Yuusuke and Ren to confess to another girl.  The pick this time?

Maria joins the cast and randomly appears in Ryuuto\'s life for portions of the series.  And what does she do?  Immediately cause drama.  Her character does a really good job at giving this series a bit of a different feel, and her connections to Runa also add another solid layer to a series that keeps adding some stronger plot points.  Not everyone will like her because of certain lengths she goes through to see Ryuuto, but she\'s still a strong add to the series, and she develops quite nicely by the end.In case it wasn\'t obvious already, this series basically seeks to ask two questions: How will Ryuuto handle the most popular girl in his grade, especially when he isn\'t experienced at dating, and how will their very differing personalities clash?  These are strong storylines that, when done well, create some fantastic moments in romance anime.  And you know what?  I think it was handled pretty well.  Experience in dating is obviously what the series\' title is referring to, and watching the person who is ""experienced"" in dating going about her life with someone who isn\'t, was actually quite magical for me.  What\'s she expecting out of person number-x?  Her personality is quite bubbly and happy, and it lends itself well to having a partner with literally zero experience in dating.  Could she have pushed harder?  Yeah, maybe.  But seeing someone like Ryuuto try so hard for his partner is always a joy to watch.The strength of the series lies in the stories told in the middle, as these are the moments when Ryuuto and Runa are trying to sort out what makes them different, and how best the past the time when they have time together.  Some of the choices are somewhat predictable, or far too common in anime, but at the very least, they are executed well enough.  My personal favourite was a place that they went to with some other classmates because it was both different, and gave us time to see their personalities fleshed out a little more than usual.  Outside of our main duo, their many of Ryuuto\'s classmates don\'t interact with each other much, so this was a good moment to see that.As we get to the final episode, we expect a wrap up of sorts, but this series doesn\'t really do that in a conventional way.  Instead, they try and add a lot of ideas into the finale, and they\'re all really rushed.  They\'re strong, but they needed time to breath a bit more than they did.  With that amount of content, you could easily stretch it into two or three episodes and create more great moments between characters, and I wish they did that.  (Story: 8/10, Characters: 7/10)Art: This series probably wasn\'t very high budget, but the animation does it\'s job for the most part.  There\'s nothing too offensive in the movement or nicer moments, which is good to see.  For a series that sports a character with some questionable backstories like Runa, I was expecting some random fan service shots, but these were basically all kept out, thankfully.  (7/10)Sound: No real complaints about the sound either.  Again, it mostly does it\'s job here.  (7/10)Overall: Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me has some fantastic story moments, even if they could have been given more time to breath a little - specifically with some of our side characters, and the finale.  The low-ish production value didn\'t bother me all that much because getting to know two very different characters with our main duo was the draw of the series.  This is a decent school-romance pick up, even if it\'s not exceptional.

To my surprise, the unfolding narrative transcended my initial reservations. Characters, steeped in genuine emotions, underwent tangible growth, lifting the series beyond the confines of anticipated clichés.Central to its theme was the exploration of intimate relationships, a subject handled with weight and nuance. It posed such connections as pivotal choices within the landscape of personal evolution and human connections.Though burdened...by the tired archetype of the improbable nerd securing the attention of the coveted love interest, I chose to forgive this familiarity, opting to appreciate the series for its commendable aspects.While not ascending to the echelons of top-tier anime, the journey offered sufficient engagement to merit this review.

The teenage toilet paper person in question actually asks out his crush (forced to by his loser friends) and enters a relationship with her, and the perfect gyaru waifu doesn’t understand men very well and tends to skip to base four on the first date because of a misguided belief that that’s how...relationships are supposed to work so she has… a lot of experience.That is the basic premise of the story. A popular girl goes out with an unpopular dork and he's got to man up and become someone worth dating. It’s a bit like My First Girlfriend is a Gal but a hundred times less shameless and a hundred times more light novel.Honestly, it’s not that bad of a show when it’s just focused on Runa and Ryuuto’s relationship which can be surprisingly sweet. They're very different people but they both accept and encourage their differences, developing trust and an understanding towards each other. I know it’s hard to believe that this is an anime romcom where the central couple are honest about their feelings towards one another, but they do! Would you be shocked if I told you there was HANDHOLDING before episode 4?? Hell, even a KISS before episode 5??? Wait a minute, hang on a second, wait, WHAT??? Relationship development? In my anime romcom?? HUH??Unfortunately where this show falls apart is in its supporting cast. While Runa’s friend Nikoru is a total bestie looking out for Runa and later Ryuuto after he wins her over, Ryuuto’s two friends are completely insufferable. They’re there to give Ryuuto relationship advice despite them never being in a relationship themselves and their advice usually ends up sabotaging Ryuuto’s confidence or creating unnecessary drama.But the cream of the insufferable crop is Maria who not only plays the “childhood friend who rejected me in middle school yet secretly has feelings for me” character but is also probably a psychopath. She is literally just there to cause drama.The art and animation are very average. They look like light novel characters, they move like light novel characters and they talk like light novel characters, by golly, it’s a light novel adaptation. Cheap as hell. What did you expect?Despite its mediocre story and an insufferable supporting cast, I think the biggest hurdle viewers will have to get over is how cringe-as-fuck the writing can be. Cringe is in the eye of the be-cringer but some of the writing and as well as Ryuuto himself had me putting my hands over my head and my balls retreating into my body. If you can push through that feeling nearly every episode then there is a nice little relationship to follow here.

Just because of that alone, there will surely be plenty of people that will hate this anime, because they are unable to see a main girl that is not a pure and...innocent angel getting the spotlight, however, the ones considering watching this anime should not bother with that, for this is the literal one single thing that it is able to do properly: the interaction between someone with experience and someone without, and how each of them reacts to one another.That is not to say though, that there are not plenty of others reasons to not watch this anime, because there surely are. From standard romances, it is probably among the worst ones of all, with not only very bad writing but also very bad investment on the anime, giving it ugly (though not the worst possible) animations, cheap style, lack of any significant music, and an horrible direction that cuts very relevant content from the light novel making some episodes utterly nonsensical. If that investment problem was all, it would not be a big issue, for romance animes tend to be less demanding in terms of animation and investment in general, to begin with, however it is not a case in which the quality of the animation sinks down the quality of the writing, it is a case in which both of these aspects hold hands and sink together to the bottom of the seas.Every single character is extremely shallow and plain uninteresting, with motives that the ones watching would easily wonder if the author even gave it some thoughts before writing it. From common nonsense of characters falling in love after an exchange of 5 words on the stairs, to the famous group of losers that spend most of their day horny and makes that their entire personality, this anime has most of the standard badly written scenarios, and the development of the plot and its attempts to create dramas doesn not fall behind. Each drama that happens throughout the anime manages to be sillier than the one that happened before, to the point that one could wonder if they are really teenagers, and not middle-school children because of such silly mentality, with characters fighting over the most stupid and irrelevant things, and even risking their relationships over reasons so petty that it feels absurd, the type of thing that could be solved by literally talking for 20 seconds with each other. Perhaps that was an attempt to replicate the silly nature that teenagers of this age tend to possess, but it is made in such an absurd and exaggerated way that instead it feels like the show is about kids of 8 years old fighting between themselves because one took the toy of the other.For those looking for something that simply has cute interactions, this anime may be something desirable, for it does have a few cute moments, but besides that; the fact that it follows well its premise of experience versus inexperience; and a few good original designs that manage to carry on even to the cheap animation, there is nothing else that this anime offers of valor. Every character besides the two main girls has absolutely zero depth, and while these two—Runa and Maria—does have a little bit more going for them, that does not save them from being badly written as well. Every other character—important characters, a relevant detail—is bad to the point that they do not even make sense, and if not straight from the beginning, they will disappoint and feel extremely childish or stupid at some point. innocent angel getting the spotlight, however, the ones considering watching this anime should not bother with that, for this is the literal one single thing that it is able to do properly: the interaction between someone with experience and someone without, and how each of them reacts to one another.That is not to say though, that there are not plenty of others reasons to not watch this anime, because there surely are.

The story and dialogue are generic. It does try to have a hook but a girl who penis hops every 2 months is not quite the kind of premise I think most people will find appealing. I\'m not judging...no wait I am. Maybe there is a groups people who find this concept amusing enough to watch.

At first glance, I admit, it seemed a tad unrealistic. I mean, don’t we all secretly hope that if we like someone, they might just like us back? But alas, reality doesn’t always play along—cue the wry laughter! 😄Now, let’s talk characters. Runa, oh Runa! She’s a gem—far from perfect, mind you. She tiptoes on the tightrope between adulthood and youthful innocence. Her quirks? Endearing. Her cuteness? Off the charts. 🌟And then there’s Ryuto. Initially, he’s...the shy kid in the corner, blushing at the mere thought of conversation. But hold your horses! By the final stretch, he blossoms into a character with depth and growth. It’s like watching a caterpillar transform into a butterfly—okay, maybe not that poetic, but you get the drift. 🦋Now, the anime itself mirrors its characters. It evolves, matures, and—dare I say—becomes downright captivating. Episode 11? A crescendo of emotions. You’ll feel it—the raw, unfiltered connection between this couple. It’s like catching fireflies in a jar—a fleeting, magical moment that warms your heart. ✨So, my friend, Kimi Zero isn’t just an anime; it’s a little vial of happiness. Silly? Perhaps. But it’s a remedy—a dose of peace, joy, and teenage romance. And sometimes, that’s all we need. 🌼🎶 the shy kid in the corner, blushing at the mere thought of conversation. But hold your horses!

While that is certainly how it starts off, it ends up telling a surprisingly deep and complex story. I would call Kimizero a celebration of imperfection: people make wrong choices, but that is okay, mistakes are something you can learn from! You can have one idea at one time and a different idea at another time — it's fine to change your mind! Different people have different preferences! Some parts of the show will seem blindingly inconsistent, but that misses the bigger point...that real life is not consistent, either.I especially like Kimizero because it dares to show happy people being happy, without those parts being boring. I feel like many other romance anime fail at this element in one way or another. The show does have weird tropey misunderstandings from time to time, but they are usually resolved refreshingly quickly.To be clear, Kimizero is not a literary masterpiece; some of the storyline choices are definitely questionable. If you're allergic to tropes of any kind in romance anime, and are utterly bored by the thought of a happy couple without underlying drama, Kimizero might not be for you.

Now who\'s the loser here huh?Alright, now let\'s be serious for a...moment, this is not why I\'m not reccomending this anime, many other titles have similar stories and characters, for example one that I actually reccomend that also has a gyaru main girl is ""Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman"", that one is pretty fun and has 12 enjoyable episodes, but this one is just stupid.The main reason I dislike this anime is because of the characters, the main dude is so plain, and the girl is kinda annoying and doesn\'t even look that good honestly.The other ""important"" character is the sister/ex-crush Maria, who could have been an actual interesting character but she\'s also way too weird and her story starts randomly.Basically she was the girl the main character confessed to years before, but of course she rejected him because... c\'mon you know it, HE IS A LOSER! But then, out of nowhere she is now interested in him, she actually loves him! Whaaat? No way.The other characters are also bland and annoying, there\'s not a single interesting one.I think that the problems started when they introduced Maria, if this anime was actually about a dude who\'s completely inexperienced when it comes to dating and a girl that already knows lots about dating, it would have been way better in my opinion, but no, let\'s just introduce this random girl at the start of the series and make the story focused on her.Honestly some episodes are enjoyable, like the fireworks one, but the more you watch it the less you care about finishing it, you already know what\'s gonna happen and like I said, besides some cute scenes it\'s not worth your time.The animations aren\'t even that good, it\'s one of the usual low quality romance anime but this time, the story quality also sucks.I had to watch the last episodes at x2 speed because I would have probably fell off my chair, so yeah maybe I lost some important story bits but honestly it probably wouldn\'t be worth it anyway. moment, this is not why I\'m not reccomending this anime, many other titles have similar stories and characters, for example one that I actually reccomend that also has a gyaru main girl is ""Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman"", that one is pretty fun and has 12 enjoyable episodes, but this one is just stupid.The main reason I dislike this anime is because of the characters, the main dude is so plain, and the girl is kinda annoying and doesn\'t even look that good honestly.The other ""important"" character is the sister/ex-crush Maria, who could have been an actual interesting character but she\'s also way too weird and her story starts randomly.Basically she was the girl the main character confessed to years before, but of course she rejected him because... c\'mon you know it, HE IS A LOSER!

There are so many romances out there that have deeply moved me with their plot and execution, but that\'s just one of many things Our Dating Story does badly, execution.If I understand correctly, Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and the Inexperienced Me, is a show about characters with such cripplingly low self-esteem all growing up together and trying to overcome that. On top of a story about a group of people who are all the same on the surface but so wildly different on the inside. This is a...concept I can get behind. However, this is a show that feels like nothing goes as the Author intended. Moments that were supposed to be emotional character moments feel unintelligent. Like Ryuto saying ""I\'m so disgusting for this"" because he disagreed with Runa about the color of a flier. Almost all the ""drama"" in this show could\'ve been avoided with a talk and a little maturity. The characters self-deprecation is hard to watch, it reminds me of my 14-year-old self. I highly doubt that\'s what the Author intended. To say nothing of Runa\'s greatly criticized character, the characters in this show top to bottom feel shallow and unintelligent. I don\'t mean that as in they\'re idiots or anything, unintelligently written. Although some are idiots too.In terms of comedy, most of the jokes were just your run of the mill anime gags. I can\'t say the jokes in this show caused me to laugh much, but for what it\'s worth, I did laugh a decent amount during this show. Most of it just happened to be at how ridiculous the actual plot was. I kept switching between laughing at it and getting genuinely frustrated. It was hard to pick. In general, the actual comedy was generic.It all feels somewhat generic. It somehow feels like both a generic romance with no interesting dynamics and a nonsensical melodrama that made you feel like you were missing something from how ridiculous it was. Like the core message behind the show is ""Teenagers are fucking stupid"". It actually makes ""My Stepmoms Daughter is my Ex"" look like a well thought out drama. On top of that there\'re about 0 meaningful twists in this entire story after the first episode. It all goes exactly how you\'d expect. I had to force myself through the later episodes.Personally, never has animation quality been a factor in enjoyment. However, it is worth noting that the animation here is subpar. It\'s normally not enough to be a bother though, besides in the ""Survival Games"" episode. That was embarrassing to watch.To say something positive, I will mention the peppy opening is very good. Maaya Uchida continues to impress.In conclusion, Media is subjective. Everyone is moved by different things. But to me, ""Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and the Inexperienced Me"" Is an anime that maybe had a semi-interesting concept, but one that just never got going. Started slow, was nonsensical and frustrating throughout, and had an ending that wasn\'t ""bad"", but it didn\'t make up for having to watch all of this. Perhaps it has to do with my past issues with low self-esteem, but I did not at all like how this was portrayed here. I appreciate the intent, but it just wasn\'t executed well. 4/10 concept I can get behind. However, this is a show that feels like nothing goes as the Author intended.

I had to force myself through the later episodes.Personally, never has animation quality been a factor in enjoyment. However, it is worth noting that the animation here is subpar. It\'s normally not enough to be a bother though, besides in the ""Survival Games"" episode. That was embarrassing to watch.To say something positive, I will mention the peppy opening is very good. Maaya Uchida continues to impress.In conclusion, Media is subjective. Everyone is moved by different things. But to me, ""Our Dating Story: The Experienced You and the Inexperienced Me"" Is an anime that maybe had a semi-interesting concept, but one that just never got going. Started slow, was nonsensical and frustrating throughout, and had an ending that wasn\'t ""bad"", but it didn\'t make up for having to watch all of this. Perhaps it has to do with my past issues with low self-esteem, but I did not at all like how this was portrayed here. I appreciate the intent, but it just wasn\'t executed well. 4/10', ""The voice of Ryuuto is a pain to the ears for the full 12 episodes this show has. I can not believe how embarrassed I sometimes felt to even listen to what comes out of Ryuuto's mouth. Ryuuto is literally acting like a cuck non stop. The way he talks makes u want stop watching anime. Imagine having a conversation with someone, and everytime u hear this sound from Ryuuto: ddwaaahhhuu, dwhhaauhh, uughhm, aahhhmm. He makes this sound like 5 times an episode. Why? The classic introvert, the classic getting flustered at his girl, the classic I'm a dumbass. I dont understand why Japanese anime...and manga creators keep making these extreme losers in dating series. If you do, atleast develop them so it makes it more fun and manga creators keep making these extreme losers in dating series. If you do, atleast develop them so it makes it more fun"", 'This show is one of the most overrated shows in recent times but as I saw, many people are picking different reasoning for it than me...First, I don\'t care about that ""good quality stuff"" cringe, which is still cringe but you can feel like teen girl watching her favorite duo doing weird things. It\'s something you usually expect in romcoms.But there are different reasons, why this anime is bad (and I am basically giving it points just for the animation and some idea at the start of the story).First reason - character development. There are pieces, that don\'t have character development or have small...one. It\'s often boring, because you are watching multiple episodes/seasons of characters behaving literally the same way, not learning from their mistakes and just doing stupid things. But here is something I would call a reversed character development. Multiple characters not only that they don\'t learn from their mistakes but even creating more stupid scenarios based on their behavior. And it\'s not ""annoying"" in that positive way but rather in negative one.Second reason - toxic and abusive relationships. Sorry, it\'s romcom, you usally expect something sweet or something interesting or something what you can learn from. What is this story about once more, please? About abusive relationships? That\'s right! There are multiple characters either having romantic or friendly toxic relationship between each other. And not only it\'s annoying, it gives you a thought ""Does creator really think this is alright?"", because most of the anime it looks like it\'s something that creator wants to defend for any cost. To me, it really isn\'t alright to show multiple psychically abusive relationships, with many red flags and something you should avoid IRL. Where is exactly fun in that?Third reason - unrealistic as much as it can be. Again, I know it\'s a romcom, some of them are really far from something realistic, some of them have actually pretty realistic story, feelings, etc... But this is as far from reality as possible. Doesn\'t matter whether you pick a sister of one of the main characters or their friends or base of their relationship - everything is unbelieveable. During entire anime you have even some random encounters with other characters or random events which basically don\'t make sense at all, because they don\'t fit into the story and not even characters seem conflicted about them. They disappear and all characters are like ""oh, nothing happened, i don\'t remember last X hours"".So, in my conclusion. You have some romcom based on toxic and psychically abusive relationships, story is basically non-existent, character development is rather reversed if something and final episodes aren\'t even worth finishing the anime. As nice as it was in like first 1-2 episodes, it went straight to the hell with everything. Music is average at best and I can really give points just for the animation and some starting idea. Because the rest of the anime definitely can\'t be enjoyed by person who likes either romcoms, romantic topic in general, at least basic story or some logical chain of events with satisfying ending. And since the first episodes are something totally different from the rest of it, I wouldn\'t hold back to call this a trap anime. one.

Ryuuto is an insecure and shy boy, even being afraid to speak to a girl, being a relatable character. This character is perfect for creating an interesting dynamic with the outgoing and confident girl and the viewer can easily understand Ryuuto's way of thinking. The story shows the possibility of a romance between an extroverted gyaru who has many ex-boyfriends already and an introverted boy who doesn't have any experience, an interesting premise. It is a good reminder to...not judge the girl because she has many exes, since she can change and fall in love later. Also, all her previous relationships were not true love, and now she is experiencing a sincere romance for the first time. Despite being a spineless character, Ryuuto is capable of showing Runa how to experience a true and sweet romance for the first time, which puts him above the guys who only wanted to have fun with her in the past.After the introduction of a third character, the anime becomes a love triangle that creates most of the drama throughout. The problem of this dynamic is that it doesn't work here. For the triangle to be interesting, it needs a possibility for the boy to be with any of the two girls. If it is known already that one girl will be chosen and the other has no chance, the tension becomes predictable and trifle.Aside from Ryuuto and Runa, the anime has two good characters: Maria and Nikoru. Maria is Runa's twin sister, who has the opposite personality to Runa. She is the character with the most depth in the anime as she is not as stereotyped as the protagonists. This anime would be better if Maria had more screen time. The other character is Nikoru, Runa's best friend. The reason she is such a good character is the contrast between the angry gyaru persona and the sweet personality deep down, and she is also a better character than Runa.With so many good qualities, what prevents Kimizero from greatness is the lack of depth in the characters and the low production value. The characters are plain and predictable, which prevents the drama from having a big impact on the viewer; Ryuuto's best friends Nishina and Ijichi are good examples, who are bad even as side characters. As for the production value, that is what you would expect from the average adaptation of a romcom light novel, and it also doesn't help that the studio ENGI is not known for making good animes in the first place; the art is decent, but unimpressive, and it is too weak in some scenes. The opening and ending songs are good, but the soundtrack is forgettable. As for the seiyuus, the one I have to commend for voicing Maria is Koga Aoi, who is already famous for voicing Shinomiya Kaguya. Her excellent job is a big reason why Maria was such an endearing character.Kimizero delivers an enjoyable and satisfactory romance. However, with such an interesting premise and setting, it feels like the anime didn't reach its potential. With better technical elements and more complex characters, this could be something great. not judge the girl because she has many exes, since she can change and fall in love later.

I don't get why people hate on Runa's character- that's the whole point of her development and also the revelation of several parts of her background. Nonetheless though, I still love this anime. I will admit, the episodes closer to the end get a bit slower and I am not the biggest fan of them but it does a good job of wrapping up in the end.Love it, would recommend. "", 'Here we have an average anime that would normally be seen and forgotten in the sea of Romcoms released every year, but which received a wave of completely unnecessary hate.The premise of the story revolves around Kashima Ryuuto, a totally ordinary boy, who manages to date Shirakawa Runa, the most popular girl in school and who is famous for having had many boyfriends because her relationships apparently don\'t last very long.For some reason this premise of a female protagonist who is not an untouched virgin was more shocking than other stories from this same season in which we had things like the defense of incestuous...relationships, relationships between adults and teenagers or between a pig and a human.In fact, without going into spoilers, it surprised me how the story, although it doesn\'t make a big judgment about Runa\'s past, makes it clear how she is much more a victim of guys who used her and threw her away, but in the first few episodes it demonstrates the importance of keeping your ""first times"" to share when you feel ready and with the people you really want.Now getting into what\'s really bad about this story, I highlight the subpar animation which, combined with uninspired direction, makes emotional moments not very impactful and makes the comic timing very bad at times.Although I sympathize with some characters, most of them are empty and don\'t contribute anything to the story, or when a sub-plot with secondary characters is introduced it is executed in a way that made me wish they hadn\'t even tried to do something with them.Honestly, I had fun watching this anime, I liked the premise and the message but I admit that it is an average anime but it received much more attention than it should have and for incredibly silly reasons. If you like romcoms, give this anime a chance and see for yourself how all the controversy surrounding this anime is completely unnecessary. relationships, relationships between adults and teenagers or between a pig and a human.In fact, without going into spoilers, it surprised me how the story, although it doesn\'t make a big judgment about Runa\'s past, makes it clear how she is much more a victim of guys who used her and threw her away, but in the first few episodes it demonstrates the importance of keeping your ""first times"" to share when you feel ready and with the people you really want.Now getting into what\'s really bad about this story, I highlight the subpar animation which, combined with uninspired direction, makes emotional moments not very impactful and makes the comic timing very bad at times.Although I sympathize with some characters, most of them are empty and don\'t contribute anything to the story, or when a sub-plot with secondary characters is introduced it is executed in a way that made me wish they hadn\'t even tried to do something with them.Honestly, I had fun watching this anime, I liked the premise and the message but I admit that it is an average anime but it received much more attention than it should have and for incredibly silly reasons.

I am so glad I did not listen to the reviews of this anime because I LOVED IT!! For people who are like me that enjoy a little bit of spice, but still like that high school romance and a happy ending, this is for you. Watch it, soak it up. The only thing I did not like was that this anime teased us at the end with this couple discussing taking their relationship one step further and then ends the season! I thought this was a light-hearted anime that touched on realistic topics and addressed them which I really enjoyed. I...also like the romance in this as well. The reason why this did not get a higher score was A. They did not give us what we wanted at the end if you know what I mean and B. Because there were moments where I got frustrated with the male protagonist and I felt like he did not learn but that is just me also like the romance in this as well.

There are generally ""flags"" that get triggered. This show wastes no time presenting those flags.1. A ""weak"" male figure who makes his romantic interest his whole world while blushing many times even at the very thought of her? He makes his crush his whole personality? Acts like a doormat? Acts like the stereotypical cliche?2. The crush is the popular girl that is ""out of his league""3. The main guy\'s friends truly feel like background noise and look very generic....even resembling...each other with the bare minimum of design difference. And of course, they have to be jealous of the mc because they also are not noticed much by the female gender.4.  The show feels like an ""introduction"" that ""hey, girls and guys can like each other more than friends"" that\'s targeted to preteen girls.5. The animation budget feels cheap or that the story doesn\'t require much budget for animation......... aka how much a character moves their bodies besides their eyes or mouths.6. The show feels like it follows the same plot as hundreds of other shows that came before it.Now, let me be clear.....There are some school romcoms that may hit a few flags but excel so greatly in that stereotype that it makes it a whole new beast...even a unique beast in the same cliche, so to speak. One example is The Dangers in My Heart. THAT is one of the very few exceptions because the characters truly are unique in their own ways that\'s different of other main characters of other shows AND that their interactions are cute, but not cringe, and feel realistic for a first love.This show is not an exception.

Having a heroine be experienced for once was refreshing. She has had some crap sack bf’s in the past, her longest relationships last just under 3 months. The bf’s would get annoyed with how clingy she was, use her for sex or just cheat on her. We all knew that the MC wanted to take her to pound town from the beginning but letting her choose when she was ready to take the next steps really made the MC shine for me.For all the people who like Maria more here is something for you. Maria only...liked him once she realized she couldn’t have him. That kind of person will drop you in a heart beat once they start to see your flaws and you aren’t that ideal person they put up on a pedestal. Runa excepts him flaws and all and truly cherishes him because she knows he is truly a kind hearted person. That is why Runa is by far the better option in the short term and long term. Maria really needs therapy, to try and steal her sister’s BF just because she doesn’t like her is so messed up. Ya some shit happened to Maria in the past but non of that was Runa’s fault it was their parents. So all the hatred that Maria has for Runa should be reflected back to their parents. Maria is mad because the boy that was chasing her is now in love with the person she hates the most. That's the only reason why she wants him now. It baffles me how many people choose Maria just cause she has her V card. Like my guys in real life are you expecting your girl to be a virgin. Sorry that is not reality my guys. If you don’t accept someone’s past and move forward. Then you will never work with that person. Just because Runa has lost her virginity doesn't make her less of a person or a bad person.

I have read My first girlfriend is a gal up to about chapter 145 twice (u can check my profile and see the dates) and I think the story for Kimizero was better told and wasn’t just an ecchi fest.

I watched this anime without reading the genre at all, so when I watched the first episode, what I thought really happened.The main characters are also like any other romcom main characters, they are shy about getting deeper but actually want to do so. But after I finished watching the first three episodes, I started to realize that what the main characters did this time was for the best.I honestly feel...sorry for what the main female character has gone through, she was just considered an easy girl and then abandoned by her ex-boyfriends. Even worse, they spread bad rumors after the breakup.With so many unpleasant experiences, the main character feels that sexual needs are the main obligation that the girlfriend must provide so that her boyfriend doesn't run off after other women. She also misinterprets what love really is. The male main character is instrumental in the progress of the female main character's development.To be honest, what I expect in this anime is the opposite, because the male main character is very gloomy, I feel that he will get more development from the help of the female main character. But after I finished the anime, the male main character also got significant character development. He's no longer a gloomy man, although he still feels like a gloomy man at times. But he's trying to get out of his gloom in order to maintain his relationship with the female main character.In the end, they both grow and understand each other, and that's how a healthy love story should be. Making mistakes is not a problem, everything can be solved with communication with each other.This anime not only presents the romance of the two main characters, but there are also romance stories for other supporting characters. There are also other problems that make this anime not always focused on romance.In terms of animation and lighting, I really enjoyed the anime. I think ENGI studio can keep up with the visual graphics of today's anime. Character depiction in my opinion is quite good, the author can make other characters look different with various details such as hairstyles and facial expressions.Overall this is a light romance anime to watch when you are tired. Everything will go well according to what you want. so don't be afraid when watching this anime and thinking that your expectations will be hit by a plot twist. sorry for what the main female character has gone through, she was just considered an easy girl and then abandoned by her ex-boyfriends.

It\'s basically a fake Hajimete no Gal (which I don\'t like either to be honest) where the main guy, Ryuuto Kashima, is set up by his friends to confess to this one popular girl, Runa Shirakawa, and SOMEHOW the girl accepts the confession. If this isn\'t incel bait, then I don\'t know what...the fuck is. And also, despite this series being a fake Hajimete no Gal, bro Yukana at least had some dignity; this Runa girl doesn\'t even have that! 💀Like who the hell would freaking FUCK ON THE FIRST DATE? You may have seen it already, but if you don\'t know, yeah, they went home and Runa tried to fuck on the first date. You get what I\'m saying when I said ""at least Yukana had some dignity""?Runa being a skank aside, we also have another, more heavy-duty skank called Maria Kurose, who is siblings with Runa, but later took her mom\'s surname after divorce. Yeah, no wonder why they\'re acting like this, they\'re both fatherless after all... but yeah, at least Runa didn\'t think of stealing her sister\'s boyfriend. Maria, who Ryuuto liked in middle school, rejected Ryuuto since she didn\'t know ""what love was"" and decided to steal him from Runa after seeing Runa got him and feeling inferior to Runa yet again because of this. Bro, Turkish clan dramas with them sheikhs and shit don\'t got this much drama in it!Also, remember when I said ""it\'s basically a fake Hajimete no Gal""? Yeah, we also have a heterosexual Ranko Honjou over here. Her name is Nicole Yamana and with the way she acts, she straight up resembles Ranko Honjou. ""I don\'t wanna see Runa cry."" sounds familiar?Animation quality, well, is average, as expected from a series like this. I don\'t recall any bad moments but I don\'t recall any impressive animation moments either. Well, it\'s a romance anime after all, if you don\'t push it to make it bad, like they did with Sasakoi, then it\'ll most likely be just fine.Soundtracks are impressive to be honest, as a music producer, it sometimes inspired me to sample that shit to cook up.

There could have been more events where it was not so expected. When you watched over 150 anime, it starts to get real repetitive real fast, especially when it comes to romance type anime. What would have made this anime more enjoyable is if after maybe halfway into the show, the main protagonist starts to become more of a man and take action. Just became frustrating and lost all comedic value after the first few episodes. I was close to dropping this but just went on...to give it a shot and finish it at 2x speed. Meh. Not impressed. to give it a shot and finish it at 2x speed. Meh. Not impressed.', 'This show actually had potential and I felt intrigued by some of the concepts shown in episode 1, but it ends up introducing drama just for the sake of drama and sadly falls into patterns and predictable plot points which causes all of the potential to turn to nothingness.The characters are very stereotypical (Gyaru and lonely Otaku) and it tries to break free from said stereotypes but ultimately fails to do so. The main character Ryuuto is incredibly bland and basically more or less ""forced"" to date the Gyaru as the relationship pretty much came to be in a completely unnatural way,...after he lost a bet with his friends and he ""had to ask her out"". Unlike you would expect, she actually ends up accepting like it was nothing, which as mentioned before has the potential to be intriguing since it is a rather strange way to get a relationship started. Another promising aspect is Runa\'s apparent mistreatment and exploitation in past relationships which could have made for interesting character development. While it sounds nice on paper, it ends up being a lot of potential which is not followed up upon.They somehow can\'t talk about their problems like human beings and it introduces plot twist which had me rolling my eyes at best. The aspect about the apparent mistreatment never really gets built up further other than the first episode and so she turns into a robotic stereotypical Gyaru who is nice to everyone. The show tries to focus on the romantic scenes but they tend to be awkward because the main character is, well, awkward and that\'s about all I can say for his character. He stays quiet when he shouldn\'t and this leads to problems getting worse and worse cause he can\'t speak up. It tends to feel like the drama is shoehorned into the story cause they had to make it interesting somehow and include drama because ""every romance needs it"".  There\'s also the usual ""misunderstanding arc"" towards the end which is completely unnecessary because it could have been avoided entirely if they actually talked about their feelings.The animation is average at best. The supporting characters are also pretty bland and forgettable, other than Maria who probably has the most complex character as basically the ""love crasher"".  Everything is just painfully average, which summarizes the anime quite well. While not completely horrible, is is also not a good romance Anime by any means. It sort of just exists and is okay but there\'s many, MANY better options to chose from.

The anime is definitely not worth it. It's just a mix of clichés, I thought I'd already given up after the first episodes but I told myself that it would perhaps surprise me like The Danger In My Heart but in the end it was really a waste of time.The MC is the most pathetic character I've seen in a romcom, he's so cringe he's the perfect simp. He's already a big hypocrite who thinks he's different from the girl's exes but he comes up with all kinds of crazy ideas just to hold the girl's hand.

That's what he appears at first when we see him with his degrading thoughts. It  geninuely made me scratch my head when he managed to score with the undoubtfully the most beautiful girl in the show, Runa Shirakawa. How could this happen? Isn't she way out of his league? Trust me, a lot of people would be asking the same questions.Our Dating Story The Experienced You and The Inexperienced Me couldn't sound any more honest as a title. You can probably figure out which character represents the 'experienced' and 'inexperienced'. The show...aims at an audience who wants to experience their dating story.A story about two lovebirds is nothing new in the anime industry as we know of today. It appears the show wanted to build on both characters from the very start, and having them with very different personalities and traits. Ryuuto has that lack of confidence in himself while being far too normal representing the 'Average Joe'. Taking a good look and you won't be able to name one distinctive physical trait about him. On the other hand, Runa can be described in a million words with her glamorous look and laviscious figure. It got to the point where there were even rumors spread about her because she is way too popular. Personality wise, Ryuuto is about as dull as a doorknob and often attracts the wrong type of attention. Runa of course makes the male population turn their heads while maintaining a bubbly and bright personality almost every time she is on screen. For most people, they look like two characters of different species.When Ryuuto and Runa goes out for first time, it evokes a feeling of awkwardness. The show sees their dating story almost like an experiment with each of their dates and interactions. As the two come to learn and understand each other, it becomes more and more clear that Runa does indeed loves Ryuuto and not using him. Deep down, Runa is truly an honest person, unlike Maria Kurose, her twin sister. If you don't believe me, just watch one of the later episodes and see the desperate moves she tries to get Ryuuto to see her. Truth to be told, Runa represents the ideal girlfriend, almost like a trophy wife. She seemingly has no flaws and tries to make the best out of every date she goes on with Ryuuto. She is not afraid of her wild side or express her own thoughts. Despite going out with Ryuuto, she doesn't change much throughout the show either. In fact, Runa improves her own image and proves that she doesn't need to be beautiful to be an ideal person. Similarly, Ryuuto grows throughout the show and even defends his girlfriend when she needs it the most.On Ryuuto's side however, he must deal with being in the public's attention. His popularity and public image only fuels fire from jealous guys and even Runa's best friend. Nikrou Yamana makes it a point throughout the show to make sure Ryuuto is the right person for Runa. Some people may misjudge her at first glance but she is just as honest and friendly as Runa. And because this is a rom-com, there's a place for romance in her hearts too. You'll have to watch to see who she gets with but trust me, she is a far better person than Maria can ever be. Unfortunately, it appears the author and this show altogether dumps the rest of the supporting cast into irrelevance. Outside of Runa, Ryuuto, Maria and Nikrou, every other character can easy be forgotten including their names. Ryuuto's circle of friends are a bunch of thirsty guys who can't find their place in life. Even Nikrou's friend Akari doesn't make much of an impact as she is overshadowed easily by our main cast.

About halfway thru the series I did get a little bored as I felt the story had reached a natural conclusion but it just kept going.To add to that, it felt like the last 4 episodes were stuffed with unnecessary drama purely to meet an episode quota. I don\'t think the viewers were given much time...to get to know many of the side characters so asking them to suddenly care about their love lives is a bit of an ask. I\'m not even sure if the endings for the three subplots were any good--I can\'t really say they were bad but I don\'t feel satisfied with how any of them ended up except for our main pair.

The female character is unfortunately the ""dumb promiscuous blonde"" type, but when you look underneath it it\'s really about this girl who\'s only ever really...been used for her body, and has never had a genuinely deep relationship with a guy, which is a very real thing a lot of teen (and even adult) girls can relate to.

I get it. They are supposed to be teenagers. Teen years are characterised by being an idiot. I get it. Listen. Everyone has the right to be a moron. Both in life and in anime. These two just abuse that privilege. But I’m getting too...far ahead, we’ll get to that point soon enough.Let’s have a look at the main cast.Ryuuto Kashima - a 16 year old moron, I mean, highschool student. He has a crush on Runa but is determined to keep it to himself. As this is a shitty highschool romcom You can guess that this plan hits the wall in episode one and dies an agonising death. Why an agonising death You might ask? First of all, good question, I’m glad You’re showing initiative. Secondly… because he’s forced to confess to her by his friends and only because he had better exam scores than them. Yes. It’s that moronic. It’s just a lazy, non organic way to get the main relationship going. As a bonus it shows our MC as a spineless wimp that does what he’s told. Yeah. Totally a character to root for. I’ll give credit where credit is due, he’s a loyal friend that tries to help his friends in their romances (at least one of them… and in just one instance. Ok… so maybe he’s not that helpful but I take what I can get at this point.) and he has his passions. He has zero experience with dating and often acts like a lobotomite when it comes to his girlfriend. The thing I really liked was the fact that the moment he starts geeking out at something he just becomes a fast talking, not exactly registering the surroundings, embodiment of a wikipedia page. I can respect that. Apart from that he’s the kind of character that went all the way in luck during creation. Which is to say, he’s mostly a boring, run of the mill anime MC.Runa Shirakawa - A cheerful gyaru that is admired, or rather lusted after, by a lot of boys in her school. It is said that she had a lot of boyfriends and that her relationships never lasted more than 3 months. There even is a rumour going around her school that she just uses boys as her personal sex toys. She wanted to fall in love and marry her first love just like it happened with her parents. Strangely enough she doesn’t change that plan even after her parents divorced. I guess adaptation is a foreign concept to her. That said, she does evolve during the show. She changes her outlook on relationships and even admits that this one could be considered the first serious one… and in the next episode she plays a martyr and wants to destroy it because she’s afraid.There are 5 other recurring characters but to be fair, apart from one, they are not important to the overarching plot so I’m not gonna waste Your time with them.Let’s talk a bit about Shirakawa and how she’s written. When we meet her she’s kind of a sex toy. Yes I know, a bit blunt, but let me elaborate. One of the first things she does when she accepts Kashima’s confession is to take him home and offer sex. Just like that. The show even portrays that she sees it as her duty and not something she really wants. To be honest it’s an interesting starting point. It doesn’t exactly show her in the best light but that's intentional. Thanks to that Kashima can reject the offer (even if his inner voice shows us that he really wants to have sex with her) and solidify his position as a good person who’s interested in more than just Shirakawa’s body. Heavy handed? Yes. A bit idiotic? Most certainly. Does it work? I guess, kind of? It is a bit strange. A girl starts to undress and all he does is panic and over analyse this situation and later regrets that. You could pass it as him being a teenager and lacking experience but it still doesn’t make that scene have more sense.Kashima isn’t in a better position in the writing department. Most of the time he just reacts to what happens. Even when he’s proactive it only happens as a reaction to something. He proactively made a solid plan for a birthday date but he only did that because someone told him about his girlfriend's birthday coming up. He didn’t even organically found out what she likes, again, it was told to him. Instead of giving us a scene where he witnesses her reactions to different stimuli and gets to know her preferences he is given an answer on a silver platter. Why? The most idiotic thing is that the moments when he is proactive by his own free will, are the moments that lead to misunderstandings. WHY? Let him be proactive with a positive consequence. As it stands the only one who is proactive with a goal of positively impacting the relationship is Shirakawa.I will give credit where credit is due. The evolution of both friend groups becoming friends isn’t a bad one. It gives rise to some new drama and even shows one of the characters as a hypocrite. She’s a teenager so it fits. The bad news is that the side plots are often more interesting than the main one. I know, I know a common situation for anime in the last, at least, 15 years.Now for the worst part in my opinion.Good 90% of drama between Kashima and Shirakawa could be avoided if at least one of them didn’t have communication skills of an amoeba. Seriously. They don't communicate when it matters. They are fine with meaningless small talk and chit chat but when a situation arises that requires a good old fashion talk-no-jutsu they turn into mutes. Yes, the show sometimes gives them an excuse for it like with the summer arc, but it’s still moronic. There are more than one way to get in contact with someone. Especially when You know You left things unresolved. I seriously hope no one will think that the way they act is proper.As a consequence most of the times they talk is because the situation festered inside them for long enough to make them do/say something stupid. Like Shirakawa wanting to break up because she witnessed Kashima getting a confession from her sister and thinking he would be happier with her. That was, I think, the most idiotic, brain dead decision anyone could make in this situation. There are multiple options in such a situation. Like… oh, I don't know… telling him, she overheard that and that it makes her feel threatened so they could have a heart to heart about it and their relationship in general? Just a quick idea here.Most of the show feels not like a love story but like Shirakawa’s story of maturing and letting go of her past beliefs about relationships. That’s why I called it a “I can fix her” dialled up to 11. Kashima also grows but compared to Shirakawa his growth is statistically insignificant. He learns not to panic and even puts his studies high on the list.I don’t really recommend this show. The writing is lazy, the sub plots are more interesting than the main one and the main duo is pretty boring. far ahead, we’ll get to that point soon enough.Let’s have a look at the main cast.Ryuuto Kashima - a 16 year old moron, I mean, highschool student. He has a crush on Runa but is determined to keep it to himself. As this is a shitty highschool romcom You can guess that this plan hits the wall in episode one and dies an agonising death. Why an agonising death You might ask? First of all, good question, I’m glad You’re showing initiative. Secondly… because he’s forced to confess to her by his friends and only because he had better exam scores than them. Yes. It’s that moronic. It’s just a lazy, non organic way to get the main relationship going. As a bonus it shows our MC as a spineless wimp that does what he’s told. Yeah. Totally a character to root for. I’ll give credit where credit is due, he’s a loyal friend that tries to help his friends in their romances (at least one of them… and in just one instance. Ok… so maybe he’s not that helpful but I take what I can get at this point.) and he has his passions. He has zero experience with dating and often acts like a lobotomite when it comes to his girlfriend. The thing I really liked was the fact that the moment he starts geeking out at something he just becomes a fast talking, not exactly registering the surroundings, embodiment of a wikipedia page. I can respect that. Apart from that he’s the kind of character that went all the way in luck during creation. Which is to say, he’s mostly a boring, run of the mill anime MC.Runa Shirakawa - A cheerful gyaru that is admired, or rather lusted after, by a lot of boys in her school. It is said that she had a lot of boyfriends and that her relationships never lasted more than 3 months. There even is a rumour going around her school that she just uses boys as her personal sex toys. She wanted to fall in love and marry her first love just like it happened with her parents. Strangely enough she doesn’t change that plan even after her parents divorced. I guess adaptation is a foreign concept to her. That said, she does evolve during the show. She changes her outlook on relationships and even admits that this one could be considered the first serious one… and in the next episode she plays a martyr and wants to destroy it because she’s afraid.There are 5 other recurring characters but to be fair, apart from one, they are not important to the overarching plot so I’m not gonna waste Your time with them.Let’s talk a bit about Shirakawa and how she’s written. When we meet her she’s kind of a sex toy. Yes I know, a bit blunt, but let me elaborate. One of the first things she does when she accepts Kashima’s confession is to take him home and offer sex. Just like that. The show even portrays that she sees it as her duty and not something she really wants. To be honest it’s an interesting starting point. It doesn’t exactly show her in the best light but that's intentional. Thanks to that Kashima can reject the offer (even if his inner voice shows us that he really wants to have sex with her) and solidify his position as a good person who’s interested in more than just Shirakawa’s body. Heavy handed? Yes. A bit idiotic? Most certainly. Does it work? I guess, kind of? It is a bit strange. A girl starts to undress and all he does is panic and over analyse this situation and later regrets that. You could pass it as him being a teenager and lacking experience but it still doesn’t make that scene have more sense.Kashima isn’t in a better position in the writing department. Most of the time he just reacts to what happens. Even when he’s proactive it only happens as a reaction to something. He proactively made a solid plan for a birthday date but he only did that because someone told him about his girlfriend's birthday coming up. He didn’t even organically found out what she likes, again, it was told to him. Instead of giving us a scene where he witnesses her reactions to different stimuli and gets to know her preferences he is given an answer on a silver platter. Why? The most idiotic thing is that the moments when he is proactive by his own free will, are the moments that lead to misunderstandings. WHY? Let him be proactive with a positive consequence. As it stands the only one who is proactive with a goal of positively impacting the relationship is Shirakawa.I will give credit where credit is due.

Many couples needs to know each other for a long  to be together, some just take few minutes, or even first glance.This Anime give\'s me vibe of another one, Golden Time. While it surely gave off that vibe almost through out the whole story, especially at the...end and beginning, I wouldn\'t say they have that much in common, and i wouldn\'t try comparing them, even though some might think they are.About the characters they are the polar opposites and is kind of assumable that the male lead has made more research on the relationship topic and is more experienced, rather than his partner, where as she wasn\'t in the honest, true, loving relationship, and didn\'t do research on that, just got ""REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE"", which isn\'t always bad, but in this situation it really is.Gladly this anime never lost a spark and is amazing.

He and his friends expect a brutal rejection, but...to his surprise, she accepted his confession and dated him.Far from the image that he had about Runa, she is down-to-Earth, kind, and unfortunately 'easy.' It's a character flaw that made her susceptible to scumbags who don't even care about her, and Ryuuto has differentiated himself as that guy who cares for her, that somebody whom she could be vulnerable and love.So from someone placed on a pedestal, Ryuuto has learned that the pedestal doesn't exist and that he can be on equal terms with Runa, which is something unlike in Rent-a-GF where despite many episodes where Mizuhara is humanised and presented as flawed, Kazuya still views Mizuhara on a pedestal.On the other hand, Ryuuto's character flaw is his indecision. Yes, he now has a relationship with the most popular girl in class, but that reality is incongruent with his self-image.Case in point, at one episode he wanted to hold her hand, which is pretty much a low level of compliance. But earlier, Runa has offered him sex, a high level of compliance. Logically, a kiss let alone a hand holding should not be that hard, except that at that point in the anime, he hasn't reconciled reality with his self-image.Thus, Ryuuto is far from the ideal of the alpha male and there are several cringe moments. That said, the beauty of watching this anime is that Ryuuto is a good enough and relatable bloke that you would want to root for. Any kind of progress is something to cheer on, so that eventually hand holding and kissing is something that's no longer a big deal in the context of a relationship.In other words, change even if slow is possible and commendable. That's the case with Ryuuto with respect to his relationship with Runa. (Or the change can be drastic like his friend Ijichi when from a fat loser, he has transformed into a k-pop looking stud as a result of being rejected by Akari, one of Runa's friends.)Yes, KimiZero is generic in that standard tropes are used such as misunderstanding and a love triangle. There are inconsistencies here and there, and the animation is far from a visual fest.I don't mind as the execution is better than many I've seen (though perhaps it prevents me from scoring it as a masterpiece). Whereas other romance anime would drag a misunderstanding for 2 or 3 episodes, the misunderstanding is resolved within that episode.In conclusion, KimiZero is a comfort anime that I find enjoyable to watch. It's not something profound like Evangelion or Frieren, but it is at least entertaining and you can look forward to watching each episode.A season 2 is more than welcome, but unfortunately it's not likely. to his surprise, she accepted his confession and dated him.Far from the image that he had about Runa, she is down-to-Earth, kind, and unfortunately 'easy.'

He is ready to be rejected as he has feelings for her (a crush), but to everyone\'s suprise she says yes, and to lest give it a chance.So, I will try to continue to write without spoilers from now on.Story: I liked that in the story, the writers sometimes present a more...mature and realistic way of romance and relationships (loke talking about sex in a healthy, not pervert way, talking about the need to support each other and help with each others past traumas, 16 year olds having the body of adults but not mature enough so they get i to 2-3 months realtionships mostly for sex), the romance between the main couple actually feels well paced and organic for like 10% of the time.And now comes the remaining 90%.Like damn, the writers really did not k ow what to do here. Lets start by saying that the Fmc is a 16 year old whore (okay, okay, she just had some issues, which was never expanded upon so I can cut her some slack, but I will write about this more in the characters section).Most of the time, instead of the more mature and honestly way better starting attitude to romance, the series devolves into indirect kiss and handholding, aint no way (you maybe get pregananananat).Its hard to write without spoilers, but as you have seen above with the Fmc, this is a very ""I have zero idea whats going on"" moment from the writers.Then you have moments, where you just look at the window after watching them, and think like ""Am I that stupid, or they are"", moments where the story is so forced into drama and conflict, or forced to get out of conflict that it physically hurts to watch.I would have more about the story, but for the sake of spoiler free review, lets move on to the characters (Not that there is really a coherent story anyway). Have I ever mentioned how stupid the story and the things that keep happening are?No, well, they are.Characters: Generic, 2d, average maybe even bad, plain stupid, thats how I could desribe them. The generic fake gyaru Dmc, with the generic kind introvert gamer nerd Mc. The show shows some promise in this department in the first few episodes, as we see that their actions have some semblance of motives, past traumas that needs to be conquered, the characters are not only what they look like, but it is left hanging, as these are never expanded upon, you can make a hedcanon out of them, but no depth was given to the characters.On that note, the side characters are as generic as they can be, not to mention they only are there when the story needs them, they dont really exist outside of that, or at least not shown.Generic I will hurt you if you hurt my bestfriend but in gyaru form - checkGeneric introvert gamer nerd friends, who piss themselves when a girl talks to them - checkGeneric everyone talks about me behind the main couples back (except their friends) background characters - checkGeneric other love interest, who tries to steal Mc - check (to be fair, she is the most well tought out character in the whole show, but its still very weakly written and never expanded upon, so that says something).Music: To be fair, the bgm and op and ed were good, nothing out of left field, but they made the show much better.Art: This is another department the show lacks, the character designs are simple, which would not be bad, but they are either moving very awkwardly or only be seen in still shots, and the background looks like someone throw a paint bucket at a canvas most of the time, so pretty bad all in all.So, this series is another let down, it showed some promise at the beginning, but it was probably never the writers intention to make a masterpiece out of this, only to make some quick buck from lonely weebs who got no otber romance anime in the season. mature and realistic way of romance and relationships (loke talking about sex in a healthy, not pervert way, talking about the need to support each other and help with each others past traumas, 16 year olds having the body of adults but not mature enough so they get i to 2-3 months realtionships mostly for sex), the romance between the main couple actually feels well paced and organic for like 10% of the time.And now comes the remaining 90%.Like damn, the writers really did not k ow what to do here.

But don't set your expectations too high."", ""This romantic comedy is a refreshing standout in the anime genre, effectively challenging and overturning prevailing stereotypes about popular girls. The story centers around an unlikely romantic venture where a shy, unpopular boy courageously confesses his love to Shirakawa, a girl known for her charisma and popularity. Far from fitting the mold of the superficial 'it girl', Shirakawa emerges as a nuanced character whose depth and emotional intelligence breathe new life into the familiar narrative.One of the standout aspects of the series is how it handles the development of Shirakawa and Riuuto's relationship. Unlike typical rom-coms where characters remain static, Shirakawa displays a remarkable capacity...for emotional growth and introspection. Despite her history of romantic setbacks, she shows a consistent willingness to engage deeply and sincerely with Riuutoe, fostering a relationship built on genuine connection and mutual respect. Her character challenges the cliché of the aloof and unattainable popular girl, presenting a portrait of someone who is both approachable and complex.Riuuto's transformation throughout the series is equally compelling. Initially overshadowed by doubts and insecurities, his interactions with Shirakawa catalyze a significant personal evolution. The anime beautifully illustrates how their relationship serves as a conduit for his transition from a timid adolescent to a confident and considerate partner.

Or rather because he only tried ONCE and got shot down, he doesn\'t try again. That is until Runa, his classmate, steps up to him wanting to borrow a pencil. He completely gets lost in her beauty but realizes he shouldn\'t overthink things. Yet then he loses a competition with his friends and as punishment he is told to tell the girl he likes to date him. A cruel thing to ask, but instead of getting the expected ""no"", he\'s getting a ""yes"". Making Ryuuto...and Runa a couple.Although he doubts her motives and constantly thinks she\'s playing with him, she seems to fall more in love with him with the day. Yet then her twin sister appears on school and in the same class. The next day there are rather nasty rumors about Runa while her sister, Maria, tries to get lucky with Ryuuto. Instead of speaking up and shutting Maria down, Ryuuto is the typical ""boy without balls""  anime stereo type and doesn\'t really say firmly that he doesn\'t want her. Not that it would have worked because Maria is a typical ""I dump you first only to wanting to steal you away from your girlfriend"" type. A lot of cruel bs happens that even causes Runa to seriously doubt Ryuuto who can\'t show he\'s a man and stand his ground and make clear that he doesn\'t want Maria. Not that Runa\'s behavior is any better, she shows a very clear ""I judge and don\'t listen"" what most women seem to have even IRL.In the end Ryuuto and Runa manage to fix things and even try to get Runa\'s parents back together, but this has it\'s own plot twist that devastates Runa who in the same evening for some odd reason comes down with a fever that\'s the next day resolved and no problem is felt regarding her father\'s plot twist.So what about the feelings regarding this story?Well seeing the love between Ryuuto and Runa growing and seeing them actually making good progress would have been awesome to see. However the sister plot completely ruins the good feelings and made me several times nearly just stop watching. It\'s the typical Japanese writer bs that shouldn\'t be there, yet for some bs reason is added. I really wish the Japanese anime industry would stop this nonsense as it completely ruins the story.Now regarding the side stories for other characters, I do feel for Ijichi, he gets brutally shot down by Tanikita who thinks it\'s a joke. But he does redeem himself in the most epic way turning himself into a maga W. This makes Tanikita fall for him instantly so badly that she completely loses it.Characters:Well the cast is generally normal for a typical anime in this category. But there are clear side notes to be made.As I mentioned before, Ryuuto is a typical boy that has left his balls in a dusty corner somewhere as he shows no manliness at all. A typical flaw in this sort of anime that rather makes the story feel bad then good. It just is poor writing.Runa is a character that clearly dated way too many men, yet somehow gets Ryuuto. Only in one of the last episodes you will learn she didn\'t sleep with anyone, but just had a lot of boyfriends she dated. Still, it\'s typical proper garden tool behavior. Yet other then this she does seem to be a nice girl that truly loves Ryuuto but due to her dating past she can\'t seem to trust Ryuuto as she gets in a panic real quickly thinking he will leave her or will cheat on her (karma in work, but oh well). She also find it normal to have sex on the very first day of her getting asked it seems. Which returns at several moments as Runa is the one that keeps trying to have sex with Ryuuto while he\'s trying to avoid it. The odd thing is she keeps blaming others instead of slapping her sister Maria for once. First Maria steals her toys, now Maria tries to steal Runa\'s boyfriend. I\'d say that\'s slap worthy.Maria, the twin sister of Runa, was the first love of Ryuuto but shot him down for dumb reasons. Yet on her return she comes in the same class as Ryuuto again and her sister Runa. She manages to sit again next to Ryuuto in which she abuses the situation trying to make him fall again for her. When this fails she becomes rather vile spreading false rumors about her twin sister and trying to break Ryuuto and Runa up for her personal selfish bs reasons. Just like she did with anything Runa had and just wanted because Maria wanted for selfish reasons. Maria is there for a extremely vile and horrible person that poses as a nice girl. Even up to the last moment she tries to get lucky with Ryuuto.Graphics and sound:Surprisingly there are some background sounds that are not standard in anime, so nice to see this. However the graphics are rather regular and there is nothing special about it.Recommended?Well this really depends on what you wish to see in a anime. The main issue is that Maria keeps messing things up for Ryuuto and Runa, without that this would have been a great anime. Even with the spineless Ryuuto. Is it a carbon copy? YES. Was it worth it regardless? YES. Would I recommend to watch this anime? Well if you can deal with the mentioned main issue then it would be just fine. and Runa a couple.Although he doubts her motives and constantly thinks she\'s playing with him, she seems to fall more in love with him with the day.

Not even for a second I felt like dropping this anime. In Some scenes It manages to Create Comedy. It doesn\'t Ruin Serious Scenes with comedy and Does focus On Character development, The Gf of the Mc gets most Character growth and also provides Room for the Mc to develop as a Character.Cons of this...show :It is not a memorable show, unlike S class Romance shows, It is not a show whose characters would be remembered. It feels Cringe at  some points, especially towards the end Where The Mc\'s gf throws tantrums about Smallest of the smallest things. it\'s romance scenes aren\'t overwhelming.The Mc has more plot armour than Tanjiro, like as if  this story is written by The Mc himself. the story looses its very essence of ""Introvert  Boy dates A popular girl""The guy as shown is  an introvert but somehow is Eloquent with his gf ( I know they have shown The Mc to be Stuttering on many events but that is only for the sake of the comedy).Overall :It\'s a pretty decent anime, it\'s a wonderful Anime For One time enjoyment but nothing too memorable or overwhelming which would make you recall this show over and over in your head.

Most of the negative reviews here on MAL or any other page are from people who are angry because the girl is not virgin. So lets try to make it more serious.The anime plot is kinda cliche and also their characters.

Altough the main duo have typical cliche personalities they really do have chemistry and we really get to enjoy their interactions. And you can analize this from an emotional/psychological point...of view. Runa have some problems with relationships, she is experienced in having sex and have had a lot of couples all of them ending with the boy cheating on her having zero voice in the relationship, this alone give us some thoughts about how Runa ended up like this.

In contrast, Ryuto, despite being his first relatioship, seems to know more about how a couple works, and the title might seem is told from Runa\'s perspective and not otherwise ""You were experienced (Ryuto), I was not (Runa)"".I give it a 7.

Ryuto and Runa have one of the sweetest relationships around that also is pretty accurate to things high school couples deal with.The biggest thing Kimizero has got going for it is that it actually has somewhat realistic depictions of high school kids. In anime, high schoolers are often seen as these virtuous paradigms who wouldn’t even think of having sex or doing anything improper. People often chalk it up to “that’s not common in Japan”, as someone who has a very good understanding of Japan, let...me tell you that’s not the case. Japanese high schoolers have sex like anywhere else, and seeing an anime actually follow the consequences of that was really appealing. Runa has been mistreated and used by numerous ex boyfriends purely for sex, to the point where she thinks her entire value is based on that. Ryuuto, who honestly starts off as a generic cardboard cutout MC, confesses to her and they start a relationship that initially is fake, but slowly turns real. Now, you’ve probably heard that set up a million times,  but this one’s a little different.In particular I found Runa and Ryuuto’s interactions to be a breath of fresh air. A lot of their conversations and little idiosyncrasies feel like actual conversations I’d have at that age. For example, there’s a scene around episode 7 or 8, where Runa loses an earring that’s important to her. She initially says she’s lost it and wants everyone to wait in the room till she finds it, then after searching for a minute she realises she had it the whole time in her purse and basically says “my bad”. Now this may seem like a totally normal conversation to you, and that’s exactly why I loved it. It felt real. That’s how real people talk and act, and whenever I see that in anime, a medium that can be so detached from reality at times, I have to praise it.Further to that, Runa has some serious insecurity due to her past relationships which at times she takes out on Ryuuto. Not intentionally, but subconsciously. Again, this felt real to me and I’ve had many exes who were just like that. Over time, we see their relationship become more healthy as the two of them ultimately confront their insecurities. His over being somewhat of a loser with one of the hottest girls in school, and hers with having been with so many guys that used and abused her. That type of trauma isn’t easy to shake and understandably so.Some might argue Ryuuto and Runa are over dramatic and doing the most, and the truth is that’s .. true. Just like it was for most of us in high school. At that stage in life, your brain is not fully developed so things will seem like the end of the world to a teenager that you’d laugh at as an adult. That doesn’t make those fears and concerns any less valid. I have to give the author credit for really nailing the teenage experience in this one. Yea, it’s got some anime tropes and what not, but on the whole it’s a pretty believable story about two insecure kids from massively different backgrounds coming together and finding that they more in common that they thought.Another thing the sets this one apart is you don’t have to wait 100 episodes in the see the main couple get together, kiss, confess etc. Don’t get me wrong, I like a good build up to a confession, but it’s also nice to get that early on and follow the characters’ progression within that relationship. In fact, I’d much prefer that over waiting 3 seasons for a confession and then a show ending.Now I’ve said all that without even mentioning how absolutely gorgeous and adorable Runa is. She’s the sweetest girl ever and seeing the things she’s been through and has said about her will make your blood boil. While not a deep cast, the side characters are entertaining and actually pretty important for the story, especially Runa’s friends who try to support and look out for her. Again, the author nailed a healthy young female friendship dynamic here too.My only complaint is the production value on the show sometimes being a bit lacking. The art is largely solid, but animation is a little janky at times. There was one scene in particular in episode 11, which basically served as the emotional climax of the series that felt weaker than it should’ve purely because of the lack of expression on the character’s faces. It still was good, but could’ve been great. Other than that.. serviceable animation quality.I could really go on  and out about this show, but the short of it is that it’s a very cute, somewhat realistic depiction of two young adults learning to love not just each other, but themselves.

So the score, forums and possibly some reviews might be affected by this and should be taken into consideration.Overall would I say it is a sweet romance that shows some of the classic issues young couples run into. But as said, it has a bit more drama than most other pure romance animes."", ""Very nice modern romanceI didn't have much expectations for this anime although it did perform slightly above my expectations, especially when the studio ENGI are kind of only known for their mediocre animes besides Uzaki which is their only anime which has performed well ish.The anime highlights social issues in the dating scene where the MC Ryuuto falls in love with a gyaru Runa who sadly has had alot of previous relationships and experienced alot of things in those, including the deed only to be dumped after a month or two by them. Then she meets Ryuuto who is a sincere person who genuinely...has feelings for her, eventhough she knows nothing about him and vice versa. So in a way she gives the guy woman would normally not look at a chance, he then has to deal with her insecurities and issues along with plot issues which is her twin sister.The scene which stood out to me the most was during the festival where Ryuuto is experiencing everything with Runa for a first time and she breaks down due to not being able to experience these things with Ryuuto for a first time, and acknowledges that it doesn't feel good to her.Besides giving a normal guy a chance, this does highlight a realistic issue in the dating world in the west atleast, where women don't value experiencing their first times with their special someones as much, and then have to deal with not being able to bond as much as they could've with their partner.With that being said, it's not like I have a gripe with just Runa, as with Ryuuto we have the kind of average guy who likes to watch live stream gamers with his friend group. Yes very odd to me atleast. And overall they're people that would just not be looked twice at in a romantic way. Ryuuto is a bit too feeble in my own opinion, as for a protagonist he to me comes off as a bit too weak and not too masculine, but I guess every man can be different. Though that does leave alot of room for growth, such as being more assertive, confident and overall masculine. We may see that in a season 2 if it gets green lit, maybe not as this anime only did as well as you'd expect.One major dislike I had was a part in the anime where Ryuuto and Runa take a small break from eachother over a misunderstanding which occurred, He then gets sent a photo from social media of Runa with a guy, which ofcourse messes with the audiences feelings, as we still don't know too much about Runa and what we do know is that she's had alot of past relationships, so we immediately think she's cheating, ontop of being at the beach with this guy.Then he goes to find out the truth for himself only to find out the guy is her uncle, eventhough the guy is so much darker than her and has dyed blonde hair. The guy honestly looks too unrelated to her and looks more like an NTR protagonist.Apart from that and overall, the anime was a nice school life based anime between a gyaru who hasn't had a sincere relationship because of how gyarus are seen and an introvert who managed to build up the courage to ask that gyaru out.I'd like a season 2 just because I hate an unfinished story as much as the next guy though I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't get one.And for anyone contemplating watching it, I'd say it's good if you want a semi modern realistic romance but don't have major expectations for it. has feelings for her, eventhough she knows nothing about him and vice versa.

I don’t really understand a lot of the negative reviews (even though if you spend any time in this app you quickly learn it’s the same people over and over negatively reviewing anime as if they get paid to do so.. if you dislike EVERY anime you watch then do us all a favor and stop watching lol) as both the MC’s are likeable with Runa being about as sweet/kind as a female mc can be. My biggest grip here is that there are too many factors constantly working against them. Mainly Ryuu’s entire...friend/childhood friend base. I believe that this could have taken I slightly different turn if so. Regardless it’s fun to watch and at the end of the day that’s WHY we watch them.. 7/10 friend/childhood friend base.

Regardless it’s fun to watch and at the end of the day that’s WHY we watch them.. 7/10', ""Dare to take the story concept from a romantic anime where the heroine already has an experience with her ex. This is quite unique because there are very few romantic anime concepts like this. This is because most male viewers don't want to see that the heroine has had a relationship with a character other than the main character. This is understandable because generally men want girls who are still virgins; however, the story of this anime is quite interesting and exciting to follow considering that they have been dating since the first episode.The characters in this anime are quite well designed and beautiful to...watch, and most importantly, the facial designs between the characters look quite different, whereas in most anime, the facial designs are usually quite similar. The nature of the main character is shy, but he can be relied on in certain situations and acts quite realistically. The character of this heroine is very good and supports whatever the main character does; this cannot be separated from her past with her ex, and she quite often compares her current boyfriend with her ex, although indirectly; however, this is understandable.The things that have made me enjoy it so far are that the main character reminds me of myself when I was in middle school and high school. I used to be like him, then I had a girlfriend in the first year of high school and got a girlfriend who was more or less in the same situation as the heroine, and at that time I was her second boyfriend after she broke up with her first boyfriend. Since I broke up with her, I changed drastically and dated several girls who were still virgins, and they gave their virginity to me. The most important thing of all is that all of those girls were popular, just like the heroine.The point is that the writer wrote the heroine character deliberately so that the audience gets out of their comfort zone. The only thing that makes this anime less popular is because of the heroine's past situation. Apart from that, I recommend this anime because the plot is quite exciting to follow and not boring. watch, and most importantly, the facial designs between the characters look quite different, whereas in most anime, the facial designs are usually quite similar.

Gamers!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34280/Gamers,"[""First review, but I felt like some of this needed to be said and I felt I've seen enough.This does contain some spoilers, I suppose.Gamers has a cool premise: modern gaming, where there's a school club for it and the leader is a popular and pretty blonde girl who tries to find other gamers and recruit them - but the main lead says no to joining!The first few episodes seemed pretty decent and I was enjoying the show. After a few episodes, things got really frustrating. The show steered away from video games and gaming culture for the most part and turned into an...extremely petty and frustrating love drama between the characters. They are all suspicious of each other liking someone else and instead of, y'know, just talking to each other and actually communicating, they have obscured POVs and do petty things to find out if their hunch is right, and, without actual proof, they draw conclusions over the dumbest and simplest things. I thought it would all stick to one, maybe two episodes, but it went on longer than it should have and is still going.I tried to give it a chance after a couple of bad episodes. I was really excited to watch it and thought it was really cute and enjoyable at first, but the plot just went completely downhill the last few episodes that it became unwatchable. I am only being this hard on it since it's a 12 episode anime. That's short, and if you have several bad episodes within that.. that really takes the quality down several notches.Instead of the characters developing, it's as if it's the characters just became worse - and not in an interesting way either. They went from pretty cool, smart characters to all of them just making piss poor decisions and failing so hard at communicating that it was cringe-worthy.I understand that every plot has at least one conflict, but the kind of conflict they went with is very poor, annoying, and unfitting for what the show could/should have been about. There's so much they could have done with this show but instead of sticking to the show's actual theme, they chose to plop in a bunch of negative, unnecessary love drama.. with the odd video game reference here and there to remind you of the title, I guess.It'd be nice if the plot picked up again and became more about gaming again, but I couldn't stand to stick around. I understand one of the themes of this anime is romance as well, which is fine, but the fact that they made all the characters so painfully stupid and oblivious is extremely unrealistic - even for naive highschoolers.Other than my disappointment for the plot (so far) and character development (or lack there-of/character decline), the music is decent. The opening is adorable, and the animation itself is decent.If the show does improve, I'll be happy, but its annoying fall-off in the middle (so far, anyway) is too frustrating to endure for me and seems to steer away from the original premise of what was making the show so charming. extremely petty and frustrating love drama between the characters.

As a gamer myself, this anime really feels relatable at heart on occasions because of its concepts. However, what really follows is a rough adaptation that translated into a questionable story. It ended up being an anime that I can’t fully say it’s appreciable for what it had to offer. And that’s too bad really.Based on the light novel of the same name, Gamers stood out as an anime at first for me just by its title and it seemed like a show that I felt comfortable with. However, what...this series actually presents is far more just about gamers gathering together to play games. It became a show with romance themes, misunderstandings, and drama shenanigans that really took relationships to a strange level. On paper, the show’s premise sounds pretty simple as main male protagonist Keita Amano is invited by the prettiest girl of the school Karen, to join her video game club. What follows is a string of misunderstandings that ended up being messy.Let’s get the obvious elephant in the room out of the way. Gamers is not recommendable if you have an obvious dislike for rom-com. From the very start, it’s pretty straightforward as the anime jumps right into the main picture with the characters and their roles. Karen is a character that I found to be easy to accept as she is friendly and simple to get along with. What might rub people in the wrong way is her obsession with video games and more so, her obsession with Amano. The anime makes it clear that she likes Amano and extends beyond just the idea of video games. For Amano himself, it seems he has a mutual attraction towards Karen although has a hard time to confess the truth. Unlike Karen, he’s also more timid and unpopular at school. Drama follows the both of them as ship teases begins to develop between various characters.Beyond Amano and Karen, we also got Aguri and Tasuku, a couple with very sociable personalities. They bring in the comedic drama as misunderstandings are often created by plot circumstances and their own personal delusions. Individually, Aguri is also quite an energetic character with a friendly personality. Similarly, Tasuku finds himself easy to make friends with others and very outgoing. Both of their live are intersected with Karen and Amano as the story picks up and they get involved in drama and the misunderstandings. For me, this shows draws and sells its humor through the misunderstandings. Unfortunately, I can’t really say the anime’s plot work overall from this formula. It’s very formulaic and predictable as almost every episode feels the same. You may think there are developments between the main characters but in reality, the anime doesn’t do a clever job at progressing the plot. While I appreciate how the anime tries to sell its comedy with character pairings, it’s really no different in the end with plot resolutions. Beyond the humor, there is some actual drama if you count Chiaki’s role in the show. The character chemistry between her and Amano occasionally has more emotions although is still often downplayed quickly because of how lighthearted this anime is. Surprisingly, I found her sister to be more likable as she seems like a fun person to hang out with and talk to. The sibling relationship Hoshinomori is surprisingly realistic as the two can be easily relatable by their roles in this show.If you’re a fan of video games, you’ll notice a lot of references. These range from console games, PC gaming, dating sims, and even arcade games. Thanks to these ideas, I think some people may find this anime likable even with the lackluster plot. The idea of gaming is explored with social norms and relatable with the main characters. However, do realize that the anime is very lighthearted and doesn’t really take a serious approach at exploring the cultural ideas of gaming. It’s more of an anime that deals with comedic relationship pairings in order to draw out a casual audience. The lack of background storytelling (with exception of Tasuku and Aguri) also holds this anime back at times. To me, Gamers is an anime that’s easy to accept but hard to embrace.Adapted by Pine Jam, this anime originally had my worries due to its lack of promotions. More importantly, their previous project was pretty unnoticeable for its technical quality. However, my worries quickly died down after seeing the first few episodes. It’s not at a level that will make your jaws drop but definitely consistent for a light novel adaptation. What really draws the audience into the technical quality is perhaps the character expressions. The biggest sell of this show is the humor so it’s important to capture those expressions. Thankfully, I found myself laughing on occasions when characters react as result of misunderstandings, drama, and other shenanigans. The character designs themselves are also appealing enough to make them stand out; except with the case of Amano as he looks like a generic Average Joe. Unfortunately, this anime doesn’t escape the fan service pit so expect some episodes to have it with suggestive camera angles and swimsuits.As a lighthearted anime like Gamers, the theme songs aren’t particular noticeable until you realize their style. While it’s not truly avant-garde, it does take an approach that will make the audience talk about especially with its catchy OP song. The gaming references extends to its soundtrack elements as it sometimes uses a similar style for its OST. Still, character voice mannerism is rather moderate as none of them really stand out. Aguri’s accent also took me some time to get used to as she sounds like a kid at times.Should you watch Gamers? Honestly, it really depends but the anime felt more like a big ship tease rather than an appealing show of sharp writing. The comedy is the main selling factor so if humor is your cup of tea, then this anime will be one that you’ll remember that by. As for the storytelling? It really doesn’t do any favors when the show is like a loop that doesn’t progress the main plot altogether. The anime itself is also an incomplete adaptation as the novels are ongoing. So in essence, it’s rather open ended. For gamers and anime fans, this show is fun to watch when you’re bored and need time to pass by. But for what it really delivered, it’s an anime that I found face palming myself more than laughing. this series actually presents is far more just about gamers gathering together to play games.

If we go to our favorite culture dictionary, we will consider a gamer someone that plays video-games. Is it the main topic of this anime? Sadly, it isn\'t. The video-game idea is irrelevant here unless that we associate the game concept with a relationship. In that case, we can say that the plot of this anime is a relationship game and a ""gamer"" interprets, acts, and plays on that relationship game. The goal of the game could be ending with someone, maybe love, etc.I can give several convenient titles for this anime, ""Misunderstandings,"" ""The mess,"" ""Mistakes,"" ""Misconceptions."" All...these titles point to the same problems in a relationship and how messy a relationship can be. It would be wrong waiting to see a full-time anime about ""video-games,"" tournaments, and more video-games. If you just watch this anime for that reason, you will receive a big blow on your face, you will lose all your health points, and you will end very disappointed with a big question ¿And the games?Story: 7/10Relationships are complicated and love ones are even worse. How many times have we seen an anime about them? If you answer just this one, I will call you Pinocchio. This anime created some relationships from a simple topic the ""video-games."" The characters have something in common, video-games or persons that played them. These characters will try harder to find more about other players because they have THAT something in common (games). That\'s the main story of this anime. Keita the typical gaming freak meets another gaming freak called Karen. Call it destiny, cliché, lack of argument she felt something for Keita. For me, both them are the first gamers. The goal is that they end together. During this adventure, other ""gamers"" joined this messy match and added chaos with some alternative endings. For example, Keita should end with Chiaki, etc. All this mess is titled ""Gamers!"" an amusing comedy with funny moments and some frustrating events but enjoyable at the end.I know, Gamers\' story isn\'t that amazing. After the half of the series, we can consider it average and repetitive. Also, several persons expressed unsatisfaction of the same misunderstanding recycling and how it only gets worse. From my perspective, that is the main argument of the series if you remove this ""mess"" we will end with an empty casket that would talk about video-games, a gaming club but won\'t be an enjoyable comedy. Besides, no matter if the argument is repetitive we can associate it to the insecurity found in every relationship.  They are average students without any relationship experience, they will make several mistakes and will tend to overthink everything.Characters 7/10We have five main characters. They share the ability to mistake relationships from bad judgment. They don\'t have any love experience. They will overlook every decision for that reason all ends in chaos.Keita Amano, the conventional freak. We can see him as a zero at the left. None notice about him and he lives in a gaming world. Insecure, shy, but cares for his new friends.Tendou Karen, the freakish idol. She is a beautiful face, desired student, popular, and with a hidden gaming addiction. From a relationship perspective, she is very insecure and timid.Chiaki Hoshinomori, the last freak. We can consider her a secondary freak. She is similar to Keita, they like the same and do the same, but they have several differences when they talk about games. She also is the last acting.Tasuku Uehara, the ex-freak. A reformed ""Keita."" He was like Keita but changed and became popular. He wants to help Keita, but he overthinks everything and ends creating a bigger mess.Aguri, the insecure lover or better the ex-freak lover. She has a particular personality, but she is very uncertain of her relationship and sees a cheating ghost every time. Even if she doesn\'t like games, she enjoys being around gamers.All these characters have a twisted insecurity that keeps adding gasoline to the fire but thanks to that we can see some hilarious moments. Sometimes we want to hit the screen with our head but overall the moments are good.Art 7/10The art isn\'t that amazing, and there are some angles where we can see some ugly spots or weird faces. In general, the art is acceptable. They focus on the characters, their faces, and details to create an impact on the expressions depending on the situation. The palette is the same most of the time as the lighting model, so they used a bright light with a pastel combined palette. In general, the art is acceptable for a comedy.Sound 8/10The sound mix helps on the situations and adds tension when needed but also focus on the awkward moments, so it helps with the plot and levels the climax. The OP and ED are good, I loved more the ED, but both are very catchy.Enjoyment 8/10No matter if the problems are repetitive the show offers several hilarious scenes. The insecurity of this group is presented to the audience with a combination between mess and comedy. This concept works well with the storytelling, a good pacing, and produces a twisted love comedy that we will enjoy.Overall 8/10Finally, I want to apologize. I overused the word ""GAME"" maybe you are exhausted from it, but I am sure this simple messy story will bring a smile on your face. It isn\'t the best comedy out there, but it is acceptable. The characters have their moments, and their insecurity is used to create some epic events. I am sure that you will enjoy some of them. Give it a try. these titles point to the same problems in a relationship and how messy a relationship can be. It would be wrong waiting to see a full-time anime about ""video-games,"" tournaments, and more video-games. If you just watch this anime for that reason, you will receive a big blow on your face, you will lose all your health points, and you will end very disappointed with a big question ¿And the games?Story: 7/10Relationships are complicated and love ones are even worse.

They will overlook every decision for that reason all ends in chaos.Keita Amano, the conventional freak. We can see him as a zero at the left. None notice about him and he lives in a gaming world. Insecure, shy, but cares for his new friends.Tendou Karen, the freakish idol. She is a beautiful face, desired student, popular, and with a hidden gaming addiction. From a relationship perspective, she is very insecure and timid.Chiaki Hoshinomori, the last freak. We can consider her a secondary freak. She is similar to Keita, they like the same and do the same, but they have several differences when they talk about games. She also is the last acting.Tasuku Uehara, the ex-freak. A reformed ""Keita."" He was like Keita but changed and became popular. He wants to help Keita, but he overthinks everything and ends creating a bigger mess.Aguri, the insecure lover or better the ex-freak lover. She has a particular personality, but she is very uncertain of her relationship and sees a cheating ghost every time. Even if she doesn\'t like games, she enjoys being around gamers.All these characters have a twisted insecurity that keeps adding gasoline to the fire but thanks to that we can see some hilarious moments. Sometimes we want to hit the screen with our head but overall the moments are good.Art 7/10The art isn\'t that amazing, and there are some angles where we can see some ugly spots or weird faces. In general, the art is acceptable. They focus on the characters, their faces, and details to create an impact on the expressions depending on the situation. The palette is the same most of the time as the lighting model, so they used a bright light with a pastel combined palette. In general, the art is acceptable for a comedy.Sound 8/10The sound mix helps on the situations and adds tension when needed but also focus on the awkward moments, so it helps with the plot and levels the climax. The OP and ED are good, I loved more the ED, but both are very catchy.Enjoyment 8/10No matter if the problems are repetitive the show offers several hilarious scenes. The insecurity of this group is presented to the audience with a combination between mess and comedy. This concept works well with the storytelling, a good pacing, and produces a twisted love comedy that we will enjoy.Overall 8/10Finally, I want to apologize. I overused the word ""GAME"" maybe you are exhausted from it, but I am sure this simple messy story will bring a smile on your face. It isn\'t the best comedy out there, but it is acceptable. The characters have their moments, and their insecurity is used to create some epic events. I am sure that you will enjoy some of them. Give it a try.', 'Typically I can\'t even decide if I\'ll like an anime after just 4 episodes but this time I NEED to write this review in order to persuade people into watching this.So, first time I saw this I was convinced it\'s some kind of copy of ""Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?"". They\'re both basically about the same thing (slice of life in a video game club) but their execution is way different.This anime basically completes netoge in some areas and it seems to explore the social aspect of video game geeks. At the same time, it seems to be a manifesto for...playing games the fun way. Nowadays, with the popularization of eSports a lot of people have started to play games in a competitive manner that, in my and apparently this anime\'s opinion, spoils the fun.I\'m a sucker for good romcoms that don\'t have a linear, boring  boy-meets-girl-they-fall-in-love-funny-stuff-happens, and this seems to hit the right spot. It\'s kinda underrated in my opinion, but it can be argued that this anime formula is already overused. Still, I believe it\'s worth your time.DEFINITELY give this a try. playing games the fun way.

If you answered yes, then there is no need for you to watch this show. It's your generic story of a loser, socially awkward MC that gets attention from the hottest girls in his school for no apparent reason. The relationship webs between characters are poorly done and only arise because the characters are too stupid to make logical decisions when it comes to their relationships. Ultimately, it fails...in making the connection between these realistic, therefore defeating one of the main purposes of a rom-com.... the romance.Oh and about the comedy, it's awful. The only time I laughed while watching this show was at myself after a joke I made about one of the characters playing a what was essentially CS:GO. The comedic timing is way off and characters have no gimmicks to play off of one another.Art: 3Think anime. Think anime protagonist. Now you know what our main character looks like. Character designs are bland, boring and just plain bad. However the animation itself is good and the intro has great animation featuring the main characters as if they were inside various types of games.Sound: 5Nothing special, background music fits the tone of situations well and the intro and ending are decent. Nothing much more to say.Characters: 1This is where the show is most insulting. Not only are the characters generic, underdeveloped, having no rhyme or reason as to why they like the other characters, but the misrepresentation of gamers is what really ruins the charters. You will not find a single gamer in this world that is anything like most of the main cast. They are gamers for the sake of the plot and are given no reason as to why they started playing video games in the first place, which could have given a nice conflict in ideologies which the show tried to do... yet failed.Enjoyment: 2There's not much to like at all about this show, if you have seen one rom-com anime, you've seen Gamers!.

The show is more a Slice of life Romcom about teenagers where the story just focuses on their lives at High school and their interactions with one other which may disappoint some viewers due to its Soap Opera-ish vibe. (If you are looking for something similar but with more gaming involved, check out ‘Netoge No Yome Wa Onnanoko Ja Nai To Omotta?’) I too was upset upon learning this, but the anime brilliantly defends itself by delivering spontaneously strong, albeit...sometimes cliched Comedy! By not resorting to a Harem anime like everybody else, it’s a breath of fresh air to have 2 main guys rather than 1 and all girls. The 1st episode itself foreshadows uniqueness as the show deliberately sets up a Generic Romcom setting where the MC is invited to a Gaming club by a beautiful girl and the other characters presented clearly looked like the shows main cast. Only to swerve all of us towards the end by having the MC be like ‘Nah, this isn’t for me’! Realizing the show had the balls to create a ‘fake cast’ of characters just for 1 Joke meant I was in store for something Awesome! And I wasn’t disappointed! Another thing I liked was the shows effort of making fun of the Harem genre itself. We actually have a character who calls upon this in one episode! The same character even plots to force a Harem on one of the MC’s which ended up rebounding horribly! ‘Gamers’ uses an old exaggeration of an over the top love triangles which gets everyone confused and misinformed, thus resulting into utter chaos! (The show bravely points it out to us from time to time) You have things like characters hearing only the worst parts of a conversations to someone suppressing important info just to protect another character’s public image which may look frustrating, but it was fantastically executed!All the characters are genuinely interesting by managing to stand out via their personalities. We have our simple looking Amano, who’s very bad when it comes to judgements due to his uncertainties. Nevertheless, he’s a good MC since he’s peculiarly zealous about certain type of games and will fight ‘’verbally’’ tooth and nails to defend his point despite sucking at playing games! He manages to come across very kind to others and it’s his infectious passion for games that resulted into Tendou falling head over heels for him! Tendou herself is a big gaming fan (in secret) so others simply can’t understand her infatuation for Amano which results into Tendou losing her ‘Highschool Dream Girl’ image. (Being REJECTED by a Nobody really hurt her image at school!) Even though she doesn’t do much later, her depiction of a major crush was humourlessly presented to us which never got tiring. After all this is how a person with a real crush acts! The person goes through unstable amount of emotions without ever expressing it out loud. Uehara is another character who comes off looking cool but isn’t as smart as he thinks! Often a prey to his own schemes due to bad decisions, results in being the root for the whole group problems! Aguri bonds nicely with Amano and she’s all cute and innocent while Chiaki turns out to be even a bigger Gaming nerd than the MC himself! I liked how her story went along with the main arc and whenever she said ‘Desu Desu’. These 5 characters provide us with the bulk of relatable Comedy in a hilarious and ridiculous manner that will have you LOLing pretty hard!Animation is pretty basic, though colourful and the character designs are by the numbers. Both the OP and ED were a stand out with very catchy music and bright visuals which is appreciated with great Voice Acting from the cast for both Subs and Dubs. The opening video boasts wonderful ingenuity by showcasing countless parodies of video games like Mario and Street Fighter and the work done on facial expressions were superb!Despite its flaws, I found the anime funny and entertaining. Episode 5, now remembered as ‘The Mother of All Misunderstandings!’ was hands down the best episode the anime has to offer as it managed to deliver a perfect storm of emotions ranging from Jealousy, Love, Envy, Confusion, Shock, etc in a Comedic fashion! (I loved how the MC was totally oblivious to all it!) This reminds me of a movie called ‘Crazy, Stupid, Love’ which pulled of a similar scene of misinterpretations by Comedic means. But exactly like the movie, this brilliant plot unravelled too quickly as the anime failed to entertain us on this level again! The anime tries to repeat itself with the follow up of a Board game, but it just didn’t have the same kick to it! And add in the pretty Meh ending, hurts your final thoughts about the show. Still the characters had their own side plots which were nicely demonstrated though the interactions between them remained the highlight of this anime. Certainly, recommend it to everyone as it’s one of the good anime of this year! sometimes cliched Comedy!

Certainly, recommend it to everyone as it’s one of the good anime of this year!', '""Missunderstandings"" everywhere. You could basically sum up the whole show with these two words. To cut to the chase, the characters are really bad and 1-dimensional. This was one of many griping issues that was bugging me while watching this show; the characters are all dumb/intentionally idiotic (and I don’t mean this lightly), and the cast consists of your run-of-the-mill cliche character tropes you’ll find in any romcom anime. You’ll have your ""wimpy loser MC” who is voiced by your average female shounen VA, the ""prettiest girl in class that has a crush on the wimpy MC” cause for SOME REASON wimps are chick magnets,...the ""annoying girl with the annoying voice"" (you’ll know which one), the ""dude that is really popular but likes to hangout with loser MC"", and the list goes on.To add on top of the lame cast, the show never seems to go anywhere. The only thing that seems to be driving the plot forward would be the “misunderstandings” that would occur between two of the characters. This misunderstand could be anything: Character A was caught being close to Character B, Character B shares a drink with Character C and Character A sees this and is surprised that B and C are close (even though in reality it was mutual and not in a way of showing lovely emotions towards each other), Character C thinks Character A hate them thus undergoes depression, THE LOST GOES ON AND IT’S ANNOYING! The whole foundation of the plot in Gamers are the misunderstandings that happen in the show, it’s the only thing moving the plot. Forget good writing, forget good drama, forget good comedy, they were basically grabbing shit outta there asses and hoping anything could help move the plot forward. What a joke.Rant out of the way, I\'d like to say a few things: I don\'t have a clue as to why I stuck with this show for 5 tremendously bad episodes and I guess I was really hoping I\'d actually get something good outta this show. Instead of romance and comedy, I got stale jokes and bad writing. Basically unoriginal cliche romcom horse arse. To be honest, the thing that drove me to stop watching this show the most was the characters. The characters were so bad it got unbearable; I was at a point in the show that I didn’t care about the plot anymore and was just focusing on how utterly terrible the characters were. It was just so...BAD! Words can’t describe how miserable each episode was, watching as the characters go on their daily lives of looping through the same problems over and over again and never learning. The characters have peas for brains! As for the art, it was mediocre AT BEST but wasn\'t too bad. I’d expect better quality though, the colors and designs of the setting and characters were bland and boring to look at. The Sound wasn\'t too bad either but not noticably great, though I did kinda enjoy the OP. The OP was catchy and I enjoyed the references to other games (such as PUBG, Super Smash Bros, and Undertale). Besides all of that though, this show could be summed up as a terrible mess or the crap I take after eating the local Chipotle burrito. I don\'t recommend this show to anyone who wants REAL romance with an ACTUAL plot, but if you like romcom cliches then go ahead and watch. the ""annoying girl with the annoying voice"" (you’ll know which one), the ""dude that is really popular but likes to hangout with loser MC"", and the list goes on.To add on top of the lame cast, the show never seems to go anywhere.

It\'s impossible. The amount of trivial misunderstandings in this anime is criminal. Every single conflict could easily be solved with a normal civilized conversation, with questions being asked between two people for clarification of what they meant.I understand the whole ""highschooler logic"" thing where everyone gets confused and they don\'t understand emotions and whatever. But come on. This is going way too far.Other than the inept communication ability of all the main characters, the anime is alright. Art is good, music is fine, the plot is...fine too.

He has the chuuni habit of talking to himself in a superior sense as if all of them would be lost without him.

Until they discovered they have different opinions about certain games then the bickering began. Since then Chiaki and Amano act like a bickering married couple which made Uehara wonder why dont they just hook up.

Which makes the beauty of the series.', 'The center of videogame stories are almost often gaming prowess of some schmuck who can go hayaku. But there is another important aspect that is not usually touched on: how videogames affects our day to day interactions and how it opens up a whole new way of forming bonds. There\'s a reason why MMO players say ""Came for the game, stayed for the community."" It\'s a beautiful sentiment that captures the often unheralded but nonetheless important aspect of gaming in today\'s society.I\'m happy to say that Gamers understands that aspect and struggles to make it the core of the series. While the characters right now...may feel like it\'ll just fill the check-boxes of typical high school stock models, this series can get by with simplistic characterizations because its potential lies in the character interactions more than anything. This is a celebration of gaming as a community after all.So far, however, Gamers is an anime you wouldn\'t feel bad missing out on. It has shown lopsided execution with a penchant for slapstick humor that can grow old easily, especially if its not your type of humor. The artstyle is less-detailed which enables more fluid animation but it\'s largely centered around the aforementioned slapstick comedy and the OST is nothing standout.But the anime is not without potential, despite its abysmal first episode which I feel I must warn you about. How it goes about fulfilling that makes or breaks the series.Happy TI7 everyone.TNC!

NO IT IS NOT!! From ep3 till the end gaming made barely an appearance, It was just a pentagon of love and misunderstanding about who loves/cheat on each other..

the show has almost nothing to do with games at this point, and as...a """"""""gamer"""""""", i can\'t say that any of the characters are particularly relatable. probably because they all have a deadly combination of fetal alcohol syndrome + terminal aspergers and i don\'t. that and i also didn\'t have 3 obvious girlfriend candidates and a wide social circle in high school. i also actually played videogames, rather than spending every day poorly handling relationship issues, huffing paint, and making unfunny, forced game references. wow, a character got upset and randomly blurted out the konami code! hilarious! this is the pinnacle of comedy! what\'s next, a character becoming so happy that they can\'t help but shout ""THE CAKE IS A LIE!""?any time they do actually talk about games, it makes me cringe so hard i feel like i\'m going to implode. they\'re playing the mario kart arcade game and MC gets an item that apparently has a 50% chance of blowing up everyone around him and a 50% chance of blowing himself up. after this is explained to him, the blonde girl says ""it\'s really hard to use on this map!"" .....what? why would the map have even the tiniest bearing on how difficult it is to use? ?????????????????? nice show. totally wasn\'t written by a 40 year old that only plays a mobage once a week.i feel like people get so caught up in praising this show for the MC not immediately accepting the club invite (so unique!!!!) that they\'re able pretend like the show didn\'t immediately turn into a cliche factory afterward. i turned my brain off as soon as i saw bridge scene in episode 2 or 3 where MC is vehemently defending a girl he has talked to for all of 5 minutes with a ""YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT DON\'T TALK BAD ABOUT HER!"" and nearly kills the guy with his retard strength. of course, the girl is secretly watching this exchange and falls madly in love with MC as a result. really breaking new ground here.in conclusion, this show is basically just Netoge no Yome season 2 but with less games and more glue consumption. only watch it if you love misunderstandings and hate anything resembling actual human interaction. a """"""""gamer"""""""", i can\'t say that any of the characters are particularly relatable. probably because they all have a deadly combination of fetal alcohol syndrome + terminal aspergers and i don\'t. that and i also didn\'t have 3 obvious girlfriend candidates and a wide social circle in high school. i also actually played videogames, rather than spending every day poorly handling relationship issues, huffing paint, and making unfunny, forced game references. wow, a character got upset and randomly blurted out the konami code! hilarious! this is the pinnacle of comedy! what\'s next, a character becoming so happy that they can\'t help but shout ""THE CAKE IS A LIE!""?any time they do actually talk about games, it makes me cringe so hard i feel like i\'m going to implode. they\'re playing the mario kart arcade game and MC gets an item that apparently has a 50% chance of blowing up everyone around him and a 50% chance of blowing himself up. after this is explained to him, the blonde girl says ""it\'s really hard to use on this map!"" .....what?

But it all fell apart midway.I went into the show completely blind not knowing what to expect, and the first episode was great. It had very nice gaming culture references from CSGO and even Guilty Gear! It made the MC, Keita, a very relatable character that just wants to plays game for fun instead of playing it competitively like the gaming club does.The second episode was wonderful as well, especially with its wonderfully animated introduction...sequence and the nest full of gaming culture references in it. This episode focused more on Uehara's character and his transition from being a loner gamer nerd to a typical cool and handsome stud. There is one part where Uehara and Keita are in the arcade and playing Persona 4 Arena, a fighting game, where Uehara basically is able to read Keita's movements and basically body him due to his 'noob' tells/tendencies in the game. That part was the hook, line and sinker for me in this anime and I was even more excited in watching the third episode for the series.At this point I had thought that the plot would be focusing on Uehara and Keita's journey in the gaming club, but this was not the case.Episodes 3 and 4 rolled along, and now I had this bad premonition that this anime was actually not what I thought it was.Episodes 5 and 6 came out and I just felt crushed. It was at this point where I realised that they would be focusing on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters and that just completely turned off this anime for me. The selling point of the anime for me, about how it was gaming, was now almost completely gone and I had just lost interest in continuing to watch the series.It could have been such an interesting concept for an anime, focusing on the inner workings of competitive gaming and gamers. It had untapped potential and they just threw it all away in favour of an overly clichéd misunderstanding-riddled romcom.And god, the characters. The character development between the main characters was just completely thrown into the garbage, it felt like the characters' personalities from the first few episode had completely flipped and they were now all completely naive and oblivious.Don't get me wrong, there are people who would like this type of anime, but this just isn't my cup of tea, I just didn't like how they just suddenly steered away from gaming almost completely and instead focused solely on the misunderstandings of the relationships between the characters.At least, the artstyle of the anime is decent, nothing flashy but still okay, and I do love the music as well as the wonderful opening of the series.It's very disappointing to see how this anime turned out, it could have been one of my favourite animes of this year. It feels that the title of the series 'Gamers!' was just stuck there just to draw in gamers into watching this anime, and it definitely did, I just wished they at least would have tried to made the focal point of the series to be gaming instead. sequence and the nest full of gaming culture references in it.

Note to self: Never read mal reviews before judging a show by myself ever again.Just know that clichés do not automatically make a show bad. A very great example of a clichés done right is Konosuba, which utilises the isekai trope to create a wonderful and humorous parody of the actual genre, and in my opinion, another great example is Gamers!. This turned out to be one of the most impressionable romcoms for me.The reason I almost dropped this show was because I was overly judgemental...on its first episode. Admittedly, the following  clichés were a bit of a turn off at the beginning: ""high school game club"" and  ""otaku-pandering main protaganist"". Basically the premise of episode 1 at first felt kind of uninteresting and even unrealistic.I decided to give this anime another chance after months because I saw that it had potential. After re-evaluating the character motives and  making the effort to actually think deeper into the actions of the characters, it made so much more sense. It\'s evident from episode 1 that the character motives in the entirety of the show can be sometimes hard to grasp and character\'s actions can often feel unreasonable or confusing (as expected of every drama show tho).  However they really are quite meaningful when given a second thought. The premise starts getting way more entertaining after episode 2 with the slight twist. What’s hilarious is that the much hated ‘game club’ cliché was actually almost never mentioned again in the show, despite spending 1 episode introducing it. It just shows how self-aware the humour is, by first baiting the audience into thinking “It’s another one of those shows… .-.” then surprising them and making fun of it. (tl;dr: so if you\'re planning to get into this show, be prepared for a little bit of confusion. if u want to understand every character fully, give everything some thought and it\'s actually quite meaningful)The main appeal of this show is that it handles the relationship drama part of it really well. Its humour stems from how self-aware the show is to the many supposed clichés, making fun of it and deriving humour from that. (I kind of see elements of Konosuba’s humour in this show.) It also does the whole ‘misunderstandings’ thing better than most other shows by making light-hearted fun of it. I find it so funny because it makes fun of exactly what I LOATHE about many drama shows and actually making it work well.See, misunderstandings in anime, especially in romance dramas, were something that I always hated to the core. It always annoyed me to no end when shows used \'misunderstandings\' as a main driving point of its plot as an excuses to either lengthen itself or to drive its melodrama. Shows like the second season of Kimi ni Todoke has fueled my hate for this because it JUST isn\'t realistic, the character\'s constant beating around the bush and not noticing the most obvious things just annoys me at how un-humanlike the characters become because of it. The problem is that most of the time, their misunderstandings can all be fixed if the characters just calm the fuck down, sit down and talk it out... Shows like that just feel very unnecessarily dragged out, insincere and boring. Drilling the frankly petty misunderstandings into our heads and making it the main point of the show be the drama that comes from them honestly makes it emotionally exhausting to watch.Of course, I have seen a small few anime that actually effectively used misunderstandings, but that’s hard to pull off, because you have to make the effort to make the misunderstandings feel genuinely realistic or relatable for the show to be actually be likable. (One example is Tsuki ga Kirei, I could get into why in another review)However, when misunderstandings are used as a meta plot device to not only get great humour out of it, but also as a way to bond and develop characters, that’s good shit. Gamers! does it so well. Notice how really it doesn’t get sad and edgy all because of some stupid misunderstanding but it not only gets funnier, characters also know each other better and develop through those experiences.Here are some other small examples of self-aware humour that I laughed way too hard at, which made fun of things other anime did badly:1. Having Uehara as the intelligent, NOT dense character that actually knows what’s going on. The fact that he judges situations and can read people’s expressions (like a normal person would) is just hilarious. Viewers can really relate to him as he actually reads into things instead of being any other dense character that does not give anything a second thought.2. The fact that Uehara and Keita consciously calls everyone into meetups to clear misunderstandings LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN WOULD DO. It’s so rewarding to see anime characters use common sense instead of beating around the bush.3. Small things like the cliché-looking student council members of the other school or other blatant references to different clichés like Misumi Eiichi\'s little section on the last episode. XD4.  How the game club which was \'supposed\' to be the main focus of the show completely became irrelevant later in the show.5. The extremely amusing and exaggerated misunderstandings that thankfully were not unnecessarily over-complicated and edgy.I\'d give this show a strong 8.5/10This show is great and it has some silly and lovable characters that unexpectedly develops through light-hearted drama and misunderstandings. The ending was an emotional pay-off and was greatly satisfying. Instead of being sad and edgy and unrealistic, it resolves all the romance and drama like a man, and in heartwarming and gratifying ways! You know a show is great when you actually like and care about every one of its characters. I have not even mentioned the ""Gamer"" part of this show, which I absolutely loved and related to. References everywhere, and it even teaches some really meaningful values for gamers at episode 4. Gaming is a huge theme (no shit) in Gamers! and fits into the contexts of the plot and characters so well: characters are bonded by and understands each other through the common interest of games. Maaaybe a little otaku-pandering but still relatable to most people. Yes there are some flaws that I won\'t mention here, but overall it\'s an extremely sweet and enjoyable show that can NEVER DESERVE THE “4” RATING. HMPH >.<I’ll edit in more to this review when I can remember more necessary things to add. Right now I’m too tired to remember everything I wanted to say. This was basically a drunken rant at 3 am after getting slightly triggered by the bad ratings in mal and wanting to do this anime some good. Knowing the fact that I almost dropped this show and that more people like me will because of mal reviews, I wanted to do this anime some justice. This definitely deserves more praise imo! on its first episode.

Knowing the fact that I almost dropped this show and that more people like me will because of mal reviews, I wanted to do this anime some justice. This definitely deserves more praise imo!', 'I don\'t quite understand the people reviewing this. Are you seriously telling me this is relatable to how ""gamers"" behave?That must be a joke, because in the first place, The ""Gamers!"" in the title is only to lure for viewers, nothing more. The plot itself has nothing relatable to video games, this series is all about misunderstandings and a boring/generic romcom plot.Let\'s start with the basics, the story is pretty bland, first 3 episodes do have a bit of game references and how the protagonists game and stuff. That\'s about it, after episode 4 the misunderstandings and the romcom start, but horribly. I understand the...misunderstandings are the plot itself, but they are making it so they are slow paced and rather boring, at times it feels like filler when it obviously shouldn\'t be. It just feels like they are dragging it to at least make it up to 12 episodes because we haven\'t gotten any progress in the story so far, always at the same point, but it is a ""slice of life"". Althought, i wouldn\'t consider a slice of life.My general problem with these misunderstandings is that they are all the same, i expected them to improvise a bit and make them different than each other, but they only spoil on how a one cheats on another when it doesn\'t really happen, blah, blah... Tell me, where\'s the creativity in that? In the end, the plot doesn\'t move on because of this.Artwise, the animation is nothing special, but i don\'t really mind it. The designs are really good for the most part. Environments are quite good looking and scenarios are fitting. The colour palette is quite nice and vibrant too.Sound/Music is top notch if you ask me, but i feel like the BGM does not fit with the scenes at times. VA are quite enjoyable, and really nice choice. The Op might be the only thing from this anime that includes Game references, the ED is enjoyable as well.This is the other problem i have with most reviews and the series itself. There\'s nothing from the character development and behaviour that make me think ""oh i act like that"" ""that has happened to me"" ""oh i hate that feeling"", literally nothing. Well, i didn\'t think anything of that because, the character development is horse poop, like the only character we know a bit is Tendou, no one else had a ""let me get to know thing"" thingy were we see their daily lives and stuff. We are already at episode 10, and i would\'ve loved to see a bit of storyline for the game club Tendou has, i would\'ve loved to see more from the protagonists as child\' and how they got into games (But, obviously that won\'t be possible, this isn\'t a series about gamers)The whole premise was good, but not with an almost clickbait title ""Gamers!"", the series is just a generic romcom we see all seasons. Nothing new, nothing creative and nothing funny about it. I did wait quite some time to see if things would\'ve gotten to the start point again, but nope, it\'s just the same over and over again.

Are you a gamer? Are you alone? Are you an awkward individual? Are you also an otaku? If you checked off more than one of the options I listed, I got the show just for you! It\'s ""Gamers!"" The show where all of your characters are nothing more than a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to connect with each other.You can\'t help but cover your eyes hoping it doesn\'t get any cringier. Seeing this makes me want to bawl my eyes out as the characters fail to interact with each other like regular human beings. It\'s a mixture...of cringe, frustration, and stupid fun rolled into one. First and foremost, I\'d like to say, the show is a comedy. Personally, if a show has made me laugh countless times, I\'d say it did its job correctly. I\'m sure it is also safe to say that the show is one giant ball of confusion. At a certain point, you would hope that the confusions would be solved A.S.A.P. right and everything would be fine and dandy? WRONG! The confusion just keeps going on and on and quite frankly, it feels mundane.I would also like to mention the casual and competitive gaming portion of the anime. Personally, I was hoping there would be more emphasis on the difference between those two as the anime is titled ""Gamers!"" but it seems to be more focused on the relationships between the confusion of the character\'s romances.The anime opening and ending theme songs aren\'t special in any type of way either except that it sounds video game-y and the art is art.To sum this whole show up, there\'s a love/hate feeling with this anime. I had a good time laughing but also a good considerable amount of time cringing at everything that happened out of pure stupidity from the characters. To a certain extent, what they do is reasonable like being jealous and worrying about their partner cheating but the misunderstandings are just irritating. I had expectations that it was going to be a typical, otaku, video game club anime where the main character is a wuss which is kind of true but there were times when the characters stood up for themselves and I, personally, found that admirable in its own way. There could\'ve been multiple ways where ""Gamers!"" could\'ve been better but what I got were headaches and laughable cringe. Keep your dreams to yourself. The show is a slap to your face for having expectations. of cringe, frustration, and stupid fun rolled into one. First and foremost, I\'d like to say, the show is a comedy. Personally, if a show has made me laugh countless times, I\'d say it did its job correctly. I\'m sure it is also safe to say that the show is one giant ball of confusion.

The show is a slap to your face for having expectations.', '""Extreme Misunderstandings – the animation"", for better or worse.Gamers is a bit of a misleading anime. The synopsis primarily gives off the vibe of being a slice of life club anime where the club in question would be focused on gaming. But that is not really what Gamers is about. Yes, there technically is such a club in this anime but it\'s a very minor part of it, and in reality Gamers is more of a stereotypical love polygon romcom. However, although it is certainly somewhat generic, the show has some decent merit to it all things considered, but ultimately ends up biting off more...than it could chew.Above all, Gamers is an anime about romance-related misunderstandings. Multi-layered misunderstandings. You may think that this does not sound like anything out of the ordinary for a romcom at all, and for first couple episodes of the anime you\'d be right, and they are quite average at best. However, past a certain point the anime starts going to such an extreme extent in order to complicate matters as much as possible that it starts bordering on sheer absurdity. It makes the types of misunderstandings you\'d normally see in romcoms looks like peanuts in comparison, and it almost starts to feel more like a parody of the genre. Once this happens (around episode 6), the enjoyment value of the show suddenly climbs rapidly. Every character is quite clearly described and their somewhat naïve personalities are easy to understand, so their respective misconceptions are quite logical from their own perspectives. Truthfully they are all pretty stupid in their own way, but as a whole it all makes sense and it is quite funny to watch. It becomes a sort of Fawlty Towers plot, where an initial misunderstanding is first conceived and then additional misunderstandings are added on top in order to sustain the logic of the previous one, setting off a chain reaction of exponentially increasing levels of ridiculousness until eventually everything comes crashing down in the most spectacular and hilarious way possible.The problem with Gamers though is that ultimately it turns out to be somewhat of a one-trick pony. The peak which the show reaches around the halfway mark is quite good, but after that it starts to deteriorate again. Because once pretty much all the misunderstandings have finally been resolved and the plot looks like it\'s about to take a new, quite interesting direction... it\'s like the story suddenly has a relapse where it decides that instead of trying something new, let\'s just bring all the misunderstandings back and do the whole thing all over again. The difference is that the second time around it\'s just not as funny anymore. The joke has already been demonstrated; you don\'t need to do the exact same thing again. Not only that, but I also felt that some of the plot developments which led to this relapse were rather unnatural to say the least; Chiaki in particular suddenly started doing some inexplicably stupid things that barely even made sense from her own perspective. It started giving me the feeling that the author was running out of ideas, but unfortunately this kind of plot doesn\'t have the sustainability to warrant going in circles like this.Gamers does have some pretty amusing characters (albeit pretty dumb ones) and momentarily has some moments of brilliance. However, despite only being 12 episodes, this anime is honestly still too long. If Gamers had ended after episode 6 or 7 it would actually have been a lot better, because everything beyond that just feels like padding. It\'s an inconsistent show, but on average still a decent one I think.

Is it excitement? thrilled? seducing?.. I think it is.. Just like anime itself.. But what if.. There is an anime about 'Gamers'.. You know.. Typical teenagers that goes to high-school then they go home to not study, but game all day. Gamers on real life are like sand grains on the beach. They are too many. We cannot count how many sand grains out there am i right? Thus, games ARE really popular throughout our generation. From toddlers who play 'ABC' games, to adults who play 18+ games out there. Almost all of us are gamers....This season we are presented by an anime that you can summarize on 1 word only because of its title.. Yes.. I am talking about ''Gamers!''. The most cliched, cringy (I guess?) and misunderstanding anime out there on this season. While there are some poor stuffs about this anime like showing-off so much rip-off versions of games like in CSGO, Candy Crush and any other RPG smartphone games out there, there are some hidden good sides about this anime. With its very unique opening, to its unique romance style of an anime, I will discuss it if this anime is totally worth it to watch.Story: 6/10We are presented by a simple story with a simple set of characters on this anime 'Gamers!'. No, really. Gamers forming a game club and a gamer inviting another gamer that plays smartphone RPG games and arcade games but ended up getting rejected because of the gamer boy's pride then after some episodes they formed like a gamers council all four of them. Simple. But as the story goes on and on. We are like forgetting the title of this series. Instead of 'Gamers!', we are getting introduced by a new title called 'Playing With My Heart'. 'Gamers!' focuses on the characters named Tendou Karen, Amano Keita, Aguri, Uehara Tasuku and Hoshinomori Chiaki, where all of them game AND have a roullette of misunderstandings of love and affections for countless of episodes. Though, the comedic factor is great on this anime because of the misconceptions of the main characters themselves, but the fact still remains that most people thought that this will be an anime that focuses on games itself. From the opening where they showcase so many parody of games, from the actual scenes where the other characters play it, we thought we will have a decent ''gamers'' anime. But instead, we were introduced by an anime about a sole rom-com. Not duo, or even trio, but a Romantic-Comedy Quadro. Though the story itself is interesting (dicarding the game itself but only focusing the romcom stuffs) but for some reasons, each episode of it focuses on characters asking question like ''Is Keita the boyfriend of Aguri?'' Or ''Is Tasuka the boyfriend of Tendou?''. The story was messy but funny at the same time..Art: 9/10Art style of the anime is vivid. It seems that its a bit more colorful than an usual one if you think but it adds up the emotions of each characters as well. The art is great on this anime, not only the character sketches and effects but also how the artist represent parodies of games itself.Sound: 8/10An anime is nothing without sound. Though some can watch anime without sound by reading the subtitles, but on this anime, i dont know if you can enjoy this one without sound. The opening and ending songs were quite fine for the ears to listen but how the background music tells the scenery change and all. Yeah sure this turned into a Romcom from being a gaming one but still. The sound here is splendid.Characters: 6/10Cringe. When the romcom started, thats the first word I come up to summarize it (especially the main character Keita). I mean cringe is a normal thing to everyone but as it goes on, it is sometimes painful to watch the other characters having cringy moments. It just hurts. Though they all suit with their roles and that was good and all, this feeling is hard to forget. The characters are very less on this anime compared to other Summer 2017 animes out there and this makes the anime a little bit not confusing to watch. So.. Less characters = fine story line (for this anime)Enjoyment: 7/10We are all watching anime for entertainment. Though not all the time. Some watch it for studies as well to get ideas for story writing and all. But please.. Don't pick ''Gamers!'' for a story to tell. Though, it has  a lot of good sides, but cringe is common on this anime. Comedy is fine and all. Romance is good but the characters' misunderstanding is quite cringy enough.Overall... 7/10 is i can give to 'Gamers!'. With its cringy characters puffing so many blushes on their faces, romantic-comedy at its finest and a story that can either make you laugh or punch the wall, a score of 7/10 is fine.. unless you hate the anime itself.

The first 3 to 4 episodes are honestly pretty good, with surprises in how the main character acts, and how all the other characters react to him.But then, from then on, it turns into a cluster of high school emotions....So much random drama, so many random ""He\'s cheating!!"" So much angst and randomness. And it loses any surprise, so that by the time the two you want to date (Presumably Tendou and Keita) start dating there\'s no more hype, and that leads to the next issue: The joke has already worn itself down. The joke being that Keita is socially awkward, probably moreso then anyone other then Hoshinomori (Who, for whatever reason, on episode 9, they start pushing for relationship between Keita and her??)Wouldn\'t recommend this.

The production quality of Gamers was better than I expected. That opening, the references, the music, the voice acting, the art style—it\'s fantastic! Though Gamers started off a little bit cliched, it still piqued my interest. I thought the pilot was just a basic starting point and the second episode introduced more characters that could get fleshed out later. That was my initial thought until the anime suddenly dropped the ball after the second...episode to opt for an endless barrage of misunderstandings. Gamers is the kind of anime where people squirm, shake their head side to side a bit, and go ""it has its moments but it\'s not worth your time.""I appreciate how passionate about games they made each character but every time they interacted with one another, it seemed like the writers forgot the nuance previously given to them. They built and nurtured these great relationships in the second episode with tender moments only to make them one-dimensional again in order to pull off their misunderstandings gimmick. The gaming club concept could have worked to their advantage but they didn\'t stick with it. Misunderstandings killed anything good that could have been salvaged; the writing was very poorly thought out.They also kept forgetting the girls were interested in video games and continuously used them as boys\' sexual attraction, physically and emotionally which was so creepy. If the poor girls didn\'t completely forget they were into games, they were ashamed of sharing their passion and grew more obsessive about relationships and boys. Because of that, all of the characters kept jumping to their own conclusions about one another. Why write a whirlwind of confusion that would serve to irritate the audience instead of just communicating as friends and partners should? It\'s just plain bad writing. In addition to that, there were episodes where I was able to catch the ending CG and they were all creepy boob and ass shots of the girls in swimsuits. They\'re children and the skeevy producers need to rethink their careers.This entire anime was a landfill of terrible ideas with few moments of fluff sprinkled into it. The writers would constantly forget that the characters enjoyed video games and then beat it into the viewer\'s head that they\'re gamers the next minute. I understand the need to create drama—high school can be fraught with it—but every plotline after the second episode became a string of one misunderstanding to the next. Most high school kids don\'t know how to gauge their emotions and express themselves, but the creators clearly had no idea how to portray adolescence without taking it to new levels of annoying. Pair that with the random creepiness of sexualizing teenage girls and you get this abomination of an anime.

This is the most satisfying romcom I\'ve seen in a millennia. The best part is how it takes the trope of stupid anime misunderstandings and twists and turns it into the satisfying comedic mess that other anime would try to make you take seriously. It keeps weaving this web of needlessly complicated relationships between the 5 main characters that\'ll have you screaming ""JUST TALK...TO EACH OTHER"" but they don\'t and it keeps piling on in the most ridiculous ways that\'d put Tu love Ru to shame (probably not actually). What makes this particularly funny to me is how closely it mimics actual normies and their ""it\'s complicated"" relationships problems and how they could be solved with a simple conversation. I\'m really not sure how it\'s gonna go from this point but I\'ll be happy to follow through.Despite dropping the emphasis on gaming pretty quickly I\'m actually surprised at how accurately they portrayed the gaming aspects of the show. Like how hard it is to initially talk with someone when the only base you have to go on is that you play games, and just how easy it is to bond and befriend someone based on playing a game. It can be cheesy at times but that\'s just how gaming is, sometimes you have to use cheesy strats to get a win.It\'s not a groundbreaking exploration of a gamer\'s psyche by any means but it\'s been a fun and enjoyable experience that hasn\'t fallen into many cliches of a romcom anime so far.

This serie has both:- The humour is just natural and hilarious.

It\'s a low and not so smart move if you ask me. The main subject in Gamers!, as is shown multiple times, is: MISUNDERSTANDING. The very first scene proves this. Also, it\'s a lie that the anime was meant to, firstly, talk about games. The story\'s subject are the GAMERS, not games. But before we get any further in this idea, let\'s start with...one of the keys to understand the anime: the characters.At first, have Keita Amano. Even though he has a good look, he is an insecure, quiet and reclusive gamer. Amano is passionate about gaming, and even puts it above interpersonal relationships, as is shown initially. His main goal with games is only to have fun, and therefore he doesn\'t really give value to competitions. Keita is also very self conscious of who he is, he knows about his insecurity and fear of socializing, and above all he knows that games can look like a waste of time. With this in mind, Keita wants to change. He wants to be outgoing, even though his passion for games makes this objective difficult, and distracts him from people around; however, again, he is self conscious about it. Amano is not perfect, and the anime shows this all the time, especially when he gets impulsive in order do defend his main and loved hobbie. He plays under two alias: Tsucchie and Yama (both kanjis of his mother\'s single surname).The second character, and my favourite, is Karen Tendou. She is pretty, and the madonna of the Otobuki High School. She receives thousand of love letters in her school cabinet every day. But, even with all the attention and spotlight, she is humble, and gives value to the inner of human, therefore Karen never judges the students, and greets all of them at school; even with all the respect and admiration towards her. Also, always helps the teachers with their materials. However, like Keita, Tendou is also a gamer, but she somehow conciliates her hobbie with her social life and studies. She also becomes easily distraught when the subject is love, and, like Keita, Tendou initially doesn\'t know her true potential, doubting of her positive qualities. Karen is the president of the gaming club, and takes part in it secretly. The main goal of the club is to improve as gamers, and initially there are other three characters, and senpais, along with her: Niina Oiso, Gakuto Kase and Main Fushiguro, with a fourth, Eiichi Misumi, joining them later in the final parts of the first episode.The third character is Chiaki Hoshinomori. She is, initially, a solitary gamer, antisocial and also gives more value to fun over competitions, just like Keita. In her first appearance, she has a somber atmosphere and her hair almost covers her face, and that, generated by lack of self esteem, disguises her beauty. It is shown later, when she changed her looks, that she develops games, under the alias of ""Nobe"", and plays using another nickname: ""Mono"" (both kanjis are from her mother\'s single surname). Initially, she started to develop games as a hobbie, but when online users started to bash her games, she felt insecure about them. However, a certain user called ""Tsucchie"" encouraged her to keep her work (neither Chiaki nor Keita were aware of their online identities initially).The fourth character is Tasuku Uehara, a good looking and socially famous student. However, deep inside Tasuku holds insecurities about his past days a nerd, and tries to achieve a ""perfect school life"" (girlfriend, friends and general acceptance).He is also a gamer, but his situation is class is the opposite of Keita, who Uehara looks down mentally. It is shown in the story that he initially did this because he saw himself in Keita, and this feeling turns into a positive one, after episode 2. Even though Uehara is what would be called a ""normie"" (a term he hates to be called, as is shown in his conversation with Keita), Tasuku believes in his first appearance that his girlfriend, Aguri, is with him just for the looks, but that turns out to be a lie later, as she was in love with him since his nerd times.The fifth character is Aguri Sakurano. She is a happy, beautiful, cute and at times absent minded student (but is proved later that she pretended to be like this, in order to be accepted by Tasuku). Aguri was, in her first school years, a shy nerd. However, unlike the other characters, she was never a gamer. She always goes with Tasuku to the arcade, and tends to ask him to pick up dolls from the claw crane. Sakurano sees her nerd days in Chiaki; like Tasuku, she wants to break from her past, and be accepted socially. Aguri is insecure, and, initially, has an emotional dependency towards Tasuku. She then breaks from her fears when involves with the club, especially when a friend of hers, Sarina, says that she will always be an antissocial, and Sakurano thanks her for the words.And at last, but not least, we have the sixth and recurring character: Konoha Hoshinomori. She is Chiaki\'s sister and the president of the students council, and was always perfect at school, from grades to behaviour. Nevertheless, Karen took her place due to her good fame. Even though Konoha has a unbreakable image to take care, she holds a secret passion for eroge games, which she always hides from Chiaki.These are the characters from Gamers!; they have complexity, and also so much to tell, so I had to say as many things as I could. As it is shown, besides their hobbies, they all have their flaws and insecurities. And the anime ALWAYS makes sure to show them, especially the latter. Now, let\'s move to another important part: the plot.The story starts with a term I mentioned previously: misunderstanding. In the first scene, we have Keita and Karen looking to one another in a class break. All the students are staring at them, since the idol of the school is involved. Tendou asked Amano to join the Gamers Club, to which he said that wasn\'t interested in competitions. It was her second time proposing, the first being her presentation of the club, and its members, and the second being rejected again in front of the class. After this situation, the students understand as if Amano rejected Karen romantically, even though that was never the case. His reason, as shown later, is because of his principles of having fun beyond competition, and it\'s revealed that Chiaki was also invited, but rejected the offer for the same reason. However, they both would like to know Tendou\'s ideas about competition better, and even want to become friends with her. After some time, Tendou gets interested in Keita, who has a crush on her, but doesn\'t believe somebody like her would ever fall in love with him. Eventually, they start dating, and their first destiny as a couple is the bowling and gaming alley, in episode 7. Her reasons for interest were due to their passion in common for games, and due to the fact that he defended her and the Game Club in a energetic conversation with Tasuku.I like that the misunderstandings evolve little by little. At first, they start in class, but eventually they take the mind of the main characters. Their paranoias regarding one another show their preconceived ideas falling apart, one by one. Aguri is worried about a """"""possible"""""" affair between Chiaki and Tasuku (lots of quote marks here); Tasuku thinks that Aguri and Keita are dating in secret at a local cafe; Keita has the ""obvious"" conception that Karen fell in love with Tasuku; Karen holds the idea that Chiaki and Keita are also dating (even though Tasuku had the intention of making Keita feel more comfortable around gaming girls, in order to make friends with not only Chiaki, but with the main goal: Karen herself); and finally, Chiaki believes that Tasuku and Keita were together, due to a misunderstanding: both students were having a conversation about their own paranoias towards the girls; Konoha supports Chiaki to take part in the gamers group, and also pretends to bring her sister and Keita together by any means, in part because of Karen\'s accomplishments and perfect image in school.Gamers! shows that communication is an easy action, but when the parts involved are blinded by confusion and precipitation, it becomes nearly impossible. And it is brilliant when showing how this issue can grow in exponential heights. The anime always breaks with the conceptions we have about the characters, and shows that, before being gamers, students, friends and game club members, they are humans. In this task, Gamers! excels perfectly, fulfilling its goal.The characters grow emotionally, and develop through the storyline. Keita starts to give more value to his friends and girlfriend, Karen, over gaming. He even forgets about the pre sale of a game called Space Ocean 2. When he tried to purchase it at the very day, he prefered to give emotional support to Aguri, in a sudden moment of misunderstanding and vulnerability of hers. They become siblings emotionally, as she says in several times. Chiaki\'s issues with Keita regarding differences of opinions change, evolving into a feeling of admiration and respect as a rival. She wasn\'t able to tell him about her being Mono and Nobe, both Keita\'s favorite game developer and best online friend; however, the anime shows that eventually, she will be ready to tell. Not only due to him, but also because of Konoha\'s support and friendship. Karen starts to give more value to fun and entertainment as gamer, after meeting Keita, who also begins to value the competition side. Although she still has preference for competitions, Amano respects her views, and even says that this is what he likes in her the most. Tasuku and Aguri learn to let the past go, but never try to hide who they are; whether they enjoy games of are secretly nerds, what really matters is their feelings towards it, above everybody else.To show people\'s will to grow, their flaws, insecurities and their love in common: THIS is where the beauty of Gamers! shines.Regarding sound, I really liked the main theme ""Gamers!"", the scenes and song atmosphere are perfect to the concept of \'games with friends\'. It is a powerful opening in many ways, and the game sfx fit well to the verses. ""Fight On"" and ""Koi No Prologue"" are two sweet themes, depicting the three main female characters. They are beautiful, and gave me the feeling of wanting more of the anime; like it wasn\'t a farewell. That said, I\'d really like a second season in a near future.The animation is pretty good, the colors are very lively, and the design of the characters are well done. They are not necessarily complex, but pleasing enough.A last idea: I think it would be better to fit episode 12, the one about the meaning of games, as an OVA. It makes more sense as an extra, since the amusement park date (episode 11) is perfect as the season finale.So, generally, this is how deep and complex this beautiful and fun story is. All in all, Gamers! is a genuine masterpiece, that was severally misunderstood through the years (what an irony). I rewatched this anime today, in a sunday. To be honest, I didn\'t even pretend to watch everything at once, let alone write a review now xDI felt the need to write a proper ""scanning"" of the characters background, as a carefully written and deserved review, since Gamers! deserves it. By the way, I plan to read the light novel soon, it looks as amazing as the adaptation.Thank you for reading this far, hope you enjoyed. And I hope I gave you the will to watch or rewatch this masterpiece, in order to take these points into consideration. Have a great day. one of the keys to understand the anime: the characters.At first, have Keita Amano. Even though he has a good look, he is an insecure, quiet and reclusive gamer. Amano is passionate about gaming, and even puts it above interpersonal relationships, as is shown initially. His main goal with games is only to have fun, and therefore he doesn\'t really give value to competitions. Keita is also very self conscious of who he is, he knows about his insecurity and fear of socializing, and above all he knows that games can look like a waste of time. With this in mind, Keita wants to change. He wants to be outgoing, even though his passion for games makes this objective difficult, and distracts him from people around; however, again, he is self conscious about it. Amano is not perfect, and the anime shows this all the time, especially when he gets impulsive in order do defend his main and loved hobbie. He plays under two alias: Tsucchie and Yama (both kanjis of his mother\'s single surname).The second character, and my favourite, is Karen Tendou. She is pretty, and the madonna of the Otobuki High School. She receives thousand of love letters in her school cabinet every day. But, even with all the attention and spotlight, she is humble, and gives value to the inner of human, therefore Karen never judges the students, and greets all of them at school; even with all the respect and admiration towards her. Also, always helps the teachers with their materials. However, like Keita, Tendou is also a gamer, but she somehow conciliates her hobbie with her social life and studies. She also becomes easily distraught when the subject is love, and, like Keita, Tendou initially doesn\'t know her true potential, doubting of her positive qualities. Karen is the president of the gaming club, and takes part in it secretly. The main goal of the club is to improve as gamers, and initially there are other three characters, and senpais, along with her: Niina Oiso, Gakuto Kase and Main Fushiguro, with a fourth, Eiichi Misumi, joining them later in the final parts of the first episode.The third character is Chiaki Hoshinomori. She is, initially, a solitary gamer, antisocial and also gives more value to fun over competitions, just like Keita. In her first appearance, she has a somber atmosphere and her hair almost covers her face, and that, generated by lack of self esteem, disguises her beauty. It is shown later, when she changed her looks, that she develops games, under the alias of ""Nobe"", and plays using another nickname: ""Mono"" (both kanjis are from her mother\'s single surname). Initially, she started to develop games as a hobbie, but when online users started to bash her games, she felt insecure about them. However, a certain user called ""Tsucchie"" encouraged her to keep her work (neither Chiaki nor Keita were aware of their online identities initially).The fourth character is Tasuku Uehara, a good looking and socially famous student. However, deep inside Tasuku holds insecurities about his past days a nerd, and tries to achieve a ""perfect school life"" (girlfriend, friends and general acceptance).He is also a gamer, but his situation is class is the opposite of Keita, who Uehara looks down mentally. It is shown in the story that he initially did this because he saw himself in Keita, and this feeling turns into a positive one, after episode 2. Even though Uehara is what would be called a ""normie"" (a term he hates to be called, as is shown in his conversation with Keita), Tasuku believes in his first appearance that his girlfriend, Aguri, is with him just for the looks, but that turns out to be a lie later, as she was in love with him since his nerd times.The fifth character is Aguri Sakurano. She is a happy, beautiful, cute and at times absent minded student (but is proved later that she pretended to be like this, in order to be accepted by Tasuku). Aguri was, in her first school years, a shy nerd. However, unlike the other characters, she was never a gamer. She always goes with Tasuku to the arcade, and tends to ask him to pick up dolls from the claw crane.

She then breaks from her fears when involves with the club, especially when a friend of hers, Sarina, says that she will always be an antissocial, and Sakurano thanks her for the words.And at last, but not least, we have the sixth and recurring character: Konoha Hoshinomori.

Have a great day.', 'Hoenstly I watched this show over a year ago but it just came to mind and made me really frustrated. I wanted to explain and ""review"" this show as to the best of my abilities as I can, which is not very well since I dont remember any of the details about the show and just overall feelings.So this show\'s only redeeming quality is the cutie character designs. The only enjoyment I got out of the show is the characters and their expressions.Now the thing that stands out in my mind and what I HATE about shows like this is an ongoing and escalating amount...of misunderstandings where is they just ACTED LIKE RATIONAL PEOPLE THIS WHOLE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. That is my sentiment. I understand some people like that senario and good on them but honestly most of the characters are forgettable or down right dislikable and the story is about as dry as I have ever seen. Leaves no lasting impression and is just here to make you frustrated.From what I remember if you get 3 episodes in and are annoyed, dip while you still can cause it only goes down hill.I would skip this show and move on to something different. of misunderstandings where is they just ACTED LIKE RATIONAL PEOPLE THIS WHOLE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.

One of this show\'s favorite gags is to set up a cliche that I\'ve seen many times before and then knock it straight down. Add in some cliched rom-com misunderstandings and I\'ve been laughing or grinning all episode every episode.Also, it\'s pretty rare for anime to take the stance of ""don\'t take life too seriously, but don\'t let it pass you by"". I might be wrong about its direction (and I don\'t want to spoil anything), but so far I\'ve liked the show\'s message.Whether or not you\'ll like this...show greatly depends on your sense of humor. If the above sounds like it\'d irritate you more than entertain you, it\'s likely that this show isn\'t for you. I feel like this is common sense for a comedy show, so insert this paragraph into every comedy review ever. show greatly depends on your sense of humor.

I feel like this is common sense for a comedy show, so insert this paragraph into every comedy review ever.', ""This is not a show about games, its a facade. The show is actually a frustratingly bad romance anime that relies heavily on misunderstandings.The premise of the show is basic, it sets up the main relationship very quickly and has a sub-plot about video games, that is hardly relevant, but I believe has been put into the show just to pander to the otaku demographic.I don't understand any of the characters in this show, not because they are complex, but because they are so poorly written and their objectives and ambitions in the show are contrived and feel as though they are just ideas...that have been copied and pasted onto these blank canvas characters.Seeming romance is the show's main focus, you would think this would be the best part, you'd be wrong to think that. The characters are so bad that I couldn't seem to care about any of their relationships. The characters all seem to be mentally handicapped as they all brake down and misunderstand the actions of other characters and the show has a roundabout way of just avoiding them actually talking about these misunderstandings.Keita fails as a main character, he contradicts himself so often, most likely because of the poor writing, I feel as though there's a new main character each episode.Most likely no one looks towards a romance anime, looking for good animation, on this front Gamers! is passable.  Art and animation are both standard, I felt like I was hearing the same couple of tracks each episode, which made me feel as though the music in the show was a bit bland. that have been copied and pasted onto these blank canvas characters.Seeming romance is the show's main focus, you would think this would be the best part, you'd be wrong to think that.

I\'d say the first 3 episodes were good, then it went downhill exponentially. Also, don\'t watch if you got interested by the name, this show has close to nothing to do with gaming, it\'s more like a tool to try making the conversations/storylines less boring, but even at that it failed. Also, it\'s more like 11 episodes + 1 OVA, 11th episode is the real ending.After the 3rd episode, the whole story was about misunderstandings getting out of hand and turning into a crazy love polygon. Honestly that\'s...all that\'s happening. I\'m fine with a bit of cliché obliviousness, that\'s needed here and there to enable the story in a shoujo, but this anime criminally overused it. Is that supposed to be its niche? What a letdown.The characters had zero depth. Nobody expects crazy characters from a shoujo, I expected nothing and still got let down. And once again, 4/5 of the main characters were ""gamers"", but it was just a tool and they were ""gamers"" for the sake of being gamers, because without that their characters would literally be empty, and funnily the 5th character\'s whole personality is not being a gamer so it\'s almost comedic how shit the characters were written.The art was okay but that doesn\'t matter when it\'s just a huge dumpsterfire.--- LIGHT SPOILER ---Not only the whole show is just a bunch of stupid misunderstandings piled up, the worst part is that none of these get addressed by the characters. That\'s just so stupid. All 4 of them thinks they all cheat on each other and it never gets addressed, like wtf? They were basically convinced they were being cheated on and all of them were like ""okay, we love each other now, I don\'t care if they cheated"" and moved on. It\'s only really Chiaki coming to terms with not pursuing Keita and that\'s the ending.I went into the last episode thinking all the things would be talked through but no, it was some random idiotic rant by the writers about the gaming industry, like ??? It\'s almost as if the creators didn\'t even give a damn about making an anime and they just wanted to make a statement. Should\'ve given away the budget for charity honestly. all that\'s happening.

Should\'ve given away the budget for charity honestly.', ""Soooooooooooo.....Yup......Gamers is the anime i'll be reviewing today and...It has an exclamation mark at the end, as you can probably see..If you're blind i'm sorry can't help you with that.And where to start really? Maybe with the story? Yeah let's go with that and see how it plays out..Ok then, the story is about gam...No it isn't actually. You see my dear friends this anime apart from the first and maybe the last episode where they vaguely talk about games, is a rom-com kinda deal. So the anime starts with Amano Keita-one of the most basic lads in anime-who,one fateful day,meets the Gamer Club President...Tendo Karen..And SHE is not basic at all..In fact i'd say she is a solid fucking 8.Now before you call me names you'll regret cause i'm one to bite back and bite hard, i mention the rankings because Karen falls for the beta male and basic as fuck protagonist..What a surprise, right? Well no..Cause Karen as it happens invited Keita to her club and the next thing you know is he rejected her with a killer smile and that was that..She was head over heels for him. And that is actually very realistic cause people always want what they can't have..It becomes an obssession of some sorts which leads to broken marriages and one parent families and kids starting cocaine and robbing marts and raping old ladies in dark alleys..You know, the small things.Then Karen starts stalking the brave knight while he gets to live a life full of naked and willing otaku gamer girls, who are there to please his needs, no matter how sick they are..I guess sick here means playing a video game other than Candy Crush?!And from there starts a whatfuckery the world has yet to witness the likes of. All you need to know is that there are couples and every single individual thinks that their other half is cheating on them when in reality they don't..I wonder if the writers actually wanted to make an anime about a swingers club but the studio wanted to make it more family friendly,which is another word for no fun.Oh and remember that club i mentioned earlier? Well that club and indeed it's 2 other senior members are nowhere to be seen after the first episode, which is a shame really cause one of them was a girl and let me tell you that bird had titties the size of a planet.Back to the love octagon..Other than the 2 cast members i mentioned earlier there are also some other characters such as Tasuku, a former geeky gamer who somehow turned into the Japanese equivelant of Brad Pitt. Then we have Aguri, Tasuku’s pink headed girlfriend and Chiaki, a lone wolf type of gamer and last but least Chiaki’s younger sister whose name i can't be bothered to remember or search cause i have better things to do, like ending my life probably..All you need to know about her is that she's there to add a little slut spice into the already fucked up mix of gangbangery.So a fucked up story NOT about gamers apart from the fact that they just identify as such,a cast built just to see how far a swinging club can go and what you end up with is a fun anime to watch..And i really can't put my finger on it, cause it really shouldn't work, but it's a joy to watch. Granted the title and the story on paper are misleading but then again it's still a silly anime and one you can watch after, say, binge watching a heavy duty series.The characters are by no means boring with their little shenanigans and quirks. Every character has something to show about....Apart from development that is. So if you're on a look for an anime with characters that are interesting and show some actual growth then this is not the one for you. This is meant mostly as a break from these anime, that's the only way it can make sense in my mind.As far as animation and music go things are pretty much standard. The characters are your standard anime fellows and the backgrounds are nicely done...It's a 2017 lineup anime so production value is very good..Unless you happen to stumble upon an anime with FUCKIN' CGI  in it.Music and VA are there surely..Opening and closing songs are very nicely done to keep in touch with the game theme..Even though the anime is about imaginary cheating.To sum it up then, Gamers is by no means a great anime and after 10 mins of watching it you'll forget everything about it. But it serves its' purpose if you want something fun and light before you go and watch Tokyo Ghoul for example.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not..Just for the laughs while having a nice soothing drink it's ideal. Tendo Karen..And SHE is not basic at all..In fact i'd say she is a solid fucking 8.Now before you call me names you'll regret cause i'm one to bite back and bite hard, i mention the rankings because Karen falls for the beta male and basic as fuck protagonist..What a surprise, right? Well no..Cause Karen as it happens invited Keita to her club and the next thing you know is he rejected her with a killer smile and that was that..She was head over heels for him. And that is actually very realistic cause people always want what they can't have..It becomes an obssession of some sorts which leads to broken marriages and one parent families and kids starting cocaine and robbing marts and raping old ladies in dark alleys..You know, the small things.Then Karen starts stalking the brave knight while he gets to live a life full of naked and willing otaku gamer girls, who are there to please his needs, no matter how sick they are..I guess sick here means playing a video game other than Candy Crush?!And from there starts a whatfuckery the world has yet to witness the likes of. All you need to know is that there are couples and every single individual thinks that their other half is cheating on them when in reality they don't..I wonder if the writers actually wanted to make an anime about a swingers club but the studio wanted to make it more family friendly,which is another word for no fun.Oh and remember that club i mentioned earlier? Well that club and indeed it's 2 other senior members are nowhere to be seen after the first episode, which is a shame really cause one of them was a girl and let me tell you that bird had titties the size of a planet.Back to the love octagon..Other than the 2 cast members i mentioned earlier there are also some other characters such as Tasuku, a former geeky gamer who somehow turned into the Japanese equivelant of Brad Pitt. Then we have Aguri, Tasuku’s pink headed girlfriend and Chiaki, a lone wolf type of gamer and last but least Chiaki’s younger sister whose name i can't be bothered to remember or search cause i have better things to do, like ending my life probably..All you need to know about her is that she's there to add a little slut spice into the already fucked up mix of gangbangery.So a fucked up story NOT about gamers apart from the fact that they just identify as such,a cast built just to see how far a swinging club can go and what you end up with is a fun anime to watch..And i really can't put my finger on it, cause it really shouldn't work, but it's a joy to watch. Granted the title and the story on paper are misleading but then again it's still a silly anime and one you can watch after, say, binge watching a heavy duty series.The characters are by no means boring with their little shenanigans and quirks. Every character has something to show about....Apart from development that is. So if you're on a look for an anime with characters that are interesting and show some actual growth then this is not the one for you. This is meant mostly as a break from these anime, that's the only way it can make sense in my mind.As far as animation and music go things are pretty much standard. The characters are your standard anime fellows and the backgrounds are nicely done...It's a 2017 lineup anime so production value is very good..Unless you happen to stumble upon an anime with FUCKIN' CGI  in it.Music and VA are there surely..Opening and closing songs are very nicely done to keep in touch with the game theme..Even though the anime is about imaginary cheating.To sum it up then, Gamers is by no means a great anime and after 10 mins of watching it you'll forget everything about it. But it serves its' purpose if you want something fun and light before you go and watch Tokyo Ghoul for example.Should you watch it? Yeah, why not..Just for the laughs while having a nice soothing drink it's ideal."", ""TSUNDERE ALERTYou have been warnedStory - 4As many Slice of Life are, there wasn't much real 'story' but it revolves around a socially awkward game addict named Keita Amano. One day, he sees the school idol and she invites him to her gaming club. After checking it out, he respectfully declines her offer, (probably because he sucks at video games) and the idol falls madly in love with him.Art & Animation - 8The art and animation still seems to be top-notch. Nothing bad I can say about it, really. The way the claw on the claw machine moved swiftly was perfectly executed and very...'flowing'. I'll have to say, Uehara's art style seemed pretty unique, but he still ended up looking cool asf.Sound - 7The VA were enjoyable as usual, except for the MC. Like, for some reason, every time he spoke he just made me want to punch his brains out even more. Oh yes, and of course, the tsundere(worst type of dere) scenes were fine as usual.Character - 5Our cast revolves around some pretty cliche characters. A tsun, the 'best friend' character, shy, awkward MC, the 'moe' character, etc. They have some heavy 2D personalities, no real character development, but I mean, the only reason character isnt rated any lower is because of my man, Uehara. Oh, what a lovable bro character. I'm not even a fujoshi, but I hardcore ship him and the MC. Ah yes, I can see the doujins rolling out, the DOUJINS RO-sorry, where was I? The characters are 'ok' likable, and from what I've seen, the MC does get quite the amount of hate. (Hes pretty annoying tbh)Enjoyment - 7Meh, sometimes an anime doesn't even have to be good to enjoy it. You see some people rating things like Konosuba a 5 because there's no story. Like, did you seriously watch konosuba for the story? I personally enjoyed Gamers! a lot so far, hopefully it doesn't dissapoint me.

The anime started out seemingly strong and appeared to me like it was going to be different than most cliché anime we see nowadays. The characters seemed strong as well. It was funny and emotional when need be, but about halfway in, everything collapsed and became a giant...mess of misunderstandings atop misunderstandings to the point where it wasn't funny anymore, especially considering how these understandings were so ridiculous and could've easily been solved in the first few episodes. The humor had died out and all that was left was frustration and me hoping the episode would just end. The whole plot, or what was left of what seemed to be a plot, fell into itself and hardly had anything to do with what was going on anymore. Each character slowly faded and it just became a jumbled mess that wasn't entertaining. The quality of this anime slowly died out each episode, and that's the sad, disappointing thing about Gamers!The whole thing was just wasted potential, in my opinion. There's tons of anime out there under the same genres as Gamers! that aren't as unsatisfactory as this one.

I came across Gamers while looking at the summer anime list and once I came across the genre ""Romance"" and ""Comedy"" I knew I had to check it out and I\'m glad I did.Story 8/10:The story isn\'t special. It\'s about a gamer kid who loves games so much that he attracts the attention of the hottest gamer girl in school and gets asked to join her gamer club which he hilariously declines. This rejection ultimately allows the main MC to make new friends and the start of misunderstandings happens from thereafter. Trust me, the story isn\'t really interesting but that\'s...not the strong suit to this anime, it\'s the character interactions. Many of the characters have some relation to each other, some characters have a crush on each other, some characters believe that another characters likes someone else, and some characters think that other characters hate themselves and with this spider web of misunderstandings, it opens up the hilarious premise of trying to solve everyone\'s misunderstandings with more misunderstandings. Honestly if you like stupid funny this is the anime for you.Art 8/10:The art really isn\'t special BUT the strong point to the art are the faces that the characters make. You can easily tell how a character is feeling and the drawings are a bit exaggerated to give it that funny element. Overall, art is solid.Sound 8/10:Sound is solid. I like the opening, it\'s cute and well made. The voice casting of the characters are also solid. I like the main MC\'s voice as well the girl. It suits them.Character 10/10:I like the characters. None of them are specifically annoying and all of them are quite likable. There is never a moment when a character shows up and I begin to despise their existence. The character personalities are what make up this anime as they are all dumb in their own way so because I like the misunderstanding aspect of this anime I give the characters a 10.Overall, this anime is a light hearted enjoyable anime to watch.

Of course games! This might be an anime where characters are gamers and they would play and explore different kinds of games. Or maybe they are ought to compete with other gamers using their expertise on games. But it\'s not. This is really just a school romance comedy anime.The first episode really caught my interest since it...shows the different types of gamers and what games they are good with. But as I continued the second and then to next episodes, it became bad and painful to watch. My expectations were ruined but I did consider the theme of the anime in which ""loving games and enjoying yourself on playing games is the best thing as a gamer"" so I could continue. But the hell, the characters just kept on talking and spouting their ideals and perceptions on games and it became a source of conflict which is kind of annoying. But the most annoying part here are the misunderstandings of the characters. Characters are so dense and stupid and small things became a big thing. It was so annoying when you\'re watching like you wanted to throw the remote control on their faces but you can\'t because your TV might broke.  I kinda dislike the characters here, a plain and dense hero, Mary Sue heroine and annoying supporting characters. There are other supporting characters there who are way better but you won\'t get to see them often in the series and I\'m kinda disappointed with that.So this anime just typically depicts the lives of teenagers in their adolescent days. Kind of cliche but it\'s a gamer teen version. I did not enjoy this really so if you\'re looking for an anime wich really uses games as a plot and not just talk about games, then don\'t watch this. shows the different types of gamers and what games they are good with.

It starts out by properly being about gamers as the title suggests, for like 2 episodes. But quickly enough it mutates into some bizzare rom com that can only go with one joke repeatedly: misunderstandings.Stupid misunderstanding at that, ones that could be quickly and easily resolved by just talking between the characters, and they annoyingly avoid doing that just to make the viewers tear out their hair in frustration. And this drags on and on...Finally the horrible rom com ends at episode 12 (the last one!!) when they at long last return to talk about...games, albeit with excessive fanservice added to it which distracts from the actual conversation.

I understand how a romcom can be enjoyable when the characters are a bit stupid, but f*cking hell this overstepped the boundaries by far.I have to say that some aspects of characters are quite relatable, hence why I think this anime portrays them terribly. When you have the most popular girl in school, who acts like a cold b*tch to everyone, blushing in front of you, surely you get that something is up. Yes, girls might feel like they are difficult to understand and that is true in real life tbf, but surely you recognize when...she starts acting different around you.Another really annoying point is that talking to someone is already seen as cheating/love. I get that this is supposed to add to the comedy but does that really happen? No, of course not. It only adds to the characters being absolutely braindead and not being able to speak their mind.

However there hasn't been a show in a while that has vexed me to this extent.Let's begin with the premise. Regardless of what the synopsis sais, this isn't about gamers, this is about teenagers in love. I know, not original, but it's also pretty much what every anime is about these days anyway. There are four characters that all have some kind of relationship with the main character, wether it be friends or crushes. The fact that most of these characters are...gamers is only established in the first episode, and is quickly set aside for the rest of the series. In addition all of these characters have stereotypical personalities for the single purpose of some comedic gags/skits that often fall flat.What moves this shows premise along is just a series of misunderstandings and convoluted omissions, that could easily be resolved if any of the characters had any kind of common sense. Even when two or more characters are discussing the very topic that has been misunderstood, they arbitrarily refuse to mention the one fact that could resolve the matter at hand. This is lazy storytelling, it's trite and unimaginative.If that wasn't bad enough they introduce more characters eventually, with the express purpose of distracting the viewer from the previous issues, by creating more convoluted situations without resolving the previous matters. An analogy that comes to mind would be that this show is like a drawer you used to store cables in, you keep adding more and more cables in there and they keep getting tangled up, so the viewer is just stuck trying to untangle the massive amounts of cables. It's not fun, it's just frustrating and it never ends.Every other aspect of the show is average at best, the art is mediocre and the music is inoffensive. There is no redeeming factor for this show that pushes it above an average score. It uses the premise that the characters are gamers to bait in gullible viewers, but none of the scenarios or the characters are really relateable if you are a gamer.My final score is 4/10, because despite every other aspect of the show being average, the story progression itself is just frustrating and unbelievable, and drags the score further down. gamers is only established in the first episode, and is quickly set aside for the rest of the series.

Spoilers ahead because its common courtesy to expose clickbait.Gamers! is your stereotypical love-polygon in which misunderstandings, a mysterious childhood friend, and a perfect blonde girl gets you real frustrated because you\'re tired of watching people blush and apologize for 10 episodes.There is actually almost nothing to do with video games. In fact, there are probably only 15 minutes of video game screen time in the 12 episode series, and 10 of the 15 are from the OP playing 11 times.Let\'s talk about...the OP. After finding this show and thinking it was about gaming from reading the title (lmao), I watched the OP and saw House of the Dead, PUBG, Smash Bros, Street Fighter, PopnMusic, and some other hype shit. ""There\'s no way this show can\'t be about games,"" I had thought after confirming by watching the OP. AYY LMAO.Then the show baits you in with episode 1, in which the stereotypical antisocial loser MC gets invited to play in his schools esports club with the school idol who happens to be 200 IQ, 10k MMR, Challenger, Grandmaster, Global Elite. It also introduces you to secondary characters who are interesting in their own right by being hyped as some of the best in the world at their respective games.But unfortunately, the MC declines the offer and instead the show does a 720 and moonwalks backwards into a terribly written love dodecahedron in which video games are never to be heard of again. Suddenly, the esports club and its members cease to exist and the clips of the characters playing CSGO, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena are like a fever dream you can\'t really believe existed.This show baits you hard and takes you on a rollercoaster ride where it feels like the show is trying its hardest to eat up time and make up dumb ways for the love dodrangle to grow even more complicated. You get this feeling of ""Its okay, this will end soon- I enjoyed Haruhi S2 even with Endless Eight in it,"" and you push into each episode only to be let down with the Endless Eleven. The show continually mocks you with the splash screen that plays before and after the commercial breaks- provocative pictures of a game controller and a PS4; surely there will be an actual video game related plot with all this teasing, right?Then you reach the end of episode 10 and then realize its too late. Episode 11 will inevitably be a continuation of the hokey pokey and the kids will turn themselves around. That\'s what it\'s all about. Then that leaves only episode 12 to continue/conclude/start(?) the plot, which of course is way too goddamn short a time to achieve anything significant.But then the start of episode 12 starts to blow you away because suddenly it has to do with esports again and it brings back one of the beloved cool kids and the- nope, never mind. It\'s like after doing the 720 they decided to do another revolution and make it a 1080 to break the world record and redeem themselves, but right as they landed they ate shit and slid down a mountain. Episode 12 is a disaster in its own right. The main focus of episode 12 is to convince the main characters, and essentially the viewer, that gaming is a waste of time and money. Can you believe this shit. Even if what they say is true, keep in mind you have been praying to every deity you can think of that this show will start talking about video games and once they actually do, they tell you that your hobby sucks. The worst part is that the characters are actually thoroughly convinced until the last 2 minutes of the episode/season/plot when they realize that actually its not a waste of time and money because it just isn\'t.However, I am not just giving this a poor review because I dislike romcoms or love-polygons, or anything like that. I am giving this a poor review because it really truly sucks.There is no story or deeper exposition that this show ever starts or concludes, probably because they trashed all the world building done in episode 1. It seriously feels like a waste and almost makes you wonder why they even bothered building anything up to begin with.The designs are so basic and characters look like background characters from other high school animes- you almost wonder if this show is a gaiden for the unnamed characters from an actually decent high school series. Another big gripe is one of the characters is literally named Ugly and her hair is pink with brown roots, making it look like someone dropped a deuce on her head.Animation quality varies wildly, and sometimes it seems like characters are the wrong size, their bodies are not in the right plane of existence with the backgrounds, and many times you will a shift in drawing/animation styles as if each scene was made by a completely different company. The last bit may or may not be a problem because the end of episode 11 actually seemed very reminiscent of ~2010 gainax which was neato.The sound is so forgettable I don\'t even remember if there\'s background music at all. The only thing I can remember is a short jingle that plays during the commercial splash screens.In all honesty, if you came to this show hoping for some semblance of a video game anime, just watch the OP, episode 1, and episode 12. You will miss absolutely nothing skipping the middle 10 episodes. the OP. After finding this show and thinking it was about gaming from reading the title (lmao), I watched the OP and saw House of the Dead, PUBG, Smash Bros, Street Fighter, PopnMusic, and some other hype shit.

It also introduces you to secondary characters who are interesting in their own right by being hyped as some of the best in the world at their respective games.But unfortunately, the MC declines the offer and instead the show does a 720 and moonwalks backwards into a terribly written love dodecahedron in which video games are never to be heard of again. Suddenly, the esports club and its members cease to exist and the clips of the characters playing CSGO, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena are like a fever dream you can\'t really believe existed.This show baits you hard and takes you on a rollercoaster ride where it feels like the show is trying its hardest to eat up time and make up dumb ways for the love dodrangle to grow even more complicated. You get this feeling of ""Its okay, this will end soon- I enjoyed Haruhi S2 even with Endless Eight in it,"" and you push into each episode only to be let down with the Endless Eleven. The show continually mocks you with the splash screen that plays before and after the commercial breaks- provocative pictures of a game controller and a PS4; surely there will be an actual video game related plot with all this teasing, right?Then you reach the end of episode 10 and then realize its too late. Episode 11 will inevitably be a continuation of the hokey pokey and the kids will turn themselves around. That\'s what it\'s all about. Then that leaves only episode 12 to continue/conclude/start(?) the plot, which of course is way too goddamn short a time to achieve anything significant.But then the start of episode 12 starts to blow you away because suddenly it has to do with esports again and it brings back one of the beloved cool kids and the- nope, never mind. It\'s like after doing the 720 they decided to do another revolution and make it a 1080 to break the world record and redeem themselves, but right as they landed they ate shit and slid down a mountain. Episode 12 is a disaster in its own right. The main focus of episode 12 is to convince the main characters, and essentially the viewer, that gaming is a waste of time and money. Can you believe this shit. Even if what they say is true, keep in mind you have been praying to every deity you can think of that this show will start talking about video games and once they actually do, they tell you that your hobby sucks. The worst part is that the characters are actually thoroughly convinced until the last 2 minutes of the episode/season/plot when they realize that actually its not a waste of time and money because it just isn\'t.However, I am not just giving this a poor review because I dislike romcoms or love-polygons, or anything like that. I am giving this a poor review because it really truly sucks.There is no story or deeper exposition that this show ever starts or concludes, probably because they trashed all the world building done in episode 1. It seriously feels like a waste and almost makes you wonder why they even bothered building anything up to begin with.The designs are so basic and characters look like background characters from other high school animes- you almost wonder if this show is a gaiden for the unnamed characters from an actually decent high school series. Another big gripe is one of the characters is literally named Ugly and her hair is pink with brown roots, making it look like someone dropped a deuce on her head.Animation quality varies wildly, and sometimes it seems like characters are the wrong size, their bodies are not in the right plane of existence with the backgrounds, and many times you will a shift in drawing/animation styles as if each scene was made by a completely different company. The last bit may or may not be a problem because the end of episode 11 actually seemed very reminiscent of ~2010 gainax which was neato.The sound is so forgettable I don\'t even remember if there\'s background music at all. The only thing I can remember is a short jingle that plays during the commercial splash screens.In all honesty, if you came to this show hoping for some semblance of a video game anime, just watch the OP, episode 1, and episode 12. You will miss absolutely nothing skipping the middle 10 episodes.', 'Before i start, let me ""warm you up"" a bit.-----Koe de Oshigoto. Work using voice.

Do you want to watch an anime about dedicated gamers who play against each other for some friendly competition? Or perhaps watch an anime about the lives of professional gamers? If you do, then I recommend you turn around and leave this page as soon as possible and never consider watching this show.This show is for all the gamers out there. Now I know what you're thinking and no, not the ones who actually play games, that'd be stupid. This show is for the people who like gaming references while watching a bad romantic comedy. Don't worry, they don't just...make references, they tell each other how much they like playing games, so you know they are true gamers! They have transitions with gaming music while showing a girl holding a controller; HELL YEAH, that is how I know she's a gamer. They even use game lingo when they talk to each other, a key feature that only the truest of gamers possess. Now if you’re still interested in watching this for the romcom aspect, I implore you to reconsider and I will explain why.The only comedy in this show is the laugh you have when you wonder how this show ever came about. You’ll laugh at the poor plot if you already recovered from your cringing. To avoid spoiling (like it matters), all I’ll say is that the “m” in gamers stands for “misunderstandings”; there are a shit ton of them. If you have a functioning brain, you should never come to any of the misunderstandings and conclusions some of these characters reach. I honestly believe the author never attended high school and is just assuming this is how a high school drama is. It honestly hurts me when I try to contemplate how they even came to some of these conclusions.Lastly, I will say that if you enjoy a good cringe (cause you’ll be cringing a lot, I will warn you that your face may contort with the ungodly amount of cringing), you’ll enjoy this show. While watching I do recommend you turn your brain off to avoid damaging it during the show. Now I got to go play some games to show everyone that I AM A TRUE GAMER!

See you later gamer BROS!"", 'To more accurately sum up the entirety of this Anime it should be called ""Misunderstandings"" rather than ""Gamers!"" as it has next to nothing to do with gaming at all. The anime started off very promising with actually showing us some gaming to help build up a storyline but after about episode 3 all of that goes away and becomes your standard/substandard rom-com(i love rom-coms but this ones not even funny). It basically delves more into the characters romantic relationships in what eventually becomes a love pentagon (not a triangle but a pentagon) all due to very easily solvable misunderstandings that could be fixed if...the characters literally just talked to each other. When the misunderstandings between them cause drama for an episode or 2 i was willing to accept it as some light comedy until the misunderstandings literally engulf the entirety of the show lasting for 4+episodes.  Essentially this anime plays to the lowest common denominator of anime fans in that it has solely relied on the same 2 misunderstandings between character relationships to play off its comedy for 4+ eps which has gotten really annoying and stale. I say this because after episode 3 all the episodes are exactly the same, same setting,same drama, same comedy bits as if they literally just copy and pasted. Overall i had very high hopes for this anime based off the first few episodes but at this point i feel extremely cheated out of what initially had a lot of potential.Like imagine buying a cute puppy only for it to grow up into a rabies riddled monster that bites off 2 of your fingers even though you gave it all your love (thats this anime). I mean the writers aren\'t even trying anymore i don\'t know what else to say this is the only anime i\'ve ever given  a 4/10 for and i\'m being super generous. (keep in mind the other reviews are only so high because they\'ve only seen 3-4 episodes which is the turning point for when the anime goes very very downhill) the characters literally just talked to each other.

It\'s got the same premise as a million other cliché romantic comedies, this time with the gimmick that it\'s about a loser gamer otaku to justify all the idiotic things he does, as well as endear itself to a niche that will appreciate the game references (not that you necessarily need to understand them to appreciate the rest of the show, this show is about people, not games), but what sets it apart is it knows how cliché it is and goes out of its way to surpass your expectations,...or annihilate them. The show relies heavily on misunderstandings to move the plot along, and it flaunts this in your face like a proud toddler. Whenever something cliché happens, it\'s treated as satire, dialing everything up to 11 in such an absurd way you are usually too busy laughing at the reaction faces or trying to piece together how this will affect the rest of the cast to care that they are completely unapologetic about their clichés.It\'s ""affects the rest of the cast"" part that makes the show feel different though, because there\'s so much more going on than there would be if this were a generic harem anime. First of all, the show doesn\'t revolve around the loser main character, a lot of Amano\'s importance in the plot is how he affects things that don\'t even really have to do with him. What\'s more, things do get affected, this isn\'t the kind of show that resets at the end of every episode, the characters all have dynamic relationships that change and evolve every single episode. You need to think to keep up, but it gives you plenty to think about while assaulting you with hilarious gag after hilarious gag. In this way, despite being incredibly cliché, you really don\'t have a clue what\'s going to happen, because they could pull pretty much anything and it would be in keeping with the tone of the show up to this point.All this said, I did find 2 episodes noteworthily unfunny, the pool episode, and the final episode. The writers managed to make so many clichés hilarious to me, but cheap fan service was not one of them, and the two episodes that featured it all more or less bored me. You might as well stop watching the show after episode 11, episode 12 did nothing to enhance the rest of the show besides a single hilarious scene featuring a side character.Overall, still an absolutely hilarious show, probably my favorite anime of the season and worth checking out if you want a good time. or annihilate them.

Literally. It\'s supposed to be a gaming anime or at least contain the gaming element,but in fact,the result was 90% relationship misunderstandings and 10% gaming. Gamers is just like any romance/School/Slice of life anime,but it doesn\'t even follow the title. If you want to make an anime about games,then dedicate to them,don\'t just use them as an excuse to create a love drama! At first it started with Karen inviting Keita to the gaming club so it had a fair dedication to games. But after the first episode,or actually when Chiaki...appeared,the gaming element went in trash and the plot focused on the complicated relationships between the five main characters.Art:7/10I have to admit that the art design was one reason why I wanted to give a chance to this anime. It wasn\'t amazing,but it wasn\'t awful either. In fact,if you don\'t count some moments where Uehara or other characters had weird facial expressions,the design was okay. I don\'t have anything bad about it.Sound:9/10That\'s the biggest reason why I wanted to watch Gamers. I happened to hear the opening song, which in my opinion is really catchy and sounds good to my ears,but as for the video clip,it was a trap too! I thought that it would have some great game battles,RPG games or anything else that involves gaming,but unfortunately this stayed only on the opening. However,I liked the music so much that I don\'t want to complain.Characters:4/10There we go! Keita is the cliche example of the lonely boy who loves gaming and is most likely a virgin who finds pleasure by playing roleplay games instead of trying to find a real girl. He likes Karen,but he seems like he doesn\'t know about dating!Uehara on the other hand is a really weird guy who wants to ship Keita with Karen , but he seems like he causes trouble to his relationship with Aguri .Karen is clearly the ""perfect"" example of a girl who everyone wants to mimic or date,but in fact she had fallen for a simple boy like Keita and doesn\'t even admit it. She is really klutz in my opinion.Aguri has that sweet, devilish personality that makes you cringe. She appears to have a cute, flirty personality when she is around Tasuku,but when she sees him with another girl, especially Karen and Chiaki,she jumps in wrong conclusions and instead of clearing the misunderstanding,she only makes it worse by bursting at KeitaAnd finally Chiaki...well,she is the only character that I like a bit more than the others. The only bad thing is that as Aguri(and actually all the characters),she jumps in wrong conclusions.Overall:5/10Gamers would be a good anime even without games. If the gaming element wasn\'t involved,I\'m sure that It would\'ve been a mediocre romance anime.

And then they proceeded to butcher, destroy, and betray it all in the final 20 minutes. The 12th and final...episode had absolutely nothing to do with anything that happened before it, pacing wasn't just bad but completely irrelevant, and what this shitstain of a finale left you with was an overdone, labored debate on the price of games, 10 minutes of jiggling out-of-place ecchi fan service (for which it seems they all got tit implants off screen), and no resolution to the love triangle at all.

The show constantly takes this to heart, resulting in nuances such as how every member of the principal cast treats games differently but all the actual video gamers treat it as a matter of life or death in their own way, the dumb reasons that are behind the name of the character's avatars and how the character's actually play actual real world video games as well as games that are blatantly referencing other popular games, or how the cliche scene where the female cast members are jealous of each other's figure actually consists of a heated debate about the joy of difficult video games.While not revolutionary the main cast of Gamers! manage to have good chemistry between each other. Which helps make the fact that most of the plot being someone suspecting another for cheating a bit more believable.Gamers! is not a revolutionary show. Nor is it something you go out to watch. But if you are a person who is a bit too invested into video games (like me, if the review didn't make it obvious) or are willing to follow a group of dumb teenagers doing dumb things you might find yourself having a good time. is because of how it treats it's subject matter.

It\'s a show that relies on two things: the viewers tolerance and general understanding of the misunderstanding trope, and the heavy prominence of game mechanics references in relationship to, well, relationships and everyday life.These two managed to work well on me, even as I\'m one who generally hates misunderstanding tropes and usually only mildly likes gaming references.What pushes this show into entertainment and why it works so well...is the level of effort put into both the references and the misunderstandings themselves. The five main characters form a complex web of their own perceptions about what\'s supposedly really going on with everyone else. Characters that don\'t realize what kind of situation they\'re in perfectly understanding when one of their friends is bumbling up. It feels very true to life in that aspect, as each dumb teen is only perceptive enough to figure out one thing going on at a time and that\'s it. One of them even constantly tries to get the others into situations where they can talk it up only for the misunderstandings to pile up. All of this culminates in the sixth (and quite possibly best) episode, where the set-up and eventually pay-off is honestly good enough to stand on its own in a lot of ways.The other thing this show thrives on is its gaming references, which are clock-full in each episode. Rarely do they feel cheap or shoehorned in either, some even being quite subtly (took me about four episodes until ""Karen Tendo"" really set in) and others are used to build whole episodes out of, like in Karen\'s episode or most of Amano\'s. They go all out with the sound effects and the ""gameplay"" of the games in-universe, to the point that most of them feel like they could be real games. All this extra effort really shows and makes the games and characters feel more alive because of it.Obviously, though, the series isn\'t perfect, and I think a large portion of that rests on the second half of the series. The first half is the perfect string of misunderstandings that were relatable and that connected with the viewer while the second half...fails to use all of them properly. The series doesn\'t even try to end on any conclusive note, although I don\'t think it necessarily needs to, it does use a few episodes in the second half to set up a conflict it never resolves it in-universe and personally it feels like we\'re getting at least a little cheated out of the possibilities of that one storyline.Overall, even though because of technical and story limitations in the end, I still highly recommend this show to people who are tired of stupid misunderstanding tropes and good rom-coms with a hint of gaming for extra flavor.~Howl is the level of effort put into both the references and the misunderstandings themselves.

First is the people create hype about what are they going to see, they expect a different anime. And that's because it sounds (and actually starts) as an interesting premise of modern gaming and a club of pro gamers. That would get the attention of a lot of different people, and a lot of them will find themselves disappointed about the actual premise of the series: a romance comedy with a small touch about videogames.After saying that, let's start with the actual review.STORY...-    7The story as a romance comedy is not outstanding, but it does the job.ART    -    8The art is really well done, and the reactions in the faces of the characters are great too.SOUND    -    8The music is good, it has some nice touches of videogame music here and there.CHARACTER    -    6The series follow 5 characters, which form a romantic triangle and a couple that doesn't quite trust each other but still like the other. The small difference with other series is that the majority of the characters are gamers that love games in their own way. This is something that could have been done better, in my opinion their personalities could have more work.ENJOYMENT    -    10As usual it has the typical misunderstandings between the characters, this is the point that could be the reason of the love or the hate for the series. The misunderstandings are insane, they are really crazy, and the way the characters react make it really funny, by them being unable of clearing the misunderstandings as normal people, and talking but taking conclusions from what they see. This is the second reason why people might wont like the series, but for me it just adds to the charms, it's so irreal it's amazing, I love it!OVERALL    -    9For me this series are a good example that if the parts aren't that great, in the end, what matters is the final product. The enjoyment I have for this series might be a little bit to high, but I cant do nothing about it, I love it! =D, every new chapter made me laugh and it made my day, and that's not something everything does.

They move the ""plot"" forward, and in a pretty funny way.And actually, Misunderstanding the anime is also the best...half, since the short time didn\'t let the series grow into a concrete conclusion, giving the last episodes a much different tone.The op and eds are great, all songs and animations are pretty good.Overall, it is a fun time, a real fun time, with some of the best comedy writing of thoughts I\'ve ever seen, some great episodes, a decline on the end, and a big hope on getting a second season.Not so big, its impossible.Edited on December 2018 half, since the short time didn\'t let the series grow into a concrete conclusion, giving the last episodes a much different tone.The op and eds are great, all songs and animations are pretty good.Overall, it is a fun time, a real fun time, with some of the best comedy writing of thoughts I\'ve ever seen, some great episodes, a decline on the end, and a big hope on getting a second season.Not so big, its impossible.Edited on December 2018', ""This anime is really entertaining to watch.It's not that great in any of the department that you would usually rate an anime on.The reason it's so fun to watch is because of the character interactions and the hilarious misunderstandings!If you want to be entertained give it a shot it pretty cool.It gives me a similar feeling to watching toradora! event tho it's different....Also the title of the show is a misunderstanding, it should be called Misunderstanding instead of gamers.Really video games in this show is just a gimmick the show isn't really about the games but about the interactions between the people who play games.

It’s a RomCom SOL series where the conflicts and problems never stop. Once one problem gets solved, another one rises up. Sure it can get frustrated, but that’s what this anime is, which is an anime full of conflicts.To me, I fairly enjoyed the anime not as a story driven series with amazing plot, but for the characters themselves....Interestingly enough, I love each character. I love their personality and they way they interact with one another. So much chemistry is present when some talk to each that it’s genuinely a good friendship. The only reason I might find them annoying is because they’re put into a misunderstanding situation.  One thing I don’t like though is how Karen become sort of...non present in the series. She hasn’t gotten as much shine as I wanted her to. She seemed like a main character at the beginning. But after things were said and done, she practically became a non-existent side character. Even with that short amount of time I felt like she was still an ok developed character.The Romance is lacking as it should be considering this was mostly a Comedy. It's not like the Romance was supposedly a big thing. But the vibe is still there.The music wasn't anything too special, but I enjoyed the OP and ED a lot. The insert songs are pretty great and the appropriate usage of some of the soundtracks make it all the more enjoyable.The art and animation isn't much. I do enjoy the character design and the animation is fair enough to enjoy it as much as I did. It isn't great nor is it “bad”. But it was at the acceptable level that I was fine with it.The main focus like I said is on misunderstandings involving our characters. I understand that it might get annoying at some points and will leave u just at a blank face, but I for one didn't find it all too annoying or just troublesome.Overall, Gamers is definitely not a show for everyone. It really will piss some people off and that's understandable. If you want something Romance focused, you can watch this, but don't come in with high expectations regarding that topic. However, if u want a lot of misunderstandings and comedy along with it, this series may be for you. Gamers don't really focus on the Gaming aspect at the end of it all, more like the people behind the controller and their daily lives regarding love and conflicts.

What appears to be an anime about video games for the first episode or two quickly devolves into a dialogue-heavy comedy with lacklustre jokes.Nearly all of the intended humour is based on misunderstandings and awkward situations. By the fifth episode, it falls completely flat. It's simply not funny 95% of the time. The animation is fine, but there isn't much to animate. Most of the show is just dialogue to set up the unfunny jokes. A large portion of that dialogue is shouting.The characters are completely unlikeable. It may be possible to forgive the fact that they are completely...one-dimensional, but the fact that they are annoying is not acceptable. If I were to refer to the loud and annoying character, you would have trouble discerning to which one I was referring. one-dimensional, but the fact that they are annoying is not acceptable.

And despite their overall outgoing personalities and privileged social standing, not one of them ever manages to work up the guts to ask the others what\'s really going on.That\'s pretty much all there is to it. Seriously.Firstly, gaming has absolutely nothing to do with anything except a premise for how these people meet. That\'s not a huge deal, except the anime makes it out to be otherwise, so it\'s blatantly misleading.The first two episodes were relatively enjoyable; it...sets up some interesting or somewhat unique choices in animation, and some of the characters didn\'t turn out to be who I was expecting them to be. With that said, later episodes drag each and every character through the mud, to the point it\'s physically painful to watch.The anime rests entirely on the premise of five people--three of whom are *explicitly* made out to be extremely skilled in navigating social situations--being completely and utterly unable to communicate with one another. On top of that massively flawed premise, each and every scene was incredibly predictable, and not in the ""familiarly reassuring"" sense.

Noone knows what\'s actually going on and even if they are concerned about a misunderstanding that could easily be cleared up with words they just don\'t even bother to clear it up. It\'s honestly so frustrating to the point that you just pray every week that the confusion gets cleared up somehow. But it doesn\'t IT JUST F**k**G continues and even gets worse when they throw in another character. You\'d think oh it\'s fine it looks like misunderstandings are ending in episode 8 but as sooooon as episode 9 roles in oh boy, u guessed wrong.For the actual ""Gamers"" theme, Just a little bit of it is provided in each episode. It\'s mostly used to set up the plot, this and this happened because of games. That\'s itAlso i need to mention one thing and that is the filler episode (episode 4). They released it after the cliffhanger of episode 3 so I\'m not at all sure why they did it. That episode had nothing important (so far) to the ""plot"" of the story. It was cute seeing the MC and the heroine together but it only leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth instead of being happy that they are spending time with each other. I wouldn\'t call it pointless character development but badly placed character developmentAs the series progresses you can see that the writer is clearly out of creative juices. If he messes up on one or 2 episodes then it\'s fine but so far it seems like this series is a goner. Not likely that you can save a series this f*cked when you only have 3 episodes left.As much as i\'d like to like this series, i just can\'t. It had potential.

Chiaki at first mainly becomes a rival to Amano when it comes to gaming opinions, but she becomes a much more interesting character when she discover\'s he is her secret playmate on a game they play and seeing her trying to decide whether she should go after him was an interesting development for her character.Tasuku Uehara is someone who used to be like Amano till he changed his ways, in some ways he is a bit of a schemer since he tries to help out Amano and Chiaki from time to time, which tend to backfire on him as it makes his girlfriend suspicious, yet somehow he still manages to get himself out of the situation.....well mostly.Aguri is Tasuku\'s girlfriend, she was a surprising character, because despite being the jealous and worried type she really makes a lot of good points throughout the show making her seem like the smartest one there even though she\'s just basing everything off her love for Tasuku, but I feel like her role in all of this wasn\'t really that much, other than helping Amano and making the love shape situation even bigger.Konoha Hoshinomori is Chiaki\'s sister, despite being introduced later on in the show, Konoha was pretty damn funny, ranging from her uncontrollable sexual desire to play erotic girl games to having a Tsundere personality made her a ball of laughter to have around despite her short screentime.Art (6/10)The art style wasn\'t exactly mesmerising, the characters design\'s were ok I guess, I think the only thing that stood out for me was the recreations of games in the anime itself which were pretty good recreations if I\'m being honest, but other than that it felt like another generic looking anime.Sound (7/10)I\'ll give the op credit for feeling like the show is about gaming, which it really isn\'t in most cases and it was pretty catchy, but the ed didn\'t do much for me and I can barely remember the soundtrack so yeah, at least the op was alright.Extras:The romance in this series was pretty much the forefront of it all, because for an anime that has Gamers in it there would be a gaming genre in there, but no instead it decides to be a Romance and even then it was a confusing one, because all of the characters keep having suspicions about each other forming one big love shape, until one of the characters confesses his feelings and then the situation changed, however at the same time it didn\'t, the characters still had doubts about each other and it just made the show a little annoying to watch until it was all finally worked out well apart from a few things.I thought the comedy was hit and miss, sure there were some surprises and Konoha was absolutely hilarious alongside Karen who\'s character surprised me a little, but most of the jokes were revolved around the whole love shape, so some of the jokes just didn\'t stick with me and felt off.Enjoyment (7/10)Overall (7/10)Overall despite the awkward romance situation and lack of gaming in general, this show still had some good points and had me watching till the end, however I don\'t really want another season of this even though there is still some things that haven\'t been concluded yet. show, which is that it concentrated on gaming and this was nice to see as different people were playing together showing the different opinions they had on games in general.However the whole gaming part of the story is quickly brushed aside and the whole show turns into a love shape of epic proportions, I mean for a good number of episodes everyone was confused who had feelings for who even to the point where it confused the hell outta me.Then the halfway episode came and the situation changed as Amano and Karen became a couple, which made the next few episodes fun as we saw them connect and became more comfortable with each other.Suddenly all that is just blown away as the love shape forms again making the show become stupid again and it made me think ""How did we get back to this point?"", ok true one of the characters had discovered something that changed their feelings for someone, which made sense except some of the other characters who were still on edge about the previous situation and I just thought enough with this bullsh*t, luckily it fixed itself in the end, well except for one character which might lead to a season 2.The final episode however did bring back some interesting joy for the show, mainly because the characters were actually talking about games and the gaming industry in general.Characters (7/10)Now the characters of this show were not particularly bad, they were quite likeable, the only problem is that they seemed quite forgettable at the same time.Keita Amano is the male MC and for a nerdy type he is actually quite complex, I was surprised by some of the things he said or did which made him a likeable character, yet some of those decisions were a bit stupid too, since Amano likes to really overthink things, but this was mainly to help out his friends over himself.Karen Tendou is the female MC and is the leader of the newly formed gaming club, despite being the most popular girl in the school and I really like how the show changes the whole popular girl type with Karen, because usually these type of characters are either a massive bit*h, a massive Tsundere or they have a God complex, Karen is none of these and is actually a very sweet, awkward and funny girl , plus it was interesting seeing how her affection for Amano started change her way of life.Chiaki Hoshinomori was probably my favourite character out of the bunch, despite being a bit of a hothead she creates games which is something I can respect and she seemed like an interesting person to have a conversation with, plus she can actually be pretty cute when she does something awkward. Chiaki at first mainly becomes a rival to Amano when it comes to gaming opinions, but she becomes a much more interesting character when she discover\'s he is her secret playmate on a game they play and seeing her trying to decide whether she should go after him was an interesting development for her character.Tasuku Uehara is someone who used to be like Amano till he changed his ways, in some ways he is a bit of a schemer since he tries to help out Amano and Chiaki from time to time, which tend to backfire on him as it makes his girlfriend suspicious, yet somehow he still manages to get himself out of the situation.....well mostly.Aguri is Tasuku\'s girlfriend, she was a surprising character, because despite being the jealous and worried type she really makes a lot of good points throughout the show making her seem like the smartest one there even though she\'s just basing everything off her love for Tasuku, but I feel like her role in all of this wasn\'t really that much, other than helping Amano and making the love shape situation even bigger.Konoha Hoshinomori is Chiaki\'s sister, despite being introduced later on in the show, Konoha was pretty damn funny, ranging from her uncontrollable sexual desire to play erotic girl games to having a Tsundere personality made her a ball of laughter to have around despite her short screentime.Art (6/10)The art style wasn\'t exactly mesmerising, the characters design\'s were ok I guess, I think the only thing that stood out for me was the recreations of games in the anime itself which were pretty good recreations if I\'m being honest, but other than that it felt like another generic looking anime.Sound (7/10)I\'ll give the op credit for feeling like the show is about gaming, which it really isn\'t in most cases and it was pretty catchy, but the ed didn\'t do much for me and I can barely remember the soundtrack so yeah, at least the op was alright.Extras:The romance in this series was pretty much the forefront of it all, because for an anime that has Gamers in it there would be a gaming genre in there, but no instead it decides to be a Romance and even then it was a confusing one, because all of the characters keep having suspicions about each other forming one big love shape, until one of the characters confesses his feelings and then the situation changed, however at the same time it didn\'t, the characters still had doubts about each other and it just made the show a little annoying to watch until it was all finally worked out well apart from a few things.I thought the comedy was hit and miss, sure there were some surprises and Konoha was absolutely hilarious alongside Karen who\'s character surprised me a little, but most of the jokes were revolved around the whole love shape, so some of the jokes just didn\'t stick with me and felt off.Enjoyment (7/10)Overall (7/10)Overall despite the awkward romance situation and lack of gaming in general, this show still had some good points and had me watching till the end, however I don\'t really want another season of this even though there is still some things that haven\'t been concluded yet.', ""First at all, you have to know it's not show about gamers...

Nothing about this anime really stood out to me, and I wouldn't call it a memorable one whatsoever. It definitely did have its moments though, and was entertaining most of the time.The plot revolves around Amano, your generic everyday guy who is, as the title of the anime suggests, a gamer. One day, while he's searching through the isles and looking at one of his beloved dating sims, Karen Tendou,...the typical popular and well-loved student in his school, confronts him. She find out he's a gamer and feels obliged to ask him to join the game club. After visiting the game club and trying it out for a day, Amano decides not to join, as he thinks that the game club is not fit for him. The following events are consequences of that action, as Tendou gets to know him more and develops a huge crush on him and we're introduced to new characters along the way.Some plot devices were far too overused which let them lose their charm a bit. The pacing was also a tad too fast yet slow for my liking, which is kind of hard to explain, but twelve episodes isn't enough to be well paced for most shows, and unfortunately Gamers! was one of them.The characters were pretty fun. Each one was their own individual and had their own unique characteristics, thankfully. Many shows tend to have the same character a thousand times but with a different physical appearance each time, and Gamers! wasn't one of them. I wouldn't say there was much character development, if any at all. The characters were a nice aspect of the anime.The visuals were okay, nothing special. The art and animation were weird and messed up at times, but they were good enough in general. To be honest, the comedic facial expressions were the best part in the animation in my opinion, because they did what they intended to do, which was being simply hilarious. Not the worst animation ever, but definitely could've been a lot better.Sounds are usually what these kinds of shows use to help them shine a little more, but the sounds in Gamers! were the same as everything else, normal. The opening theme was quite catchy though, and I found myself listening to the whole thing in most episodes. The rest was average, or at least nothing in it really appealed to me. I watched this anime dubbed so I can't really say anything about the voice acting, but the dub was adequate.I did enjoy watching Gamers! for sure, and I also learned a little about gaming, because I myself am not a gamer and I have no knowledge about gaming whatsoever, so I guess it did help a bit.

It's the type of factors that I look for in a cheery anime. It's also precisely the reason why I felt pretty frustrated watching Gamers!, like what a programmer would feel trying to fix an annoying bug among hundreds or thousands of lines of codes.The story is basically a hit-or-miss and fluctuated at each differing episode. Having gamers as the main characters with a story of relationship dramas revolving around misunderstandings and teen insecurities is the summary....Glitchy I'd say. While it seemed to be a clichéd premise, for mindless rom-coms like Gamers!, it could had worked better if not for the contrived attempt in delivering humor, an integral part in the heart of what every rom-coms should successfully offer to the audience. So, what comes out of these failed running gags that didn't appeal much to me? It's the stupidity of the characters. It can be an entertaining element but that depends on the episode's plot. One episode had me laughing to tears while the others had me facepalming myself. The reasonings on their actions were random, which seemed like it's what the creators were trying to achieve but at least try to make it feel more natural or creative because they won't come across as fun baka characters. Other than that, I did actually adored some of their other ridiculous personalities leaving their stupidness aside. Combined together, they were quite an appealing cast, even sweet at times when games came into play. Them playing and talking about the games together, such as the culture, were pretty fun to watch and reminded me of my younger days when I was still a competitive gamer. Sadly, the given time slot didn't deliver a balanced story, focusing more on their acts of haphazard interpretations in their romance life. But the games and a couple of hilarious moments, which I admit did stemmed from their dumbness, were definitely the most enjoyable factor of this anime.The visuals didn't suffered much compared to the previous aspects. Some shots had a clumsy feel to it, particularly in the line work, but it didn't take away much from the main tone. Using a colorful setting engaged the silliness of this anime which it managed to portray. As for the character expressions, it said a lot about their personalities so what I felt about them can be traced back to the writing. For the most part, they were cute but depending on the scene, they were quite irritating too. In the most amusing scenes, the way they expressed their comical reactions had a strong impact on making me laugh. Colorfulness also blended in with the character designs too, and most of them boast an outer look in the side of attractiveness. Their exaggerative actions were livened up by the animation, which was not in the level of a masterpiece but not too shoddy either as it worked with the tone of the anime. I also liked the other bits of pieces that stood the anime out slightly more such as the use of game-like sound effects, making everything more fun. The text pop-ups that appeared occasionally also molded in a bouncy atmosphere. While the loud voice-acting did fit the aura of the characters, it's a sometimes situation of getting on my nerves and being an entertainment. Music-wise, the upbeat soundtracks matched the energetic nature, along with the complementary quality of the catchy OP and EDs.Gamers! was a rollercoaster ride that was too bumpy to really get any satisfying enjoyment. By no means is it a horrible show but it's a weird one as I can be fully enjoying at one moment but completely be irked by some other scene. Well, this adventure was an interesting one but I'll go and turn off my gaming device for now. It's game over after all. Glitchy I'd say.

My least favorite thing about the story is how heavily it relies on lies and misunderstandings in order to further the plot. Misunderstandings I can tolerate to a certain degree, and in some situations in the show (around the middle) it causes some pretty hilarious happenings.I loved Keita's rejection of joining the...gamers club, especially after they really set it up as if that's where the series was going by introducing all the characters and giving them enough character to make them feel important. They aren't important to the main story, but it's nice seeing them when it occasionally cuts to Tendou in the game room.My biggest issue with the plot is the lack of resolution, in the end very little is wrapped up well.Art - 7:Well animated, certainly looks like an anime made in 2017, but aside from being clean it doesn't have much else going for it.Sound - 5:This is mostly because I don't remember much of what the sound was like, I'll probably have a better idea when the OST is released.Character - 7:Because it's a rom-com, there is heavy focus on the characters, and all of them are enjoyable people. I would rate this a 10, but the one thing I hate that they're almost all guilty of is the insane jealousy they so blatantly show. The show tries to play this up for laughs, but personally I don't think a character getting mad at someone else for being nice to them is all that funny.Enjoyment - 7:If my enjoyment of this series was on a graph start steady, go up in the middle, then fall below where it started at the end. gamers club, especially after they really set it up as if that's where the series was going by introducing all the characters and giving them enough character to make them feel important.

It turns out, the only right thing from that bait is the last word - gamers. While it does not actually involve an actual club, the characters featured in the show are still gamers to their core with differing values. So what is the show actually about?Gamers!...is perhaps the best conventional modern romcom anime. When I say conventional, I mean that it does not break away from the cliches and tropes of the genre. People may misunderstand and think this show is a parody, when in fact it is the exact opposite. This show embraces these generic elements and instead gives them a place where they could shine best. Unlike other shows, cliches - particularly misunderstandings - are not used as a convenience for the plot to be able to move. Instead, it IS the plot itself. As someone who is a massive fan of romcom, it reassures me to know that the writer knows and is aware of these developments that are often found in romcom, and that he seeks to make them as reasonable, logical, and most importantly fun as they could possibly be. Unlike other prominent romcom shows, it does not break away from its mold, instead it seeks to be the very best version of it.This requires a certain amount of awareness that the usual romcom fan would have for it to be enjoyed to its fullest. I have to admit, as someone who enjoys romcom, that I am in fact stupid - just self aware unlike most others. I recognize that this genre is filled with trashy shows but I still do want them to be good despite that. And Gamers! is exactly that one show that knows what it's doing. It takes elements that this genre has degraded to the ground and presented them in full capacity.Unfortunately for this show, the beauty in its writing is not appreciated well enough by the majority. It is quite ironic that a show about misunderstandings is also misunderstood by its viewers. This show is a love letter to romcom, and to romcom fans. Anyone who tries to look for anything more than that is missing the point and is bound to be disappointed. Gamers! portray all the good parts a romcom could ever have, and it's a shame that it will not get the recognition it deserves because they decided it would be funny to also let the viewers misunderstand.With all that said, as close as this show is to being perfect, there are still some flaws I have to address. The biggest one of which is in the character that is Konoha. She was introduced in the best manner possible in the show. And then, she got reduced to a plot device. They were so many things they could've done with her, and it almost hurts that they let that all go to waste. From what I know, this is a problem on the anime's side as part of episode 11 seems to have been anime only. I am currently reading the source at a slow pace though, and from what I can tell, the anime has been handled perfectly; or at the very least, the early parts of it. The later arcs seems to have suffered a little bit perhaps due to time constraints or for whatever reason that might've been the case. With that said, it was still extremely good, it was just not as perfect as it could've been.The ending was great. It's sad that it flew over most people's head. It is one of the most unique episodes in romcom. I feel a bit wronged that people did not understand the show for what it was, but there's not much I can do unfortunately. I've already written for too long, this is more or less my thoughts on this show. A shame that I couldn't give it a 10, but that only means I can still hope a better romcom will show up eventually in the future. is perhaps the best conventional modern romcom anime.

The jokes are funny, even if they tend to repeat themselves (kinda gets old after the eighth episode). However, the ""plot twist"" around episode 8 ""restarts"" the story and that is what kept me going to the end of it. So I rate it 6.Art : Flashy colors and overall good animations.

Sounds familiar, right?Though this anime tends to follow a lot of the typical tropes for this kind of anime quite rigidly, it also does a few things differently. For starters, the focus of this anime's love plot is not just on the protagonist, but on his friend as well. Typically in a romcom you have a simple love triangle. This anime cranks up the absurdity and creates a love-pentagon between the 5 main characters (though most of the time it's just a misunderstanding rather...than actual love, but still). The love pentagon tends to create some funny situations and I think they did a great job of getting comedic content out of it.In terms of plot, there's basically none. This is an anime focused on the characters and nothing more. Anything plot-related will come from character development and drama between the characters.The protagonist, Keita, is your typical romcom protagonist. He's a fairly drab character with zero emotional intelligence and a burning passion for gaming. This of course leads to him getting into plenty of romantic mishaps. His friend, Tasuka, is the more level-headed person. The female characters tend to be sort of one-dimensional and forgettable.The art and sound was average. Nothing super but nothing terrible.I have a couple of complaints. One would be the overabundance of misunderstandings between the characters. It tended to be overdone a bit at times. In smaller doses I would have been fine with it but it reaches a point where it gets a tad too obnoxious for my tastes. There are also scenes where the characters will drone on and on about the virtues of video gaming almost like they are giving a sermon. It's weird and doesn't feel like something a normal person would actually say. During those scenes I tended to zone out, it feels like the writers just needed some sort of filler to kill time so they used that as a crutch when they needed it.I give props to the writers for making the love triangle stuff a little bit more interesting (and actually committing to allowing characters to actually confess their love). The comedy is rather well done at times as well.Overall, Gamers! is a pretty standard otaku romcom with a side of drama that has a good sense of humor and some interesting writing.

Seeing the first couple of episodes i was expecting to be more gaming stuff, but the twist on the story and how the characters relate each other make me stay. Frankly this isn\'t a ""gamer"" show but more like a ""romance"" one?....I think is that.A group of students who wants to make a gamer club on their school finally get involved in different love struggles between them, not the craziest premise but it develops really well.And of course there is a lot of references to games, i personally loved the Tales of Phantasia one.I reccomend it, it\'s fun, relaxing, and i would say rewarding.One came for the games and stayed for the plot and characters, well done Gamers!, well done..

This anime in specific just feels better enjoyed together, it's still nice to watch alone though!"", 'A considerable amount of opinions regarding Gamers!, especially in the reviews here, come from people who didn\'t even paid attention to what the anime actually tried to do, and therefore criticize it for expectations that were never given in first place. It\'s a low and not so smart move if you ask me. The main subject in Gamers!, as is shown multiple times, is: MISUNDERSTANDING. The very first scene proves this. Also, it\'s a lie that the anime was meant to, firstly, talk about games. The story\'s subject are the GAMERS, not games. But before we get any further in this idea, let\'s start with...one of the keys to understand the anime: the characters.At first, have Keita Amano. Even though he has a standard decent look, he is an insecure, quiet and reclusive gamer. Amano is passionate about gaming, and even puts it above interpersonal relationships, as is shown initially. His main goal with games is only to have fun, and therefore he doesn\'t really give value to competitions. Keita is also very self conscious of who he is, he knows about his insecurity and fear of socializing, and above all he knows that games can look like a waste of time. With this in mind, Keita wants to change. He wants to be outgoing, even though his passion for games makes this objective difficult, and distracts him from people around; however, again, he is self conscious about it. Amano is not perfect, and the anime shows this all the time, especially when he gets impulsive in order do defend his main and loved hobbie. He plays under two alias: Tsucchie and Yama (both kanjis of his mother\'s single surname).The second character, and my favourite, is Karen Tendou. She is pretty, and the madonna of the Otobuki High School. She receives thousand of love letters in her school cabinet every day. But, even with all the attention and spotlight, she is humble, and gives value to the inner of human, therefore Karen never judges the students, and greets all of them at school; even with all the respect and admiration towards her. Also, always helps the teachers with their materials. However, like Keita, Tendou is also a gamer, but she somehow conciliates her hobbie with her social life and studies. She also becomes easily distraught when the subject is love, and, like Keita, Tendou initially doesn\'t know her true potential, doubting of her positive qualities. Karen is the president of the gaming club, and takes part in it secretly. The main goal of the club is to improve as gamers, and initially there are other three characters, and senpais, along with her: Niina Oiso, Gakuto Kase and Main Fushiguro, with a fourth, Eiichi Misumi, joining them later in the final parts of the first episode.The third character is Chiaki Hoshinomori. She is, initially, a solitary gamer, antisocial and also gives more value to fun over competitions, just like Keita. In her first appearance, she has a somber atmosphere and her hair almost covers her face, and that, generated by lack of self esteem, disguises her beauty. It is shown later, when she changed her looks, that she develops games, under the alias of ""Nobe"", and plays using another nickname: ""Mono"" (both kanjis are from her mother\'s single surname). Initially, she started to develop games as a hobbie, but when online users started to bash her games, she felt insecure about them. However, a certain user called ""Tsucchie"" encouraged her to keep her work (neither Chiaki nor Keita were aware of their online identities initially).The fourth character is Tasuku Uehara, a good looking and socially famous student. However, deep inside Tasuku holds insecurities about his past days a nerd, and tries to achieve a ""perfect school life"" (girlfriend, friends and general acceptance).He is also a gamer, but his situation is class is the opposite of Keita, who Uehara looks down mentally. It is shown in the story that he initially did this because he saw himself in Keita, and this feeling turns into a positive one, after episode 2. Even though Uehara is what would be called a ""normie"" (a term he hates to be called, as is shown in his conversation with Keita), Tasuku believes in his first appearance that his girlfriend, Aguri, is with him just for the looks, but that turns out to be a lie later, as she was in love with him since his nerd times.The fifth character is Aguri Sakurano. She is a happy, beautiful, cute and at times absent minded student (but is proved later that she pretended to be like this, in order to be accepted by Tasuku). Aguri was, in her first school years, a shy nerd. However, unlike the other characters, she was never a gamer. She always goes with Tasuku to the arcade, and tends to ask him to pick up dolls from the claw crane. Sakurano sees her nerd days in Chiaki; like Tasuku, she wants to break from her past, and be accepted socially. Aguri is insecure, and, initially, has an emotional dependency towards Tasuku. She then breaks from her fears when involves with the club, especially when a friend of hers, Sarina, says that she will always be an antissocial, and Sakurano thanks her for the words.And at last, but not least, we have the sixth and recurring character: Konoha Hoshinomori. She is Chiaki\'s sister and the president of the students council, and was always perfect at school, from grades to behaviour. Nevertheless, Karen took her place due to her good fame. Even though Konoha has a unbreakable image to take care, she holds a secret passion for eroge games, which she always hides from Chiaki.These are the characters from Gamers!; they have complexity, and also so much to tell, so I had to say as many things as I could. As it is shown, besides their hobbies, they all have their flaws and insecurities. And the anime ALWAYS makes sure to show them, especially the latter. Now, let\'s move to another important part: the plot.The story starts with a term I mentioned previously: misunderstanding. In the first scene, we have Keita and Karen looking to one another in a class break. All the students are staring at them, since the idol of the school is involved. Tendou asked Amano to join the Gamers Club, to which he said that wasn\'t interested in competitions. It was her second time proposing, the first being her presentation of the club, and its members, and the second being rejected again in front of the class. After this situation, the students understand as if Amano rejected Karen romantically, even though that was never the case. His reason, as shown later, is because of his principles of having fun beyond competition, and it\'s revealed that Chiaki was also invited, but rejected the offer for the same reason. However, they both would like to know Tendou\'s ideas about competition better, and even want to become friends with her. After some time, Tendou gets interested in Keita, who has a crush on her, but doesn\'t believe somebody like her would ever fall in love with him. Eventually, they start dating, and their first destiny as a couple is the bowling and gaming alley, in episode 7. Her reasons for interest were due to their passion in common for games, and due to the fact that he defended her and the Game Club in a energetic conversation with Tasuku.I like that the misunderstandings evolve little by little. At first, they start in class, but eventually they take the mind of the main characters. Their paranoias regarding one another show their preconceived ideas falling apart, one by one. Aguri is worried about a """"""possible"""""" affair between Chiaki and Tasuku (lots of quote marks here); Tasuku thinks that Aguri and Keita are dating in secret at a local cafe; Keita has the ""obvious"" conception that Karen fell in love with Tasuku; Karen holds the idea that Chiaki and Keita are also dating (even though Tasuku had the intention of making Keita feel more comfortable around gaming girls, in order to make friends with not only Chiaki, but with the main goal: Karen herself); and finally, Chiaki believes that Tasuku and Keita were together, due to a misunderstanding: both students were having a conversation about their own paranoias towards the girls; Konoha supports Chiaki to take part in the gamers group, and also pretends to bring her sister and Keita together by any means, in part because of Karen\'s accomplishments and perfect image in school.Gamers! shows that communication is an easy action, but when the parts involved are blinded by confusion and precipitation, it becomes nearly impossible. And it is brilliant when showing how this issue can grow in exponential heights. The anime always breaks with the conceptions we have about the characters, and shows that, before being gamers, students, friends and game club members, they are humans. In this task, Gamers! excels perfectly, fulfilling its goal.The characters grow emotionally, and develop through the storyline. Keita starts to give more value to his friends and girlfriend, Karen, over gaming. He even forgets about the pre sale of a game called Space Ocean 2. When he tried to purchase it at the very day, he prefered to give emotional support to Aguri, in a sudden moment of misunderstanding and vulnerability of hers. They become siblings emotionally, as she says in several times. Chiaki\'s issues with Keita regarding differences of opinions change, evolving into a feeling of admiration and respect as a rival. She wasn\'t able to tell him about her being Mono and Nobe, both Keita\'s favorite game developer and best online friend; however, the anime shows that eventually, she will be ready to tell. Not only due to him, but also because of Konoha\'s support and friendship. Karen starts to give more value to fun and entertainment as gamer, after meeting Keita, who also begins to value the competition side. Although she still has preference for competitions, Amano respects her views, and even says that this is what he likes in her the most. Tasuku and Aguri learn to let the past go, but never try to hide who they are; whether they enjoy games of are secretly nerds, what really matters is their feelings towards it, above everybody else.To show people\'s will to grow, their flaws, insecurities and their love in common: THIS is where the beauty of Gamers! shines.Regarding sound, I really liked the main theme ""Gamers!"", the scenes and song atmosphere are perfect to the concept of \'games with friends\'. It is a powerful opening in many ways, and the game sfx fit well to the verses. ""Fight On"" and ""Koi No Prologue"" are two sweet themes, depicting the three main female characters. They are beautiful, and gave me the feeling of wanting more of the anime; like it wasn\'t a farewell. That said, I\'d really like a second season in a near future.The animation is pretty good, the colors are very lively, and the design of the characters are well done. They are not necessarily complex, but pleasing enough.A last idea: I think it would be better to fit episode 12, the one about the meaning of games, as an OVA. It makes more sense as an extra, since the amusement park date (episode 11) is perfect as the season finale.So, generally, this is how deep and complex this beautiful and fun story is. All in all, Gamers! is a genuine masterpiece, that was severally misunderstood through the years (what an irony). I rewatched this anime today, in a sunday. To be honest, I didn\'t even pretend to watch everything at once, let alone write a review now xDI felt the need to write a proper ""scanning"" of the characters background, as a carefully written and deserved review, since Gamers! deserves it. By the way, I plan to read the light novel soon, it looks as amazing as the adaptation.Thank you for reading this far, hope you enjoyed. And I hope I gave you the will to watch or rewatch this masterpiece, in order to take these points into consideration. Have a great day. one of the keys to understand the anime: the characters.At first, have Keita Amano. Even though he has a standard decent look, he is an insecure, quiet and reclusive gamer.

Aguri was, in her first school years, a shy nerd. However, unlike the other characters, she was never a gamer. She always goes with Tasuku to the arcade, and tends to ask him to pick up dolls from the claw crane. Sakurano sees her nerd days in Chiaki; like Tasuku, she wants to break from her past, and be accepted socially. Aguri is insecure, and, initially, has an emotional dependency towards Tasuku. She then breaks from her fears when involves with the club, especially when a friend of hers, Sarina, says that she will always be an antissocial, and Sakurano thanks her for the words.And at last, but not least, we have the sixth and recurring character: Konoha Hoshinomori. She is Chiaki\'s sister and the president of the students council, and was always perfect at school, from grades to behaviour. Nevertheless, Karen took her place due to her good fame. Even though Konoha has a unbreakable image to take care, she holds a secret passion for eroge games, which she always hides from Chiaki.These are the characters from Gamers!; they have complexity, and also so much to tell, so I had to say as many things as I could. As it is shown, besides their hobbies, they all have their flaws and insecurities. And the anime ALWAYS makes sure to show them, especially the latter. Now, let\'s move to another important part: the plot.The story starts with a term I mentioned previously: misunderstanding. In the first scene, we have Keita and Karen looking to one another in a class break. All the students are staring at them, since the idol of the school is involved. Tendou asked Amano to join the Gamers Club, to which he said that wasn\'t interested in competitions. It was her second time proposing, the first being her presentation of the club, and its members, and the second being rejected again in front of the class. After this situation, the students understand as if Amano rejected Karen romantically, even though that was never the case. His reason, as shown later, is because of his principles of having fun beyond competition, and it\'s revealed that Chiaki was also invited, but rejected the offer for the same reason. However, they both would like to know Tendou\'s ideas about competition better, and even want to become friends with her. After some time, Tendou gets interested in Keita, who has a crush on her, but doesn\'t believe somebody like her would ever fall in love with him. Eventually, they start dating, and their first destiny as a couple is the bowling and gaming alley, in episode 7. Her reasons for interest were due to their passion in common for games, and due to the fact that he defended her and the Game Club in a energetic conversation with Tasuku.I like that the misunderstandings evolve little by little. At first, they start in class, but eventually they take the mind of the main characters. Their paranoias regarding one another show their preconceived ideas falling apart, one by one. Aguri is worried about a """"""possible"""""" affair between Chiaki and Tasuku (lots of quote marks here); Tasuku thinks that Aguri and Keita are dating in secret at a local cafe; Keita has the ""obvious"" conception that Karen fell in love with Tasuku; Karen holds the idea that Chiaki and Keita are also dating (even though Tasuku had the intention of making Keita feel more comfortable around gaming girls, in order to make friends with not only Chiaki, but with the main goal: Karen herself); and finally, Chiaki believes that Tasuku and Keita were together, due to a misunderstanding: both students were having a conversation about their own paranoias towards the girls; Konoha supports Chiaki to take part in the gamers group, and also pretends to bring her sister and Keita together by any means, in part because of Karen\'s accomplishments and perfect image in school.Gamers! shows that communication is an easy action, but when the parts involved are blinded by confusion and precipitation, it becomes nearly impossible. And it is brilliant when showing how this issue can grow in exponential heights. The anime always breaks with the conceptions we have about the characters, and shows that, before being gamers, students, friends and game club members, they are humans. In this task, Gamers! excels perfectly, fulfilling its goal.The characters grow emotionally, and develop through the storyline. Keita starts to give more value to his friends and girlfriend, Karen, over gaming. He even forgets about the pre sale of a game called Space Ocean 2. When he tried to purchase it at the very day, he prefered to give emotional support to Aguri, in a sudden moment of misunderstanding and vulnerability of hers. They become siblings emotionally, as she says in several times. Chiaki\'s issues with Keita regarding differences of opinions change, evolving into a feeling of admiration and respect as a rival. She wasn\'t able to tell him about her being Mono and Nobe, both Keita\'s favorite game developer and best online friend; however, the anime shows that eventually, she will be ready to tell. Not only due to him, but also because of Konoha\'s support and friendship. Karen starts to give more value to fun and entertainment as gamer, after meeting Keita, who also begins to value the competition side. Although she still has preference for competitions, Amano respects her views, and even says that this is what he likes in her the most. Tasuku and Aguri learn to let the past go, but never try to hide who they are; whether they enjoy games of are secretly nerds, what really matters is their feelings towards it, above everybody else.To show people\'s will to grow, their flaws, insecurities and their love in common: THIS is where the beauty of Gamers! shines.Regarding sound, I really liked the main theme ""Gamers!"", the scenes and song atmosphere are perfect to the concept of \'games with friends\'. It is a powerful opening in many ways, and the game sfx fit well to the verses. ""Fight On"" and ""Koi No Prologue"" are two sweet themes, depicting the three main female characters. They are beautiful, and gave me the feeling of wanting more of the anime; like it wasn\'t a farewell. That said, I\'d really like a second season in a near future.The animation is pretty good, the colors are very lively, and the design of the characters are well done. They are not necessarily complex, but pleasing enough.A last idea: I think it would be better to fit episode 12, the one about the meaning of games, as an OVA. It makes more sense as an extra, since the amusement park date (episode 11) is perfect as the season finale.So, generally, this is how deep and complex this beautiful and fun story is. All in all, Gamers! is a genuine masterpiece, that was severally misunderstood through the years (what an irony). I rewatched this anime today, in a sunday. To be honest, I didn\'t even pretend to watch everything at once, let alone write a review now xDI felt the need to write a proper ""scanning"" of the characters background, as a carefully written and deserved review, since Gamers! deserves it. By the way, I plan to read the light novel soon, it looks as amazing as the adaptation.Thank you for reading this far, hope you enjoyed. And I hope I gave you the will to watch or rewatch this masterpiece, in order to take these points into consideration. Have a great day.', ""I watched Gamers. Here are my thoughts:Gamers has a serious branding issue, in the sense that the content doesn't match its marketing. This show is like 90% relationship drama, and gaming hobbies are just an excuse to facilitate that. If you go into this expecting gaming-related content, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you like highschool romance and relationship drama, you may be pleasantly surprised by this show. I, very selectively, can enjoy these things, and so my initial pessimism about this anime was pleasantly defied. However, people looking for a show about the gaming hobby will likely have the opposite viewing...experience (and consequently give it a low rating). I should clarify that when I say 'relationship drama' I'm including the many platonic relationships featured in the show as well. Gamers is a show about relationships, not gaming. Of course there are a lot of gaming-related jokes, but what I'm trying to convey is that gaming is not the central focus here – it's just a theme or canvas upon which the actual story is illustrated.The writing of all the various relationships and the ways they intersect is surprisingly intricate and well thought out. However, it takes a while to build the foundation for this, and the writing doesn't start to reveal its true potential in this regard until around midway through the series. The story of Gamers takes a while to really start to deliver, but when it does it's really great. This anime is fairly well directed, and does a good job of exploring and fleshing out each character's perspective. The relationship drama in this is quite well done, regardless of the juvenile mechanics it sometimes involves. Similarly, the characters and their interactions are terrific. The plot and character interaction in this feels very down to earth, lifelike and real. Gamers is an excellent 'highschool social-life simulator'. The entire cast is likeable as well, including the MC who is a super-cute boy – he is so adorable!Character animation in this is sometimes quite sloppy. In fact the visuals in general are lackluster and feel budget-constrained. However, some of the character designs are cute, like the boyish MC, and Aguri with her pink hair and cute accessories, and Chiaki with her tomboyish charm and kelpy hair.The OST is not bad – it enhanced some scenes. There are some cute 8-bit retro-gaming-style tracks. I like the ED song too – it's ultra cute and has a nice melody that was stuck in my head for weeks. I also appreciated the variety among the voice actors in the main cast; every VA sounded distinct and suited their character well.Just FYI, although the penultimate episode was easily one of the best, I found the finale to be a disappointing weaker episode. Also, as expected of an LN adaptation like this, there isn't any closure or finality in terms of relationships.My overall rating: 7/10Although the visual production quality is rough, I really enjoyed Gamers. The character interaction is so real and lifelike. The writing weaves numerous relationships together in an elaborate way, yet the story is coherent and well directed. The entire main cast is cute and likeable, as are their relations with one another. Gamers is a show about relationships and it does a great job of it. It really tickled my emotions. This anime is so cute!If you're interested in a show about gaming, you should watch something else. However, if you like cute relationship drama you should consider watching this. As I said, Gamers is seriously misbranded. On a related counterintuitive note, I actually think a female audience would enjoy this anime, for reasons you can probably infer.I also want to take this opportunity to say that, despite my low expectations for a new studio, with poor animation quality to boot, I am quite impressed with the direction quality of Pine Jam, at least for these 2017 shows – especially in terms of romance. Both Gamers and Just Because completely smoked my (admittedly low) expectations. I see a ton of potential in this studio and look forward to future works. Even though it looks sloppy, it does a great job at what really matters. This studio has induced the butterflies-in-stomach feeling within me multiple times already, and I really want more. experience (and consequently give it a low rating).

I wanted a show about...gamers doing gamer things (you know...hence the title of the show). After seeing so many online personalities praising the show as a well put together drama, I decided to give the show another show. And...I'm very glad that I did.Story: 5/10As I mentioned in my opening, I initially misunderstood what the show was trying to accomplish. Instead of being a show about gamers, it is a show that is fully about the main cast failing at life while also happening to play/talk about games here and there....The show is absolutely a drama and one of the best parts about that is it strays away from being a melodrama. While there are moments you would see in a typical melodrama, the show seems to respect the viewer and not give into easy melodrama tropes.One of the main reasons why I fell back into the show on the second viewing was the pacing. Plot devices are brought up and are (usually) completed in an interesting way without sticking around too long. If I had to list a nuisance though, it would be that the last episode is really episode 11 and that episode 12 is just there to entice people to buy the eventual blu rays (super fanservicy and a disgrace to the show). In fact it was so bad and such a waste of time that I'm docking an entire point because of it. Have your fanservice moments but if you are going to dedicate an entire episode to it (and mind you the last motherfucking episode), fuck you especially since we still have unanswered/unresolved plot lines after the ending.Art/Animations: 6/10The show sports a simple looking art style. The character designs however are really super clever. You can really tell a lot about each of the main characters by the way they are designed. This is amplified in the opening for the show. The layout of the city was also really interesting. I don't know how to fully explain this but this show felt like it really was in a sort of downtown setting unlike a lot of other shows that always seem like they are showing the same buildings in the background over and over again.What really shined in the art department was the quirky, derpy face moments that occurred during comedic moments. There would usually be a moment when a character misunderstands something or just does something stupid and this pop-out areas with derpy faces would fill the screen. It worked pretty well.The animation was actually pretty decent. There really isn't that many high-movement shots but what really struck me in a nice way was just the overall quality control of the animation. I couldn't really tell at any point where “yeah they ran out of time here. Looks worse than the rest of the show”. Now I cannot say that is true for some of the art quality (really takes a nose dive in some scenes) but overall the visual presentation was more than good enough for this anime season.Sound: 6/10Honestly the background music is pretty decent. Seeing how games are somewhat of a focus in this series, the studio did a pretty good job with finding music that fits within that demographic while also not breaking the tone of the scenes. It's more than just throwing some chiptune into a blender, there was some serious thought put into making the songs. Any sort of misc sound design went over my head. There wasn't a lot of moments for them to shine anyways since this is a pretty low-intensity show.VAs did an amazing job. Every VA sounds so into their on-screen characters. Really a super smashing job on that front.Characters: 8.7/10This is the reason to watch the show. If you don't find yourself liking the main characters after the third episode, jump ship my friend. The whole point of the show is to watch these lovable idiots fucking misunderstand like...every situation thrown their way. The way the cast worked with each other was such a joy to see unfold. It's because of this that it is so painful that some things were left unfulfilled and open-ended after the final episode...Overall: 6.4/10You don't even need to say it. Yes that I get that this anime is adapting an on-going series so my points about certain things being left in-the-air is dumb. No, fuck you. I do not care about the source material. The fact that the last episode was wasted (on needless fanservice) and we did not see important things come to a close almost makes me not want to recommend this series to potential watchers. The characters do make the show fun to watch. However, the loose ends will drive you insane. Maybe wait for more to get adapted or immediately switch over to the source material once you finish watching this.Enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall: 6.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

This game club is basically just a room for member to play their favourite game, yes, they played DIFFERENT game in the same room.Instead of calling that club is...a Game club i\'d say that\'s a FREE cyber cafe at school.== If you really want to watch this anime just keep in mind that this is not an anime about gamers life but just another rom-com anime ==Story : 5in the first 3 episodes this anime give you a combination between game and rom-com and that\'s appealing (i was going to give an 9 but..).

The downhill is just obvious.[SPOILER]All the characters became more stupid than Ichika Orimura from Infinite Startos.""Misunderstanding"" became the plot for this anime so called ""GAMERS"", instead of focusing on ""how do I convince Amano join the club?!"" this anime turned out to be another cliche rom-com.The only thing we got from these 5 characters is only misunderstanding. here is list of the character ( game club member are excluded because they have nothing to do with the story AT ALL )A: AmanoT: TendouU: UeharaAg: AguriC: ChiakiTo put it simple:A loves TT loves A(^ these two finally become a couple but it doesn\'t affect on their stupidity)U & Ag coupleC loves AThe misunderstanding:A thought U loves T (even after A & T become a couple)T thought A loves C (even after T & A become a couple)U thought Ag having an affair with A (dude, U & Ag already going out for  half a year and why didn\'t they even solve this problem in their time after school, like seriously)Ag thought U having an affair with CC thought A is being played by Agso it became a circle of misunderstanding and basically that\'s what 4-9 episode are look like :)))))))For people who rate this anime by 8-10, I believe they rate it when only 3 episodes are released. And if they still rate it 8-10 even after episode 8/ 9 and not disturbed by how U & Ag never talking about this problem in their time, then I don\'t know if they even understand what they are watching.If you are in a relationship, you tend to trust to your partner and if anything seems suspicious you can ask everything you wanted to know about her/ him in a positive way ofc.I love rom-com anime but I really can\'t stand with this one.Character: 4Sigh.. this is where the story became boring, generic characters are always fine to me, but this anime definitely have no character development at all.

Well, if you're one of those that believe that love is a game, then it technically is. A very bad example of gamers, but example of gamers nonetheless.'Gamers!' plays out similarly to your every other shounen rom-com, except instead of yakuza bs, you've got gamers bs gimmick. What little positives it has going for it isn't worth sitting through this shitfest for 12 episodes, so I'll just list these minor positives seeing as that way you can just pretend you've seen the show and skip it completely.- It...has relatively decent amount of game references for the type of a show it is. They're not complex, they don't play any part in the actual narrative, they're just sort of there, but it can be fun recognizing them.- You don't have to take it seriously 'cause the show itself doesn't take itself seriously- You can watch first 1-2 episodes and the last, and comfortably say you've actually watched the entire show (I, myself, didn't have such fortune, as I watched it weekly. Damn me!!)Well, now that we've listed out the positives, let's get on with the actual review of this shitfest. 'Gamers!' plays out a lot like parody - considering that it takes cliche, generic settings or plotlines and exaggerates then to nTH degree - but I'm not sure whether it realizes that it's a parody. You see, just because you take a certain scenario and exaggerate it in any way doesn't make it immediately funny. Especially if you take something that was boring and atrocious to begin with. If someone wants to parody and make fun of the classic rom-com misunderstandings plot devices, you DON'T amp them up to fucking heaven. No, no you don't. It's not funny. Trust me, ooh trust me, it's not funny.And what do you get when the greatest problem of the show lies with what literally defines it? Well, you get 'Gamers!'. For the plot to play out the way it did, it was necessary for each and every character to literally be a pre-programmed AI that responds only when certain conditions are met. Say, a boy has a girlfriend. A boy sees his girlfriend with his friend (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people of opposite sex meet up without intention to fuck each other dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). Now, it's only logical for the boy to come out and ask his friend: Oi, you fucking my girl? Obvious, right? Well no, apparently not.Say, you think your boyfriend is cheating on you. After all, you did hear him say some other girl is cute (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people compliment members of opposite sex without intention to fuck them dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). So, what do you do? Well, you talk to him obviously. Ah, no, wait, that's logical thing to do. Better, let's meet up with his friend and do absolutely nothing except whine and complain about it.Look, I can stuff a lot of shit - especially if it's a comedy show - and especially if it's parodying something. But, even inside the fucking parodies, there NEEDS to be a baseline logic. Why the hell do you think that most of the recent spoof movies are hated almost universally? Because it's just a bunch of random shit that's not funny. And, believe it or not, I don't think it was 'Gamers!'s intention to parody anything. Yes, characters occasionally call out the absolute retardation that their situation is. But, BUT, just because you point something out doesn't mean you're parodying it, nor does it mean that it's okay 'cause you pointed it out. No, that shit doesn't work that way.So, the story. Well, from those two prior example you can basically derive the entire story of this shitshow. There are five characters. None of them are capable of this human thing called talking. They all have immensely fucked up and skewed imagination. Let the bullshit commence. Let's not even mention that intervention of god's hand was necessary for any of this shit to even start. It's just... it's just plain fucking nonsense.But don't worry. We've got ourselves an even worse part that the story. No, it's not the overall rating of the show. Well, kind of, but let's ignore that. Let's talk about the characters.We've got five of them. When you first begin the show, they all seem diverse enough; you've got your generic beta-male, your generic hot chick who's interested in him (for the love of me I never figured out why except for 'well, he likes games and so do I that absolutely means I need to fuck him'), then you've got the high-school debut guy, gal(?) airhead, and the fifth wheel. No, she's the fifth fucking wheel. When you dedicate 9 fucking episodes primarily to developing the relationship of other four (even though that 'developing' is kind of pushing it), and then just ignore every other character except for her, I ain't calling her anything other than the fifth wheel.Now, with such diverse cast, you'd think, I mean, YOU'D FUCKING THINK (RIGHT?!) that they all behave differently. RIGHT?! I wish. I wish someone turned psychotic in the early episodes and killed everyone. Ow man would that have been fun. Well, first and foremost, disregard who these characters are. The only time they act IN their character (uh...) is when they're talking. And by that I mean when people are voice acting them. That's all. All five of them - ALL FUCKING FIVE OF THEM - act exactly the same in every situation. Are they all fucking twins but they just haven't realized it yet?!I'd love to say these characters develop and grow on you. I mean, would truly love to say that. It would have meant I at least enjoyed the show partially. But, even if Satan were to set my asshole on fire right this very moment, I couldn't do it. These characters do nothing but run in circles for 12 episodes. If they all looked the same, and had the same voice actor, you wouldn't be able to tell one from another because nothing else defines them, especially after first 2-3 episodes.The boyfriend girlfriend pair should have never started dating. They have 0 chemistry. Fuck, I don't even know why is the girl obsessed with him so much (by the way, that's sort of a theme in this show; you don't really ever know why these girls like these guys so much, they just sorta do and you just sorta have to accept it). They don't trust each other. Fuck that. THEY CAN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. If you're that fucking insecure about being cheated on, ASK. If we were given nothing else about that pink-haired girl, we were shown that she's the proactive type. PROACTIVE TYPES FUCKING ACT. THEY DON'T SULK WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING. And the boyfriend guy, get this. So, at first, the dude just started dating her because, well, fuck, we needed a boyfriend and girlfriend pair but we couldn't think up a reason for them to date. But, don't despair!! He does eventually like her!! Why? Because she liked him back before he became 'hot'. The level of utter nonsense presented here is reaching levels we thought impossible people!! I've seen loves on first sight. I've seen loves because of a single act of kindness. I've seen loves 'just because'. I've seen all kinds of loves in all kinds of stories. But never have I seen someone date someone for a prolonged time, don't give that much shit about them, and then, without any chemistry, without any build-up, without any banter or anything else that quantifies a RELATIONSHIP, not just a romantic one but relationship in general, just fall in love or whatever.Then we have our fifth wheel. I absolutely hate that guy. Oh, wait, He likes my games and he plays games with me. Ooops, did I say hate? I mean I absolutely adore, worship and love that guy!! Just fuck off.Literally the only two characters that are given even a whiff of relationship development are our beta-male and blonde beauty. Hell, when compared with the rest of the shitshow, it actually stands out as something decent. But it's not. Oooh trust me it's not. I don't know why this girl likes this dude. And I don't even know why this dude likes this girl. I mean, I can sort of understand, she's cute and shit, so whatever. I mean, the dude doesn't even know what 'playing games for fun' means, and yet I'm supposed to listen to his spiel whereas he somehow convinces this chick that he's right? Fuck off with that nonsense.In the end, 'Gamers!' is anything except what its name suggests. It's an attempt at parody (I hope, I HOPE TO GOD IT'S AN ACTUAL ATTEMPT AT PARODY) that doesn't understand how to parody something so basic. It's like that retarded dog of yours that keeps chasing its tail until it gets dazed. Five characters act in exact same ways regardless of the circumstances, and it's just plain not fun. It's not entertaining. It's not funny. It's just fucking exhausting. Much like this review of mine.Anyway, that's it. Go game on. Time better spent than watching this show. has relatively decent amount of game references for the type of a show it is. They're not complex, they don't play any part in the actual narrative, they're just sort of there, but it can be fun recognizing them.- You don't have to take it seriously 'cause the show itself doesn't take itself seriously- You can watch first 1-2 episodes and the last, and comfortably say you've actually watched the entire show (I, myself, didn't have such fortune, as I watched it weekly. Damn me!!)Well, now that we've listed out the positives, let's get on with the actual review of this shitfest. 'Gamers!' plays out a lot like parody - considering that it takes cliche, generic settings or plotlines and exaggerates then to nTH degree - but I'm not sure whether it realizes that it's a parody. You see, just because you take a certain scenario and exaggerate it in any way doesn't make it immediately funny. Especially if you take something that was boring and atrocious to begin with. If someone wants to parody and make fun of the classic rom-com misunderstandings plot devices, you DON'T amp them up to fucking heaven. No, no you don't. It's not funny. Trust me, ooh trust me, it's not funny.And what do you get when the greatest problem of the show lies with what literally defines it? Well, you get 'Gamers!'. For the plot to play out the way it did, it was necessary for each and every character to literally be a pre-programmed AI that responds only when certain conditions are met. Say, a boy has a girlfriend. A boy sees his girlfriend with his friend (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people of opposite sex meet up without intention to fuck each other dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). Now, it's only logical for the boy to come out and ask his friend: Oi, you fucking my girl? Obvious, right? Well no, apparently not.Say, you think your boyfriend is cheating on you. After all, you did hear him say some other girl is cute (I know, I know, sometimes, in real life, people compliment members of opposite sex without intention to fuck them dead; but this is anime, so obviously that logic doesn't exist here). So, what do you do? Well, you talk to him obviously. Ah, no, wait, that's logical thing to do. Better, let's meet up with his friend and do absolutely nothing except whine and complain about it.Look, I can stuff a lot of shit - especially if it's a comedy show - and especially if it's parodying something.

Time better spent than watching this show."", 'The stereotypical gamer is an anti-social closet hermit who obsesses over leveling up their avatars and staying far away from social activity as much as possible.\xa0 To poke fun at this stereotypical concept, we have Gamers!, a show supposedly about gamers and the kind of comedy that happens when they\'re put in a romcom situation.Story:Based on a light novel of the same name, Gamers! tells the story of a boy named Amano Keita with his life flipped upside down as the school idol Tendou Karen notices his dedication as a gamer and offers him a spot in the gaming club where she and several upperclassmen...spend their afterschool hours practicing competitive gaming, using the prize money to improve and expand their clubroom with more trophies and better equipment.\xa0 He rejects her offer and thus begins the romantic comedy involving these two adorably stupid gamers.\xa0 If I said that was the plot, well I would by lying.\xa0 Or at least...half lying.In reality, Gamers! is the anime equivalent of a Bethesda game; you really want to enjoy it, but at the same time, it\'s riddled with a lot of bugs and ends up making the overall experience somewhat infuriating.\xa0 The entire show spends its runtime focused on its five main characters as their relationships are tested because each character manages to find some way somehow to misunderstand every little detail and create their own headcanon for what\'s going on with everyone else but them.\xa0 Of course it\'s done in a comedic sense, as it\'s all exaggerated and no one talks to each other in and attempt to clear up the problem because that would be too easy.The upside to that is the fact that the show sucks you in with wanting to know what\'s going to happen next whether you want to or not.\xa0 Cliffhangers are commonplace, and there are a couple of moments where the episode ends on such a dramatic note that makes you want to continue watching just to see what kind of result such a fuck up creates.\xa0 Despite that, the cliffhangers aren\'t necessarily a good thing for this show.\xa0 Each successive episode only feeds into the spiraling vortex of misunderstandings that at some points makes it really hard to tell if what\'s happening is going to end well for anyone.\xa0 It\'s this kind of storytelling that turn the show\'s comedy into something of a niche, as personally I felt aggravated seeing what had transpire while I\'ve spoken to others who like the show for what it displays.While certainly not a show that\'s actually about gamers (sure the characters are gamers, but that aspect is only touched on in their personalities rather than the storyline), Gamers! is a show that entertains by making as many things go wrong as it possibly can.\xa0 Its story is certainly unique in that aspect, and more or less seems to fix up a majority of the characters\' misconceptions and problems by the end of the series.\xa0 So at least that headache is gone.It\'s also worth noting that oddly enough, the throwaway episode is of better quality than the rest of the series despite it being a DLC episode that actually talks (somewhat) about gamer mentality.\xa0 I just find that...odd.Overview:+ Stays consistent with its story+ Throwaway episode somehow much better than the actual plot+/-\xa0 Pure misunderstanding comedy (depends on your taste in comedy)Characters:Since the show\'s about gamers, let\'s talk about gamers.Amano Keita is...not that interesting.\xa0 An avid casual gamer that looks like a generically designed male protagonist, Keita\'s character is probably the most uninteresting member of the cast despite being the protagonist.\xa0 His main quality aside from really liking games is being an anti-social shut-in who can\'t fathom how to manage being more than what he already is.\xa0 My main problem with him is how he shows quite a bit of promise as the main character due to his decisions in the early episodes at the beginning, but ends up becoming nothing more than a stand-in protagonist that does little to nothing to drive the plot.Then there\'s Tendou Karen, the supposed main female protagonist of the show.\xa0 With the early episodes showing her falling from grace due to Keita\'s initial refusal, Karen eventually becomes a lovesick girl being too shy to fully admit her true feelings.\xa0 The initial promise for development is very clear, but the show outright refuses to use her.\xa0 Along the way, the show basically shoves Karen to the sidelines, focusing on a different girl entirely as largely the show\'s main focus.\xa0 In truth, Karen never gets the attention or development she deserves, and kind of makes the whole resolution at the end of the show meaningless because most of the time, both Keita and Karen aren\'t even in the same room.\xa0 It\'s weird that the show basically refused to use her, and I really wish that wasn\'t the case because there was potential with how Keita as a casual gamer affected her thoughts on gaming as a competitive gamer.Then there\'s Hoshinomori Chiaki.\xa0 When I said another girl takes the spotlight, this is her.\xa0 Personally, I attribute a lot of the show\'s problems to Chiaki, as not only does her involvement create the first set of grave misunderstandings that make up the show\'s plot, but the entire second half is devoted to contrived feelings for Keita, who many times the show has attempted to convince the audience THAT SHE HATES.\xa0 The show puts so much focus on her that it shoves everything else to the side and makes her the star of the show as unlikable as that is due to the entire flip of who the show was about at the beginning.\xa0 She also has a \'repeat phrase ending\' where she says \'des des\' or phrases of the sort every time she talks in an attempt to be cute.\xa0 It\'s not.Then finally, there\'s the couple of Tasuku and Aguri.\xa0 Can I just ask why the show makes such an attempt to crash and burn their relationship?\xa0 Initially, we\'re treated to a sweet story of a girl and a boy falling in love as an explanation to their relationship.\xa0 So why exactly does the entire series feel the need to have these two running in circles as well trying to find out if one is cheating on the other?\xa0 It\'s something about this show that I really didn\'t understand and I honestly felt sorry sometimes cause what we could\'ve gotten would\'ve been sweet.\xa0 Instead we get this sour storm of misunderstandings that I wouldn\'t have attributed to a couple who\'ve been dating for a while.The only side character that\'s worth mentioning is Konoha, Chiaki\'s little sister.\xa0 She only appears in the later episodes and is really just a supplement to Chiaki\'s character to add to the overall misunderstanding, so she\'s not really anything that important to note.Overview:+ Initially good characterstics-\xa0 Later bad characteristicsArt:Produced by Pine Jam, the art for Gamers!

To be honest it was pretty good! Not perfect, but definitely a good entrance to get into slice of life anime. So what are some of the good things? So the anime shines with the sound and attention to detail for video games to be honest. I am a huge gamer so I definitely enjoyed this anime. Now I personally like the characters. The main guy is kind of oblivious to kind of common things. However this anime does show how awkward love can be. Now it does dramatize the awkwardness. However so...does most anime.

Well imagine instead if every character in the show was like that, that is this anime. Also, the show could've honestly been about anything, what's more so driving is their passion, unlike shows like SAO or Hi-Score Girl where actual gaming was an integral part of the show, this show the characters just sorta like games, but honestly there's nothing wrong with that, it makes for a fantastic opening animation. I would say that the strongest feature of this anime is the unpredictability,...it's legitimately difficult to guess what will happen next because everyone is an idiot, and while most of the characters are just the generic archetypes you expect from any rom-com the interactions with each other remain highly entertaining. It's a fun watch and a perfect filler anime if you're not looking for something you have to invest in, but rather just a fun watch. it's legitimately difficult to guess what will happen next because everyone is an idiot, and while most of the characters are just the generic archetypes you expect from any rom-com the interactions with each other remain highly entertaining.

That, by itself, is worth something, and makes this a cut above the rest.As far as the rest of the story, there isn't anything mind blowing. You won't cry, you won't be incredibly attached to any characters, and you probably won't laugh out loud at...any point.

From here it turns into a love triangle circus comedy of who likes who/pin the tail on the donkey. The story could be summarized into about 6-8 episodes if the MC\'s played a lot less I\'M DENSE cards, but that\'s...for comedic effect which makes up the whole story so if dense characters irritate you i have some bad news.Characters: 7/10Surprisingly the characters where a nice change of pace to what is normally seen. There was your regular troupes, but it wasn\'t on the normal character it was a bit of a switch around from the norm, which was a nice breath of fresh air for a change. Each character had their own little likeable feature and it wasn\'t a case of really playing favorites too much.Sound: ?/10As per my last review, I don\'t pay a lot of attention to the music, so it either wasn\'t enough to hook me or I\'m just tone deaf.Art: 7/10The art style was your standard moe try to get everything colourful and cute art style, but it wasn\'t super over the top, backgrounds looked crisp and not rushed to save money/time and the comedy scenes were done nicely as well with the change of art style for reactions.Overall: 6/10TL:DRFrom the original premise of the show it changed completely into something that i wasn\'t really expecting, this is a reoccurring thing with game related anime, but it turned out not so bad, for a romcom it faired alright though the last episode may leave you disappointed (SPOILER AHEAD) as it really ends in episode 11 and episode 12 is just filler.Would I recommend it?Only for the character aspect, as far as Romcom, Comedys and the like go, it was about on par with everything else. = No for comedic effect which makes up the whole story so if dense characters irritate you i have some bad news.Characters: 7/10Surprisingly the characters where a nice change of pace to what is normally seen.

Running on an outlandish series of comedic errors and exaggerated reactions, the main cast manages to convince themselves their video game loving friend group is a tangled web of love triangles, while in reality...there are only two non-competing couples. The show does this for the first half of its run and it’s comedy gold.Unfortunately, in the second half the show made the mistake of starting to take itself seriously and the quality slips a bit. An actual love triangle develops, an unnecessary character is introduced, and there’s less comedy to go around. The ED is even changed for a couple episodes, with much more melodramatic music and imagery. Gamers! never slips entirely into a dramatic series, but it really should have stayed a farce. To top it all off, the last episode is a filler spa episode centering around a conversation about DLC and fan-service that gets seriously ramped up in a series that’s otherwise fairly tame in that department. The show should have stuck with comedy all the way, that’s its best asset.ANIMATION & SOUNDThe animation is a flat 5 here. It does what it needs to do, has no major flaws, and looks nice enough, but I can’t think of single thing it does unusually well.This is an English Dub series all the way. Comedy is just so much better in your native language, and the voice actors do quite well conveying the ludicrous, exaggerated emotions and rapid-fire dialogue necessary for a good farce. I haven’t laughed out loud at an anime in a good long while, and this show did the trick.The soundtrack is fine, with the OP being a catchy and happy little pop song, but I really can’t remember a single piece of music that played during the show.CHARACTERSReal people don’t act remotely like this, folks. I can sympathize with going in ridiculous over-analysis of a romantic situation only to draw the completely wrong conclusion, but it’s heavily played up for rule-of-funny. The cast plays up their stereotypes hilariously, the generic, wishy-washy main character, the gorgeous school idol hiding a nerdy secret, the cocky schemer whose schemes always backfire on him, etc. The big mistake occurs in the second half of the show where the story tries to make these loons work in a scenario that’s just a little too serious for them to handle well.OVERALLI greatly enjoyed this lunatic farce of a rom-com.

However, after watching Hiding in Public's video about the anime, I decided to give this anime another chance. To be honest I hated the way this anime focuses on the love dynamics between the main characters while not giving much attention to what specifically they like about the games they played. If anyone wants an anime or manga that balances the enjoyment and appreciation of video games with subtle romance then I would recommend Hi-Score Girl. What I was beginning to like after the sixth episode is how the characters begin to understand one another when they...are not focusing on each other but when they are enjoying each other's play style when playing games or vaguely discussing what they like about the games. I wish the anime built this up more, but unfortunately it never does. The anime seems to be playing it safe with keeping the subject of enjoying video games minimal while putting out the romance gags. I liked how the anime breaks free from the trope of every girl falls for the main character by having one of the characters already have a boyfriend that she is serious about. It's interesting to see the other characters expect this character to fall for the main protagonist since it reveals both their and the audience's tendency to expect two people of opposite sex enjoying each other's company to be an item. I would like to see the anime dwell on this topic a bit more in the future. The final episode seems like an experimental episode to test whether the audience would tolerate the minimizing of the romance aspects of the anime for the contemplation of video games place in the life of each character. If the anime continues in this direction, then I would look forward for the second season and hope for the improvement. If not, then I guess I am done with this anime. I wouldn't turn to this anime for a great entertaining story but for its intriguing ideas it seems to vaguely play with. It barely breaks through for me as slightly above a sub-par guilty pleasure. are not focusing on each other but when they are enjoying each other's play style when playing games or vaguely discussing what they like about the games.

It was at my bottom to mid on the to watch anime. The synopsis werent so convincing either but i tried it out of boredom.To be honest it is actually very good. The first episode tells us that is would be your typical no friends boy with the most popular girl. But on the later episode it gives us some character development. In terms of character development it is quite unbalanced, one is slower and the other one is faster.What i find interesting from this anime...is that it uses all the characters on the right time and for the right purpose. They didnt left the characters in every episode. The comedy used here is also funny and not cringy.Also if you are looking for a gaming theme in this anime, dont expect too much. It focuses on the daily life of a gamers instead and not really much on the games. One thing that lacks in this anime is it's clear way of expressing things.

Really recommend it"", ""Allow me to start by clearing up the first of what will be many misunderstandings: Gamers! is not about games or gaming. It's an anime about the people who play games - a loner who loves video games to death but is awful at most of them, an honors student who hides her gaming to maintain her image, a game designer with a fetish for fish, a casual who needs the aforementioned loner's recommendations to really get into gaming, and the casual's girlfriend, who looks at all of them like members of an alien species. Every character has clear and particular tastes and relationships with...gaming, making them infinitely more relatable and distinct. Oh yeah, and all five form a love pentagon of epic proportions.Just because Gamers! is about the gamers doesn't mean it can't show off their shared titular hobby, and Pine Jam packs GOBS of gaming references both specific and not. Even disregarding the OP and EDs - which are fantastic - the show itself incorporates plenty of references and behaviors that are instantly familiar to anyone familiar with gaming culture (the scene where Amano gets critted is particularly memorable). The staff are obviously passionate about gaming, and it shows through in every moment of the show, though the story leans on it less heavily in later episodes.Speaking of the story, it seems like a pretty standard romcom laden with misunderstandings. Upon closer inspection however, the misunderstandings are impressively self-aware and carefully orchestrated for maximum effect. And with characters that feel as alive as this cast does, the misunderstandings and love pentagons become infectiously fun to watch. Seriously, having misunderstandings DOES NOT ruin this show. Clichés can work if executed well, and they are very very well executed here.The soundtrack is pretty good, if a little unremarkable at times. The animation suffers pretty visibly as the show goes on, likely from deadline issues or the like (episode 10 was delayed like 12 hours), but it's never awful, and if you've already bought in to everything Gamers! is trying to do, it's easy to ignore. Plus, the more glaring stuff will likely get fixed on BDs.Overall, Gamers! is a diamond in the rough. It's the rare hobby-focused slice of life that actually understands said hobby. The characters are likeable and well-rounded, and the romcom side turns out to be a blast. There's an inexplicable charm to this show - this is the most fun I've had watching anime in years - and even if it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, give it a shot and let it surprise you. gaming, making them infinitely more relatable and distinct.

It's your usual romcom anime, with your batch of funny misunderstandings.The comedy part is pretty good, considering the anime is about gaming culture with romance.Which I'd say it's 60% romance and 40% game related, which isn't bad, you're in for some cute romance here and there, I ensure you they're adorable and wholesome.I am one sucker for romcoms, and this one is good. The misunderstanding aren't too forced, just stupidly put together enough that's it's not bad, but anime tier.Cute characters and your cliches here and there, but the premise is unique...and fun.While I may dislike MCs such as this one, he grows on you as understand him, if you're passionate about games.The game posters are something to see, you may notice one you know of. and fun.While I may dislike MCs such as this one, he grows on you as understand him, if you're passionate about games.The game posters are something to see, you may notice one you know of."", ""If you already watched some LoveCom/RomCom and wanted something similar with a twist, I believe that this a good one to watch as refresher.I'm a casual gamer so I started watching this anime out of curiosity.

I'll try to keep my review spoiler-free.Story maybe boring at first but hold for 3 episodes before you drop it.The story shows how different types of gamer deal with people and events of their lives.

It\'s a complicated mess that takes you nowhere at all. It\'s a train that takes you across the country only to drop you off where you started.That being said, I still somewhat enjoyed Gamers!Now, where to start. I guess the humor. Not too awful. I had a giggle here and there, but as with most comedies, the jokes get repetitive and start drawing away from the actual story we\'re supposed to be getting. Nothing ever goes anywhere. Sure, progress is made in some relationships between characters, but its very minor pushes. one step forward, one step back. Gamers! just feels...like one of those scooby doo chase moments, where everyone\'s just running around in circles. Nothing is ever really resolved. My big issue with the anime, or should I say, another issue with this ""game"" anime is that there\'s just excessive speak of games. There actually isn\'t any games to be found. Hell, the game we see most is a flash mobile game...The characters do not help the story either. It\'s ironic that dating sims are spoken of as much as they are considering our MC is reminiscent of the MCs in dating sims. Nothing redeemable about him whatsoever, but everyone flocks to him, because again, he\'s the main character. Worse than this though is the ongoing gag that you get sick of the first time you see it, the misunderstandings. It wasn\'t fun 2 times in, it wasn\'t fun 30 times in. Communication isn\'t present between these characters, which is funny (more irony) when in real relationships, you\'d consider communication to be  incredibly important. It\'s as if the show wants to irritate you, because some of the characters will fully share your stress and you think to yourself ""why won\'t you just say something"". It\'s a nightmare.I have nothing to say about the sound/music. The OP was nice, I suppose. The art style wasn\'t really anything out there either, there were some character designs that I just viewed as really average, but with a speck of flair. Characters like Aguri and Tasuko. They weren\'t anything remarkable, but they gave a bit more personality (not to say there\'s much unique) to their characters. This was easy to notice when looking at Keita. Makes you appreciate the small things, but then maybe that\'s a flaw.Now with all the trash talk spoken, how come I enjoyed it? Well, the main reasons are the ridiculous misunderstandings and the cliche cute moments. This is the rise and fall of the anime really, since these same things are what can make the anime such a turn off. The misunderstandings were fun to watch, albeit irritating, but only really bothered me when I realized they were complete comedic relief and filler. They\'d be left unresolved and forgotten. A joy for a moment and then disappointing. I liked some of the chaos, but I was ultimately left dissatisfied.The cliche moments and cuteness are kind of similar. This anime kind of has some identity issues sometimes. It\'s funny and stupid and then there\'s a sweet moment, or something really cute that happens and you can\'t help, but hope that particular relationship route works. Then we\'re back to comedy and the scene is forgotten as with everything.So I give this anime rank: Diet Soda *Because like diet soda for me. Its pleasant for a second and then you\'re left with the aftertaste.And that\'s only if you don\'t watch episode 12, which is basically a DLC- err OVA. It kills the ending of episode 11 and leaves an even worse aftertaste. So pass on it unless you\'re desperate for more, somehow.----To summarize nice and neat, what made this anime enjoyable?•The rare cute moments, the few laughs this anime managed to get out of me, the chaotic plot if you\'re into that and for me personally, Aguri. I won\'t lie. I fought through for that, she\'s adorable.What makes this anime disappointing?•Everything feels like filler, the misunderstandings aren\'t funny after awhile; they\'re painful, the show ends on an OVA, nothing about how any situation is handled is ever satisfying since you feel as though nothing is ever clarified and these characters have 5 second attention spans.

Honestly this was quite an interesting part of the Anime in the first episode and I thought: hey maybe he will get better at gaming and become some very good Gamer.So I kept watching the first episode and at some point I was really excited like...a little child because there is a so-named Game-Club. Nothing special you think? Oh I tell you it\'s an amazing club because the goal of the club is to win tournaments and make money with it. Basically ESPORTS!!

Notice that I used the word ""very"" 3 times, that\'s the evidence of my disappointment to this show.Story: 1/10Plot? What plot? The story centered around Amano Keita, who is our typical lonely otaku but ofcourse despite being a loser, the most beautiful girl in their school, Tendou Karen developed a love for him. How? I don\'t know. It\'s just to sudden. Do love really works that way? And ofcourse Keita ignored that. Why? Because he is a otaku. Episode 1 is good, but later on, each episode is nothing but cringe. The potential...of the starting episode immediately flushed to the toilet.Art: 3/10Character design is unoriginal. Bland and too simple. All of them is so plain except Hoshinomori Chiaki Some animated scenes are very bad. Sometimes, their movement are smooth at all.Sound: 5/10Its surprisingly above average for me. Voice actress did a good job. OP and ED song are nice.Character: 5/10Average. 90% of screentime centered around our 5 main characters. Supporting cast is useless. Keita is also dumb as f---. Tendou is autistic. The only one who is fix is Uehara. Chiaki is also lovely. Her sister Konoha is also fine. Her body is...., fine.Enjoyment: 4/10It was a decent ride. It is just so sad that the later episode became to boring. Force drama is annoying. The love triangle is stupid. Comedic scenes are korny. I would have more fun if this anime is an ecchi. Atleast there is a thing to look forward for. There is a unexpected pantsu shot on episode 3 but after that, zero. The final episode had some awesome hot spring bath scene though.Overall: 3/10Poor.

This anime is bad.  The story is poorly-written, and the entire narrative relies on a series of misunderstandings.  The entire conflict could be cleared up if the five main characters just talked to each other for ten seconds.  This form of storytelling gets very frustrating very fast.  The romance aspect is enjoyable enough, but it is certainly nothing new.  At best, this anime is just another forgettable romance anime....Also, the plot does not resolve in the anime, ending very abruptly in a seeming reliance on finishing the story in a second season.  However, due to the poor performance of the anime, a second season seems impossible, and to make matters worse, the series of light novels and manga that the anime is based on has never been translated into English, so there is no closure to the plot.However, Gamers has one thing going for it that makes it an anime I can still recommend.  One of my greatest passions is video games, especially retro video games.  It is abundantly clear that the writers of the anime share this intense love of video games.  As a result, the anime is full of jokes and references about video games, ranging from mainstream pieces of gaming culture like Super Mario Bros, Dragon Quest, or the Konami Code, to jokes about extremely obscure pieces of gaming media, like Star Ocean, Harvest Moon, or even Nintendo StreetPass.  Surprisingly, a lot of the gaming jokes are very funny, and I found myself laughing quite a bit at this anime.  Additionally, the more you know about video games, the more you are likely to get out of Gamers.I cannot recommend this anime to everybody.  Objectively speaking, it's very bad.  However, the references and humor make it extremely watchable.  If you're just looking for a funny, video game-centered anime and don't mind wading through the frustrating plot, Gamers is a lot of fun.

They're all pretty likable, especially Tendou. The down side to that is that they're all pretty stupid. Each them keeps assuming the worst of each other romantically, and to be honest it got old after the first three or so episodes when the premise started.For this reason, the storyline is pretty damn bad. It's really repetitive and gets old fast, even to the point of frustration. The only reason why I rated the show a 7 is because the characters were good.As I mentioned earlier, the characters are all pretty solid. Amano,...the MC, is probably my least favorite due to the fact that he's the densest of them all. He can't pick out the most obvious social cues. He might have no experience in that stuff at all, but he seems to know how to act in certain situations and not in others. To be honest, it seems like the writers made this for serious plot convenience. On the flip side though, Tendou, the main love interest, is goddamn adorable. My favorite character in the series. Even though she's pretty much perfect in every aspect, she loses her composure in Amano's presence and even when he's not there either. I still don't really know what she sees in Amano, but that'll probably get explained eventually.Besides the plot in itself, my other concern with this series is the order of arcs that this anime decided to go with (though it's likely based on the LN). Episode 12 seemed disjointed and ill-fit to be the finale. Meanwhile, episode 11 had more closure, and did a better job in cementing the relationship drama that was plaguing the series for the entire season. It was weird going from 11 to 12, where the characters just went back to bickering about relationships and getting into the same misunderstandings as usual.This is a nitpick, but I don't really know why people say this show is an accurate description of gamers. Growing up in NYC from age 8-18 (2003-2013), I was never called a nerd in a derogatory manner. Gaming wasn't that niche, and it's been growing in terms of popularity over the last two decades. In high school, this stuff was practically popular. To be fair though, I wasn't at the top of the social food chain (being in the middle is the most accurate description). This is also NYC, a pretty developed city by social and societal standards (stuff like students talking back to teachers is really rare), so that could have an effect. This is all anecdotal. It could be different for other people who grew up at the same time as I did.All in all, I'd recommend checking out this show. It's not exactly the best in terms of romance, because the characters spin in circles, but it's pretty funny at the same time. You'll get frustrated, but it's also really satisfying when things finally go where they're supposed to. the MC, is probably my least favorite due to the fact that he's the densest of them all.

A Light Novel adaptation about a gamer otaku that actually bad at gaming and the life he lives. The story is a slice-of-life, school, comedy, romance theme so, the story is not too heavy to absorb even by a half-brainer. There's a relationship going on from the very first episode but they put misunderstanding into the mix (making the story hard to watch at some point. But, if you intend to watch this, you'll get over it) It serves a pretty relaxing story and a lovable character....The art is not so good in my opinion. I watch 85 anime (with this 86 on my list) and the art here is just lower than average. I gave a 6 for the art. The characters are pretty interesting since the story makes them so. There's a wide variety of unorthodox cast here such as a combination of tsundere and deredere school beauty who fall for an extremely regular boy, a full-blown deredere girl that was too oblivious about a lot of thing, a tsundere that doesn't resort to violence when needed, an ordinary MC, and a jack-of-all-trades wingman.This anime is good only for relaxation.

I often see it here on MAL and on my several Anime communities including a Facebook Group which I am no longer a member of (whoever kicked me out of TGOOPH, your Mum\'s a hoe) and I get a good glimpse of what the Anime is about. What made me think it wasn\'t worth watching is because I am not a huge fan of Rom-Coms. Why? It\'s because most Rom-Coms only focus on the Romantic part and honestly, I have rather sophisticated standards when it comes to...Anime Comedy and I often end up disappointed on how other famous, mainstream RomComs deliver humour. So with that being said, I didn\'t think it was worth my precious time.Days ago, I stumbled upon Gamers! again on a Telegram channel, and I thought there\'s nothing to lose if I give it a try so I went on and watched the first episode.NOW. First episode gave off a full-blown stereotypical high school Rom-Com feel. I felt the *meh especially when a Blond Bishoujo appears before a mediocre-looking loser type MC. I was like;""Oh great, its a club thing. This shit is going to revolve around club activities and shit. Ugh."" I was ready to kiss Gamers! ass goodbye once the first episode reaches conclusion but on the last parts of episode one― BOOM!Okay, say all you want about how little that certain detail was but that was the part where it got me hooked!The plot was kind of a joke, but for me, in a good way. In my opinion, the characters are what really gives life to this Anime in a general perspective. I like the fact that they\'re all fucking clueless and suspecting and I think its totally stupid and that\'s what makes it funny for me.Okay so now, a lot of people are shitting on this Anime because it doesn\'t focus on the ""Gaming"" part and I can\'t help but roll my eyes over these comments like, does it really have to focus entirely on gaming just because the title is ""Gamers!""? What a joke! It\'s all about a bunch of oblivious, Gamer-Otaku dimwits dealing with relationships. That\'s all. I think its actually fun that you don\'t get what you once expected from the Anime. If Animes always turned out to be how you wanted and expected it to be then where\'s the fun in that? You can\'t compare Gamers! to NGNL or SAO or Log Horizon or any other Anime that focuses entirely on gaming. It wasn\'t intended to be an Anime like those in the first place. That\'s all.All in all, I gave it a 9 only because it was hella funny and I needed a cleanse after watching a shounen action-packed Anime. If you want a non-cheap laugh, this one\'s for you.

I was like;""Oh great, its a club thing. This shit is going to revolve around club activities and shit. Ugh."" I was ready to kiss Gamers! ass goodbye once the first episode reaches conclusion but on the last parts of episode one― BOOM!Okay, say all you want about how little that certain detail was but that was the part where it got me hooked!The plot was kind of a joke, but for me, in a good way. In my opinion, the characters are what really gives life to this Anime in a general perspective. I like the fact that they\'re all fucking clueless and suspecting and I think its totally stupid and that\'s what makes it funny for me.Okay so now, a lot of people are shitting on this Anime because it doesn\'t focus on the ""Gaming"" part and I can\'t help but roll my eyes over these comments like, does it really have to focus entirely on gaming just because the title is ""Gamers!""? What a joke! It\'s all about a bunch of oblivious, Gamer-Otaku dimwits dealing with relationships. That\'s all. I think its actually fun that you don\'t get what you once expected from the Anime. If Animes always turned out to be how you wanted and expected it to be then where\'s the fun in that? You can\'t compare Gamers! to NGNL or SAO or Log Horizon or any other Anime that focuses entirely on gaming. It wasn\'t intended to be an Anime like those in the first place. That\'s all.All in all, I gave it a 9 only because it was hella funny and I needed a cleanse after watching a shounen action-packed Anime. If you want a non-cheap laugh, this one\'s for you.', 'The story begins well, but after 5 episodes, it becomes repetitive and boring is always the same joke of misunderstanding, the characters are slow and poorly developed and do not have the least level of self confidence between them.I decided to stop watching after the 6th episode because I realized that it would not change at all.I recommend only for otakus who are beginning to watch anime now.My own opinion I give a 5 note because the first episode pleased me but after 2 ° forward feel that it would not be another cliche novel without development. ', 'In a nutshell, Gamers! is a sweet rom-com anime about high school gamers who get entangled in a web of misunderstandings over love.  You’ll like it if you enjoy the dramatic irony of characters agonizing over misunderstood lines and situations.  You’ll dislike it if you wanted a serious focus on gaming, though Gamers! handles gaming in mature and non-cringey way (which I appreciated).  There’s also not much as much character or relationship development as I had hoped for, so here’s hoping for a second season!Note that gaming is not really the focus of the anime, but rather the string that ties our...cast together.Art and animation are good, especially so during ridiculous or emotional scenes.  I felt like the voicing was really, really good – certain vocal quirks build up some characters very well, and comedic scenes benefit greatly from characters audibly freaking out.Would recommend for the great voice acting and silly romantic confusion.

Heck, it's even pleasing to watch, and is deserving of a rewatch sometime in the future. However, to be truthful, despite the enjoyment i have of watching the show initially, it became painfully clear that Gamers was not the anime i expected it to be. I don't mean it in a bad way, nor a good way. I will elaborate in the story section. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN I DID NOT ENJOY ITStory: 3/10The first major thing that caught my attention to watch this was the title itself, Gamers. In the synopsis, it...said that Tendou wants to recruit Amano into the gaming club, leading Amano to find a side to gaming that he loved contrary to what the gaming club does. Sure, the premise seems intriguing so far. A daily life of wild, unexpected changes to the protagonist life, yeah, it's normal. However, with the title and synopsis talking about the gaming club and protagonist who loves gaming, i fully expected it to be about a gaming genre. Sure, there were references to gaming in the show, and all of the characters love gaming. However, as i watched on, the show felt more like a confusing love pentagon than it is a gaming genre anime. In fact, by the end of half the series, i became convinced this show had almost nothing to do with gaming other than the references made and minor gaming challenges, which did not comprise of even 30% of the entire show. Yes, it is funny and kinda creative to have an idea for a confusing love scenario entangling every characters, and i did enjoy the anime quite a lot. But, i was really disappointed in the way they derailed off the gaming genre, especially with the HUGE misleading title, Gamers. With most anime fans like me, the first and main thing that attracts them is always the title, synopsis, and trailer debuts. That was even how i got into gamers, just judging by the title itself had me intrigued. Needless to say, i was let down when i found out about this. Otherwise, this anime is actually nice to watch.Art: 7/10Not really anything special to mention here. Points for the side notes marking future character developments, and hinting at future plot storylines.Sound: 9/10I gave it a 9, for the very very VERY simple fact that i just loved the interlude melody. The first time i heard it, it was like i was taken back to my childhood gaming era, where everything was in an 16 bit graphic. The music was electronic, yet simplistic, and just full of that retro gaming feel in the modern gaming era. That 5 second interlude was enough to fill me with waves of excitement as a gamer, who spent his childhood years gaming. The op was ok, and ed was not bad, but the real reason i gave it 9 was just that interlude. Seriously.Character: 7/10 (very minor spoilers)There will be 2 kinds of people for this. People who LOVES the characters, or absolutely HATES them. There's not going to be any in between since most of the character build are the same, from genius Tendou Karen, to moe moe Aguri, in the sense that they are ALL DENSE!!! EVERY CHARACTER OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS SHOW ARE UNBELIEVABLY DENSE. Not kidding. If you love characters who have no idea who likes them, gets jealous over every little thing, evolves every single simple thing into something chaotically confusing, you will love them. Honestly, i don't find much of a problem, the similar character traits is what made the show funny, especially when all of them misunderstands a very simple exchange for something so chaotic i never even believed could exist in a romantic comedy saved for the harem genre. Baseline, they are funny, albeit quite annoying, especially Amano. All of the others are arguably  more likeable and funnier than Amano, especially Aguri and Tasuku xD.Enjoyment 7/10Personally, i quite enjoyed this show saved for the misleading premise and confusing, next to meaningless romantic misunderstandings. It would make hell of a romantic comedy if they redirected it towards that genre though, since the premise for it is actually really fitting and good. said that Tendou wants to recruit Amano into the gaming club, leading Amano to find a side to gaming that he loved contrary to what the gaming club does.

It is the opposite of a diabetic story where every corner lies a bowl of chili and a pint of hot sauce.Enjoyment is 5/10Can\'t say that i fully enjoyed it after drinking a gallon of chili sauce while watching a comedy.Still, its a 10 out...of 10! of 10!', 'This one started really strong. It subverted a lot of traits of the slice of life genre always with great comedy to go along or just getting you completely by surprise. It took one of the genre worst tropes, using a misunderstanding to take the plot in the way the writer wants to, and basically made fun of it. There were 3 times as much misunderstandings but they were always comical and so were their repercussions, and when the plot took itself seriously it actually seemed like something that would actually happen. It was pure chaos but in a good sense, it was unpredictable, funny,...self-aware and almost satirical...for the first 6 episodes.My score would be much higher if the show stopped at its sixth episode. Because it seems that most of the staff´s creative energy seems to have been spent there. The last 6 episodes don´t completely lose the magic of the beginning, but they almost do. The first few are still kinda funny but none of them will surprise you anymore, it kinda did in episode 9 but not nearly as much as before, it becomes a generic romcom without anything to set it apart in this oversaturated genre. The laughs became few and far between and followed the cliches of the genre so well it became exactly what it made fun of in the first place. The characters were still likable, although the moe got turned up to 11 in these last six episodes. But their interactions were still fun to watch, to be fair it got giggles out of me here and there but I never laughed out loud like before. And the passing, one of the best parts of the first half, slows down so much it that it gets painfully slow and feels like nothing happens in each episode.In short, it´s like the studio made the first 6 episodes, then got A1-pictures to do the rest. And for some reason they made episode 12 seem like an OVA. The first 6 episodes get an easy 8 but the last 6 barely get a 6, it averages out to a 7.

Yes the title is extremely attractive that i prioritized watching this particular anime for this season. BUT BEWARE! The actual anime has little to almost nothing about gaming actually.This review is about how disappointing the experience was.Story : The story is nothing special. It's the regular high school romance but this time it's about gamers I actually doubt that the story has a meaning at all. It's a manifest of misunderstandings all the way from the beginning to the end. Let me explain, each one of the characters comes up with conclusions based on the tiniest things. It's funny at the beginning, but as...the story progresses it becomes repetitive and irritating.Art : Probably the major breakthrough this anime has. The scenery is beautiful and relaxing and you get a vibe of the care that was put into the drawings.Character development: Don't expect too much of it since the misunderstandings take over any possibility of that.Final Thoughts : Gamers! is a good anime, might not be the best in summer 2017, but it still is enjoyable to watch. I might have had big expectations for this anime, to at least have some interesting gaming moments, but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. If you simply want a humorous experience with a relaxing vibe, then you might like it. the story progresses it becomes repetitive and irritating.Art : Probably the major breakthrough this anime has.

It was well executed and my expectations were defied many times which kept me hooked. I wasn't the most fond of the voice actor they choose for Amano because he sounded too much like a pre-pubescent girl, but that was easy to look past. Uehara was a great friend to Amano. I wish I saw more of a progression in the relationship of...Amano and Chiaki though. Overall, great show! I would watch a 2nd season if and or when it comes out. Amano and Chiaki though.

Maybe if the relation between the games and the main character was better worked, that would contribue to that.The main characther lacks a bit of charisma, and Tendou it is not well developed.

It\'s full of absurd misunderstandings, miscommunications and pure cluelessness generating tons of unnecessary drama, that prevents the two couples the show focuses on from getting together (obviously, we know from the start that everything will be fine in the end). There\'s an actual love triangle in the mix, but even that is obscured by the mountains of false signals and inability to speak out about their feeling on the part the main characters (and once more, we more or less know the conclusion anyway). In the end, after...the amusing start, for many the series became irritating, as it\'s hard to keep suspension of disbelief while every new problem presented in the plot could be fixed with a few minutes of honest talk.Personally I don\'t think it\'s that bad/annoying, but I\'m also a guy that liked School Days and a few other purposefully-frustrating shows – I\'m OK with them when I know what I\'m getting into. Gamers! is a comedy above all and I think the humour really works, the characters themselves and stupid situations they get themselves into are in most cases genuinely funny. Romance component of it, on the other hand, is questionable at best, with characters being either obsessed to creepy levels about their love interests or completely confused and unable to act on their feelings. The predictable outcome only makes it more disengaging on the part of the viewer – the only pairing I would actually enjoy to watch was obviously doomed from the beginning.The ""gamers/geeks"" theme is never fully forgotten, but really just serves as a background for the romantic story. The series have some amusing references and the nerd status of some characters is important to the plot, but never its main focus.The art, animation and music are fine, but the visual quality deteriorated by the end of the season. The voice acting is also adequate, my favourite probably being Hisako Kanemoto as Karen. In general, the production qualities are good, but never blew my mind in any aspect (very good visual design of the main characters being maybe the one thing that stood out).In summary, I recommend this show to people liking comedy anime and not being scared of messy rom-com storytelling, that conjures more and more layers of drama out of thin air. It shouldn\'t be taken seriously and you shouldn\'t expect it to move you in any deeper way. It\'s rather a fun story that maybe had potential to be something more, but ended up as an amusing comedy to watch through on a lazy weekend – not a complete waste of time for sure, but nothing really memorable either. the amusing start, for many the series became irritating, as it\'s hard to keep suspension of disbelief while every new problem presented in the plot could be fixed with a few minutes of honest talk.Personally I don\'t think it\'s that bad/annoying, but I\'m also a guy that liked School Days and a few other purposefully-frustrating shows – I\'m OK with them when I know what I\'m getting into.

Yes, it\'s a normal anime trope. However, there were SO MANY of them in this series that it made my head spin.You a fan of love triangles? Try a love pentagram.The title is a bit misleading, there isn\'t a whole lot of ""games"" going on. Or is there?What I liked:...Each character was at least intriguing and had unique personalities.I was a big fan of the art.It was a fun and hilarious ride watching the characters try to solve their issues. Each character was at least intriguing and had unique personalities.I was a big fan of the art.It was a fun and hilarious ride watching the characters try to solve their issues.', '(*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*)I\'m...a little torn on this one. On one hand, I really enjoyed the characters in this show, and I enjoyed a lot of the humor...but on the other hand, the plot is pretty repetitive, and pretty much ALL of the conflict in this show feels forced bc the characters don\'t think of simple things like, idk, communicating?Okay, so the main character is Keita Amano, a teenage gamer who doesn\'t have any friends and has a giant crush on Karen Tendou, the prettiest girl in school. Kind of generic, but hey, it\'s only episode one. Anyway, he\'s in this game store looking at...games or whatever when Tendou approaches him and invites him to join the high school\'s gaming club. He considers accepting her offer, but ultimately turns her down bc he finds them to be a little too competitive, inadvertently hurting her feelings. She then falls for him after he defends her from someone who badmouths her. Keita quickly makes friends with another guy, Tasuku Uehara, who initially seems like your typical dumb cool guy character, but is actually revealed to be a former nerd who used to love gaming but chose to give it up in order to become popular. He\'s pretty likable too, and so is his girlfriend Aguri, a sort of ditzy cat-loving girl with pink hair who we later found out liked Tasuku even before he was ""cool"". Finally, we meet our fifth and final ""main"" character, and my favorite, Chiaki Hoshinomori. She\'s a aspiring indie game developer and social outcast who Keita befriends in order to practice talking to girls. (See, he wants to get closer to Tendou, but he sucks at talking to girls, so Tasuku suggests he befriend Chiaki in order to practice.) Unbeknownst to the two, they actually already know eachother-see, they both have this online friend they play games with, and it later turns out that Keita is Chiaki\'s online friend and vice-versa. Anyway, after we meet Chiaki is when things kinda go downhill.See, this show is SUPPOSED to be about Gamers, right? Well, it\'s really not. Rather, it uses gaming as a sort of platform to carry a really generic, stupidly complicated love story that creates drama inorganically and frustrates the viewer. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s kind of funny at first, and the characters are overall pretty likable...but they\'d be more likable if they just TALKED more, instead of what they actually do, which is create misunderstanding on top of misunderstanding. The overarching plot of the show is that the five main characters form a sort of weird love pentagon, and they all incorrectly assume that the person they like actually likes this person or that person. (For example, Keita begins hanging out with Aguri a lot after Tasuku starts acting kinda weird, so Tasuku starts to suspect that Aguri is cheating on him with Keita and that Keita is therefore betraying him.) Like I said, it starts out funny, but the jokes gets old pretty fast. It\'s hard to get invested in this plotline when the characters never stop to ask the obvious questions, and when they do, the other characters make really dumb mistakes and explain their situation in a way that actually makes them look MORE guilty. What begins as a fun gag quickly devolves into a repetitive mess, and the characters seriously never learn to just sit down and confront eachother about their suspicions in order to sort things out. Again, I don\'t dislike these characters at all, but I\'d like them a heck of a lot more if they would just make smarter choices, and if the writing wasn\'t so darn repetitive. And maybe it\'d be better if it had more to do with gaming, too. I stand by what I said about gaming being more or less just a backdrop, the characters will occasionally throw some weird gaming lingo into their dialogue and videogames factor into the overall plot of one or two episodes, but for the most part, again, it\'s just kind of an afterthought. What it really feels like is that the guy who wrote the light novels this is based on came up with an idea for a romance story, but then he realized it was kinda generic so he decided to make the characters all gamers to try to help it stand out. Replace the gaming in the show with some kind of popular Japanese sport like baseball or soccer, and the show really wouldn\'t stand out at all, it\'d just be another generic high school anime.The best character in the show is by far Chiaki, I really enjoyed her character overall. She has this big subplot towards the end of the season where she finds out Keita is her secret e-friend or whatever, and she ends up falling for him. But he\'s already kinda with Tendou, so she tries to break them up only to selflessly decide to leave them be and hide her feelings for him in the end. I actually found this to be incredibly relatable, and it honestly frustrates me that Chiaki DIDN\'T end up with Keita. Don\'t get me wrong, I like Tendou as a character, but she doesn\'t have that much chemistry with Amano imo. The only thing they really have in common in videogames, and the only reason Tendou even likes him is because he defended her once and she found it kinda charming. With Chiaki, they actually have a connection, and she likes him because of said connection and how he\'s always supported her in her endeavors as an aspiring developer, even if he didnt realize it was her the whole time. Honestly, even though I didnt enjoy this anime very much, I\'m still really interesting in seeing if it gets a second season, just bc I wanna see Chiaki and Keita end up together. Like I said, I dont hate Karen as a character, but she\'s just not a good fit for Keita imo. She\'s be a much better fit with someone else, I think. As for Tasuku and Aguri, they\'re both pretty adorable together, I wouldnt pair them with anyone else.Do I reccomend ""Gamers!""? Yes and no. I\'d reccomend it but only for the comedy and music. The actual plot is pretty infuriating, the whole ""love pentagon"" thing gets really stale by the end, and in the end I think the protagonist ends up with the wrong girl. Like I said, they could always fix that in a second season, but if the ending of the show is any indication this is a definitely one of those ""read the manga/light novel endings"" where the anime is more or less an advertisement and not a full adaptation, and even if there is a season two there\'s no guaruntee that they wont just keep Tendou and Amano together. I havent read the light novels since they havent translated them into English as far as I know, so I\'m not sure whether they stay together or they go a different route. games or whatever when Tendou approaches him and invites him to join the high school\'s gaming club.

It\'s hard to get invested in this plotline when the characters never stop to ask the obvious questions, and when they do, the other characters make really dumb mistakes and explain their situation in a way that actually makes them look MORE guilty. What begins as a fun gag quickly devolves into a repetitive mess, and the characters seriously never learn to just sit down and confront eachother about their suspicions in order to sort things out. Again, I don\'t dislike these characters at all, but I\'d like them a heck of a lot more if they would just make smarter choices, and if the writing wasn\'t so darn repetitive. And maybe it\'d be better if it had more to do with gaming, too. I stand by what I said about gaming being more or less just a backdrop, the characters will occasionally throw some weird gaming lingo into their dialogue and videogames factor into the overall plot of one or two episodes, but for the most part, again, it\'s just kind of an afterthought. What it really feels like is that the guy who wrote the light novels this is based on came up with an idea for a romance story, but then he realized it was kinda generic so he decided to make the characters all gamers to try to help it stand out. Replace the gaming in the show with some kind of popular Japanese sport like baseball or soccer, and the show really wouldn\'t stand out at all, it\'d just be another generic high school anime.The best character in the show is by far Chiaki, I really enjoyed her character overall. She has this big subplot towards the end of the season where she finds out Keita is her secret e-friend or whatever, and she ends up falling for him. But he\'s already kinda with Tendou, so she tries to break them up only to selflessly decide to leave them be and hide her feelings for him in the end. I actually found this to be incredibly relatable, and it honestly frustrates me that Chiaki DIDN\'T end up with Keita. Don\'t get me wrong, I like Tendou as a character, but she doesn\'t have that much chemistry with Amano imo. The only thing they really have in common in videogames, and the only reason Tendou even likes him is because he defended her once and she found it kinda charming. With Chiaki, they actually have a connection, and she likes him because of said connection and how he\'s always supported her in her endeavors as an aspiring developer, even if he didnt realize it was her the whole time. Honestly, even though I didnt enjoy this anime very much, I\'m still really interesting in seeing if it gets a second season, just bc I wanna see Chiaki and Keita end up together. Like I said, I dont hate Karen as a character, but she\'s just not a good fit for Keita imo. She\'s be a much better fit with someone else, I think. As for Tasuku and Aguri, they\'re both pretty adorable together, I wouldnt pair them with anyone else.Do I reccomend ""Gamers!""? Yes and no. I\'d reccomend it but only for the comedy and music. The actual plot is pretty infuriating, the whole ""love pentagon"" thing gets really stale by the end, and in the end I think the protagonist ends up with the wrong girl. Like I said, they could always fix that in a second season, but if the ending of the show is any indication this is a definitely one of those ""read the manga/light novel endings"" where the anime is more or less an advertisement and not a full adaptation, and even if there is a season two there\'s no guaruntee that they wont just keep Tendou and Amano together. I havent read the light novels since they havent translated them into English as far as I know, so I\'m not sure whether they stay together or they go a different route.', ""Gamers is an anime that has a lot of apparent problems with it but I still enjoy this anime probably the reason why is Because I am a sucker for romance but lets begin the review. lets begin with the story the story is very weak and nothing new this anime follows the main character named Keita Amano he is your classic unpopular guy who plays video games as you could guess by the title  who is shy and it so happens the most beautiful and popular girl in school likes him that so happens to also like plays video games . nothing new...or original here. now the characters for the most part all of the characters are plain no real personality or back story besides one character and name is Tasuku Uehara this character was by far my favorite in the anime he likes to troll the other characters so to speak kind of funny and he is the only character that had a back story and it wasn't to bad. now lets talk about what I like about this anime and the first thing is the art and sound very solid no problems here. another thing I really like about this anime but it is nothing new is a love triangle later on in the anime. and the last thing I like about this anime is when all of the characters have fun together even tho most of them are not really memorable. Overall this anime has alot of Issues and problems that are very apparent but I still enjoy this anime a good reason why is because I am a sucker for anything really romance related. or original here. now the characters for the most part all of the characters are plain no real personality or back story besides one character and name is Tasuku Uehara this character was by far my favorite in the anime he likes to troll the other characters so to speak kind of funny and he is the only character that had a back story and it wasn't to bad. now lets talk about what I like about this anime and the first thing is the art and sound very solid no problems here. another thing I really like about this anime but it is nothing new is a love triangle later on in the anime. and the last thing I like about this anime is when all of the characters have fun together even tho most of them are not really memorable.

It was fun, but I was expecting way more out of it. It might just be me, I guess I didn't really know what I was getting into. The good thing was that it was absolutely hilarious, but it seemed that they used up most of their funniness in the first few episodes.Art: I found nothing wrong with the art. It was nothing special, but I liked the parts with the commentaries on the screen and...stuff.Sound: The music was a bit repetitive, but I didn't mind because there was a lot of dialogue. Also, I liked the random sound effects they chose.Characters: The characters were pretty good, but they didn't really seem real. They just do stupid stuff and they don't really learn any lessons.Overall, I give this anime a six out of ten. It was funny but I got my hopes up a bit too much. Maybe if I re-watched it I would like it more. stuff.Sound: The music was a bit repetitive, but I didn't mind because there was a lot of dialogue.

I am a huge gamer myself and a lot of the anime out there are about video games, and I tried some of them and they are pure identical.For this review I will focus on story/execution, art, characters and my enjoyment (minor spoilers MIGHT lie ahead.)Story/execution: Like any other video game based anime this one is about a high school boy that is recruited to a gaming club, but his interests aren\'t in taking video games seriously. First of all, this...show is not really about ""gaming"", the characters just happen to be gamers, however in fact this show is sort of a love triangle rom-com. The fact that they are gamers is just a stretch and the anime could still exist without the fact that the characters play video games. That aside, this is supposed to be a comedy anime and one of the biggest problems that I have with comedy shows is that they might not be funny, and Gamers perfectly nails not tickling out a single laugh out of me. Plus most of the comedy in this show are just a repetition of comedy from literally any other rom-com. For example the trope where girl thinks her boyfriend is cheating and then his boyfriend thinks the girl is cheating and so on. Besides the failed comedy the best moments that the show actually provides is when it takes a serious tone. That emotional scene where a character tells another character some strong motivating words. In my opinion the series would have worked better as a drama, sadly they focused on the bad comedy instead.Art: The art is really good in my opinion, it\'s nothing new though. The character designs and art style is something that we have seen thousands of times but it still manages to keep me invested enough because this is the kind of art that I prefer, and usually for shows like this, the art works perfectly.characters: This show tries very hard to make the characters relatable to gamers and for the most part it succeeds. However they succeed by throwing a bunch of unnecessary references here and there to show that they have knowledge about gaming and it feels cheesy at a point. A lot of the times it also completely fails to be relatable at all because of the amount of times they say the word ""gamers."" I bet nobody in the gaming community would highlight being a gamer as if it was some sort of a profession. However, it\'s anime and in anime anything goes. Something that I loved about this show is that it acknowledges it\'s surrounding and puts it to use. What I mean by that is, most shows have the main characters talking at the top of their lungs in a very public place and people around them couldn\'t care less. However, Gamers on the other hand have the characters actually reacting when our main characters talk very loud. Making the environment more realistic and lively. It\'s a minor thing but I still liked how they did that.enjoyment: The comedy obviously fell flat and bored me out of my mind. However the beautiful art style that I never get sick of, the some what relatable characters and the serious moments persuaded me to keep going. show is not really about ""gaming"", the characters just happen to be gamers, however in fact this show is sort of a love triangle rom-com.

Each character has at least one generic trait that makes up a bit of their personality. For example, Amano...has the Regular Person variant of the 12 Jungian Archetypes. The average joe.Sound was clear and very high quality.Overall, I give it an 8/10, because not every anime is perfect. has the Regular Person variant of the 12 Jungian Archetypes.

I won\'t lie to you about that. It is what it is, and some people won\'t get much past that if that breaks their immersion. You will find an incredibly funny and light story about true geeks of a wide variety learning to deal with their weirdness and overcoming some of their personal fears and anxieties.As a very light comedy, don\'t expect to dive into the feels like you would with the big Slice of Life names you all know.

And after the first couple of episodes... I was hooked. Let me explain.Story:The story focuses on Keita Amano, a lonely high school gamer, who was in love with a girl named Karen Tendou. One day, she talks to him in his favorite game store, inviting him to her gaming club, where he meets other game members that are committed to their games. However, the story does not revolve around this premise, which surprised me. It was interesting to see them build up the suspense of this club, just to shift the story into something else. The story is really a love story, between A LOT of characters. And it caught my attention and hooked me into this love story between the main characters, and it kept me guessing, ""what\'s going to happen next?"" or ""who is he going to fall for??"", which is always good for an anime to do.Art and Sound:The art and sound were not particularly amazing, but it was definitely eye-pleasing, nothing to complain about. The voice acting was good and the lines felt smooth, so yeah, good job gamers.Characters:The characters in this show were unique and different, respectively. Generating the screen time for all of them equally, which was well done by the creators. Showing each of their lives and backstories, and shows the hardships and struggles miscommunication can have. The show revolved around five main characters:Keita: The main lonesome gamer in this show. We watch as he grows up from a lonely boy to a social butterfly it seems like, which was satisfying to see, and was a great representation of growing up. He tends to revolve himself around the three main girls, which was hilarious to watch his interactions with each of them, from hate, love, and friendship. He wasn\'t particularly annoying, however, some decisions he made wanted me to scream at him because of how stupid they were. Nonetheless, I enjoyed his character.Tendou: The main girl in this show who confused me the most. She is the most popular and beautiful girl in the school, which must mean she has high standards right? Nope, she\'s a gamer, which means she likes gamers. It is shown throughout the show and brought up in jokes how she rejects multiple guys constantly, which made me feel bad for her because of how she doesn\'t want to hurt their feelings, but she never told them she liked someone else? confusing. But who does she fall in love with? The lonesome gamer boy. And she falls HARD. If she went up to him at the beginning of the show and literally said, ""go out with me"", half the show would have been over. Aside from this, her personality isn\'t praise-worthy and she doesn\'t have any scenes where she shines, but she is good written character and makes us laugh as she struggles to do the easiest thing in the world.Tasuku Uehara: This guy was my favorite character in the show. When he started out hating Keita because he was weird and alone, and then he shifted into a friendship and mentor for him, which was a really good character development, which made me like him more. I wish we got more into his past, as he was previously just like Keita, but he realized he had to be cooler and worked towards that. The only thing that annoyed me about this guy is that he would seem to forget that he has a girl that loves him so much and he brushes her off like nothing most of the time. But other than that, my favorite character.Chiaki Hoshinomori: The lone gamer girl from the beginning of the show, that has a bond with Keita that she doesn\'t even realize until the end of the show, and never does anything about it. If she made a couple of right decisions, the ending for her would have been so much different and so much in her favor, which was what I was rooting for honestly. She seemed like she had the least amount of screen time in my opinion, and she seemed to never have any character development until the end of the show, which is a shame. OK character, I would\'ve enjoyed a little spry in her step.Aguri: Uehara\'s girlfriend, she falls for him HARD, ever since she was in middle school. I would classify her as the comic relief in a way, as she hangs out most of the time with Keita, where some of the best scenes are. She also seems to be the main source of confusion and miscommunication, as she seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time always. She seemed to have the most personality out the group, as she has the most energy and social skills, however, she is not a gamer. Bad character 0/10 never watch again.Enjoyment and Overall:This show is alright. Nothing to praise about, but I can see myself watching this again in the future. This show is about growing up and fixing relationships, which are good messages to have in today\'s society. Thankfully there was no sad plot twist in the end, which some romance anime revolve around most of the time. Nonetheless, I enjoyed Gamers!. and I just had to go through with it, cringe or not.

With a title like that you would think its about gamers right? Well, its more like Horimiya but with people who play video games. I can recommend you this show but all the reason why is very subjective. I personally loved the comedy, and the...love tringle in this show but if you don't like stuff like that then you may not like this show. I enjoyed my time with this show and you may too if you give it a shot. love tringle in this show but if you don't like stuff like that then you may not like this show.

I'm giving it higher than a 5 because it's dishonest to say this show is completely unforgettable; after all, I will always remember how the writer(s) stretched out a single misunderstanding to span 10+episodes. This is a feat not seen since Kimi Ni Todoke, a show which I also forgave due to memorable character design, animation, and music.The misunderstandings in this show are painful to...watch. Every episode has at least one scenario which it would be impossible for the misunderstanding to continue, but nothing gets cleared up anyway because the writers need to milk it for several more episodes. Hooray, plot convenience! This is not to say the show isn't funny - there are some pretty great jokes and hilarious scenes - but they are not worth sitting through the show. Most of us are anime otaku and video gamers, and this show is counting on you wanting to watch it on that fact alone... do not fall for it! There are better shows to waste your time on.

Gamers! never ceases to make me repeatedly hit the surface of something in gleeful amusement. It\'s turned into something entirely different to what seemed to be the original premise and I just can\'t wait to see just how far the author can take this BS!""And trust me, there is a lot of BS.Let me explain with a little more depth (or go watch it before I spoil you with pure reasoning):So we start the anime with a certain Amano Keita...who seems to basically be the relatable facade of our own gaming selves personified. At this point, everyone (who hasn\'t read the synopsis) will assume this anime will be a lovely ball of relatableness for us gamers. And then they introduce more characters who are themselves other types of gamers. The title is perfect, this will be an anime about different types of gamers and how they get along! All hopefully, without the stereotypical 12 year old who screams murder at everyone else when the team loses except perhaps, as a fleeting cameo and a joke in the backdrop. Perfect, riiiight?Indeed, the first misunderstanding the creator of this work made was the one with the viewers, while he brazenly sets up the real show in broad daylight.So... this is a good time for you to go watch it, rather than reading the rest of the review. And I can\'t decide whether you\'re lucky buggers or unfortunate bastards, because by now, you probably don\'t have to wait a week for every episode! I\'ll leave you to interpret that statement by yourself.When the snowball started rolling, most of us probably didn\'t catch on immediately... because who actually writes a story like that?! When misunderstandings are usually either solved quickly which furthers character development or dragged on into excruciating eternity. I\'m too amused at the entire situation to be ashamed that I didn\'t catch on quickly enough. One of the many misunderstandings in a complex web gets dissolved and many more take its place, piggybacking on the different social awkwardnesses of each unique gamer (oh, the title didn\'t lie, it\'s just misunderstood). Although the characters that were introduced in the first episode... they\'re just... kind of not really there, since they\'re not the focus of the anime.I just love it. It\'s brilliant, bombastic, lighthearted fun, all at the expense of the characters. An anime Midsummer Night\'s Dream turned up to eleven if you will.If you\'re an Amano, you\'ll just enjoy it for what it is.If you\'re a Tendou, you\'ll get serious and then don\'t understand what the fuss is about.If you\'re an Uehara, you would probably get salty over stuff out of your control.A Hoshinomori is going to get absolutely annoyed over all the trickery this anime has thrown at you (I think there\'s probably a lot of these)And an Aguri... might just stay blissfully unaware.Did I get the characters right?

LA is now something of a retro gamer as of late. What does this have to do with Gamers!, because Gamers! is relatable....to an extent.If there was one statement LA would place on Gamers! plot, it would be ""a snowballing misunderstandings love dodecahedron with gamers of all sorts"". Now it\'s not a bad thing but it\'s also a good thing in a sense. As such, the misunderstandings the main cast goes through do let us see both sides...of the misunderstandings however the main cast do make the situation worse or are just dense to a degree, for a good side of all these misunderstandings is that characters who usually didn\'t interact with one anther start interacting with them and develop a friendship or relationships with one another. However the misunderstandings do at times interrupt the interesting gaming situations it does have and becomes more of a hindrance to the gaming atmosphere for characters quietly bickering or snowballing the misunderstandings even more for the sake of the plot.For characters themselves, Aguri voiced by Rumi Ookubo is something of a casual gamer and is in love with Tasuku Uehara voiced by Toshiyuki Toyonaga who wants peace in the snowballing love dodecahedron, Aguri also has a friendly friendship with our main protagonist Keita Amano voiced by Megumi Han, a gamer who love playing ANY kind of games, whether he sucks at it or not in which he grabs the heart of Karen Tendou voiced by Hisako Kanemoto and the president of the school\'s game club and finally Chiaki Hoshinomori voiced by Manaka Iwami who Tasuku introduces her to Keita and they have a friendly tsundere relationship with each other. You can expect even from this that a love dodecahedron forms quite quickly. LA\'s favourite characters would be a tie between Aguri and Karen in this anime and no not even they are immune for them to START a misunderstanding let alone be targeted to one as well. As for Keita...yeah LA agrees that he\'s dense as hell at times but it isn\'t entirely his fault as multiple misunderstandings causes him to do what he does at times, Tasuku is an instigator but a peaceful yet karmic one at that and Chiaki just kinda took too long before her friendly tsundere relationship with Keita to be a more romantic one not to mention Chiaki caused a misunderstanding herself with Keita involving her younger sister Konoha voiced by Yuuki Kuwahara that made it worse as an extent...thus it felt like for LA that she\'ll never get closer to Keita even though she DID get closer to Keita as a result, just not as closer as Aguri (friendship) and Karen (relationship).The gaming elements of Gamers! however is a decent watch where they make fun of games for comedy sakes but know in certain detail about the games in question, also the dialogue about gaming does transition into real life in many ways from how ""certain"" gamers act to that finale about DLC\'s and the many viewpoints of DLC\'s. LA isn\'t gonna say that Gamers! knows everything about gamers thus it MUST be relatable to gamers, LA is saying to CERTAIN gamers it does become relatable, misunderstandings of the characters in question not withstanding.The animation by Pine Jam is pretty decent from the gaming aesthetics of the games that are referenced in Gamers!, the character designs are pretty distinct with the backgrounding being well done overall. If there was anything the animation did well, it is the gaming aesthetics will reel you in, character designs being secondary well for LA anyways.Voice acting, well Megumi Han crossdressing is good though it\'s not her vocals that are annoying but her character traits, LA really like Hisako Kanemoto and Rumi Ookubo as Karen and Aguri respectively. Manami Iwami was pretty unique in voicing Chiaki in a ways a striked something for LA and enjoyed her vocals, however best voice actor goes to Rumi Ookubo as Astolf- *ahem* Aguri...her genkiness is infectious!.The finale?....misunderstandings are still going with relationships not patched up from those misunderstandings and instead we get a hot springs gaming DLC trip yeaaaah this being an adaptation from a light novel, LA was expecting no resolution from this besides Keita\'s beliefs of always having fun with games being the last message to the anime.Gamers! is a definite tightrope act with it\'s flaws and strengths and sometimes vice versa having strengths and weakness they have as a result. Does Gamers! misunderstandings ruin the characters into making them idiots and NOT gamers, yes and no, yes as it makes characters look idiots and diverts the gaming element to it, but no in that it develop characters we didn\'t expect them interact with to interact with them and become friends and talk about gaming more but it\'s also no on doing misunderstandings correctly without it being annoying, Tsuredure Children in the same season did that right and NOT be annoying. Does Gamers! look at ALL gaming elements to a gamer, hell no, but it tries to be relatable to a certain group of gamers as well having certain degree of trivia and knowledge about gaming in general and to be able to be cheeky and funny about it\'s comedy using gaming as an element was nicely done.

And it doesn\'t end with good character moments the characters themselves were all written really well and in some ways refreshing from your typical anime love story.', 'For a fair and proper review I am going to go ahead and say that ""Gamers!"" is not an anime about video games. It is a romance, slice of life anime about Gamers!. If you expected an anime about about the hardcore gaming life style, then I would recommend something else. This anime does give you that, but that is not it\'s main focus and it shows. If you enjoy your cute, school life, romantic comedy style of anime about a group of interesting people then this would work. Although I enjoy my fair share of romantic anime, this review comes from someone who watched...this anime not knowing what it is really about. My issue with Gamers! is that I expected one thing, but I got something else. Sure the show still had gaming themes, but it suffers from a similar problem that a show like Big Bang Theory has: A show about a social group that\'s great to some people, but not that same social group.Story: 3/10If I was reviewing just the first 2 episodes of Gamers! It would be at least a 9. The story started out super relatable with the topic that is ""casual vs. competetive gamers"", and is something a lot of gamers at least think about. However, the story slowly falls out of that. The story starts to become more about the romance between characters, and the topic of video games just becomes a few references here and there. It left me with the impression that the show was going to be about one thing, and then I keep watching it the whole way through hoping that what originally got me hooked would be brought back. Not to mention the Romance side of the anime was hard and frustrating to watch through.Art 8/10The art is something that this show has done very well. Everything felt super bright and colorful, and it was still clear what the artist were trying to use as a focus point.Sound 6/10The intro for Gamers! was nice and fun to listen to. The soundtrack itself did not stand out, but it did its job well.Characters 4/10Amano, just like most protagonist in any harem animes, go through the same formula of a personality (If they even have one at all). Other than that all the other characters in the main cast seem to  have something going for them. But the issue is none of them seemed memorable.Enjoyment 2/10Gamers! in general was not fun to watch. When an anime presents me with something in it\'s first few episodes, I expect it to be like that the whole way though. I was unhappy with the way things turned throughout watching this anime to the end. The show started out very relatable, and something I got hooked on after just 1 episode. The show then became a romance anime, not necessarily a bad one (not a good one either), but games were not its main focus. Depending on the anime that\'s not much of a problem, but when an anime sets itself up to be one thing it becomes a problem.Overall 5/10As I said, Gamers! is not the anime for you if you want something about video games. It is just an anime about reference to a gamers life style, and more about the romantic issues among the main characters. The biggest issue with anime isn\'t its writing, or the what it turned out to be. It\'s what it set itself up to be.

This series really tickled my pleasure in terms of how engrossed I was into the world of these ""gamers"" and the different fantastic games they played. Some people say the game is fun. Or, that the game is a battle. If it\'s not fun why bother? If it\'s not a battle, where\'s the fun? These questions really dig deep into my understanding of how Gamers! truly imagines and unfolds its world. It\'s really a test that you pass or a quest that you fail. It is also a race against time. Fun and battle always lock together.Gamers! embodies what...makes these kinds of shows special. A truly unique look into how gaming clubs operate and how the members interact. Slightly awkward at first, but as the show unfolds we find that these characters have a tender and caring side for one another.But Gamers! is something else. It is a journey, or a passport to new worlds. Perhaps even... an Odyssey. It\'s a look, a feel, an exploration. You really have to close your focus and open your mind. Yes, the journey requires the right ticket, and that ticket is Gamers! But in the end it\'s not just about where you can take Gamers!.

Honestly, I am writing all this just because how fucking angry this piece of shit anime has made me.One day my bro sent me a pic from this anime where you could clearly see a Dark Souls 3 game copy, I was all like ""huh, an anime that actually appreciates gaming as a thing and does recognize what modern games really are"". Luckily, I decided to postpone the show for better times.Then I stumbled upon that opening video...on YouTube one day and I was like ""OH DUD PUBG REFERENCE IN AN ANIME? NO FUCKING WAY!"". Once again, however, I decided not to watch the piece.Piece because it\'s a piece of garbage. Got it? No? okOne day I had that fucking spark in me, y\'know, I really wanted to watch a fun, maybe even braindead anime, so I remembered about this GAMERS! thing and decided to get my hands on it. Tell you what: my expectations were pretty low, but what I\'ve experienced is fucking terrible even by my ""low expectations mode"" standards.I was watching the first episode and I noticed all those game copies on shelves being references to different games and I was very hyped indeed. However, I noticed something being really off with the series so far: it\'s the fucking piece of shit cringe-worthy protagonist, who is by far the worst fucking take on a mc-kun made by anyone. I think. The dialogue is just unbearable, even the most polite and shy human being would not behave like THAT monstrosity. It\'s just horrifying and overwhelmingly underwhelming at the same time; the only thing the protag-kun is good at is MAKING ME FUCKING CRINGE.However, the next episode MC hooks up with some dude who made a ""decent human being"" impression on me. Dem dudes go to a game center and play some arcade Persona 4, idk. Apart from MC giving me conniptions it was fine. Made me B E L I E V E once again that this anime was actually about games and all that.The next couple of episodes SHIT GETS REAL. So instead of a gaming-theme anime we get absolutely fucking CLICKBAITED into some... uhhhhhhh how\'s it called? ROM-COM, and as far as I am concerned this is a whole new low even for the rom-com standard. So, you see, there\'s that ""love hexagon"" (now that I think about it, maybe it\'s a pentagon? oh noes, better say octagon because I just can\'t care less at this point) that is purely born because of sheer misunderstanding between characters, that, may I point that out, could be EASILY solved with a normal fucking human talk. Our characters are too fucking anime for that shit though. Better just ruin everyone\'s relationships because HUMAN PERCEPTION IS OVERRATED.At this point, the show turns out to be some borderline netorare hardcore shitshow. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s genuinely hard to watch. I dropped this right at the 5th episode as the madness just seemed to carry on and I it was clearly obvious that from here on out this whole ""misunderstanding"" process is the main gimmick of the show. It gets awkward and stupid.My mathematical knowledge is more than enough to estimate the scores as following:Story: ""2/10 where are the gaems at boi""Art: ""6/10 nuffin special""Sound: ""4/10 OP sucks and chiptune is bland""Character: ""1/10 top 10 anime protags you would wish to fucking murder""Enjoyment and Overall: 2/10.One point for the fact that there are some people who rated this 8-10/10 which is very funny and entertaining indeed, one point for Tendo slipping on a banana peel allowing me to scream ""GO HOME GAMER GIRL"" in satisfaction.It\'s an abysmal experience, please spare your time, do yourself a favor and don\'t watch this absolute legendary trashy show. on YouTube one day and I was like ""OH DUD PUBG REFERENCE IN AN ANIME?

And me on the other hand have endless times, the story is more about the interactions with the gamers themselves rather than videos games. hence the ""romance"" tag on it, which is why alot of people hated the story.ART 10/10I\'m really liking the newer stages of art style being thrown into the mix of these animes. It really does feel like they try...to do their best with the budgets they have. The colors are clean, but kinda generic.Sound 6/10I was streamed from 4 different website and the audio wasnt great at all.

They didn't explain if she gave up or not, they go from ep.11 where she tries her hardest to try to spend some alone time with him and have a dialogue with him that kinda says how she feels about him then they drop the subject completely the last episode. The last episode had nothing to...do with the plot of the show at all, it didn't advance the story one bit. The plot was a giant misunderstanding that was annoying to watch and I'm sure a majority of us waited it out to see if the ending was worth it but the ending was irrelevant to the plot.

So the Overall Score I gave is 6. The main reason is that the whole story revolves around the 5 characters misunderstanding the feelings of each other. There are some gags that are hilarious due to these misunderstanding but still it is very exhausting watching them misunderstand each other.And what is very annoying in this anime is that these misunderstanding were not cleared and the story keeps on progressing until the last episode...therefore it makes you wonder why they still keep their relationship if they think their love one like the other.On the other hand the Art and Sound of this anime is outstanding, the art of the female protagonists are very cute and their details are very exquisite =)) therefore it makes you wonder why they still keep their relationship if they think their love one like the other.On the other hand the Art and Sound of this anime is outstanding, the art of the female protagonists are very cute and their details are very exquisite =))', 'This ""review"" is intended to those who have watched the 2 first episodes.The episode 1 was amazing.Starts with your typical loser nerd you can identify with.Perfect female student appears like sent from angels to save your loser lifestyle.Typical rom-com conversation follows.Of course, this never happened to you nor me.So, the girl want him to join her club for apparent no reason, just to increase the number of members it seems.

To put it plainly, this is one of the most frustrating animes I have ever seen.The premise starts off interesting: A ""loner otaku"" gets invited to a gaming club but rejects the invitation as it does not satisfy what he truly enjoys about video games(the loner aspect). That premise only held interest in the show for the length of 3-4 episodes, and then it turns into an abominable mess of misunderstandings. This on its own is fine by me since you have to build a plot from somewhere,...especially when it comes to rom-coms. The issue for me was that the entire plot then became about various misunderstandings that could have all been solved through one measly conversation. BUT NO FUCK THAT MAYBE THE CHARACTERS SHOULD TAKE ANY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT OR ACTION AND TWIST IT TO BE AS CONTEXTUALLY NEGATIVE AS POSSIBLE. THAT MAKES FOR STELLAR STORYTELLING.

Is a series that has some good cute and funny moments, but ultimately suffers from a perpetual status quo. It follows tropes found in many romcom animes, though sometimes it manages to put a twist in it that will keep you watching a little longer.It also has several nods to gaming culture, and the last episode frames an engaging discussion on the pricing of games and DLC, if you don\'t completely miss it due to the fanservice. The show is good about showing and comparing different kinds of gamers.I enjoyed the first part of the series, when the misunderstandings were fresh and the...gags were unexpected. The stories and relationships were getting really tangled up, but it felt like that it was building to a climax, which the show did provide about halfway through the series. It looked like a clear resolution was coming, but then the plot started to get tangled again, except this time the direction was not as clear, and the characters were making the same mistakes, and the season ended by pausing the tangled storylines and giving us *ahem* distractions. What looked like a cute rom com had turned into kind of a harem perpetuated by lies and assumptions.I feel that if the show got a second season, no substantial forward progress would be made.

I was definitely caught off guard by this anime. I\'ll give them props for that.I went in, expecting the cliche rom-com and harem and part of me came out, wondering what exactly was it that I just watched for the past 6 hours. Was this an attempt to create something unique?First of all, the show itself was definitely funny, filled with humorous moments as every character had their ""inner dialogues"" conflicts, which added oil to the fire.There was also something remotely different about this anime: exaggerating drama out of the extraordinary, ability to create ridiculous miscommunication and a semi-peak of character development that needlessly...fell short after the last few episodes.Does that make this a masterpiece? Not at all.Did this had the potential? With this type of generic MC, not in a million years.Yet. Something still drew me.

The first episode, I thought the two Senpais from the Game Club are somehow going to have a relevant role. Needless to say, that did not happen for the rest of the show as it took some sort of detour. I find that interesting as it kept me wanting to find out where this show is going to take me.- Funny. Rom-Com genre. It delivered. I am satisfied and had a couple of good laughs.- Different POVs. I personally liked how the show dived into each character\'s head and thoroughly expose their thoughts for our entertainment.- Character Development. It was there, but not in the way I expected. Some characters grew while few rose and fell stagnant. While some just remain the same.- Filled with drama. I think this was the huge highlight of the show. There is always some sort of drama happening because some character misunderstands a situation or have an unlucky moment with fate. It\'s like watching preschoolers have an argument over a toy car.- Art. Animation. Music. Tunes and melodies were on par, the animation was nicely drawn and there were smooth transitions. But of course, that is to be expected during this era of anime.※ WEAKNESS ※- Deviation from the plot. You can change the topic of games to entirely something else like hentai or food and it would function well enough its own.

Don\'t forget the most popular hottie along with some nerd girl who turns out to be a gorgeous babe to fall for MC for no apparent reason.- So stupid it hurts. Might have lost a couple IQ here and there as the entire crew are completely oblivious. All of these can be solved if people were honest with their feelings but then again, we want to watch stupid people do dumb things so we can laugh at them for our own pleasure.

(Note: This review will be spoiler free do a degree; though I am writing this more for those who have already watched a bit of it, or for those who have finished it)First things first; I completely understand why so many people dislike this anime. Its pacing is weird, some of the characters are annoying, and it changes into a practically different anime half way through.However, I'll use this review to explain why you should watch this one anyway.Last note: I drop anime like a mad man. If I start to dislike an...anime at any point, to a certain degree, I just won't watch it. As I watch more and more, I become pickier, so my completed to dropped ratio becomes smaller and smaller as time goes on; but that's just me.START-O:Story (7/10):I feel as though people are being too hard on this aspect. The story had to focus on the extreme tropes of the characters to introduce them in a dramatic way; I believe, to get you more invested in them. So the first half of the show (more like the first third, but whatever) is focused on character introduction and dramatization of the way they live their lives. Once that is over, it heavily focuses on the drama surrounding the characters in a much more unique way than I have seen in many of the anime is this genre. Its biggest highlight is the hilarious comedic overtone that affects the story as a whole.Art (9/10):A place where this anime really hits me is certainly not in its general character art or its background art, but rather in the hilarious, intentional way it draws its characters. It's absolutely hilarious to watch the way the characters forms change in response to what happens to them or those around them. It was what made me come back after dropping it after episode one, and what kept me laughing hysterically throughout the show. By far my favorite quality of this anime.Sound (8/10):The OP and EDs were pretty great, especially on the art side (affects the above score, obviously). The music definitely fit during the great moments of the show and was overall decent. Not memorable in the least, however. Lastly, I don't pay much attention to the music, so this is as much as I could come up with.Character (7/10):The characters are obviously what made the show as good or as bad as most people feel, I believe. In my opinion, I loved the characters (to a degree). The way they interacted with one another, the inner monologues, the reactions to events, the way they changed flow suddenly occasionally. I loved it all, which is another reason why I enjoyed myself so much. However, they are also all very flawed in many ways. They lack really any depth beyond how they act, so you can't really connect with any of them on a deeper level at all (which can also be a good thing, since it means focusing more on the overall picture; at least for me it did). I really loved one of the characters and felt like she grew more as a character than any of the others, by far.Enjoyment (9/10):Overall, I really enjoyed myself throughout the course of the show. I loved many aspects of it!TL;DR for each category:Story: Dry in the beginning, got much better in the second third of the show. Many will disagree; it depends entirely on taste I believe. The pacing is weird and it changes quite a bit.Art: The animation of the characters is what made me keep watching, and it only got more hilarious as the show went on. I really enjoyed this particular aspect of the show. The artwork itself was average or subpar.Sound: Not much to say, OP is great, EDs are fine.Character: Love and hate relationship in many ways. If you read any part of my review, I would like if you read this one in particular.Enjoyment: I really liked it, but it definitely has its flaws.OVERALL: I give an 8 as both a perfect average of my scores, and what I generally feel it deserves. Not great, but definitely better than what many have to say about it.Thanks for reading! Any tips would be much appreciated as I have never written a long comment, much less a review of an anime, at any point in my anime career. Look forward to writing more. Thanks again. anime at any point, to a certain degree, I just won't watch it. As I watch more and more, I become pickier, so my completed to dropped ratio becomes smaller and smaller as time goes on; but that's just me.START-O:Story (7/10):I feel as though people are being too hard on this aspect. The story had to focus on the extreme tropes of the characters to introduce them in a dramatic way; I believe, to get you more invested in them. So the first half of the show (more like the first third, but whatever) is focused on character introduction and dramatization of the way they live their lives. Once that is over, it heavily focuses on the drama surrounding the characters in a much more unique way than I have seen in many of the anime is this genre. Its biggest highlight is the hilarious comedic overtone that affects the story as a whole.Art (9/10):A place where this anime really hits me is certainly not in its general character art or its background art, but rather in the hilarious, intentional way it draws its characters. It's absolutely hilarious to watch the way the characters forms change in response to what happens to them or those around them. It was what made me come back after dropping it after episode one, and what kept me laughing hysterically throughout the show. By far my favorite quality of this anime.Sound (8/10):The OP and EDs were pretty great, especially on the art side (affects the above score, obviously). The music definitely fit during the great moments of the show and was overall decent. Not memorable in the least, however. Lastly, I don't pay much attention to the music, so this is as much as I could come up with.Character (7/10):The characters are obviously what made the show as good or as bad as most people feel, I believe. In my opinion, I loved the characters (to a degree). The way they interacted with one another, the inner monologues, the reactions to events, the way they changed flow suddenly occasionally. I loved it all, which is another reason why I enjoyed myself so much. However, they are also all very flawed in many ways. They lack really any depth beyond how they act, so you can't really connect with any of them on a deeper level at all (which can also be a good thing, since it means focusing more on the overall picture; at least for me it did).

Thanks again."", '[Minor Spoilers]Gamers is not a good show. I\'m honestly surprised that so many people like it. It\'s almost like they\'ve never seen a romantic comedy before. It becomes very apparent that the show is not about video games, it\'s about people who play video games. There\'s nothing wrong with that in itself, but the problem is the main characters in this show are not representations of real gamers. I don\'t mean to sound like a teen from 2008, but the main characters are quite literally posers. The entire show tries to pose as something it\'s not. At best, it\'s a quick comedy to watch,...one that you may or may not enjoy based on it\'s humor. The worst transgression of the show is the final episode, but we\'ll touch on that later.The story of Gamers starts off good, but after the initial few episodes it loses it\'s direction and quickly refocuses to basically anything other than games. The mc rejects the heroine\'s offer to join the Games Club, but instead of trying to make him desperately rejoin the club like you\'d think would happen, she just falls in love with him because of his ability to not care about her status in the high school and then doesn\'t care if he joins the club or not. There\'s a whole cast of people introduced in the games club, but they\'re relevant for that single episode, then they\'re not shown on screen again until maybe six episodes later. Basically, the story forgets the games club exists. Games hold little importance in the show, they\'re just things the characters like to do in their free time. The reason Amano gives for not joining the club is bullshit as well, but we\'ll save that for the character section. The story of Gamers is very similar to High Score Girl with a bigger cast and more misunderstandings, except High Score Girl heavily revolved around video games. One hundred percent, High Score Girl was a show about romance and games. Gamers poorly balances romance and games, and instead is 95% romance, 5% games.The art of Gamers is pretty solid to be honest. The colors are attractive and the girls are as well, though this only applies to the main cast. Every other character is drawn pretty average. One of the good parts of the series are when they show the characters playing games themselves. Obviously you can just look up a YouTube video of the game in action, but it\'s pleasing when the characters play games then you can actually see them playing the game instead of seeing them hovering over an arcade machine frantically pressing buttons. The execution of how games are portrayed reminds me of High Score Girl as well. The opening animation is good, seeing the characters portrayed in different games is fun. It\'s nothing new though, just what you\'d expect from a show seemingly about games.I don\'t rate sound by background music, but by opening and ending songs and voice acting (sometimes). The opening was alright but generic. It\'s so generic that I can\'t remember how it went at all, and it\'s only been a bit over two weeks since I finished the show. The ending I skipped every episode because I didn\'t like it the first couple of times I heard it, so I really can\'t speak on it. I watched the dubbed version of the show and I think the casting was done really well. Amano\'s voice actor was unfamiliar, but he did a good job translating Amano\'s wimpyness onto screen. I didn\'t like Tendo\'s voice actor. Whenever she talks she\'s whining or being weird. That\'s more of the character\'s writing fault than the voice actor\'s to be fair.The characters in this show by themselves are really annoying but when they all come together to interact they can be funny. I really dislike Amano as a character though. It\'s like the writers couldn\'t decide if he was a gaming addict or just a casual gamer. He says things like he spent three nights in a row playing a game and beating it repeatedly, but he doesn\'t ever look like he\'s done an all-nighter. The only game we see him actively playing other than arcade games are that mobile game he plays, which is the only game he shows real dedication to playing. The show tries to portray him like a toned down Keima Katsuragi, but he really isn\'t. He\'s just a guy who plays games. He\'s not a real gamer. Tendo on the other hand seems more dedicated to games than Amano, but we also never see her actively playing games other than one scene here and there. One of the best characters in the cast is Amano\'s best friend, Uehara. Uehara reminds me a lot of Yuuji Sakamoto from Baka & Test. Uehara engineers a lot of the mischief in the show, and he likes games but he doesn\'t pose to enjoy them more than he really does, like Amano does. Other than those three, I really don\'t have much to say about the characters. Uehara\'s girlfriend is particularly annoying throughout the entire show. She seems to be the idiot falling for all of the misunderstandings, and even contributing to most of them. On the last episode especially, she becomes infuriating...Which leads me into the enjoyment of the show. Gamers is a mindless comedy to watch. Nothing more, nothing less. Some jokes are funny, others are not. Throughout the show they use gamer terms for real life things and it\'s simply cringe. For example, they\'ll say phrases like, ""I just got OWNED on my quiz!"" or ""That quiz has my health super low and I have to eat lunch to heal!"" throughout the show. This dialogue needs to go away. It\'s simply cringe to people who actually play games, as no real gamer talks like this in real life. Even Keima Katsuragi, the God of gal-games, doesn\'t talk like that in his regular grammar. One of the most unfunny parts of the show is the last episode. For whatever reason, they decided to make the last episode educational, like it was an episode of Sesame Street or something. This is extremely insulting to the audience. After watching the entire series and hearing them mention many ""gamer"" phrases and terms, they decide to educate us on what DLC is in a filler episode for the last episode. First of all, who does filler on the last episode? Second of all, why would it choose the end of the show to explain terms they\'ve been using during the entire show? The show would\'ve benefitted more if they placed this episode in the middle of the series, then put the second to last episode as the last episode. Even narrative wise the episode makes NO SENSE. Aguri starts questioning why they like video games when there\'s harmful things like DLC in them, then starts attacking them all as ""gamers"". This is the end of the series, mind you, and Aguri has already been around these gamers for months at this point, she should not just begin questioning their motive behind loving the genre.I don\'t want to ramble on because the show honestly isn\'t worth it, but I\'ll say it again: Gamers is not a good show. It is very average. Sure, it\'s a good watch when you have nothing else to do but I presume it wasn\'t in any runnings for best anime of the season during it\'s time, nor will it ever be. I rated the show a 5 Overall. Very average, even amongst the average. It\'s a poor attempt to copy the cast of Baka and Test, and a poor attempt at an anime. The mangaka should go back to the drawing board one that you may or may not enjoy based on it\'s humor.

What it does not have is any interest in taking those elements and building anything with it.

Early on it plays lip service to them, but around episode 4 it drops that concept to focus on a run of the mill miscommunication based romance schlock -fest.This series has charm, but there isn\'t really any reason to watch.

I got super excited by the opening because of the mini homage they did for Street Fighter which is an all time favorite game of mine. As I went on with actually sitting down and watching this it slowly began to irritate me and bore me.Honestly the first 6 episodes are alright but get pretty bad as they go on.Out of the 5 characters Amano is the only one I was able to relate to during certain scenes....Other than that none of the characters were great. I didn't really like Karen as a character, from what I understood she was trying to keep appearances up and then eventually became a boy hungry girl.  One of the things that was most annoying was having introduced Konoha, she provided nothing but dragging on this whole desu desu liking Amano.The faces were honestly were all that kept me going they could get pretty funny at times. I thought episode 2 was great because of how they told how Aguri and  Uehara met. The anime seemed really dragged on with the whole misunderstandings and I can't believe they couldn't just settle things once and for all instead of having these meet ups and trying to catch people in lies.I know this anime is suppose to be about misunderstandings but why is it titled Gamers??? Its almost false advertisement except for the fact that desu desu is a game developer, and a good portion of the cast avidly plays video games. I wouldn't recommend this anime at all, I trudged through it thinking it would get better but sadly it doesn't.  The ending was very anticlimactic and episode 12 I didn't even bother watching because I was told the anime honestly finishes with episode 11. Other than that none of the characters were great.

I genuinely laughed quite hard at certain points and the visual gags were pretty good.Good if you want a little gamer based romantic drama and shenanigans. giving it a 5 is because some facial expressions and overall humor was on point.

When I saw the title and premise of this show that was certainly my first thought anyway, and as a non-gamer I had little interest in what I assumed was just a lazy cash-grab aimed at a completely different demographic to myself, but then it...got a Simuldub so... here I am 12 episodes later.The more I watched the show and saw others' reactions to it, the more I realised this show was definitely not aimed at me both because I'm not a gamer and because I don't particularly care for romance anime, but despite feeling frustrated with the show at times because of both these things I still came back week after week. For that reason I'd say Gamers! is still a good quality show generally even if it's not personally for me, and I'm glad I watched it for that reason if nothing else.So, what specifically did I find frustrating here? It isn't, as you might expect, that I didn't understand any of the terms used or the references made - I only remember one or two odd lines I didn't understand throughout the whole show and even though there were a lot of references I didn't know, I was expecting that so it didn't bother me - the real problem I had throughout was the way the show seemed to revere gamers as some kind of rare, distinct species separate from regular humans with a hobby non-gamers couldn't possibly ever get their heads around. The portrayal of Aguri, the lone non-gamer in the group of friends, illustrated this whenever she talked about games with the others with the last episode in-particular really trying to hammer this point home. Now I must say I, personally, don't play games because my visual impairment makes it near impossible and I don't enjoy watching others play games, but I still understand why other people find them fun. Aguri, however, seems unable to wrap her head around this idea at all, which I found infuriating. All humans like doing fun, challenging things and while it may be hard to understand the motivations of more extreme gamers, none of the characters in this group of friends could be considered extreme - they're just dedicated fans and it isn't rocket science to understand why they like gaming, yet the show presents the idea that games are fun like it's some little-known nugget of wisdom only the chosen few know.In the end this was my biggest gripe with the show, as even though I didn't care for the romcom elements I still found all the characters (bar the protagonist, but alas you can't have everything) very likeable and fun and everything felt like it was executed well generally. I can't say I'd ever want to re-watch Gamers! but it certainly wasn't a bad experience, which is more than I can say for some shows of its ilk. got a Simuldub so... here I am 12 episodes later.The more I watched the show and saw others' reactions to it, the more I realised this show was definitely not aimed at me both because I'm not a gamer and because I don't particularly care for romance anime, but despite feeling frustrated with the show at times because of both these things I still came back week after week.

Here we are. It\'s finally over people... Misunderstandings the Anime is finished, and has left me feeling robbed and empty after having such an unfulfilling ending that gave me no closure. Lets get into it shall we?*MAJOR SPOILER BELOW*Story: 6The story here gets a 6, mainly because it was pretty decent from the start, but then the amount of pointless misunderstandings that actually aren\'t very relatable to myself (since I am a pretty heavy gamer/Otaku) just hit me real hard. I felt like they kind of wasted a lot of valuable assets when it came to those countless misunderstandings. I was actually...really interested when Tendou and Amano got together. What I really wanted to see was some more actual development and depth with their relationship, not just stupid misunderstandings that could easily have been resolved with a few words (better yet, just leave that s*** out of the damn anime). Yes, I understand, the characters are supposed to be that way, but honestly speaking, no gamers I know actually think the way some of these characters did, or like, overthink like they did.Art: 9Art gets a 9 here. I just liked the art style thats all. Character design was pretty good, but Amano was pretty bland when it came to looks, but that\'s just part of his character, so I\'ll let it slide.Sound: 7Nothing too special or bad for the sound here. OP was ok, ED was ok, so I didn\'t have any problems here.Character: 5Here we are, the Character section. Now, everyone who watched this Anime can agree, that Amano is a rather bland character. Sure, he does have a little more that meets the eye, but like, I feel that him representing a gamer is kind of unfair. A lot of people think that gamers are people that are really shy and somewhat hard to talk to. In some cases, that\'s true, but at the same time, why couldn\'t they at least make him slightly less of a dense f***boy and give him some more  personality? I feel like gamers IRL are actually really interesting when it comes to personality. As a gamer my self, I can say that my personality is one of my more appealing traits. The, ""being shy"" part of the Anime was fairly relatable, but it was slightly over the top.Enjoyment: 7I kind of enjoyed this Anime, but honestly speaking, the ending was absolutely dreadful. It gave me no closure, left me feeling absolutely cucked in terms of how much time I invested into it, and I just wish that they didn\'t just s**t out a garbage ending.Overall: 7I really considered giving this an 8, but the ending really just killed everything for me.

Another adaptation of light novel about a rom-com focused on otaku high school students who like to play video games. It is true that we didn\'t have enough similar animes and studio Pine Jam was kind enough to realize it. A big thank-you.Gamers! is your seasonal generic anime and my expectations weren\'t high but it is not even satisfying because it tries to be funny by repeating gags based on misunderstandings all along the anime till this concept is exhausted.We have a series with a lambda protagonist named Keita Amano who loves to play video games. He will meet progressively people who share...his passion (or not): the popular Karen Tendo (who is beautiful and likes to play video games), the ikemen Uehara (big lol) with his girlfriend Aguri (aka ""gal"") and Chiaki Hoshinomori, a secluded and shy girl who plays video games and who will often quarrel with Keita Amano because they will have slightly different tastes.(Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)All that Keita Amano says and does makes me cringe. He does not agree with Karen Tendo because he thinks he must play by having fun and not being competitive. The idea does not even come to mind that he could do both as well. Have fun and be competitive and I\'m sure a lot of people prefer to play in this way. If you play without interest to win or play correctly, then this means more a lack of self-confidence that you will voluntarily ignore. Gradually, talking with Tendo Karen (who mainly plays by being competitive), Keita Amano will review her judgment and incidentally fall in love.Furthermore, Amano doesn\'t understand love relationships. He thinks that life happens as in visual novels and as a result he will train to understand girls through visual novels. But what an absurd idea! life and games have nothing to do (what Uehara will point out to him). I complain when I see this type of behavior because the anime portrays a negative image of the otaku gamer, assuming that he only lives in 2D and is unable to understand anything to real life. I understand that it is a comedy but surprisingly the anime tries to give a more serious tone in these moments.(By the way, let\'s also point out that Keita Amano buys at cost price his video games in shops and never on the Internet.)The other male protagonist is Uehara. A high school student who has a lot of friends and a girlfriend called Aguri. He doesn\'t care so much about his girlfriend and often forgets her. He is more interested in Keita Amano (Is he gay?) because he saw that this unpopular guy was discussing with Karen Tendo and that the latter had a fit when Keita refused to register for the club. He tries to become a friend with Keita and helps him find a girlfriend who also plays video games. So he suggests that Keita talk to Chiaki. The latter proves to be (surprise ! surprise !) Keita\'s only friend because they have already met on a mobile game. But the two concerned don\'t know. Obviously Uehara, satisfied to hear this news (without the other two being aware) would like them to go out together.He thinks that Keita and Chiaki can live as a couple because they both love video games. Sorry? It\'s completely stupid. Such a couple is completely improbable. It is not because you have a common passion that everything will go well for the rest of your life as a couple. This type of relationship is completely fragile and has no future.Regarding the female characters, I appreciate them although they are not coherent. Aguri is a girl who goes out with Uehara but becomes jealous because she sees Uehara with Chiaki and suspects him of going out with Tendo as well. Karen Tendo is a very popular girl who wants Keita to join her video games club. Surprisingly, the anime seems to assume from the first episodes that gamers do not have many friends and often feel isolated as we can see with Keita and Chiaki but not with Tendo. I don\'t know if the passion of Tendo is secret but if it is the case, it is improbable since the club of video games seems quite visible and that some people are already in this club. Following Keita\'s refusal, Tendo gradually falls in love with Keita and follows him like a stalker. She will try to get closer and they will go out together. Why is she interested in Keita while receiving daily declarations of love from other boys? Do not ask me, it\'s a mystery.Honestly, it\'s hard for me to describe the characters more, because their personality is inconsistent. It evolves according to the needs of the scenario. If Karen Tendo is to react as a tsundere at a specific time, she will. If Uehara is to behave like a fool by gesticulating stupidly, he will. If Aguri must be angry with her boyfriend (Uehara) because she has seen him with another girl, she will either do it or not. Only the scenario decides. The characters do not behave logically. The characters are deliberately stupid and this facilitates all the more the setting up of the misunderstandings in the plot.And thus all misunderstandings are based on random reactions of the characters. They don\'t try to think much longer about their situation, their real relationship with their boyfriend or girlfriend. They only believe what they see and it\'s insane. If tomorrow I see my girlfriend walking with another man, I won\'t directly assume she\'s unfaithful, right? But it\'s different for Gamers\' characters. Two or three coincidences are enough so that the character feels betrayed. At no time do the characters really decide to reason and go quietly to discuss with their partner to understand what is really going on. They try to get together to play a ridiculous board game that plays even more with their relationships but do nothing concrete to correct misunderstandings.The relations between the characters aren\'t interesting and illogical too. For example, Aguri and Amano will initially ally to know if Uehara actually goes out with Chiaki because they accidentally saw them together once. And to complete the misunderstanding, Chiaki and Uehara think that Aguri and Amano love each other because they happened to see them together in the restaurant. Meanwhile, Amano and Uehara continue to see each other at school without asking a single question, while if at least one of them tries to approach the subject, misunderstandings could have been solved more quickly. So everything is good to continue the same insipid and repetitive comedy. Like manzai gags we can see in the shounen mangas.*Big spoiler*Later, these misunderstandings will create a love triangle. Chiaki aka Mono (her username in the mobile game) hears that Keita is her best friend who has supported her creations from the beginning. Keita doesn\'t know the true identity of Mono. And because plot-convenience, Chiaki says that her little sister is Mono. (I wonder how she could convince her sister) But Keita doesn\'t notice the lie. Even if he is a little suspicious, he doesn\'t try to make the connection between Mono and Chiaki, not once. And so begins our dramatic romance with Chiaki who begins to regret seeing Keita go out with Tendo while she did everything to stop Keita from knowing her identity. She is shy but at one point I wonder why she decides not to reveal anything to Keita. Why suffer so much?As for the Aguri-Uehara couple, it is present only to increase the number of misunderstandings. There is no development in their unstable relationship but obviously no one wants to break despite the lack of trust between the two characters. I pity this poor Aguri frankly because her boyfriend seems to be totally disinterested in her. Actually I almost never saw this couple act like a couple.*End big spoilerThe animation seems cheap. Anyway, I had low expectations of the studio Pine Jam, known for two other lamentable works: one with a magical girl for lolicons and the other with a high school girl who seduces a salaryman because boobs. Overall the faces are drawn roughly and the colors are close to what you can see using paint. The opening sounds like a disgusting mixture of generic J-pop with noisy seiyuu. Where are the great performances of excellent seiyuu like Nao Touyama or Rie Takahashi? I thought the Japanese were taking this profession more seriously than in the West but apparently the level is falling in Japan.Eventually Gamers! didn\'t try to build romances, trying to give a more interesting place for video games. You can find some references on popular games, whether it is the games that the characters play or the comic scenes where the characters run or make choices such as a visual novel. It was entertaining, nothing exceptional either. Gamers! doesn\'t really deal with interesting themes such as the place of video games in society or the impact of video games on the characters\' daily lives. A series like New Game! is more interesting at this level. I expected at least a series like Genshiken who shows us (comically, I admit) the routine of the otakus. Don\'t waste your time on this series and watch something that can actually satisfy you, for example Made in Abyss if you choose a seasonal show. his passion (or not): the popular Karen Tendo (who is beautiful and likes to play video games), the ikemen Uehara (big lol) with his girlfriend Aguri (aka ""gal"") and Chiaki Hoshinomori, a secluded and shy girl who plays video games and who will often quarrel with Keita Amano because they will have slightly different tastes.(Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)All that Keita Amano says and does makes me cringe.

Aguri is a girl who goes out with Uehara but becomes jealous because she sees Uehara with Chiaki and suspects him of going out with Tendo as well. Karen Tendo is a very popular girl who wants Keita to join her video games club. Surprisingly, the anime seems to assume from the first episodes that gamers do not have many friends and often feel isolated as we can see with Keita and Chiaki but not with Tendo. I don\'t know if the passion of Tendo is secret but if it is the case, it is improbable since the club of video games seems quite visible and that some people are already in this club. Following Keita\'s refusal, Tendo gradually falls in love with Keita and follows him like a stalker. She will try to get closer and they will go out together. Why is she interested in Keita while receiving daily declarations of love from other boys? Do not ask me, it\'s a mystery.Honestly, it\'s hard for me to describe the characters more, because their personality is inconsistent. It evolves according to the needs of the scenario. If Karen Tendo is to react as a tsundere at a specific time, she will. If Uehara is to behave like a fool by gesticulating stupidly, he will. If Aguri must be angry with her boyfriend (Uehara) because she has seen him with another girl, she will either do it or not. Only the scenario decides. The characters do not behave logically. The characters are deliberately stupid and this facilitates all the more the setting up of the misunderstandings in the plot.And thus all misunderstandings are based on random reactions of the characters. They don\'t try to think much longer about their situation, their real relationship with their boyfriend or girlfriend. They only believe what they see and it\'s insane. If tomorrow I see my girlfriend walking with another man, I won\'t directly assume she\'s unfaithful, right? But it\'s different for Gamers\' characters. Two or three coincidences are enough so that the character feels betrayed. At no time do the characters really decide to reason and go quietly to discuss with their partner to understand what is really going on. They try to get together to play a ridiculous board game that plays even more with their relationships but do nothing concrete to correct misunderstandings.The relations between the characters aren\'t interesting and illogical too. For example, Aguri and Amano will initially ally to know if Uehara actually goes out with Chiaki because they accidentally saw them together once. And to complete the misunderstanding, Chiaki and Uehara think that Aguri and Amano love each other because they happened to see them together in the restaurant. Meanwhile, Amano and Uehara continue to see each other at school without asking a single question, while if at least one of them tries to approach the subject, misunderstandings could have been solved more quickly. So everything is good to continue the same insipid and repetitive comedy. Like manzai gags we can see in the shounen mangas.*Big spoiler*Later, these misunderstandings will create a love triangle. Chiaki aka Mono (her username in the mobile game) hears that Keita is her best friend who has supported her creations from the beginning. Keita doesn\'t know the true identity of Mono. And because plot-convenience, Chiaki says that her little sister is Mono. (I wonder how she could convince her sister) But Keita doesn\'t notice the lie. Even if he is a little suspicious, he doesn\'t try to make the connection between Mono and Chiaki, not once. And so begins our dramatic romance with Chiaki who begins to regret seeing Keita go out with Tendo while she did everything to stop Keita from knowing her identity. She is shy but at one point I wonder why she decides not to reveal anything to Keita. Why suffer so much?As for the Aguri-Uehara couple, it is present only to increase the number of misunderstandings. There is no development in their unstable relationship but obviously no one wants to break despite the lack of trust between the two characters. I pity this poor Aguri frankly because her boyfriend seems to be totally disinterested in her. Actually I almost never saw this couple act like a couple.*End big spoilerThe animation seems cheap. Anyway, I had low expectations of the studio Pine Jam, known for two other lamentable works: one with a magical girl for lolicons and the other with a high school girl who seduces a salaryman because boobs. Overall the faces are drawn roughly and the colors are close to what you can see using paint. The opening sounds like a disgusting mixture of generic J-pop with noisy seiyuu. Where are the great performances of excellent seiyuu like Nao Touyama or Rie Takahashi? I thought the Japanese were taking this profession more seriously than in the West but apparently the level is falling in Japan.Eventually Gamers! didn\'t try to build romances, trying to give a more interesting place for video games. You can find some references on popular games, whether it is the games that the characters play or the comic scenes where the characters run or make choices such as a visual novel. It was entertaining, nothing exceptional either. Gamers! doesn\'t really deal with interesting themes such as the place of video games in society or the impact of video games on the characters\' daily lives. A series like New Game! is more interesting at this level. I expected at least a series like Genshiken who shows us (comically, I admit) the routine of the otakus. Don\'t waste your time on this series and watch something that can actually satisfy you, for example Made in Abyss if you choose a seasonal show.', ""Gamers! left me feeling mixed enough to write my second MAL review on an anime, so that's something.~~The TL;DR of this review is basically: it's fine, and enjoyable enough, and from where I'm at in the LN it's probably worth an 8 out of 10 or so - *if you watch it with the intention/understanding that you'll need to read the LN to finish the story*. Without including the LN, I'm giving it a 6.~~As a pretty hardcore gamer myself, and a fan of slice of life, romcom, and all that good stuff, Gamers! is one that I had to check out at some point....It had been collecting dust for a long time, but I finally got around to it.The characters are good and fun. The art style is nice. The plot is energetic. There's a fair bit to like about it. The issue is, there are a few things that really dragged it down for me:* Practically every conflict is caused by miscommunication. This in itself isn't bad, and there are some masterpieces out there built on the premise. The issue is how ridiculous the miscommunication is. I get it; some of these characters are socially stunted, but it's taken to such an extreme that it can't help but be frustrating at times.* The series ends extremely prematurely. Episode 11 didn't seem like the end point - but it practically was, as episode 12 was basically just side-story. A lot of major plot points don't get resolved, and the relationship status of characters can only be described as weird.The worst part? I was so intrigued by what happened afterwards, I started reading the light novel. And I'm really enjoying it! I suspect that there wasn't enough of it finished yet when the anime was greenlit and being made, and the hope was that if it did well enough there'd be a season 2 for it - but people likely felt similarly to me (disatisfied with a few things) so season 2 was an unachievable dream.The moment at the end of the theme park (in the LN), and the events that happen in the days immediately afterwards - those would have been extremely intriguing to the viewers. They could have even left season 1 with that as a cliffhanger, and you would have immediately had a lot of interest in a season 2, or at least pushed up the LN interest and sales. Instead, it ends on what I can only describe as a whimper. Actually, the DLC final episode leaves a little bit of a bad taste; I feel like in this case they're almost screaming at us that the LN is the DLC for those that enjoyed the series. -.- It had been collecting dust for a long time, but I finally got around to it.The characters are good and fun.

Overall, it's mostly fine, with a couple of things that make it frustrating or annoying.All the characters are fairly well-developed and the story is pretty straightforward, but most of the comedy comes from all the characters obliviously saying things that can be easily misinterpreted and these misunderstandings happen like 5 times per episode. None of the characters are ever on the same page and constantly believe certain things are going on that actually aren't(someone cheating on their SO, someone being in love with someone they aren't, etc). While I find this kind of humor a little grating on...it's own, it's usually ok in small doses, however it's so constant in this and it's pretty much the entire framework of the show. 90% of the conflict in the show would be resolved if they just talked to each other. To be fair, the show is somewhat satirically self-aware of this at some points and tries to lampshade it, but it's still too central to the show for me to fully enjoy it without getting a bit frustrated. Also, some of the character's choices are a little perplexing and obtuse at times, which exacerbate things.There are some fun comedy moments and some interesting video game related juxtaposition and allegory here and there. Some of the video game scenes and recreations are fun and decently produced.Overall, I'd say it's mostly fine and certainly watchable, but some of the aspects I outlined above make it harder to recommend. it's own, it's usually ok in small doses, however it's so constant in this and it's pretty much the entire framework of the show. 90% of the conflict in the show would be resolved if they just talked to each other.

The story is mostly about our 5 protagonist who are avid videogame enthusiasts (most of them anyway) and how they deal with teenage romance. And man, was it also really fun to watch.The strongest point here in the series is probably the way these guys handle misunderstandings, or actually, how much they suck at handling them. Yes, this story is more about misunderstandings with romance than games and that's good! I was...expecting yet another club-based series where we see the daily shenanigans of our characters while they play games and just be kawaii and shit. But that was absolutely smacked down to the ground on the very first episode. This isn't a club anime, this is a story about love and friendship, and how if we don't express what we really feel then silly things are bound to happen.One of the biggest, most incredible things about the series is the punchline delivered midway through the season, a scene that took several episodes to build a momentum so high so they could drop the bomb on us in a way that made that episode one of the best ones I can remember from recent years in a series. From that point on the story takes another turn and focuses more on the relationships between characters and the way they really feel about each another.Every single character is also great, each having their own personalities and quirks but without forgetting that they are all still teenagers, and the way they handled romance and failed miserably was hilarious. The situations they are presented, either during their romantic ordeals or afterwards were also well handled and awkward but in a cute and good way, they're teenagers after all living in the real world.One of the negative points here is probably the production. The animation in some episodes is just terrible, but that's fair considering there's not even action here. There's also not really a set story, nor a progressive plot, just teens being teens and playing games from time to time. But I guess that's my only complaint with the series, everything else was just pretty damn good.So in short: this is a romantic comedy, not a club-based series with a slice of life. The comedy is hilarious and the characters really charming. There's not too much of a conflict here, so this series will be enjoyed by people who are more into harmless stuff and comedy than action packed conflicts. And I? As a romantic comedy junkie I enjoyed it a lot.FINAL SCORE: 9 out of 10. expecting yet another club-based series where we see the daily shenanigans of our characters while they play games and just be kawaii and shit.

Loner Amano-kun gets the school idol to fall for him, and a romantic wacky hijinks ensues. Seems pretty cliché, but I don\'t really care how unoriginal a show is anyways. What matters to me is how shows execute these ideas to form interesting stories and likeable characters. So let\'s dive in.Story 6(9)/10:The first thing to note is that while the story is pretty interesting, there is a huge problem with the pacing. Now it isn\'t as bad as it sounds, the pacing problem doesn\'t occur in the middle of episodes but rather between episodes. In some...episodes, notably episode 3 and 6, the romance and comedy goes blazing forward, pushing me to the edge of my seat and wanting to see more. In other episodes however, like episode 4 and 12, the show slows to a crawl, and after a couple of minutes you\'ll to start to realise that this episode pretty has nothing to do with continuing the story whatsoever but rather delves into a side story.The last few episodes also drop the score for me considerably, as the series ends with barely any of the conflicts that arose during the show resolved at the end. While the characters still got together halfway through the show they don\'t really show any signs of developing at all, even though they spend a lot of time together and such.Though I still really enjoyed the episodes that progressed the plot and were funny and interesting, and the relationships that develops during those episodes are also interesting and entertaining to watch. In order to enjoy this show to the fullest and avoid the pacing issues I will recommend you to skip a few episodes listed below and read my summary instead.Episode 4: Shows Karens life, and shows her spending time with amano in an arcade. They\'re relationship does not change at all, and in fact it\'s kinda infuriating as nothing is resolved.Episode 7: Karen and Amano go on a date to the pool, but they run into Chiaki along the way too. Similar to episode 4, nothing really changes.Episode 9: Chiaki accidentally reveals to Amano that she is somewhat important to him. But then she says that it\'s her sister for some reason and then Amano just goes ""oh, okay"" and it\'s barely brought up again and doesn\'t impact the story, like what the fuck. Again, nothing changes.Episode 12: They all go on a trip and talk about DLC\'s. Nothing is changed or resolved. This anime actually ends at episode 11.Now it may seem that the anime is actually shit from my summary above, but don\'t misunderstand. Only those episodes are shit. The other episodes range from decent to amazing. If you skip these episodes the story easily jumps to a 9 out of 10.Characters 7/10:The first thing to note with these characters is that while the characters themselves aren\'t too phenomenal, the way they interact with each other or in other words the character dynamics are amazing and entertaining. This is one of the reason why those episodes above are bad. This story needs the whole or almost the whole cast to be together in order to be entertaining, and that\'s a good thing since the majority of the show has all the characters together. But still, let\'s analyse the characters.Amano: Your classic loner character that is actually pretty friendly. He\'s okay and he sparks some of the hilarious misunderstandings, but without Uehara with him he\'s pretty bland, and that\'s one of the reasons the episodes above were bad.Karen: The perfect girl that develops an deep love for Amano. She\'s also pretty boring and bland when she\'s perfect, as with most perfect characters. The only way to keep perfect characters interesting and not irritating is to construct comedy around them, and this show does it pretty well most of the time. And that\'s another one of the reasons the episodes above were bad.Uehara: The actual main character of the show IMO. He\'s a representation of the reader really, understanding most of the plot and plays the straight man that doesn\'t usually go stupid. He\'s also really funny and brings the other characters together in an amazing comedy harmony. His presence is one of the reasons why the show is so funny and fast paced. This show won\'t be anything without him.Aguri: Pretty interesting and good. Nothing really much to say.Chiaki: Also pretty decent character, though her refusal to let Amano know that she\'s someone special to him is pretty infuriating.Konoha: Now I\'m not sure why they even introduced this character to begin with so late in the show. Not to mention she does nothing to contribute to the romance and instead makes the misunderstandings a whole lot worse.Music and Art: Don\'t really care, I skipped the OP\'s and ED\'s most of the time and I find that the most important part a show is the plot and characters anyways, not the music or art. Even shows with shit art like welcome to the NHK are amazing.Enjoyment 6/10:I\'d say I enjoyed this show quite a bit. While it can be infuriating at times especially during the episodes that didn\'t progress the plot whatsoever, and another part of the show that can be annoying is that the show doesn\'t really resolve a lot of the conflicts set up, but aside from that the show is still funny and the romance is still entertaining.

Well almost all of the characters that we are talking about in our relationship zone are gamers and gaming is used as another element of comedy and story driving mechanic. Sort of like K ON but the topic is used to a lesser extent.In the end I give this anime a 7/10', 'So, U are searching for animes about games? I have to tell u, this is NOT for you. This Anime is about everything, less games. So, u have romance, some comedy and misunderstandings a lot (that should be the anime name).This anime was my first, and watched expectating an anime about games, but is actually I romance. U have the idol school girl falling in love by the one of the mostly cliche and inexpressive charcters that u will see in ur whole life, the protagonist.But even with this protagonist that has a boring personality, I liked this anime. The other chars are awersome,...the comedy really works for me. In my opinion, has an one single problem: they does not went any place with the relationship of the couples: as they started, they end up.so,__Story and Charcter__8Has really fun  charcters, and the plot about one of them and her relationship with the protagonist is juicy.__ Art and Sound__7Has a normal animation, nothing special, and a good sound desing work. About the comedy, the surprised element  is one of the most importantly things to something being funny, and the productors used misundertandings to do that. So, it works sometimes, but if u watch 3 or 4 episodes at one time, maybe it will be a little predictable, so watch one episode at a time.__Enjoyment__8One of the other thing that a comedy anime needs its great voice actors, they need to do a good work, without that, u have fifty percent of chance to dont get fun with the comedy (the audio an visual has the same importance, in my opinion). And in this anime, they did a great work, I really liked their interpretations.__Overall__8So doing a simple average, we have almost eight points, and thats it. the comedy really works for me.

There\'s a scene I\'m still always thinking about to this day where the pink hair girl just says something to the effect of ""Turns out it was all a misunderstanding."" If that doesn\'t sum up this show and pretty much this whole genre into a single sentence I don\'t know what does.Gamers does have a refreshing take on some things. For one protagonist-kun is pretty hilariously completely oblivious to how much all the girls seem to be in love with him, and the way he completely rejects joining their club was pretty funny....The expectation is that he\'s the typical blank slate protagonist who finds meaning in his life for the first time when introduced to a new hobby via a club or something and suddenly that becomes his life from that point on, but instead he\'s like ""nah, I\'m good."" It reminded me of that part in Mob Psycho with the body improvement club.The games themselves are done fairly realistically, about as much as can be expected in something like this. I\'m always pretty critical of the way media portrays games, and it\'s nice to see the hobby represented accurately every now and then. The reason protagonist doesn\'t want to get involved with them is that he sees the dedication they put into it and he just wants to be able to play the games for fun. I get that, it\'s how I used to think about Super Smash Bros until I started getting really competitive with it. I think it\'s daunting to see how much time and effort someone has put into a hobby and just that barrier for entry alone can scare newcomers away.All the relationship stuff and love triangles and comedy are about what you\'d expect from any other slice of life show, nothing new can really be done there when it\'s all already been done a thousand times before. That doesn\'t make it bad, nothing wrong with sticking to the established format. It\'s comforting, in a way. Overall I give Gamers a 7/10, decent show.

They barely even mention the premise of games throught the whole anime. They basiacly just give it to you all on the first episode as a ""please don.\'t go! Its about games I swear!! look... games!"" then after the first episode you completely forget its about games. Its a generic love story harem thats just as boring as the main character.

The sound was fun and lighthearted, with some occasional chiptune and game noises that fit in well with the action on the screen.CharacterThis was one...of the aspects of this anime that I just couldn't get over. I watched dubbed but went back and watched a little of the sub just to see if it was the English VAs that were bothering me. It wasn't.The main male protagonist has to be, hands down, the most obnoxious romcom male MC I've seen so far. I'm used to characters in romcoms being fairly clueless since the main conflict is high school kids coming to terms with new feelings and experiences, but this guy... I actually found myself getting angry while watching and listening to him. I don't know if they were just trying to drive home the fact that this guy has had very few social interactions in his life, but the gamer in me finds it slightly off-putting that a gamer is being portrayed as completely and hopelessly socially inept, as if he has never spoken a single word to another human outside of a video game. In both dub and sub, his voice is just like nails on a chalkboard after awhile, especially when he starts yelling and freaking out about something.StoryThe other aspect I just couldn't rate any higher. Overall, I liked the premise, I wasn't one of the people who assumed this show would be about gaming and nothing else, I went into it knowing that it is a romcom about people who play games.What forced me to give a low score was the fact that this show just beats you over the head mercilessly with misunderstandings. What makes it more frustrating is that they are all verbal misunderstandings that could have been easily avoided if the characters spoke normally instead of just in gratuitously vague statements that could never be interpreted correctly even by someone who isn't as clueless as these characters. This specific issue almost made me quit watching this anime halfway through, but I powered through it.Which brings me to the ending. After watching the end of episode 11 (the actual end of the show, 12 is just a special) I found myself wondering what conflict was resolved, because it just felt like the show got cancelled after that.OverallI didn't hate this show, but I feel like I would have enjoyed it much more if the writers dialed back a bit on the verbal misunderstandings, and if the MC was less whiny and oblivious. of the aspects of this anime that I just couldn't get over.

What I found was a drama with a love pentagonal dodecahedron that relies heavily on having incredibly complicated relationships for ""Comedy"". The writers do this really annoying thing where there like ""Oh wait, this show\'s about gamers!"" and they insert some random gaming reference that\'s incredibly cringey and is not an accurate representation of how actual gaming...enthusiasts talk. This is a perfect example of a company not doing proper research on their target demographic. They made some topical references that gave me a good chuckle but they depict the characters as thinking and speaking entirely in gaming references. I don\'t know about you but I don\'t know anyone who acts like this. It seems like there was one person on the writing team that actually knew what gamers enjoyed and they\'d randomly consult for some info on what to say that would appeal to their audience, but instead of capturing their audience they end up sounding even more condescending and distant.The show has few real redeeming qualities for me and after episode 2 it was demoted to background noise while I do other stuff. The art is uninspired and mediocre. Don\'t go in to this expecting art that will make up for the plot because it\'s not there. The music is forgettable and the audio mixing itself is bad. In one of the episodes there is an audible error in the mixing when they cut the audio. Character\'s are tropey with the protagonist clearly being a boring ""self insert"" character. I\'m not opposed to ""Self Insert"" characters and personally love characters that I can relate to and is one of the main things I look for in an anime, but gamers failed at this. They take a relatively simple otaku gamer character and somehow manage to make him feel annoying and unrelatable by turning so many of his characteristics up to a 10 and dialing them back when it\'s not convenient to the story. The only comedy it possesses outside of the topical references are the confusing and complicated predicaments the characters get in to based on their relationships.This show isn\'t completely devoid of enjoyment. The final episode was actually decent. They actually ignored the drama mostly and showed us a rea, interesting discussion about video games that spanned the whole episode. They talked about whether dlc\'s are good for the gaming industry and consumers alike. If only the whole show was like the last episode it would\'ve made up for it\'s lack of humor. I will admit there was a solid 3 minute scene that consisted almost entirely panning shots of the girls naked, with all the r+ parts barely censored by the waterline, steam, hair, or something else. This scene was almost amusing due to the sheer amount of fan service they packed into the scene especially given that the rest of the anime was relatively devoid of fan service.

I\'m a pretty big GAMERRRRRR, and I feel like sometimes, the shows got a little too, how should I put this, ""OH PIXELS YA GET IT GAMES HAHA"", and that\'s a shame because, besides that, I thought it betrayed games and the industry very well and made me laugh a few times because of the way they poked fun at it, but at the same time being respectful of it. The only other thing I could think of as a problem is that some of...the side characters aren\'t as explored as I would want: probably because of the length of the show. But besides that, all the characters were wonderful. Amano works really well and plays off everyone around him so well. Karen is just, perfect, best girl. Chiaki is a close 2nd as best girl, and I found her relationship with Amano particularly interesting. my favorite character, is probably Uehara, just because his attitude is pretty spot on throughout the show, and you can he tell he grows as a person too. overall, while not perfect, I enjoyed this show quite a lot as a gamer chad and would recommend it as something easy to just enjoy. the side characters aren\'t as explored as I would want: probably because of the length of the show.

Another thing I was frustrated about was how the show never resolved one of the storylines. (that Hoshinomori was Nobe, a game developer that the mc likes) and Mono (an online friend of the mc) Amano never...found out that she was Nobe and Mono OR that she liked him it\'s all just left on a cliffhanger.ARTThe art was mediocre. some parts look kinda weird to be fair. And also in one episode, there is another missed opportunity in the scene where Aguri thinks Uehasu is cheating on her and so Uehasu, Hoshinomori, and Tendou chase Aguri down the street. the art and animation look jolly rather than suspenseful. comparing the school hallway chase scene in the second to the last episode of Toradora. there is a difference between the two and in my opinion, the Toradora scene looks a lot better Than the one in gamers!.SOUNDI don\'t really have anything to say, the voice actors did a good job. The music was pretty good actually I have the songs on Spotify. But the music doesn\'t fit some of the scenes. For example in the scenes that could be dramatic and suspenseful, it does happy music not suspenseful or even sad music. And even with the happy scenes, it does slower and sadder sounding music.CHARACTEROkay, you\'re going to have to sit down for this one. The characters and their personalities suck.(the characters)Tendou Karen is portrayed as the school idol and is super popular but is kinda just mentioned in some select episodes and nothing else like for example in the first episode when Tendou walks up to Amano and tries to invite him into the video game club it\'s not mentioned (until a few episodes in) that Tendou turns down a lot of people wanting to start a relationship with her, what they could have done is... when she walks into the video game store it portrays that Amano has a crush on Tendou and has wanted to tell her about it many times but was always told that she turns people down a lot and so thinks that he\'s invisible to her but she talks to him and then awkwardness and hijinks ensue. Better right? 5/10Amano could be in a harem anime and actually blend in. he\'s supposed to be an awkward, nerdy klutz and that\'s it. He annoys me a lot.3/10Aguri is Uehara\'s girlfriend and she is supposed to be like kushieda Minori from Toradora y\'know always on the bright side but still has emotions she\'s not a one-sided character, the writers tried to portray that but they didn\'t do a good job. In the scene where she does cry (I mean scene as in singular scene) the music and the way the scene is animated doesn\'t make it sound like she\'s running away and crying it makes look and sound like she\'s in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, I love Tom and Jerry but if you got Tom and Jerry background music and replaced it with the Toradora school hallway running scene\'s music it wouldn\'t fit, more so if you put Tom and Jerry music into the Toradora scene.Uehara is just... boring. he had an interesting? backstory. basically, he used to be a geek and he ""busted his ass"" trying to become popular. that\'s all I have to sayHoshinomori she\'s written pretty well actually in the words of Laurel and Hardy \'I have nothing to say""OVERALLThis show is the Poster Child for just okay at best it\'s mediocre at its worst it\'s still mediocre. it\'s not good but it\'s not bad. I give it a 5/10 thank you for reading. found out that she was Nobe and Mono OR that she liked him it\'s all just left on a cliffhanger.ARTThe art was mediocre. some parts look kinda weird to be fair. And also in one episode, there is another missed opportunity in the scene where Aguri thinks Uehasu is cheating on her and so Uehasu, Hoshinomori, and Tendou chase Aguri down the street. the art and animation look jolly rather than suspenseful. comparing the school hallway chase scene in the second to the last episode of Toradora. there is a difference between the two and in my opinion, the Toradora scene looks a lot better Than the one in gamers!.SOUNDI don\'t really have anything to say, the voice actors did a good job. The music was pretty good actually I have the songs on Spotify. But the music doesn\'t fit some of the scenes. For example in the scenes that could be dramatic and suspenseful, it does happy music not suspenseful or even sad music. And even with the happy scenes, it does slower and sadder sounding music.CHARACTEROkay, you\'re going to have to sit down for this one. The characters and their personalities suck.(the characters)Tendou Karen is portrayed as the school idol and is super popular but is kinda just mentioned in some select episodes and nothing else like for example in the first episode when Tendou walks up to Amano and tries to invite him into the video game club it\'s not mentioned (until a few episodes in) that Tendou turns down a lot of people wanting to start a relationship with her, what they could have done is... when she walks into the video game store it portrays that Amano has a crush on Tendou and has wanted to tell her about it many times but was always told that she turns people down a lot and so thinks that he\'s invisible to her but she talks to him and then awkwardness and hijinks ensue. Better right? 5/10Amano could be in a harem anime and actually blend in. he\'s supposed to be an awkward, nerdy klutz and that\'s it. He annoys me a lot.3/10Aguri is Uehara\'s girlfriend and she is supposed to be like kushieda Minori from Toradora y\'know always on the bright side but still has emotions she\'s not a one-sided character, the writers tried to portray that but they didn\'t do a good job. In the scene where she does cry (I mean scene as in singular scene) the music and the way the scene is animated doesn\'t make it sound like she\'s running away and crying it makes look and sound like she\'s in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, I love Tom and Jerry but if you got Tom and Jerry background music and replaced it with the Toradora school hallway running scene\'s music it wouldn\'t fit, more so if you put Tom and Jerry music into the Toradora scene.Uehara is just... boring. he had an interesting? backstory. basically, he used to be a geek and he ""busted his ass"" trying to become popular. that\'s all I have to sayHoshinomori she\'s written pretty well actually in the words of Laurel and Hardy \'I have nothing to say""OVERALLThis show is the Poster Child for just okay at best it\'s mediocre at its worst it\'s still mediocre. it\'s not good but it\'s not bad.

The actual show isn't all that good, but the English dub is so genuinely good it makes it truly entertaining to watch. Every single voice actor sounds like they *are* the character and made them come to life with some pretty genuine feeling personalities, which for anime dubs feels pretty unheard of.The actually story is pretty unremarkable, but (at least in terms of the dub) the acting made the gags bearable and the intentionally cringey parts funny enough to at least smile at, so while I think the actual premise of...the show isn't all that interesting, the execeution was really quite fun. The romcom aspect of the show is based around the idea of a comedy of errors, which it really does do quite a good job of, and the misunderstandings were funnier than they were frustrating. It's not like the characters' personalities really went anywhere interesting, but they all had their time in the spotlight and (varying degrees of) development. At the very least, they were all multifaceted characters who held their own little surprises, and certainly didn't feel flat or boring (minus a couple side characters). The art was nice, but especially shone when it served to punctuate the comedy (guilty faces, sweating bullets, or the ever-present arguing), and was definitely suffiect at the least.I think if you're starved for good dubbed anime, or are at least willing to watch a dubbed romcom anime (because seriously, the dub is not only so much better than the sub but actually so good it *elevates* the show), Gamers! is genuinely worth a watch.

I haven\'t watched the sub so maybe this is a Ghost Stories-esque situation as I found the English dialogue felt pretty natural.First and foremost, as a comedy if you don\'t like this type of comedy you won\'t like this show as much. The comedy is primarily based on misunderstandings. This show is a RomCom that pokes fun at itself and other typical RomCom tropes, at least at the beginning.Story(Minor Spoilers):I can\'t fully agree that this show is generic, because it starts off as a strong parody show. Episode one sets up the show to be a parody of generic...high school RomComs. The pacing is pretty solid in the first half of the show, but afterwards it slows down. Unfortunately it goes from parody to your average RomCom, which is disappointing. However, the romcom elements still manage to be decent while providing some funny dialogue here and there.Characters:I found that all of the main characters are likeable. They are pretty stupid for the misunderstandings they get into, but are never insufferable. They clearly support each other as friends and never jump the shark in terms of overreactions. All of the characters have solid characterization and have a reason for why each of them act the way they do.Art:The show has a very simplistic art style, with thin lines and a sort of pastel color palette. It\'s nothing to write home about, but its consistent and easy on the eyes. Being a comedy, the show occasionally alternates to other art styles to emphasize a comedic situation. The animation is similarly average with the only outstanding bits of style and animation in the opening. That being said, I never thought the art looked bad or the characters ugly. Its reminiscent of Konosuba\'s art style if it were less cartoonish and animated(which admittedly is why the art style would be good in that show not just fair here).Sound (7):I loved the opening. It has the Japanese voice actors singing the opening song, à la Toradora ED ""Orange"". These types of OP/EDs deserve way more hype. Other than that, the EDs are fine if not forgettable and the theme they play for the intermissions is nice and snappy.Enjoyment:I\'ve watched and re-watched this show. Once as the main object of my attention and afterwards something to enjoy on the side while doing something else. For me its an easy watch. The show starts off strong and doesn\'t have too many annoying anime tropes near the end.Overall:This show is a fun little lighthearted show about gamers trying to interact with each other, stumbling around awkwardly the entire time. high school RomComs.

Is a 2017 slice of life, romance anime, about 5 people who all come together from their love of video games. The series follows shut in nerd Amano, who is content with his anti-social life until the most popular girl in school, Tendou falls in love with him and asks him to join her gaming club, he rejects the offer  but after befriend one of the guys in class 2-F, Uehara, Amano finds himself creating a Game Appreciation Club with some new friends who all entangle themselves in a web of misunderstandings that leads to them all overthinking about every little detail.The characters...are probably the show’s strongest part. Amano is a plain looking, but often funny and unpredictable protagonist who doesn’t let anything get in the way of his love of gaming no matter how bad he is at them. Tendou is the popular girl who lets her feelings for Amano completely overtake her, and is often seen stalking or drooling over our main protagonist, she’s quite endearing and her character design stands out really well compared to the rest of her fellow students. Uehara is probably my favourite character, he’s the hot guy of the group who in the past was made fun of for being a massive nerd, which he tried to hide in order to fit in, until he met Amano and discovered the true reason to why Aguri asked him out is when he accepts the gamer that he really is, it’s always fun to see him scheme to either help fix situations, or have everything go up in flames, and how it usually always backfires on him. Aguri is the only one in the group who is not a gamer, and only has a passing interest because of Uehara, but her friendship with Amano is both positive and pleasant and the fact that she isn’t afraid to stand up for her gamer friends is also quite nice. Last we have Hoshinomori a game developer who has almost all the same views and opinions as Amano, But due to minor differences the two can’t stand each other at the beginning, until she learns that Amano enjoy’s her games, leading to her developing feelings for him. She’s a fun character who throws a wrench into the group dynamics.The story is simple, but is fun and charming, I like how the story likes to purposefully subvert cliches, like how the first episode is basically a massive set up for a single joke, and how they constantly frame Amano like he’s going to win something, only for him to lose miserably each time. The constant questioning of who likes who, and is he/she cheating on me between the cast was fun, however I feel that could of ended nicely after they all played the bored game at Hoshinomori’s house. Which could of given us a bit more room to develop and progress all of the shows main relationships. The couples, Amano & Tendou and Uehara & Aguri. Are both quite cute, however I feel like we don’t get to spend enough time on their relationship due to the constant misunderstandings. And at time’s it doesn’t even feel like Amano & Tendou are actually together. it would have been nice to see a bit more of their relationship’s and their dynamic’s apart from each other.But all and all I had a lot of fun with this anime, and if in the mood would likely watch again. are probably the show’s strongest part.

And at time’s it doesn’t even feel like Amano & Tendou are actually together. it would have been nice to see a bit more of their relationship’s and their dynamic’s apart from each other.But all and all I had a lot of fun with this anime, and if in the mood would likely watch again.', ""First impression of Gamers!? Well, 1 episode gave an impression of your typical rom-com, bland protagonist gets noticed by the hottest girl in school etc. etc.. While the first episode might give you the same vibes as those rom-coms, don't get fooled! Gamers! is really entertaing, while also developing some kind of a plot. While the Amano is obviously the main protagonist of the show, every character have some kind of a story to tell. Plot is not very gripping, dont get me wrong but this show has something that many animes not only(but especially rom-coms) lack- character development. Art and music are definitely not...the advantages of the show, at least for me.

Characters? I can't remember a single name. What makes Gamers great is the constantly shifting alliances and incompetence of the mind games the characters try to play. The first 2 episodes can be a bit of a chore to sit through, but they're important in setting up all the characters before putting them in the blender. The show suffers a bit from bland MC syndrome, however. He gets fleshed out a bit, but the real character growth mostly only occurs to the friends around him. The fan service is negligible, which I appreciate...greatly.

I was interested more so in the beginning and it slowly went down in quality over time.Characters: Another one of those things where it was just simple. The protagonist was not too interesting but not necessarily hateable as a person.Enjoyment: The first episode had me hooked, but then as more episodes went on, it just got weird and started to become something I had to sit through instead of enjoy....Overall:I'm not going to lie here, it was decent for the most part. I can't say it had me hooked the entire time but it was enjoyable to a certain degree. The downfall of this anime (in my eyes) was the ending. I'll still give it a solid 7, but the ending really screwed it. It's not one of those things where the protagonist didn't get with my favorite girl. It went like this: Amano is dating Tendou from I think episode 6 (Half way through). After they get together, Chiaki starts developing feelings for Amano, and they built her up to go and ask him to break up with Tendou and get with her. They put multiple episodes into developing this, and then completely scrapped it in the end. The final episode was more like an OVA than the ending to a RomCom. They seriously did not address it in the end. The final episode consisted of the group going off to a resort and just playing games. Nothing romantic is even mentioned (unless it was to make a small joke). My point is here, they spent half the anime building up to a point, and then scrapped it, which felt like a waste of time in the end.

Watched the first episode and it didn’t hook me. But finally picked it back up and I am not disappointed that I did it was a fun time. I love the trop where the cutest girl in school starts to like the quiet shy main character, any anime with that trop I will like most likely. I really enjoyed the English voice actors on this one (the Japanese were good as always) but the main girl voice actress is one of my favs so that helped me enjoy it more. I think I liked the...English voice dialog better on this one because the gamer lingo jokes hit so much better in spoken than in subtitle forum.

This show has a nice balance of humor and story depth. Usually with anime that portray ""otakus"" they either nail it, or miss the mark. This show knocks it out of the park.This is on par with shows like ""Wotaku"" and ""Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki"". It is a funny portrayal of otakus that is fairly accurate. The show does have a stupidly complex ""romance hexagon"" as they call it within the show. This is all due to the characters being completely stupid when...it comes to human interactions (like most otakus would be lol). The confusion from the romances gets a bit cringey, but thankfully there are enough redeeming parts to make these scenes palletable. it comes to human interactions (like most otakus would be lol). The confusion from the romances gets a bit cringey, but thankfully there are enough redeeming parts to make these scenes palletable.', 'Gamers! is a rom-com following a group of high school students who enjoy playing video games for a variety of reasons. The show consists of 12 episodes which in itself is incredibly short. This is also frustrating when you consider the running gag of this show takes up roughly 4-5 episodes of the 12 total. The characters are all enjoyable in their own sense, sans, Amano in my opinion. The art style is high quality and will age incredibly well. The sound design is nice even if the OP song is a little lackluster. I watched the show dubbed so all of my experiences with...the show is based on that.Story: [ 5 / 10 ]As an avid gamer myself I was really rooting for Gamers! to have a captivating story. The first couple of episodes hooked me in, however, as the show progressed the same running gag of misunderstandings between the main characters and their ""love triangle"" slowly started to interfere with the original purpose of the show. Instead of communicating these differences like upcoming adults would they instead scheme and imagine scenarios that ultimately lead to more conflict.The romance sections of this show also leave much to be desired. Throughout the show, the characters seem to have a 1 step forward 2 steps back approach when it comes to romance. Numerous times throughout the show whenever the viewer thinks Uehara will solidify his appreciation and love for Aguri or Amano will progress his relationship with Tendou it seems to fall flat on its face an episode later. This leads to the whole relationship sequences between each couple feeling half-baked.Thankfully, despite the average story the focus on gaming and the industry as a whole is described extremely well. There are numerous gaming references throughout the intro and show that capture a variety of different gaming genres. Whether it\'s FPS games such as CSGO or PUBG, fighting games such as smash, or even old puzzle games such as Tetris any gamer will appreciate the well-represented references. Another positive, I was laughing at a majority of the episodes. The humor concocted by each character was unique and I believe was a highlight of this rather mediocre show.This ultimately leads to this shows biggest issues. The show had a great premise on games and the creators seem to understand the hobby well enough. If the show would have had focused on gaming with relationships as a secondary it could\'ve been a fantastic anime. The art style and animation being such high quality could\'ve easily carried this. The problem is the creators were worried more about the ""love triangle"" drama than concluding or focusing on certain parts of the story. This is apparent when the gamer club is rarely focused on anymore, the beginning section at the end of episode 12, and so on. I really believe if this show had 24 episodes instead of 12 it could\'ve been fantastic, however, when nearly half of the show is focused on the same running gag that gets irritating after a while it really dilutes the quality of the story being told.Art: [ 8 / 10 ]I had briefly mentioned this in the introduction section, however, I believe it needs to be told in more words. The art and animation in this show are fantastic. The colors are bright and vibrant. The main characters are incredibly detailed. The world space and secondary objects are well depicted. I have no major complaints about this.This further translates to all of the video game references I mentioned in the previous section. Whether it\'s the Mario cart sequence that was well designed and animated, the fighting game in the gamer club at the beginning of the show, or even the smaller games shown throughout. The art/animation team deserves a pat on the back. They did a great job.Sound: [ 7 / 10 ]The opening song was good, however, it wasn\'t really memorable. The ending song ""Fight on!"" was pretty great and helped bump this score from a 6/10 to a 7/10.The sound in Gamers! was pretty good for the most part Whether it was the clink of ice in a drink, the notifications on the phones, or even just subtle sounds that reference popular games e.g: the CSGO sniper section. I think the sound team did a great job too.Characters: [ 6 / 10 ]In Gamers! we have five main characters. Some are fantastic while others leave much to be desired. It is important to note that non of the main characters have any experience with relationships which leads to numerous drama-filled conflicts throughout the show.1. Amano Keita - The main character of the show and also my least favorite. A true video game connoisseur. He prefers multiple genres of games, however, does not enjoy the competitive aspect of them. He views video games as an avenue for fun and enjoyment.  He is shy, awkward, and tends to live within his own bubble. As the show progresses he begins to appreciate and care for his group of friends.2. Tendou Karen - An outgoing beautiful blonde-haired video game enthusiast. She is talked about throughout the entire school and her popularity speaks for itself. She is the ideal student, gamer, and friend. Her video game addiction is hidden from most of the world and only shared between the gamer club and her friend group. Most men of the high school want to be with her, however, she only has her heart set for Amano. In her relationship, she projects herself as insecure, confused, and jealous. This is an inverse of how she appears to others during her day-to-day life. One of my favorite characters in the show and a big portion of this show\'s comedy along with Uehara.3. Tasuku Uehara - An ex-video game addict who puts school popularity above his own desires. He is the love interest of Aguri and really cares for her despite hiding it on the outside. A big portion of the show\'s comedy comes from him and his ability to overthink every single situation presented to him. This ultimately leads to bigger issues created for the entire friend group. He cares for Amanos success in life and often takes the role of a mentor when it comes to his friendship with Amano.4. Aguri - The love interest of Uehara. She is cute and bubbly, however, she is insecure when it comes to her own relationship with Uehara. A distinct difference between Aguri and the other main characters is her lack of interest in video games. She still respects gamers and loves to be around them, however, she has no desire to really play them herself. To Amano, she takes on the sister role and is the voice of reason to Amano, however, to other members of the friend group this relationship is seen more of boyfriend and girlfriend and thus causes further conflict.5. Chiaki Hoshinomori - An avid video game addict and developer of new video games. She enjoys all genres, however, mobile games seem to be her main interest. In terms of personality, she and Amano are identical. This leads viewers to sometimes think she and Amano would be a better pair. Despite the similarities she and Amano share when it comes to games their viewpoints are much different. This leads to conflict between the two despite the help of Uehara as a sort of ""cupid"". Hoshinomori battles insecurity and detests conflict and much prefers her own solitude. Despite all of this she always ends up at the center of conversation for much of the show.Each character is unique and for the most part enjoyable in some way. Tendou and Uehara are great comedy relief throughout the show, however, when they are serious this really allows the viewer to understand them. Aguri, while bubbly and sometimes ditsy is a great friend and really cares about the various members of the group. Hoshinomori is a neutral member of the group and really adds to the group\'s discussions of video games and various topics. Her own feelings are pushed to the back burner throughout the entire show. This has the viewers seeing her as more of an underdog. Finally, Amano, the reason why the characters are a lower score than they should be. The main character of the show left me as a viewer more frustrated than excited. Between his obvious inability to further his relationship with Tendou, his lack of insight in correcting relationship issues caused by him in the friend group, and his lack of growth throughout the show it left much to be desired. Like I mentioned previously if the show had 24 episodes instead of 12 my views on Amano could\'ve changed, however, in the show\'s current state I can\'t help but feel he is just a weak MC. The only credit I can give him is his headstrong ability to ask Tendou to be his girlfriend despite it rarely leading to anywhere.Overall - [ 6 / 10 ]Gamers! had a great concept. A romcom that followed a group of gamers and touched a genre rarely shown in anime. This couple with a fairly interesting cast of main characters and real-world references could have made this a top contending anime in my opinion. However, the short nature of the show and the fact the original concept of the show was abandoned for an extremely drug-out plot narrative left much to be desired. The relationship aspect of the show is an up and down battle with the end not resolving anything. The characters rarely had any growth throughout the show which lead to them becoming gradually worse. The art and animation style is fantastic and really help this show shine. The sound is great, however, I would\'ve appreciated a more memorable OP.My final thoughts: The show is worth a watch if you enjoy RomCom just don\'t go into it being attached to one couple too much. It really doesn\'t feel the role of a slow-burn romance nor is it as funny as something like Love is War! The show has its own niche. Once again I believe if the show had 24 episodes instead of 12 it could\'ve been an 8/10. the show is based on that.Story: [ 5 / 10 ]As an avid gamer myself I was really rooting for Gamers! to have a captivating story.

Nothing hard to unpack from that, but what I really love about this is the characters, it essentially is a parody of your typical rom-com anime, and that is just great, however, it does play it out in a way that it is not a parody. Like when the popular girl falls for the unpopular boy, it is not afraid to hide that fact, whereas other animes do try their very best to. That is where this anime excels, the fact that...it is not afraid to show off what it is. which is a simply grounded rom-com, ish parody.The story, giving it a 7/10 cause of how expected and normal it is, nothing much to say about that, the popular girl asks the boy out, the boy is dumbfounded and says things in the spur of the moment, everyone is jealous. Ya know how it goes.Character-wise, very solid character, even though it is not a very serious anime, the characters still feel normal and not outlandish, solid 7/10.Overall I did enjoy this anime as one of my time killers that turned out to be really freaking good, solid 8/10, would reccommend it. it is not afraid to show off what it is. which is a simply grounded rom-com, ish parody.The story, giving it a 7/10 cause of how expected and normal it is, nothing much to say about that, the popular girl asks the boy out, the boy is dumbfounded and says things in the spur of the moment, everyone is jealous.

The story was really funny (I love awkward characters, romance and geeks put together) It all starts with a gamer named Amano who gets hunted down by the schools idol Tendo who is secretly the president of a gaming club... what more fun could you ask for? The art style was cute, I love how the made the girls stand out and made the guys look extremely basic. The...OST was pretty good, it had me humming after watching the anime but it\'s not something that I want to listen on repeat. My favourite part was probably the characters; I loved the scenario and how everyone advanced them in such different ways BUT most of all (although they were clearly exaggerated) I feel like the misunderstands they made about each-others relationships and cheating could actually happen in real life (most of the time I was thinking ""Come on, just confront your GF/BF if you really think they\'re cheating, but the extreme situations was also the fun of it all).Overall, I really enjoyed this YET AGAIN otaku rom-com.

My favourite part was probably the characters; I loved the scenario and how everyone advanced them in such different ways BUT most of all (although they were clearly exaggerated) I feel like the misunderstands they made about each-others relationships and cheating could actually happen in real life (most of the time I was thinking ""Come on, just confront your GF/BF if you really think they\'re cheating, but the extreme situations was also the fun of it all).Overall, I really enjoyed this YET AGAIN otaku rom-com.

So, instead of a gaming anime, it was like watching a Neil Simon comedy.

Megazone 23,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1935/Megazone_23,"[""The most important thing to be aware of when going into Megazone 23 is that it's in three very different parts. Each part is directed  by someone different, so the quality fluctuates drastically.The first part is outstanding. As to be expected from Noboru Ishiguro. The story has some incredible twists, the art is top notch and there's plenty of great 80s j-pop. I'd give this part a 9/10 and was really looking forward to what happened in the next episode.So you can imagine the disappointment when in the second part, everything was entirely different. The characters do not even look remotely similar to how...they do in part one and the conclusion feels rather lackluster in comparison to the introduction. The storytelling and art is by no means bad, but is clearly not to the same standard.Part three has even fewer similarities; there is an entirely new cast and setting, and only has passing reference to the first two parts. This is more of a sequel than part of the same story. By this point it's really no different from any of the other sci-fi OVAs out there.The one thing that's consistently great is the music. 80s and 90s J-pop, yes please.In short, watch part one, but prepare to have the quality drop considerably by the time you reach the end (if you even get that far). they do in part one and the conclusion feels rather lackluster in comparison to the introduction.

With this review i hope to give my own opinions and insight on what has currently become one of my favorite anime titles - Megazone 23.Story -As...for story , Megazone 23 is quite original.  I have a large anime collection, and in all my years of watching anime have i never watched anything with a story like this one. its an original piece of work that has managed to become nostalgic and stay fresh at the same time, and it also manages to merge quite a few genres together, such as - mecha, romance,action,sci-fi, and even post apocalyptica. Megazone 23 has something for everyone thats for sure.ART -When it comes to the Art Department, Each part of the Megazone 23 collection has its own style. Part 1 offers a strictly old school style which could only be described as ""80\'s animation"". Part 2  is also animated in a late 1980\'s animation style, but it is slightly different and more detailed than Part 1. Parts 3 & 4 are animated in the mid 1990\'s animation style, with cleaner animation with a more modern look. Though each Part is animated in their own different style, i didnt find it taking anything away from my viewing pleasure, Each Part had its story to tell and i greatly enjoyed the series despite the animation changes.Sound-The sound is basically one of the things that got me hooked on Megazone 23.  i really enjoyed the 80\'s  style and music that Parts 1 & 2  were infused with. The look and sound of everything fit together really well and made it a great experience altogether, whether it was 80\'s rock, or pop, or sythesizers. As for sound effects, i felt they were done quite well too, especially  with the vehicles (motorcycles). I bought the ADV dvd collection, so thats the only version ive watched, and i must say that the dubbing was done really good in my own opinion.Characters -As i watched Megazone 23, i really found myself liking some of the characters, especially Eve and Shogo. The music they used with the character Eve basically made her an instant legend when it comes to anime Idols, right up there with Macross and everything, and it is certainly for good reason. Shogo was a pretty cool character too. in Part 1 he was stubborn and hot headed, but as Part 2 rolls around you can tell he has matured a bit. Yui changes a bit fom Part 1 to Part 2 as well, and Part 2 introduces alot more minor characters that are pretty cool too. all in all, the characters of Megazxone 23 in a whole are pretty memorable  :)Overall-As a whole, I really found myself enjoying each and every Part of the Megazone OVA. I liked the originality of its story, the old school 80\'s style presentation of music and animation, and the characters were interesting and kept the series fun to watch. Although i didnt mind the animation changes, i know everyone may not care too much for them, but if you can look past those changes and focus onthe story, then im sure youll enjoy Megazone 23 just as much as i did. If you are looking for an anime that is original and one of a kind, then Megazone 23 has everything you could possibly ask for :) for story , Megazone 23 is quite original.

Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3-4 can all be taken as separate stories in the same universe. It began with director Noboru Ishiguro (Macross) doing Part 1, and then the character designers were different in each part as well as the directors.Megazone 23 is a very original anime with a setting that will enthrall the viewer into the story, characters, and even the representation of the era it was made in. Yes, this is incredibly 80’s. Part 1 by Noboru Ishiguro is absolutely...outstanding. There are so many similarities to the art design and music of the Macross series, and the plot development is top notch. Not surprising that this show eventually became a movie, “Robotech: The Untold Story.” Part 1 focuses on a biker name Shogo and his run-in with a top-secret government weapon called Bahamut. He learns more and more about what the government is, what they want, and how it affects not only him but everybody in the city in which he lives in. Not to mention the interaction with the cities pop sensation named “Eve” and his eventual love interest Yui. Art, music, plot; this first part to the OVA series is top notch.Now, due to the times and certain decisions being made, a change in essentially everything to series happened going forward in parts 2,3, and 4. A change in staff, lower quality, even the way the characters are drawn all changed. For example, Yui changed from Macross style and green hair to Sue with short brown hair and a generic character design. Basically, the entire OVA series goes downhill incredibly fast. It is a complete dumpster dive after how great part 1 was. Part 3 and 4 goes even further with it being a completely different setting and time period. The same lowered quality and generic character designs are shown again. This time, even the music, which was Megazone’s last saving grace, is pretty much gone.Sadly, the series falls way short on a setting and plot with so much potential that takes the viewer into the universe of Megazone. If only the concurrent parts after the way the series began were anything remotely similar to Part 1; Megazone 23 could have been something on the scale of a Gundam or a Macross. Unfortunately, the series as a whole is executed horribly. Watch Part 1 and pretend it was the only part made. outstanding.

The story by the way the title is based on what Japan was called back in WW2.The story is pretty hard to get into, but once you get it it\'s there. Here\'s a sentence to sum it up: The main character, Shogo finds a bike, a bike that\'s top secret to an organization. Oh, and the world is only Tokyo and they live in a spaceship that people aren\'t aware of.Not very novel, right? Wanna know why? Because Megazone started it. The story was originally...supposed to be a multi-episode series compounded into a large series. There\'s a big flaw in this. There are many loopholes that happen. Where are the organizations? Who\'s who? What\'s going on? After about 10 minutes you start to understand, but it\'s pretty difficult to understand what\'s going on early on. Basically there\'s three more OVA\'s so it\'s okay to not understand at the moment. Overall, not bad but the loopholes are very hard to understand.The art is amazing. The palet and the facial designs are very cleanly done, just like back in the day when hand drawn cell animation was around. My big complain is that things change. In some scenes there\'s a pillow that\'s big and pink. In some scenes it\'s a simple pillow. Honestly, I\'m suprised I catched that but a normal viewer probably wouldn\'t notice. There are some great realism in the art though. There\'s McDonald\'s and Coke all around this anime. It\'s VERY realistic. The art is well designed and if you can get past the flaws in this artwork it\'s not a big deal.The sound is amazing. From the pop idol singing to the \'80\'s soundtrack it\'s all amazing. I really felt like I was in that time and place. The english dubbing is excellent, and I wish I could say that for the Japanese version. The J. dubbing is terrible. The flaps don\'t match and the voices all sound like they\'re on steroids. For all you sub fans you might be turned off by this. It would be unfair to give the audio  a 9 since the Japanese track is terrible.The characters are pretty great. The loud mouth, the cool guy, the girl willing to sleep to the top, and the aspiring actress. Add in a guy trying to commit a coup and you got Megazone. The characters are anything but one sided but I couldn\'t get a feeling for them. I seriously only got to like Yui and Shogo. I have to admit I LOVED it when a certain hot-headed-bitch gets shot in the head. I have to say though that there are alot of characters that come and go. Just remember Mr. Coup, Shogo, and Yui and you should be good.You know I want to give this anime a 10, but it doesn\'t deserve it. It just had too many loopholes and it suffered from changing artwork. It is however one of the best OVA\'s I have ever seen. I\'m going to give it a 9 because it\'s a must see. Frankly, not seeing this is ground enough to have your otaku license revoked.Pros:+ One of the visuals I have ever seen. (Epic color palet)+ It keeps you gripped with a great storyline.Cons:- Some of the backgrounds change when they shouldn\'t.- Characters come and go.This anime is 9 ""OVA BOOMS!"" out of 10.This anime is out now by ADV films, go out and buy it. supposed to be a multi-episode series compounded into a large series.

I really felt like I was in that time and place. The english dubbing is excellent, and I wish I could say that for the Japanese version. The J. dubbing is terrible. The flaps don\'t match and the voices all sound like they\'re on steroids. For all you sub fans you might be turned off by this. It would be unfair to give the audio  a 9 since the Japanese track is terrible.The characters are pretty great. The loud mouth, the cool guy, the girl willing to sleep to the top, and the aspiring actress. Add in a guy trying to commit a coup and you got Megazone. The characters are anything but one sided but I couldn\'t get a feeling for them. I seriously only got to like Yui and Shogo. I have to admit I LOVED it when a certain hot-headed-bitch gets shot in the head. I have to say though that there are alot of characters that come and go. Just remember Mr. Coup, Shogo, and Yui and you should be good.You know I want to give this anime a 10, but it doesn\'t deserve it. It just had too many loopholes and it suffered from changing artwork. It is however one of the best OVA\'s I have ever seen. I\'m going to give it a 9 because it\'s a must see. Frankly, not seeing this is ground enough to have your otaku license revoked.Pros:+ One of the visuals I have ever seen. (Epic color palet)+ It keeps you gripped with a great storyline.Cons:- Some of the backgrounds change when they shouldn\'t.- Characters come and go.This anime is 9 ""OVA BOOMS!"" out of 10.This anime is out now by ADV films, go out and buy it.', 'action, sex, romance, great ost, great plot, and etc. you name its on here this movie is what i would consider legendary among all the legendary mecha anime. this series is really under rated but i promise you if you watch this series it will have you on the edge of your seat.

Megazone is one of my favorite anime ova's ever to watch, with an special eye on part 2 , traditional animation was replaced bij a more realistic, mature like animation, compared to part 1, 3 and 4. Storywise, it was one hell of a trip througout the show, and the charach. are SOOOO 80's it hurts my balls, and the soundtracks were awesome, especially in part 2.

From the synopsis it seems like just another hidden society based anime and in terms of content, meh, get a bike, it does stuff, people want it back, ride around, cause trouble .

The first part is really well animated and has an intriguing plot line but that's about it.  The narrative, while interesting, is not fully developed.  The characters are not overly memorable and the pacing is erratic.  In contrast the storytelling of the second part is executed much better.

While the character designs and Artstyle differences for Part 2 can be jarring at first, don\'t let it detract from the story which is nothing short of fantastic.It has a Sci-fi Plot that is ahead of its time and a lot of that is due to Part 1 being directed by the legendary, Noboru Ishigoru (man behind works like LotGalacticHeroes, SDF Macross & Space Battleship Yamato 2) who presents us with a Sci-fi Premise that would later inspire movies like The Matrix, Existenz, etc.𝙋𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙄:...(1985 film - directed by Noboru Ishiguro)The way the Story unravels in the Part 1 is nothing short of masterful.

It becomes pretty damn suspenseful as you wait for Shougo to desperately find a way to combat the Government Conspiracy on his own.

Everything is about as Good, It just has One Little Issue.Yui Takanaka and Shougo\'s character designs look completely different which can be jarring. I understand they wanted to show the passage of time but at least get the facial features right.

You really see how Shougo learns and completes his Character Arc by the end of it and B.D is one of the more interesting villains I\'ve seen in Anime. What\'s interesting about him is that he isn\'t completely evil, his motivations are completely understandable. In a lot of ways, he did nothing wrong, and I was surprised with how the confrontation between B.D. and Shougo was handled by the end. It was nothing like what I expected.

Great concepts with poor execution in certain aspects, but Megazone 23 is still a definite must-see for anyone into the sci-fi genre.The OVA is in three parts and each one is more different from the other than you'll expect. On all three of them the animation is top-notch but different aesthetically.The design and animation of the technology the characters interact with is brilliant. Feels like they had someone with engineering expertise design them. It's still kinda funny how in the 80's they couldn't imagine computer displays to be anything but monochromatic with vector-like graphics,...I must say.The music is also fantastic with some great 80's J-Pop and hair metal that gives it a really cool personality of the time (if you're into that sort of thing).The story, characters, and the quality of the voice acting is where I think Megazone 23 falls short. The concept and overall theme are what's good, it was a first of it's kind that inspired so many other works for future generations (The Matrix for example). The storytelling is what failed grab me. I thought it got confusing at times and the characters didn't quite stood up.Although everyone seems to praise Part I the most, I think my favorite had to be Part III which is fantastic by itself. It has the best animation and art design by far. Part I's art design was cool in a more cartoony sort of way, then in Part II they tried to give it a more mature approach which I thought was weird and looked like something out of an early 90's punky beat em up like Double Dragon or Final Fight, but in Part III they got the perfect balance. The story in Part III is also better told and better paced, and manages to clear things up from the overall lore and a few plot-holes left in the previous parts. I think the character design was so much better in Part III as well, and I dare suspect that Final Fantasy VII might have had some inspiration from it. I liked Eiji as a protagonist a lot more than Shogo.Part III is where I think Megazone 23 comes together more polished and it's what halted me from rating it lower. I don't understand why people talk about it as if it was something extra or unnecessary.Megazone 23 is not the kind of work that stands tall on it's own, but rather one that inspires other great works that follow its steps, for that reason I think it's a must-see for everyone looking to enrich their scope of the art-form and sci-fi genre.

Sigh, what a shame.An illusionary city set above a top-secret underground cyber hardware was definitely not a conventional narrative the 80s Japanese directors would dare enough to initiate. I can get why this was revolutionary in Japan back then, the story was way ahead of its time. Megazone 23 successfully introduced the phantasm of virtual reality and oh boy you wouldn’t believe the amount of films this OVA have influenced. It starts with a really convincing premise, but once it crispens up... well, things are not quite what they seem.It felt so disjointed and set forth my attention span to...hit the lowest. There are too many plot holes that are based on ambiguity, thus I don’t think their original story will carry the film effortlessly and let us overlook its really reaaaally bad narrative. Half of their transition cuts seems like it was too rushed and the whole idea of emphasizing its cheesy sexual love scenes when finally they’ve set the right pace, for me, is the worst marketing idea to boost up a film’s popularity. Up until the end it still left me so confused dammmittt. Yeah I won’t waste my time trying to find the explanation on google. It aint worth it.So go watch it at your own risk, don’t get fooled by its originality. hit the lowest.

Discovering that concepts like life in a virtual reallity, being able to directly connect your conscience with a machine, hacking into a person's mind or a cibercity able to grow infinitely by itself made their entry in popculture with Megazone 23 was quite a surprise.We probably recognize these concepts from more well known works like The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell or BLAME! The reason Megazone 23 isn't as well known as these franchises is, I'd say due to a less than ideal execution of those ideas. Not because of art and sound...wich are pretty good altough it feels more dated nowadays than other anime of the time. Rather due to not very interesting main characters, that simply don't captivate you to follow along and discover all these interesting concepts as you go. Besides I felt the message the story wants to pass with these characters to be quite questionable. In other words the anime has a very nice deeper layer but sort of boring exterior.The anime nevertheless very much worth watching, with the last part of the OVA being the best. The first part is also pretty good and offers a very nice start to the journey but unfortunately the second part is not good at all and what happens in that episode takes away much of the credibility of the events to come.. wich are pretty good altough it feels more dated nowadays than other anime of the time.

Even if a reboot worked out, it\'s not the same thing.[SPOILER]Nowadays, a story where a whole society that lives in a world created by a computer without knowing anything discovers what is happening and needs to...decide how to deal with this information may seem cliche, but at the time this story was created I don\'t know if this was an innovating idea, but for sure was an interesting one.The story, while it have a pretty amount of fanservice of both the sexual and violent type, is well told. Sometimes it may pass as contradictory, but at least for me, it\'s not contradictory in the sense that it\'s badly written, but more like ""what would you do if it happened to you?"". The fact that it ends in a cliffhanger only makes this feeling stronger.[SPOILER]One thing I think is worth noting is that while Part I ends in a big cliffhanger, if this is not a problem for you, you can watch only Part I and forget the other parts exist. It may be because I\'m still traumatized by Part II but I don\'t know, the choice is yours.Since this is an OVA, the animation is well made, and having a character design by Haruhiko Mikimoto (the guy that made a lot of character designs in the 1980s, including for anime like Macross and Top wo Nerae!) only makes it way better. The direction is amazing too because it makes you get involved with the story from the first to the last second. You can feel that everyone that worked in this project really believed in what they were making.The voice acting is good. The voices are the usual for an anime from the 1980s, but they\'re a bit refreshing when you\'re used to listen to the voice acting from the 1990s onwards.The soundtrack is by far one of the strongest points of this OVA, that have as a trademark the classic ""Senakagoshi ni Sentimental"". Kumi Miyasato\'s singing voice is just way too perfect for this OVA. The songs are very strong and absurdly outdated – and I mean it like a compliment since I really love the sound of the 1980s. All the songs are good. ""Kaze no Lullaby"" is one of the songs that most perfectly personificates the feeling of loneliness, and ""Samishikute Nemurenai"" is good as an ending song.Overall rating: 9,5> Part IIAh... Even though it\'s just one year apart from the Part I, the quality and feeling of everything – with the exception of the soundtrack – dropped or changed ghastly. To start with, if I\'m not wrong, it wasn\'t produced by the same team, and the project only had a second part to end the main storyline.Everything is exaggerated here. The fanservice, the product placement (that is even mocked in a brief break of the fourth wall lol), and the melodrama. Everything here is not the worst that are there, but it doesn\'t looks and feels like the first part at all. It feels like the people behind this OVA made it as an obligation to give the story a proper ending.The character design used here is not my favorite type but I could get away with it if it wasn\'t for one little thing: the change in the character design is so dramatic that you literally can\'t recognize the returning characters.Just like the change in the character design is dramatic, the change in the direction style is too. The story is not even that bad, but the direction have a heavy, unpleasing feeling. I literally paused it for some minutes because of how torturous was to watch it.[SPOILER]This style of direction is tetrical, and only makes the ""end of humanity"" scene, along with the dreadful song ""Himitsu Ku-da-sa-i"", more difficult to watch. I don\'t know, I don\'t like this kind of scene, but because of said reasons it felt haunting for me to watch it.The final scene can be slightly unexpected, and this can be a good or bad thing... It depends on who\'s watching it. I liked it because it\'s almost a happy ending since the main characters end up alive, but after that second-to-last scene, I felt frustrated that they were alive, like, I know it was the ""end of humanity"" but since 1% of it survived couldn\'t y\'all make it less distressing? I\'ve had nightmares for three weeks because of that scene.[SPOILER]Apart from the story, the only real good thing about this OVA is the soundtrack. Even the vibes of the songs changed between Part I and Part II. ""Himitsu Ku-da-sa-i"" is not bad but I really don\'t feel like listening to this kind of song, but I really loved the ending song, ""Lonely Sunset"". Just like the first OVA, this song have the sound that was common at that time and it is, again, very well made. Since compared to the former song this is an upbeat song, it also makes you feel relieved that the OVA is over.Sincerely, if the whole story were only this OVA, I would never recommend it to anyone, unless if said person likes depressing stories. But since it ends the story started in the first OVA, I feel obligated to recommend it for who wants to know what happens in the end.Overall rating: 5 decide how to deal with this information may seem cliche, but at the time this story was created I don\'t know if this was an innovating idea, but for sure was an interesting one.The story, while it have a pretty amount of fanservice of both the sexual and violent type, is well told.

I could talk about the shitty underage romance subplot (a loner encounters a 13 yo girl and they fall in love...in the river), or how fucking socially retarded Munto is: appears out of nowhere and demands a girl give him her ""power"", when she doesn\'t even know who he is or what he\'s talking about. Tells her to ""believe in herself"", and she actually says ""I believe in myself"" when all she did was touch Munto. That was literally all she had to do. ""Believe in yourself"" is literally the most overused line in the history of shitty fanfiction. I would...give a 0 for the story if I could.Character designs: Terrible. All the girls have fuckhuge bug eyes and Munto looks like a skinny 12 year old...remember this guy is supposed to be the king of the Magic Kingdom. Just look at that ridiculous hair.Animation: Average. Nothing to complain about, but it wasn\'t amazing either. The fight scenes were a letdown. Actually there is only one fight scene in the entire 54 minute OVA, Gas vs the chick with two swords. It was okay animation wise, I mean it\'s double framed. But in terms of choreography it wasn\'t that great. It was just Gas dodging the double swords. Was somewhat similar to the Darker than Black OVA where Hei was dodging the chinese contractor\'s double swords. Gas grabs the sword and vaporizes it. If the sword doesn\'t cut you then why bother dodging it? Seems kind of pointless really. Anyway that was it. The OVA\'s only fight scene and was mediocre.Overall piss poor story and underwhelming fight scenes, really disappointing. give a 0 for the story if I could.Character designs: Terrible.

This story seems a bit forced in the beginning. The story actually revolves around Yumemi Hidaka instead of Munto so I’m not really all that sure why the show is named after Munto. It should have been called magical girl or destiny girl, which would be closer to it I think.I don’t really understand why there is a storyline within a story line. It seems like it confuses it. Fortunately, it makes up for it by the same feeling of Air and Clannad. This has the same feeling as them where if revolves around...the world of a young girl who doesn’t know where her place is. She tries to find out, but turns out there are powers she has that can save the world. Kyoto has this way of having a rather dreamy and other worldly show. Now this show feels only like a beginning of a chapter, and it doesn’t seem to end really.The artwork is not as good as the big three, it feels a bit hazy. I guess the hazy is supposed to make it dreamlike, but it just feels a little odd. The 3D animation actually look rather good with this show for however little is in this. Munto looks like Yugi with his spiky hair and lengthy body. Some of the bodies are really small waist.The voices sound pretty good actually in the English, They did a rather good job. Unfortunately, the magical king Munto sounds like Yugi to in his dueling form. It doesn’t help because of his looks too. the world of a young girl who doesn’t know where her place is.

So, she carries around an umbrella so she can't see them anymore.One day, she is walking to school when a strange man with red hair comes out of nowhere and...demands that she give her powers to him.  She says no and thinks she dreaming and he vanishes.Later on, he keeps popping out of nowhere and demands she helps him.  She does later and the day is saved!  Yay!This show was a good growing up story and had great character development but there were a lot of characters that were not need at all in the story.  They just pop out of nowhere and go with the flow being completely useless.Another thing is that the ending was about friendship.  That pissed me off.All in all, this was a good series in the beginning but the ending sucked. demands that she give her powers to him.

His world resides in an alternate dimension. However, there is only one girl on earth who can see Munto\'s dimension as well as the flying pillars, and she is the only one who can ""save the world."" Munto has to convince her to cross over into his dimension and help him.This premise is incredibly interesting in theory but this movie does...not do justice for the plot. In fact, there is quite a bit of filler in this movie. There\'s an entire side plot about a girl who wants to get married to this guy that has nothing to do with the story, there\'s interesting characters in Munto\'s world who are never developed/explained, and there is some evil organization with no plot or backstory whatsoever trying to destroy Munto\'s kingdom.Art 6/10The art is very pretty to look at. I loved the designs of the dresses and how they flowed. There are some scenes in Munto that are beautiful to watch, but unfortunately some of the frames last a long time for no reason other than to save animation budget.Sound 3/10This was the most awkward part of Munto. There wasn\'t any sound during some of the parts, which made it feel...lifeless. The voice acting was fine, but I felt it was too quiet for an anime.Character 2/10This show has the worst type of characterization a writer could ever do. There\'s the kindhearted main protagonist, the stubborn but good natured Munto, etc. No one ever changes, grows, or is explained. They are all shells of character arctypes that could\'ve been interesting but go absolutely nowhere.Enjoyment 3/10The only enjoyment I had was making fun of some of the scenes....and wanting to bang my head because I loved the 9-episode show as a child.Overall 4/10With an interesting premise but severely terrible storytelling, I feel this show could use a reboot that fleshes out the main characters and focuses on the story.

I Loved his design but I couldn\'t get any of my friends to identify him so after months of staring at his picture and looking for ANY tag that would help me id him, I finally found out about his anime. After reading a bit of the plot, I\'d honesty have to say that I was more intersted in seeing this design in action than the actual story but I gave it a chance. From the pictures I saw, I saw promise but after seeing the anime, I was bored senseless.The...plot, though somewhat interesting, wasn\'t as riveting as I hoped. You have two people from two dimensions parallel to each other and it\'s near imposible to cross over but the girl has to cross over to save the other dimension. These are the beginings of a good plot, so what happened? Well, the characters are as ineresting as mud, they take FOREVER to get to something exciting in the plot, and there\'s no music to help with the atmosphere of the scenes to make them more bareable.In one world, you have a group of unnamed bad guys destroying King Munto\'s kingdom in the sky (and their HOME) just BECAUSE THEY CAN (really, no real motive was EVER revealed, A holy crusade for the greater good would have been nice) and people sitting around and LETTING THEM while saying hope is not lost as long as we withhold our troups and have faith in Munto who has leaped into an area where him just being there is slowly and PAINFULLY killing him while he tries to convince this boring little middle school girl, who is the only one that can see beyond the barrier between them (and that\'s the only thing interesting about her, everyone else thinks she\'s a liar instead of crazy), to help him.In the other world you have the boring everyday life of said boring girl and her friends. She know Munto NEEDS her to help him and that COUNTLESS lives are at stake but even as he lays DYING in front of her, she still says ""you have the wrong girl, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, leave me alone"" instead of HELPING him like a SENSIBLE person would if a person was dying in front of them. Also, it\'s a MIRACLE she has just been tagged as a liar and NO ONE has thought to AT LEAST get her couselling. Who wrote this, a 4YO?! Hey, if she was at least considered mentally unstable by the general public, it would make her half of the story more interesting as she is strugling to find answers (is the floating kingdom real or do I really need STRONG medication?), but no, we get this half-a** piece of sh**.I was excited to see Munto but after watching the OVAs and finding out that they were just a portion of the story and the anime has the whole story, I gave up on it. Usually when anime\'s chop up episodes into OVAs or a few movies, the pull the highlights of the anime and if THAT was the highlight, I say it\'s not worth it.

The story itself may be cliche and full of exposition but the art is really good. The pacing isn't as good and the ending feels a bit rushed despite all the time it took getting there but the animation and direction and ideas present make it an interesting watch overall. Got a few Cardcaptor vibes from the story but that's never really a bad thing.(Also, for the English dub it was pretty hilarious to have Goku's original dub voice coming out of a Vegeta look alike.)I keep being told to enter a longer review but...that's pretty much all I got to say on it. An impressive debut even if the material doesn't feel entirely original. I'll still be going on to watch the next part. that's pretty much all I got to say on it.

My personal favourite is Aiko's episode, in which she does an improvised dance in the rain to cheer up Ayumi, but the other four also get their time to shine.The animation is done in flash, but it doesn't look bad.

But on this movie, Masato (Max in America) [known as May's Sister] leads the movie with Jirachi (in my personal opinion, a charming little legendary). The beauty is that it implements about the beauty of friendship on the early days, the middle days, and the day of separation. It's like something to compare with in school life.

Minus the Graduation hats and diplomas.No matter how long or short the days, moths, or years last, the relationship between the intellectual Max/Masato and...the kindhearted Jirachi the wishmaker (the gender is up to you to decide. But its a girl for me), it nicely implements as to how a powerful friendship lasts a lifetime. In the movie's case, it also shows a mildly dark reason in the near end of the movie on the value of letting the most treasured things go.If you want to take your brain's imagination to the next level, you could compare Max and Jirachi's friendship to that of Ash and Latias' relationship.

In the end we're left with a film in which anything goes and the audience is left out cold, only to warm up to the film if they find the overly long final fight engaging.On the bright side of things, most of the characters and their interactions are likable.The first third of the film nicely establishes the new Pokemon cast. Generally, shenanigans in the camp are engaging. Establishment of Jirachi, although a bit too goofy, works....Even if he's not well characterized, Absol, a fan favorite pokemon, is nice to look at and keeps up with the plot without feeling out of place.This is where the film drops the ball, though. After the plot gets rolling, we're treated to a flat good guy turning into a flat bad guy. The ensuing race to the final destination drops the underwhelming, but somewhat fun carnival setting, but doesn't really replace it with anything noteworthy.Here we're finally given an explanation of the villain's motives, but it doesn't tell us any more than we already know. Futhermore, the character interactions continue like no twist happened, as if they were still at the carnival. Thus, instead of shaking things up to keep them interesting, film quickly turns boring.Eventually, as the time for final showdown comes, we're treated to yet another one of those situations - you know, where the villain wields infinite magical technology already set up everywhere in advance. Why? How? Because the plot requires it, of course! This is where the film starts falling appart, but hope still exist. You think to yourself - well, the stakes are high, maybe this finally becomes interesting! Nope, he's resurrecting a Dark Jellyfish Groudon™ out of nowhere.One of my gripes with the film which aren't imediately apparent is how unimportant details get overexplained. Right at the very start of the film we're treated to a voiceover explaining Team Magma, their dreams, goals and their favoite football team. This never gets relevant. The only reason I can think of for this being in the film is so the viewers aren't confused by a certain later monologue. In the monologue we're treated to a flashback showing Butler's ex-ties to Team Magma. This would be fine if it was used to give his character depth or set up evil Groudon clone. But it doesn't give us any insight into the character nor the plot. Since there's no payoff, the reason for this scene becomes clear - padding the film.With characters not mattering and plot in the gutter, we're treated to a nonsensical plot wrap up, complete with a McGuffin and a cheesily written goodbye to Jirachi. Still, there were a few nice moments that shine here - a few shots of Ash and Flygon look really good. May forgetting to fold her last necklace piece gives us a very sweet character moment that was built up subtly throughout the whole film.Ultimatelly, while there are around twenty enjoyable minutes in the film, most of it is wasted on a nonsensical plot and underwhelming character interactions. I'd recommend this film if you like to laugh at dull plot devices with your friends. I've done so and we had some fun nitpicking the problems. Otherwise, don't bother unless you're a Jirachi or Max fan and even then keep in mind that this is film Max at his least likable. How unfortunate, considering it's the only one focused on him.

Between making a wish on a comet that appears for seven nights every thousand years and trying...to take Jirachi back to where he belongs - and stopping a magician/scientist from grabbing Jirachi to awaken a legendary Pokémon of his own - there was nothing special in this movie.So, an okay movie, and perhaps my rating is a bit low, but it didn’t have that something in it that would have made it better. to take Jirachi back to where he belongs - and stopping a magician/scientist from grabbing Jirachi to awaken a legendary Pokémon of his own - there was nothing special in this movie.So, an okay movie, and perhaps my rating is a bit low, but it didn’t have that something in it that would have made it better.', 'wow, another pokemon movie review. sixth in the series, jirachi wishmaker is one i remember from my childhood quite well and is the first one to feature the hero group from pokemon advanced. though a little on the random side from the series, the story does tie in somewhat from the reference to team magma and groudon. jirachi is a cute little pokemon and it\'s ability did come into play so i can see how it fits. it seems a bit simple, like there should have been some more there, but it\'s nothing that makes the movie unwatchable. for a side story like movie, i...found it to be enjoyable and cute at times. the art, not much can really be said in that other than it\'s traditional pokemon. i feel like so far, that hasn\'t changed for any of the movies  but that\'s personally a plus. the music was pretty good, though previous movies had better. all the original voice actors were there and that, in my book, keeps it relevant and classic. i enjoyed the characters well enough, jirachi was a cutie(despite HIM sounding a lot like a SHE but that\'s okay), and so on. this is a case however when the antagonist sees the light and error of what he did which was a bit different. normally they are defeated or something(not like with mewtwo in previous movies who had the same thing happen) but not this time. overall, it wasn\'t a bad movie and i would watch it again if i had the chance to though i admit, it isn\'t as good as the previous ones. it was simply and only ""good"" found it to be enjoyable and cute at times. the art, not much can really be said in that other than it\'s traditional pokemon. i feel like so far, that hasn\'t changed for any of the movies  but that\'s personally a plus. the music was pretty good, though previous movies had better. all the original voice actors were there and that, in my book, keeps it relevant and classic. i enjoyed the characters well enough, jirachi was a cutie(despite HIM sounding a lot like a SHE but that\'s okay), and so on. this is a case however when the antagonist sees the light and error of what he did which was a bit different. normally they are defeated or something(not like with mewtwo in previous movies who had the same thing happen) but not this time. overall, it wasn\'t a bad movie and i would watch it again if i had the chance to though i admit, it isn\'t as good as the previous ones. it was simply and only ""good""', ""Upon rewatching this movie, I was surprised to find that it was actually... pretty good. I can't remember ever really liking it as a child, and when it first came out, it played All The Time. Like, every weekend. I got sick of it real fast. But I'm thinking now that this is because so much of this movie's focus is on the bond between Jirachi and Max. And I can't say I ever warmed up to Max. He was just annoying. (Though maybe not as bad as Iris...)But the plot actually had a pretty solid connection back to the actual story-- the main...villain being a shamed Team Magma scientist-- and I liked that. Jirachi himself was really more plot device than character, but that was okay too. He existed to make the viewers feel when he and Max were invitably separated, and he was just never going to accomplish that with me. So I'll be satisfied with knowing our villain had an actual, concrete motivation for resurrecting him.Something that really struck me while rewatching this one is how bright all the colors were-- fitting the carnival setting perfectly. This was something I took special notice of, having just rewatched 4Ever where everything looks kind of dull. My biggest complaint would be that this movie always feels so long... But I suspect that goes back to how much of a focus it puts on Max. No matter how good the story, it just wasn't going to appeal to me, and I've accepted that. villain being a shamed Team Magma scientist-- and I liked that.

I got this movie as a gift from a friend, and it isn't bad. The sound and visuals are standard, and the story, while not bad, is not anything special. The characters are the characters (except for Brock, who is always a blast.), so why is my enjoyment a 7/10 then? Well, to be honest, its because this movie was one of the reason's why Absol became one of my favourite pokemon, but of course this is subjective. I recommend seeing the better pokemon movies instead, and while I wouldn't say this movie is...awful, I would say it isn't the best. awful, I would say it isn't the best."", 'So as of now I’ve watched 3 out of 4 of the Hoenn/Advanced Generation movies. This movie, like Destiny Deoxys, is a pretty mixed one.First of all, since this was made when 4Kids was still in control of the Pokémon franchise, Ash and Team Rocket’s voices all sounded very off to me, similar to Destiny Deoxys.However, one of the good things about Pokémon movies are their opening scenes. They really bring the setting and feeling of the story to life somehow.And the first portion of the movie was the most hilarious portion of a Pokémon movie I’ve ever come across (I wonder if the weird...voice acting played a role into that LOL)The whole movie practically had a TON of Temple of the Sea vibes, with everything except the aquatic theme.And EPIC BOSS FIGHTS!!!!!!

There were Lots of cute, funny moments throughout, both between the bonding of Max and Jirachi, and Max and May's sibling relationship. The animation was great and there was once again a good share of lovely scenes, direction was nice, and when things got going, the climactic scene was the high...standard i've come to expect by this point.So yeah, it was the weakest movie yet, but it wasn't bad.

Re-Kan!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25859/Re-Kan,"['The topics of death and a possible afterlife (or rather, the fear of them) can be quite distressing to think about, and philosophers and scientists alike have banged their heads on countless brick walls trying to figure out what exactly life is about, and why there has to be an end to it. However, death may not be so dreadful, and there may be a playful side to what happens after it, well, at least in Re-Kan.The plot revolves around Amami Hibiki, a transfer student who mysteriously has the ability to see and interact with ghosts. Now, as per traditional Japanese beliefs, these ghosts are...figures known as Yurei, spirits living in a peaceful afterlife which are known to protect and bring good luck to the living family members. Being totally friendly and even playful at times, the ghosts cause a lot of lighthearted commotion to the lives of Amami and her friends. In fact, they run into these ghosts quite often, be it at a ceremonial tombstone on the way to school or at the beach on a hot summer day.The characters are all quite lovable, and there really isn\'t an antagonist by definition in the anime as one of the ongoing themes is simply learning to get along with ""others"". All the person to person and person to ghost conflicts are quite short lived. However, I must mention that the personalities we see have a limited amount of depth, and as of right now, we rarely, if at all, see introductions of new, radical characters that drive the plot forwards.Additionally, as creative as Re-Kan is, there are shortcomings with the story. As of right now, the plot doesn\'t have a lot of depth, and other than the fact that the ghosts will deliberately spook people out (especially Amami\'s friend Inoue), there\'s a lack of conflict. Dramatic scenes and cliffhangers? No, we likely won\'t see those. I believe that the first episode will give you a good sense of the mood of the series and what the sequential episodes will be like.As for the visual aspects of Re-Kan, the art, first of all, is very poor and inconsistent, and isn\'t considered by any means stellar by today\'s standards. That being said, the art does contribute to the light mood of the story, so essentially we can\'t say that art is that bad.The other thing to mention in terms of Visuals are the OPs and EDs. They\'re not a treat to the eyes, but we do have to give every♥ing! credit for good theme song performances, as ""Colourful Story"" (OP) and ""Kesalan Patharan"" (ED) are two of their first singles. As for the rest of the audio, the BGM is alright, but one thing that you will notice upon watching is that except for Amami (since she just transferred to the school), all the characters speak with a strong Kansai dialect, which may not be what you are used to hearing.

It has been a while since my previous review, so I'll try to keep it as brief yet informative as possible.(Story - 5/10)The story itself focuses on a very standardized set of plot where the listed main characters are usually all you'll ever see in the Anime. Screen-time wise, it is passable as each main character does get their own set of scenes. But, back to the main point. The feel that I get from watching this Anime is that the story can be both lighthearted yet heart-warming at times. One of the main characters, Amami Hibiki, is the...protagonist where she connects to the ghosts through her ghost-sense, or Re-Kan, as the Anime title is named, and as a result they like her a lot too. The other main characters are there to add color to their everyday lives.(Art - 6/10)The art style of this Anime is very fitting as well. The choice of colors and the way the characters are designed are pretty well done. The one flaw I noticed would be the eyes of the main characters where they seemingly appear in front of the character's hair. Other than that, it's all good.(Sound - 7/10)The sounds, especially the OSTs, are one of the plus points of this Anime. Even the music used during various scenes sound pretty fitting as well. Just listen to them!(Character - 6/10)The character development on the main characters' side honestly does not have much development; while I do think that it is nice that Amami is able to treat the ghosts as though they are humans and has conversations with them as such, it is also true that it gets kind of mundane when you see her walking through the same neighborhood and carrying out pretty much the same actions everyday, like greeting the ghosts and going to school. It is the same with the other main characters, where they themselves go to school and talk about their everyday lives and bullying the crap out of Yamada.(Enjoyment - 7/10)I would say that the Anime is pretty enjoyable. While watching through the series one by one, there were times where I would get bored while watching halfway through, then get up and feel touched during certain scenes where the ghosts' problems get solved.(Overall - 7/10)On overall, I'm giving this Anime a 7 out of 10 score for the amount of enjoyment that I got from it. This Anime is a good watch if you're someone who enjoys light-hearted humor. While it is centered around ghosts, it is not too much too the point of a horror Anime where scares pop up out of nowhere.

Give it a go!"", 'Re-Kan! is a supernatural comedy that can be funny, cute, or surprisingly touching......but the majority of it is so head-shakingly silly that I had a hard time enjoying all of it.The concept isn\'t exactly original, and even this season there are shows that involve characters who can see ghosts (Kyoukai no Rinne, I\'m looking at you), but Re-Kan! takes a much more lighthearted, easygoing, and realistic approach.Well, as realistic as a show about ghosts can be.Our story centers around routine interactions between Hibiki, our main character, and various spirits around town. Emphasis on ""routine,"" because Hibiki greets and converses with these spirits in the same...way that she would talk with her human friends, much to the chagrin of some characters...Along the way, we inevitably learn of the backgrounds of many of the ghosts, and this is where the ""surprisingly touching"" part comes in. Even in this show, death is a somber topic, and as a result, Re-Kan! often ends its episodes with bitersweet realizations by living and dead characters who can accept the death of a loved one and move on with their lives. It made sitting through the rest of the episode worth it, usually.By this, I am referring to the silliness that the rest of the show is dominated by. The show tends to fall back on running gags, and this inevitably leads to most of the jokes being rather predictable. A good amount of the characters (Yamada, Yamada\'s brother, the Ero-Neko) exist solely for the purpose of silly, nonsensical, or often perverted humor. As a result, they function as the subject of rage from the more violent characters, or ones who are simply fed up with their antics. And why wouldn\'t they be? Their lines are repetitive and their presence in the show gets stale pretty early on.While some of the female characters suffer from the same issue, we at least get to see a more enjoyable relationship develop amongst them. Their bonds form primarily through, you guessed it, Hbiki\'s ability to see ghosts. Their progression as friends is so slow it\'s almost unseeable, but it\'s just another aspect of the show\'s slow, easygoing nature. Maybe I\'m just simple-minded, but seeing those kinds of interactions is cute and enjoyable for me.Particularly, the interactions between Hibiki and Inoue, our token tsundere, are pretty darn cute. Their biggest obstacle is that Inoue couldn\'t be a worse friend for Hibiki - she\'s terrified of ghosts! Despite her fear, she somehow gets dragged into all of Hibiki\'s ghost antics, and comes to accept Hibiki as she is... for the most part. Also, it\'s pretty obvious early on that Hibiki has a crush on Inoue, so for all you yuri fans out there (myself included), it\'s an added bonus.Unfortunately, due to the show\'s short run time and episodic nature, the usual ""characters-don\'t-get-enough-development-or-screentime"" problem is prevalent here. As only one example, Inoue\'s relationship with Hibiki is cute, but she shows no hints of breaking out of her tsundere nature by the end of the show, which is rather disappointing considering how much she\'s changed her attitude towards her friends. Also, I would have expected her to at least try to act less terrified in the presence of ghosts, but I hardly got any of that. The rest of the human female cast got one episode of development, if they were lucky. I\'m not sure if a 24-episode series would have dragged this show out or not, but again, 13 episodes certainly isn\'t enough for everyone.Instead, what I got were situations where all I could think of was ""Are they really going to spend ten minutes on this subject?"" I don\'t think I needed Yamada\'s older brother to talk about how much he loves girls in swimsuits for ten minutes, or a spirit that jumps off of a cliff everyday for a silly reason, or a zombie-loving girl running all over town because she had a possessed zombie doll. I know it\'s supposed to be a comedy, but these are more cases where the comedy either fell flat for me or was so silly, all I could do was sigh.The openings and endings are cute... however, there was an obvious drop in animation quality between the opening and the rest of the show. It\'s like 70% of the budget went into animating the opening, and the rest went into the actual content. Character and background designs, while cute and colorful, were average at best and disappointing in the context of the opening.Openings and endings aside, the soundtrack is quite relaxing. I was particularly fond of the acoustic-centric inserts, and it emphasized the ""slice-of-life"" feel that I am so attracted to.Re-Kan! has its moments, but the moments are too far in between the stale jokes and the eyebrow-raising scenarios. It\'s entertaining enough, and it\'s not the worst option if a break from the standard shounen/ecchi/harem fare is wanted.

Spoilers ahead!)My sister was born on Halloween, so I am no stranger to all of the common tropes that follow such a holiday. There are pumpkins to carve, candy to pass out, and the movie Hocus Pocus to watch at least once, all done to commemorate such a special occasion. Another major trait that Halloween almost always has is the prevalence of ghosts. Ghosts are not real (like most other phenomenon hosted during that time of year) but they usually beg the question: what if? If ghosts suddenly became corporeal tomorrow, would you avoid them entirely? Or...would you attempt to converse with them to learn more about who they happened to be? Re-Kan! focuses on these supernatural beings, giving an anime that relaxes both body and mind.STORYRe-Kan! stars Hibiki Amami, a young woman who has a sixth-sense, allowing her to communicate with entities that are no longer living. One day, she happens upon Narumi Inoue, with the two becoming at least acquaintances and the tale progressing from there.Ghosts are most often perceived as scary, what with their translucent bodies, ability to float, and the hauntings they take part in. But here, in Re-Kan!, ghosts are the complete opposite. They help the characters with the problems that appear, they are generally kind in their normal dealings, and they refrain from harassing the living. For example, the ghosts at one point watch over Amami’s inner spirit or assist in the school festival’s haunted house. This is the first sign of the anime being able to generate such a calming atmosphere. By taking a concept that is normally seen as horrifying and diluting it to the point of cuteness, the anime is able showcase its relaxation to a higher degree. It is not so much dissonance as it is dichotomy; the application of a subject that is not usually placed in such a positive light makes it so that the anime’s calmness is more pronounced than if such contrast was not employed.Re-Kan! continues building its calm atmosphere through the construction of the narrative itself. Here, the anime avoids any lasting tension by foregoing long-stretched conflicts, instead opting for an episodic, “monster (ghost) of the week” format. There do exist partial carry-overs between episodes – such as specific ghosts or allusions to previous happenings – but for the most part, the anime keeps each tiny tale segmented from one another. The drama is there but the resolution comes quickly, giving the anime the chance to showcase more heartfelt moments like an elderly man enjoying his wife’s homemade chocolates or a little girl getting to play with her childhood friend. While the individual occurrences are not profound or deeply moving, they manage to sit snuggly among the show’s tone, thereby heightening its relaxing effect once more.To round out the experience, the anime focuses on a specific theme to unify the disjointed events: the small things in life matter most. It is quite simple, but this aspect, like the others before it, finds easy comfort due to the endearing nature of the motif. Many of these moments demonstrate this idea. For instance, a group of small kids running around in the park and a mother hugging her daughter are the kinds of occurrences that do not seem like much but are quite relatable. In fact they almost come off as insignificant, but in essence that is life itself, a series of “forgettable” happenings that are small in scale now but have a large, everlasting impact later on. This is exactly where the anime goes as it comes to its conclusion; these “insignificant” moments are revealed to be more than what they are at face value. Those little kids allowed Inoue to understand the connectedness she herself has, and the mother becomes inspired to cook like she used to. The majority of the previous plot points are revisited to showcase how such small events really do have quite the impact. However, the most profound part is that this message is revealed through thedead. That is, cherishing life’s smaller experiences is made possible by the non-living. It is ironic, but again, this dichotomy gives it added meaning since they are the ones who can no longer do this. In other words, everyone eventually moves on, so love the small things as much as you can while the opportunity is still there.Now, the entire outing is by no means perfect – there are specific plot points that are not fully expanded on or used, such as Mary the cellphone ghost; and the comedy often relies on the same, repetitive jokes – but as an anime aimed at healing its audience, Re-Kan! performs at a very nice level.ANIMATIONRe-Kan! takes a strange approach to its art style. The best way to describe it is that the backgrounds are three-dimensional in nature, or that the characters are quite obviously superimposed onto the setting they find themselves in. By doing this, the art takes on a “photorealistic” effect that helps to keep the anime’s sense of realism despite the ghosts that permeate it. Various locations are visited, like the beach, parts of the city, and Amami’s abode, but the show takes place mostly at their school. While the style can take a while to get used to, and the lighting and camera direction are nothing noteworthy, it does its job handily enough.The character designs are weird mainly due to how shiny everyone is. Hair, eyes, and skin all have this sheen to them that makes the members of the cast glow. In a way, it makes them seem unnatural, in the same vein that the ghosts are “not of this world.” Besides their shininess, characters like Amami with her long purple hair or Inoue with her short twin-tails are appropriate but not too dazzling.Actual animation barely manages to be average in execution. The characters do not do much in terms of movement, sticking mostly to sitting or standing while having their conversations. A possible reason for the anime’s direction here was to keep the feeling low-key; preventing the characters from engaging in gratuitous action coincides with the relaxation it was going for. However, when the characters do move, it can be somewhat choppy, such as with running or during reactions.CHARACTERSIn an anime like Re-Kan!, the characters are not looking to be complex or incredibly fleshed-out. This is apparent when noticing the lack of drama (no personal conflict) and the format of the plot (no long-lasting effects) which causes the characters to refrain from developing to any extent. Meaning there needs to be some leniency applied when analyzing said characters.To this end, the anime is competent with at least the characterization of the main troupe it touts. Some of them are rather interesting, such as Kyouko’s past as a thug who protected the streets and Ogawa’s infatuation with zombies. Others are common tropes found throughout the medium, such as Inoue the “tsundere” and Amami the super-nice young woman. While each does get an episode that semi-revolves around them, such as Kana having issues at home and Ogawa aiding a possessed doll, again it is more about using their shticks in the moment – either to further the comedy or drive home the sentimental idea for those events – as opposed to expounding on their actual persons. The same direction can be seen with the minor characters, like Ko-gal Spirit and the “Roll Call Samurai.” The former reconnects with her mother in a tender moment but later on is used as comedic relief whereas the latter is humbled by Amami’s kindness, so he makes it his mission to protect her, which leads to his own type of gags. So, while the characters do not individually go through much, their respective personality traits are at least shown and used in an acceptable manner.More powerful than each character’s singular facets are the bonds that they share between each other. The idea that the connections people have with one another being important is introduced in the “final” episode, but in retrospect it becomes clear how much focus was placed on the relationships established. Kyouko and Kana get angry at each other all of the time, but that is because they understand one another due to the rough-and-tumble attitudes they own. Ogawa and Yamada also manage to relate to one another due to their outlier status. Ogawa’s obsession and Yamada’s “anti-harem” role make them stand-out from the rest of the group, allowing them to get one another more readily. Even the relationship between Ko-gal and Samurai has a foundation. Ko-gal’s laidback nature contrasts with Samurai’s dignified manner of behaving and speaking, which causes the two to tease one another as only companions could.Best of all is the dynamic between Amami and Inoue. Amami is unbelievably gentle and enjoys communicating with people of the transparent variety. Inoue rests at the opposite end of the spectrum; she can be rude and overly-direct at times yet she is deathly afraid of ghosts. But as a testament to the strong bond they share, the two overcome such a huge gap in differences and become the best of friends. Amami gives others the chance to see Inoue’s kindness hidden behind her abrasiveness, such as when Inoue agreed to continue being next to her, and Inoue gives Amami a backbone, a wall to lean on when troubles arise, like when Amami was forced by Inoue to wear ghost-warding glasses to let her friend rest. They appear to be the most unlikely of duos, but that is precisely why they are so close to begin with. Amongst Re-Kan!’s characters, it is clear that the understanding relationship shared between Amami and Inoue is one of the stronger parts offered.SOUNDThe opening theme starts off well then heads into quite the guitar riff, which eventually devolves into a tired beat and a bout of singing that is not entirely pleasant. However, when the second half of the track begins – where it matches the very beginning – it finds strength once more, with the nice catchiness and the back-and-forth vocalists. The ending theme is oddly quick, but it works because of the contrast it has with the anime that precedes it – this contrast being a common motif found throughout the anime. It contains many various sound-effects, fast singing, build-ups, tonal changes, and catchy lyrics that come together to create a fun song to hear.The rest of the soundtrack presents an arrangement that sticks to relaxation. There are goofy pieces like the ones that play during rambunctious moments – a distinct, ghostly whistle can be heard during one – and serene piano pieces for those sad moments, but many of the tracks are composed with softness in mind. One of the most prominent and memorable tracks from the show is the four-note, acoustic guitar ensemble that captures the sweetness that is everyday life. The OST is by no means great, but it manages to contain a number of pieces that follow the atmosphere nicely.Voice acting for the anime is somewhere around average. A special shout-out is deserved for Ibuki Kido as Amami for her extremely kind way of speaking.ENJOYMENTI like cute anime; anyone who knows me knows this to be true. And this one definitely fits the bill mostly thanks to Amami’s unending kindness and affability. Her simply saying “Inoue-san…” in her gentle voice was more than enough. But watching her stumble around, helping the ghosts and the living alike, would always make me smile because she was smiling while doing it. Viewing someone that is doing what they love, seeing as their passion manifests, makes me happy because that is something everyone should experience.The only other character I cared for was Inoue, who was also a source of entertainment due to her scaredy-cat ways. It was always a game, trying to see where she was hiding in the background when ghosts entered the area, or watching as she shook and panicked while screaming “no” with her hands to her cheeks. Her relationship with Amami – with the “yuri” undertones, strictness (as the show put it), and “tsundere”-ness towards her best friend – was hilarious because of how genuine it was. Amami’s innocence was something that Inoue never took for granted, with Inoue wanting nothing but the best for the girl that, as she did with the ghosts around them, treated her so well.Beyond the comedy, there were two moments that managed to tug at my heartstrings. The first was with “Little Ghost Girl” who got to play kitchen with the boy (now a grown-up) she made friends with years ago. I hate goodbyes, and the one between her, the gang, and Moriya was very touching. The other moment was when Amami realized just how much she impacted the people around her, subsequently getting her sixth sense back. It was a tender moment between her and Inoue, bringing about both a fulfilling and satisfying conclusion.Re-Kan! targets more than just ghosts. Championing simplicity and the connections we hold with the people around us, the anime manages to be a relaxing ride with heartfelt roots. While it is somewhat weak in its art and music department, those aspects do not dissuade the notion that, corporeal or not, life is a truly beautiful entity.SUMMARYStory: Good, the subject of ghosts is utilized well, the episodic nature works in its favor, and the theme on life’s smallest things is executed nicely, with minor flaws in terms of specific plot points and the comedyAnimation: Fine, weirdly real backgrounds, shiny character designs, and just about average actual animationCharacters: Good, Amami, Inoue, and the rest have their characterizations used well, with the connections between them being more important than their singular aspectsSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Good, Amami and Inoue were fun, with specific moments getting me emotionalFinal Score: 6/10 would you attempt to converse with them to learn more about who they happened to be? Re-Kan! focuses on these supernatural beings, giving an anime that relaxes both body and mind.STORYRe-Kan! stars Hibiki Amami, a young woman who has a sixth-sense, allowing her to communicate with entities that are no longer living. One day, she happens upon Narumi Inoue, with the two becoming at least acquaintances and the tale progressing from there.Ghosts are most often perceived as scary, what with their translucent bodies, ability to float, and the hauntings they take part in.

At first I thought it was going to be quite dull and rubbish however as I got more into the anime I actually personally started to really like it.There isn't really a plot line to any standard, it just really follows a girl that can talk to her ghost friends along with her normal school friends, simple plot however at the end of the series there is a slight plot pick up where it actually follows an event. To me it was quite dull in the plot area as it didn't really have one,...however this didn't destroy the anime in any way.The character!! Oh my, where do I even begin. These characters are unique beyond belief, all having their own unique traits. The characters where my favourite part of this whole series, there was your usual funny ones, your usual scardy cat, your usual phone geek, your usual closet girl that wants to hide herself. The list can go on, the characters are just so good! I love the connection the two main casts have (and If you keep your Yuri-Goggles on you can see a bit more hehe) There development was really well thought of and in my eyes I found that the creator thought of what the characters would be like before even beginning.For this type of anime I thought the animation would be dull, in some aspects it was but you can expect that from this type of anime. The animation was actually pretty nice, it gave effect and shown you 'ghost' like effects too.Honestly, I liked this series. It made me enjoy myself and laugh, at some times I even wanted to carry on watching it because it was that fun to watch. The characters made it enjoying to watch, how they acted and what they did. If you love comedy school like anime this is great. Although some will turn away straight away I recommend to give it a chance, to me it will give you enjoyment. If not, then sorry!Canaan~ however this didn't destroy the anime in any way.The character!! Oh my, where do I even begin.

If not, then sorry!Canaan~"", 'Well, considering this is my first review, let’s see how we go!It’s time to delve into the world of a high school student who has an activated 6th sense. Every day life for her is a mixture between making new friends and catching up with many other interesting people she has met over the course of her life. For Amami, this life of communicating with the living and the dead is all she has known. Her gift was passed down from her mother when she was born, who is just as kind and compassionate as she is.Fast forwarding into her schooling life where she is...introduced rather abruptly to her new best-friend-to-be Inoue. Mix in an ex-Yakuza member, a furious blogger, the girl who has a knack for finding the adorable in everything and an energetic high school boy for a healthy balance and there you have the ingredients for a rather heartwarming show.Each episode takes you day by day into the life of these teenagers, exploring many different scenarios relating to the living and the dead. It shows you grief, sadness, acceptance and introduces you to many interesting characters who are from the other side of the veil.As much as I seem to be chatting this show up right now, I wish I could put more substance into this review than what I am. Unfortunately, that substance isn’t apparent because that is all the show is. High school students roaming around the city and dealing with events surrounding death and loss.Don’t get me wrong. Each episode had something which most people can relate to. The sudden death of a loved one, coming to terms with a person lost a long time ago, moving on and finding acceptance in someone’s passing. However, out of the 13 episodes this show had to offer, only two of them actually made me care about what was going on. This for me is a little upsetting, because this show could have had so much more going for it. Instead, it turned into background noise while I played a game in another window or browsed my Social Media outlets.The characters, even though were enjoyable at the time, in hindsight are just the typical anime characters you see in every school based slice of life. Each episode seemed like a repetition of the same typical genre points and the only episodes which seemed to have any kind of working plot line where two towards the end. Which in turn forces me to leave this review here rather incomplete and unsatisfactory, likely to coincide with how I felt about the show. introduced rather abruptly to her new best-friend-to-be Inoue.

Is a supernatural, comedy anime that aired in the spring of 2015. The story revolves around Hibiki Amami a high school girl who has the ability to see and talk to spirits. We see the daily life of Hibiki and her friends as they often assist with helping spirits come to peace.Now I originally reviewed this series back in the summer of 2015. Fortunately I have had time to reflect over my original thoughts on the series and see if this new one gets taken down. Wish me luck!Story:Hibiki Amami is just your average high school...girl who has a heart of gold and a personality of sweetness so over used that I had to drink my tea without sugar whilst watching this anime.The series was episodic dealing with different spirits and the life they lead before passing on into the spirit realm. Hibiki and co set about helping the spirits find peace, but they never move on and still linger around Hibiki, more often than not to provide comedic relief.I feel that it was a shame that the bad humour took out the sting of the more heart felt moments from the heavy hitting stories.Episode Nine was a prime example of how the comedy made said heart felt moments look completely out of place. I was actually surprised with how sad the ending of that episode was especially since the cast assumed that Hibiki dating an elderly gentlemen. That for me was a prime example of Re-kan’s undoing.Well… maybe im being a bit too harsh on the comedy elements as I’ll admit some of it got me smiling.Characters:Like most comedy shows the supporting cast does much better than the main character herself. Mainly the dead spirits which Hibiki interacts with provide more comedy and honestly more story. Hibiki is the one that brings the living and dead together like the mother Teresa she is.Hibiki Amami is a sweet but ditsy girl who is a ghost whisperer. She is a nice girl and at times can be taken advantage of unintentionally by spirits who crave for her attention. Hibiki often helps the spirits to find peace. Her relationships with the living cast of friends are not the focal point, but the friendship she has with her group is just as meaningful as it is with the dead. It is implied that Hibiki and Narumi Inoue are Yuri partners, but never specified.Narumi Inoue is the secondary character who is afraid of ghosts and is the shows Tsundere. Over time she befriends Hibiki without ever really admitting it until later episodes. Narumi does a good job of supporting Hibiki and being there for her in good times and bad.Other mentionable characters include the role-call samurai who has a massive crush on Hibiki, Merry-San who haunts Kana Uehara and Ero-Neko the perverted cat who… has his moments.Art:The Artwork isn’t great and neither is the animation. I rarely see points throughout the show which suggests this is pretty to look at.Kana Uehara is an example since her hair covered her eye, yet you could still see the eye… I don’t know why this bothered me really. This is the first show I’ve watched of Pierrot’s work but I wasn’t impressed.Sound:Re-Kan’s opening felt that I should have been is a stereotypical Yuri show, which to be fair appeared to have the lingering undertones of one.The rest of the soundtrack was nice actually. I could range from happy peaceful music to upbeat and whacky at a moment’s notice. Some parts of the soundtrack can stand out on its own.Final Verdict:Overall Re-Kan! was an average show. Whilst there always seemed to be a positive message by the end of most episodes it’d hard to justify watching through twenty minutes of a perverted cat looking for girls panties.(I’m probably over-blowing that scenario, but I hope you get the gist)Hibiki stole the lights for your typically sweet main protagonist and the side cast do a positive job in progressing the movement of the episodes, whether that be offering comedy or helping the spirits find peace as well.Animation is almost below standard and the soundtrack does an relatively decent job.I’d recommend that you watch sixth sense if you want something a bit more serious.Overall Re-Kan! Gets a 6 out of 10.Alternate recommendations are the aforementioned Sixth Sense which is not an anime.I also recommend Death Parade focussing on dead people and their passage in to the abyss or reincarnation which does a more serious take on the dead and the infamous realm known as ‘In Limbo’Thanks for reading guys. Have a nice day! girl who has a heart of gold and a personality of sweetness so over used that I had to drink my tea without sugar whilst watching this anime.The series was episodic dealing with different spirits and the life they lead before passing on into the spirit realm. Hibiki and co set about helping the spirits find peace, but they never move on and still linger around Hibiki, more often than not to provide comedic relief.I feel that it was a shame that the bad humour took out the sting of the more heart felt moments from the heavy hitting stories.Episode Nine was a prime example of how the comedy made said heart felt moments look completely out of place. I was actually surprised with how sad the ending of that episode was especially since the cast assumed that Hibiki dating an elderly gentlemen. That for me was a prime example of Re-kan’s undoing.Well… maybe im being a bit too harsh on the comedy elements as I’ll admit some of it got me smiling.Characters:Like most comedy shows the supporting cast does much better than the main character herself. Mainly the dead spirits which Hibiki interacts with provide more comedy and honestly more story. Hibiki is the one that brings the living and dead together like the mother Teresa she is.Hibiki Amami is a sweet but ditsy girl who is a ghost whisperer. She is a nice girl and at times can be taken advantage of unintentionally by spirits who crave for her attention. Hibiki often helps the spirits to find peace. Her relationships with the living cast of friends are not the focal point, but the friendship she has with her group is just as meaningful as it is with the dead. It is implied that Hibiki and Narumi Inoue are Yuri partners, but never specified.Narumi Inoue is the secondary character who is afraid of ghosts and is the shows Tsundere. Over time she befriends Hibiki without ever really admitting it until later episodes. Narumi does a good job of supporting Hibiki and being there for her in good times and bad.Other mentionable characters include the role-call samurai who has a massive crush on Hibiki, Merry-San who haunts Kana Uehara and Ero-Neko the perverted cat who… has his moments.Art:The Artwork isn’t great and neither is the animation. I rarely see points throughout the show which suggests this is pretty to look at.Kana Uehara is an example since her hair covered her eye, yet you could still see the eye… I don’t know why this bothered me really. This is the first show I’ve watched of Pierrot’s work but I wasn’t impressed.Sound:Re-Kan’s opening felt that I should have been is a stereotypical Yuri show, which to be fair appeared to have the lingering undertones of one.The rest of the soundtrack was nice actually. I could range from happy peaceful music to upbeat and whacky at a moment’s notice. Some parts of the soundtrack can stand out on its own.Final Verdict:Overall Re-Kan! was an average show.

Have a nice day!', 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryProbably the easiest review I have written. Simple premise, simple presentation and good enough result. Story is about a girl who can see ghosts and her friends and how they all get along. That\'s all you need really. Very easy to enjoy this Anime, it isn\'t bad nor good, it\'s something you just sit down, relax and watch and by the end you feel as you enjoyed such simplicity.✦Art & SoundCute, clean and satisfying art with some a bit odd photo-realistic backgrounds. As for music & ost,...cannot really remember much. Think they were good enough, but nothing worthwhile.✦CharacterLots of stereotypes and cute characters. Main shippable duo was very cute.  Inoue X Hibiki✦Enjoyment & OverallAs mentioned enough it already in a review. Its a very simple and enjoyable series. Light-hearted, joyful, cute, bright. Type of ""6"" that comes not from boredom, but simply from not getting any sort of surprises. I finished this Anime almost in one go, if it would been a boring Anime, it would take me much longer to finish. cannot really remember much.

It was average budget-tier in all aspects, but it impressed me with subtle technical production creativity, which gave it a polish that increased the enjoyment factor. The harsh reality is that this anime is basic by today\'s standard. It doesn\'t try too hard to entertain, but instead is seemingly used to progress the staff\'s art experience.It\'s set in a late 90s Japanese town. The main character is a girl with traditional Japanese traits who had no mother to raise her, able to see...ghosts due to a family ability passed down to her. She seemingly had a sheltered princess childhood and had been raised to be compassionate. This leads her to meet and connect with a seemingly endless number of other characters, as she takes to helping ghosts out of kindness during her high school years.Characters can all have their personalities described with one word, matched with a stereotypical physical appearance, such as cranky old man or yankee girl. Living characters with foreign physical traits, and ghosts from all sorts of time periods and backgrounds seem to take interest in and befriend the girl. The show seemingly runs with this fact, even making running jokes about it. Plain ghosts are shown as just hands or floating blobs.The visuals and audio seem to be budget oriented, but there seems to be technical creativity to make it work out well. The backgrounds/settings seem to be CG that\'s given a fair amount of additional touch-up to make it fit fairly consistently. I took notice of how characters and CG objects in the settings were masked and layered, giving a sense of depth (e.g. scene with aho-senpai doing his dance in the back, while girls sat on or at their desks in the foreground). The animations have a subtle slap-stick feel, and are colored with exaggerated highlights. Even on a gloomy day, the characters shine brightly, and shadows, such as on their necks, are still well defined. There\'s no faceless living characters--the entire class and incoming new class have unique physical appearances. There\'s even a scene where the entire class is shown turning to face the main character.The audio reminds me of video game quality (e.g. RPG, such as Trails in the Sky), and find that it factored in strongly to evoke strong emotion. Sounds echo in the bathroom and utility poles woosh by in high speed pans, with a little ambiance here and there.As far as enjoyment, I have to say that there needs to be a term that describes ""sakuga"" moments that involve audio and cinematic cuts instead of action choreography. This show had a few of these that stunned me. This, in turn, made me more alert, looking out for further technical production expertise, making me turn a more critical eye towards the basic parts of the show. I saw no weakness, only well executed polish on what seemingly is an average show.My experience wasn\'t all good. I went from being somewhat bored after about 5 episodes, taking a break before finishing ep6, and then marathoning the rest. I had a number of tear jerk moments towards the end, and admit that I was charmed by the main character by the end, enough to share some feelings.All in all, it\'s a show I don\'t regret finishing, but will be reluctant to recommend to others. Props to the production team for making this at least a little enjoyable. Seems like it could\'ve been done a lot better, with a stronger comedic element, but I\'ll take the few eps of emotional motherly relationship stuff. ghosts due to a family ability passed down to her.

Though the show tends to deal with heavy-handed topics such as death and grievance, the show\'s light-hearted, comedic feel prevents these issues from overshadowing the entire show.The show\'s story is unarguably its weakest point, as there is no real plot per se. The entire show is episodic, with limited continuity between them aside from episodes 11-12. Our protagonist Hibiki Amami is a recent transfer student who is beginning her first year of high-school in a new city. On the...way to school, she meets Narumi Inoue, another first year attending the same high-school as Hibiki. After a mishap on the crosswalk, the fated meeting between these two occurs and Narumi discovers that Hibiki has the ability to interact with the supernatural. From this point, the show deals with the day-to-day activities of Narumi and Hibiki, and their friends. Most episodes revolve around Hibiki, Narumi and their friends helping a spirit of some kind and generally having a cute, fun time while doing so. While the comedic tone of the anime is at the forefront, the show doesn\'t shy away from the more depressing sides of death, managing to have its own fair share of heart-warming and heart-rendering moments. If you\'re the least bit emotional, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring a pack of tissues to wipe your eyes while watching.The characters are the anime\'s strongest points. While the characters do tend to be one-dimensional, only having one major defining character trait, this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. The show tends to play itself off the character archetypes and a lot of the show\'s comedy is centred around how the characters act and interact with one another. Lovers of yuri and/or romance won\'t be amiss here either, with the show having much subtext for both. Through character interactions between Narumi and Hibiki, it becomes clear that these two harbor much more feelings than friendship for one another. The rest of the girls in the squad tend to ship the two together, teasing Narumi whenever Hibiki is involved. It\'s even directly implied that Hibiki has a crush on Narumi, with both girls becoming flustered when Esumi implies that Hibiki has fallen for Narumi because of the similarities between Narumi and Hibiki\'s father. The show seems to be self aware around it as well, stating several times that the two girls have ""yuri"" characteristics, and how a certain scene plays out at the end of the anime. The rest of the characters are great as well. We have the journalistic Kana, who regularly photographs the spirits and writes about them on her blog. There\'s also former gangster, Kyouko who was renowned for defending weaker students from bullies and our lovable yet dense Kenta, the only male in the group, however he\'s only present to serve as the girls\' punching bag and pack-mule. Throughout the series, you\'ll be introduced to many ghosts and spirits, many of whom become regular characters in the supporting cast.The show\'s art isn\'t revolutionary, however it is cutesy and light, complimenting the overall nature of the show. The sound is superb as well, perfectly matching any tone that a scene has. Without the show\'s OST, it\'s hard to imagine many scenes having the same emotional impact.Overall, the show was a funny, light-hearted and cutesy time that I enjoyed. While it is regrettable that the show sold so poorly, I had a good time and would be willing to watch a new season if they were to ever return, which I hope they do. Re-Kan! isn\'t revolutionary or game-changing, that\'s a given, however it uses its tropes and cliches to deliver a well produced fun time, filled with laughs and tears throughout. Go out and give this show a shot, and I hope you have as good a time as me.Papa Bless. way to school, she meets Narumi Inoue, another first year attending the same high-school as Hibiki.

The ending I think would satisfy just about anyone, but you\'re still left feeling very, ""ah, oh well... I guess on to the next.""The art on the other hand I really enjoyed, mostly just the background imagery though. I thought the school was really well designed and didn\'t have that typical feel which was nice. Although I don\'t know how I felt about the weird bangs. Hopefully you will see what I mean about that because...I\'m at a loss for words.Would recommend watching if you have nothing else really going for you( I was sick with a cold,) and  you just want something to watch casually, because it did have some funny moments as well as some tear jerking moments.

I love the concept, a girl can see ghosts, and goes out of her way to make their lives easier. I love that kind of wholesome story. Any wholesomeness is taken away by the friggin perverted cat. Anything wholesome is just taken away by the creepy laughing and the ""show me your panties!"" bs. it\'s a stupid trope and I\'m tired of it. If it were once or twice an episode it\'d be much more manageable, but it\'s once every 5 minutes....A bunch of ghost kids are trying to form a connection with Inoue? Let\'s throw in a cat trying to peek up her skirt. Amami\'s tired because she hasn\'t been sleeping well? Oh, it\'s because the cat is literally in her dreams pressuring her to show her panties.

I don\'t have as much to say about this anime as I thought I would. I\'ve been on a personal mission of sorts lately, trying to find a Slice of Life show I really enjoyed. (It is my least favorite genre, but I have tried.) I guess I should have figured years ago that the answer was to add ghosts. The construction for this review has been a disaster, so I\'m just going to throw my thoughts out there in no particular order.I did eventually get sucked in and want to see more, but it was...a slow start. To its credit, the series does eventually address nearly all of my early critiques, but our main protagonist is not one of them. Hibiki is just so bland. She\'s one of those characters who comes across as being just a little too perfect. The thing that was supposed to make her stand out was her ability to see and communicate with ghosts, but the ghosts in this show are super... accessible. When regular people can see them through the lens of their cell phone cameras, it sort of takes away from the one thing that was supposed to make Hibiki stand out.And then there\'s her group of friends... I will say that they grew on me over time. But they certainly contributed to episode one being really hard to swallow. This show starts out with that \'Main character with a dead mother moves to a new town trope.\' But very little time is focused on showing Hibiki settle in. One second it\'s her first day, then jump to a week later and she already has a close group of friends who believe in her abilities completely and have no reservations about hanging out with the girl who speaks to the dead. Right... To be fair, none of these new friends are exactly what one might call ""normal"" themselves, and as time went on, their own quirkiness grew to be more endearing than unrealistic.Re-kan! is certainly a lot more lighthearted than all the other ghost shows I\'ve been watching lately. But it does have its moments where they do address death and the effect is has on the living. Namely, grief. And it was those slightly darker, more heartfelt episodes that really drew me in. As I mentioned, this is still a Slice of Life series, and it shows. They have their beach day and their culture festival and their New Years\' celebration, but these episodes all have a supernatural twist to them that held my interest a lot more than those sorts of episodes usually do.If you\'re already a Slice of Life fan, I definitely suggest checking this one out. And if you\'re not a SoL fan, but you enjoy things with a supernatural touch, (like myself) you may want to give this one a try also. My suggestion is to watch at least up through episode three before deciding whether to continue or not. (That was the first of the deeper episodes, the ones that gave me hope for this series.) Personally, I\'m going to call this a mission accomplished and put the genre to rest for a while. a slow start.

You have Amami who can see ghosts all around her, as her mother also could before she died, and tends to get into some hairy situations because of it. Her friends are there to bail her out and it led to some laugh out loud moments.Is it a great storyline? No, its rather cliche and overdone but it is very charming in its ways and i quite enjoyed it.Characters - what Re-Kan! Lacks in story it makes up for in diverse characters. Amami is the shy, sweet type that usually gets on my nerves but...with her it worked. She was always helpful and that led to some of the more tear jerker moments.The other main human character is Inoue. Inoue is your typical tsundere character. She acts tough and stand-offish to Amami but she really values thier friendship, so much at times it bordered on shoujo-ai. The relationship between these two is fun, funny, sweet and frustrating. I wanted so much MORE! I want the soft shy sweet Amami and Inoue to develope a strong bond.The other human characters are well rounded. Theres the hardcore ex gangster Esume, the paranormal bloggist Uehara who uses Amamis ghost familiars for her popular posts, the occult fanatic Ogawa and the only guy in the bunch: Yamada. They all have thier roles and help Amami out when she needs it. While Yamada fit the stereotypical ""guy who just cant get a date"" role he really had me chuckling and i generally liked him. They all add charm and all have thier moments to shine.Ghosts - The ghosts in this anime vary in personality and age. From very young and cute (above) to a samurai, a gal ghost (think valley girl) and a cat(?).. Actually i do not know if the cat is a ghost or not but i guess he is, either way he is completely pervy!The ghost comprise the other half of the show. After all, its what the anime is about! They are all funny or tragic in thier own ways and some i really, really liked.  The main two are the samurai and the gal ghost and i liked that, they intereacted with each other well as a witty pair. The ghosts help (or hinder) Amami and Co along the way. I would have liked to know.more backstories on some of them as one of the episodes had me bawling like a little girl.Art Style and Sound - Closing out my review is the art anf sound. The art is very pretty and lends to the story well. The large eyes of Amami show her innocence while the blank eyes of the samurai ghost show his tragedy. Lines are clean and everything is bright and in place. The style simply fits.The opening and ending songs are upbeat and playful. They are catchy and the animations cheerful. I loved the opening more than the ending but they both fit the happy go lucky style of the show.Conclusion - Re-kan! Is not an anime everyone will enjoy. I honestly almost stopped watching it but it drew me in because of such good characterization. I wanted to see what would happen to Amami and by the end i was glad i continued as the last few episodes really tugged at my heart. with her it worked. She was always helpful and that led to some of the more tear jerker moments.The other main human character is Inoue. Inoue is your typical tsundere character.

I loved the opening more than the ending but they both fit the happy go lucky style of the show.Conclusion - Re-kan! Is not an anime everyone will enjoy. I honestly almost stopped watching it but it drew me in because of such good characterization. I wanted to see what would happen to Amami and by the end i was glad i continued as the last few episodes really tugged at my heart.', ""Update Note: I watched the whole show but my opinions have not changed. I liked the story(although there were some unnecessary and rushed parts) and everything but the sound + artwork especially really bugged me throughout the whole show.I gave this show a six because I liked it but the director really blew it for me to give it anything higher. Eyes visible past the hair and the sound is horrible.There were so many inconsistencies that I thought that they changed voice actors. Also in one scene Uehara sounded so different that I thought that they messed up and mixed Yamada's line in there....I put no blame on the seiyuus at all, this is entirely on the director and the audio people. There is absolutely no oomph to their voices especially when Inoue is yelling. It's like they used a voice equalization filter. Felt absolutely no menace from their words and the delivery just felt flat. These aren't new seiyuus. They're experienced, they know what they're doing and they're good at what they do. Should add that it wasn't just Inoue's lines that felt flat but it was the same case for everybody, it all just felt lifeless. I haven't had an issue with sound in an anime before so this was a bit of a surprise to me.The art really messes with you sometimes. The characters switch between good and ugly and sometimes the girls, Inoue especially look masculine in some scenes. Which is a shame really because Yuuhi, Hibiki, and Uehara were good character designs. I know they tried to make Inoue cute and Esumi cool but it didn't really pan out with the consistencies.It felt like they had a really tight schedule or really just wanted to get it done with as fast as possible.

It's funny, pretty consistently, with characters that fit into clear personality types, that bounce off each other with enough variety to keep your attention for 12 episodes. If I had to compare it to something, BBC's 'Ghosts' comes to mind, that, for me, is a pretty high compliment; 'Ghosts' is a phenomenal show that uses it's 'one person who can see ghosts' premise impeccably, and 'Re-Kan!' shares a lot of that same sense for how to mine the concept for all its comedic potential. The ghosts are...just as varied as the human characters, and manage to be just as funny to watch bouncing off everyone else.That's not to say it's only jokes; the show also knows how to tug on your heart-strings, and a couple of episodes definitely left me a little choked up. And, while it's light on constant, forward-moving character development, the central relationship in the show definitely has a decent sense of momentum; even within the realm of 'shows that aren't explicitly queer but also the queer subtext is basically just text', the two of them have super compelling chemistry, romantic or otherwise.That's not to say there's nothing wrong with this show on an objective level. The creepy cat was getting old before I finished the second episode, for one thing. And, like, it's not some big complex story, there definitely could have been room for deeper development, and maybe I'd have liked to see that subtext drag itself those final few metres to the surface; it's competent, but it's certainly not especially ambitious.But, as I've written before, not every show needs to be ambitious. This show wanted to be charming, cute, and funny, and it succeeds pretty conclusively at all three. Well worth giving a try if you want something to blast through and laugh through an afternoon. just as varied as the human characters, and manage to be just as funny to watch bouncing off everyone else.That's not to say it's only jokes; the show also knows how to tug on your heart-strings, and a couple of episodes definitely left me a little choked up.

There was a part where a bunch of ghost children played with her and she was able to see all of them just fine despite not being spiritually sensitive or looking through a camera lens. Only explanation is that she herself is also a ghost. Not really but that was the direction I honestly thought it would go for a while. I was kind of sad to see it didn't play out like that. Jokes aside I thought this was a decent show overall.The ghosts and youkai in this are depicted as mostly harmless or even comically helpful at...times. There aren't really any deeper themes explored or underlying messages to be gathered. It's basically a vehicle for more comedy. The comedy lands for the most part, but it isn't anything spectacular. I think the walking-punching-bag guy is a little overused and it gets a little repetitive the way they make fun of him. He's the kind of stupid that's not in an endearing way. The joke about Inoue being scared of ghosts gets a little old but I was able to trick myself into thinking it was funny for longer by telling myself that she was probably a ghost the whole time. She wasn't.Our main character forgot to have a personality, but enough of the supporting cast has one that the show ends up being okay overall. Not great, just okay.

It\'s fairly forgettable, though could have been much better with a few relatively small changes. It\'s not necessarily ""bad"" or unpleasant to watch, but the biggest problem here is the kind of cookie-cutter otaku pandering and indulgence in cliches that makes it feel like it came off an assembly line rather than bringing something original to the table.+ Positives: The positive aspects of the series are carried by the relationship between Hibiki, a lovable airhead who can see spirits, and...Narumi, her tsundere best friend that tries to keep her distance because she\'s frightened of the ghostly happenings that surround Hibiki at all times. Their dynamic is cute and full of heart, and their friends (Uehara and Esumi in particular) are just as charming for the most part. The character designs are strong and the animation, while more functional than fancy, is well storyboarded. In contrast to the similar-in-premise Mieruko-chan, the ghosts here are not malevolent or grotesque, and they end up being fun characters in their own right. The show is light-hearted for most of its run, but it does engage with the inherent tragedy of its premise, that Hibiki is mostly interacting with ghosts of children and young people that died far too young. When it does choose to switch gears into heavy drama, most notably in episode 8, it generally does a good job of not trivializing or undermining the necessary dramatic parts with poorly timed comedy. Those scenes can hit surprisingly hard, especially if you aren\'t prepared for the tone shift. Itou Miku, VA for Narumi, does a solid job of being the ""scream queen"" of the series when she reacts to the ghosts.- Negatives: An aggravating overuse of the kind of pervert humor that is unfortunately endemic to comedy anime. Things like the cat that\'s constantly trying to look up the skirts of the female characters or Kenta\'s police officer brother openly lusting after underage girls just gives the whole thing this icky vibe that simply did not need to be there. It\'s not funny, it\'s just creepy, and I struggle to understand why they think this kind of cringeworthy shit is in any way entertaining. Kenta, likewise, adds nothing, and his single repeated gimmick of yelling and then getting beaten up by Esumi wears out its welcome almost immediately. This all adds up to a sense that you get throughout the show that they could just get rid of a few elements of this series, like the cat and Kenta, and it would be vastly improved, or at least not as groan-inducing. The pacing is also very strange, it\'s hard to get a sense of how fast time is passing unless it\'s a holiday episode, but the series covers over a year of in-universe time and it doesn\'t feel that way at all. Furthermore, the most questionable part of how it\'s paced is the ending. Episode 12 feels like it\'s the clear end of the series and then it\'s just... not. There\'s a 13th episode after it that\'s just, like, a random episode, without any of the sense of finality and closure that 12 ended with. It almost feels like an OVA that was tacked on at the end or something. It\'s a strange decision that makes the ending much weaker than it would have been if it had ended on 12. In general, Re-Kan stays safely inside of its box and regurgitates most of the slice of life tropes you\'re likely to be familiar with, and not to belabor the point on the pervert humor, but even that feels incredibly derivative. There are a couple bits that feel fresher, like the ghosts of the samurai and the gyaru becoming friends, but it often feels uninspired and rote, like it was written by someone that didn\'t really have any ideas and just leaned on the kinds of tired cliches that they picked up from a general survey of shounen anime and manga.

Masamune-kun no Revenge,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33487/Masamune-kun_no_Revenge,"[""S.P.O.I.L.E.R.S. - Stupid Pissed Off Idiot Likes Emphatically Raging at ShitThis review is honest, but purposefully exaggerated so that it may be entertaining to some people, much like the anime itself except I believe myself to be halfway amusing.  It also contains bad words like “fuck” and “dick” and “kittens”, so to all children who can’t handle a few motherfucking swears, avert your goddamn eyes!!Let’s talk about the concept of Masamune-kun for a moment, and why I was immediately nervous about where the anime would go.The plot has a clear ending that it is working toward:  Makabe Masamune will get revenge on Adagaki...Aki in a most grandiose and satisfying way.  But you can’t just have a good ending; otherwise the audience would just skip to the last episode to see how it plays out.  You need to somehow make the ending satisfying, but also balance the rest of the story so that the build-up is worth it as well.And here’s where those spoilers really kick in.Masamune-kun has neither a good build-up, nor the ending it promises.  In fact, it has no ending at all.  The final episode is a fucking karaoke party.  Why the fuck did they even make this?  I feel like a complete idiot for subjugating myself to watching every minute of this mumbo jumbo, which was admittedly okay and non-offensive for several episodes, but after a while it feels like even the writer didn’t know how the revenge was gonna work, so they started making excuses for some weeks or years or however long you’ve been experiencing this series.  Oh god, could you imagine a second season of this?  This is not any sort of narrative that requires more than twelve episodes to develop.  It initially appears as a typical romcom, but with a twist ending and nothing more.  The presence of a sequel would immediately imply that the ending is prolonged longer than necessary, like a really awkward handshake.  Not like Hand Shakers tho.  That anime was flawless in every aspect.Yes, yes “it’s about the journey” whatever, except the actual journey towards the non-existent climax is about as fruitful as an average expedition in The Oregon Trail.  Masamune, being a charming young lad, simply oozes with swagger and sex appeal.  Yes, this little piggy got /fit/, and now every teenage girl within a five-mile radius wants to bang him.  But instead, Masamune would rather reject these fine 2D women and chase after the dumb ugly bitch so he can end up rejecting her too.  You know, even though chasing after one girl for your entire high school life is probably the worst thing you can do as a high schooler, I can respect Masamune for being so determined to work towards his goal.  You know, IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.And while you sit back and watch Masamune make irritating decisions, Masamune-kun will do its damndest to make you laugh.  If you love WITTY ANIME HUMOR then this is about as much WITTY ANIME HUMOR as you could possibly need.  Characters overreact because their actual personalities can’t carry the scene, people often compare scenarios to those seen in anime and manga, and the main character comments on so many things in his head that the Fine Bros would’ve sued Silver Link a year ago.  No, I’m not saying you should feel bad for finding these things funny.  I’m just saying that I didn’t.  Masamune-kun doesn’t have any strong nor original jokes, and the only thing I can say about its general style of comedy is that it’s “very anime”.  The ONE joke I actually laughed at is Masamune’s mom looking like a five-year-old girl, because it's so weird and illogical and out there that I just kinda like it.  Doctors HATE her!That’s really what I could say about Masamune-kun in general, it’s “very anime”:  A decent but not particularly unhealthy dose of “underage” partial nudity, the leading female as a high-and-mighty bitch quee--I mean tsundere, an oblivious main character, and a high school containing all the silliness.  Masamune-kun never sets out to break the mold or add anything new, although a twist ending would’ve been nice.  Maybe at the end of the series, Masamune could’ve said “ha, PRANK’D” and dunked Adagaki Aki into a shark tank as his way of getting revenge.  You know.  Just a suggestion.  Any sort of revenge plot would’ve been nice to see.  But anyway, Masamune-kun just wants to be a plain high school rom-com.  And you know what?  I’m okay with that.  For most of the season, Masamune-kun failed to evoke a single reaction from me.  Nope, not one.  I watched episode after episode week after week and didn’t crack a smile, didn’t have any particular thoughts, didn’t twitch an eyebrow, didn’t slit my wrists, nothing.  It was a perfectly acceptable five out of ten, and if it sounds negative, it's actually something that I am 100% okay with.But then something happened later.Now, the lack of delivery on Masamune-kun’s part is bad enough.  Since I keep mentioning it, I really don’t like the fact that it doesn’t bring about the ending it promises.  But before that cuckening even ignites, we get this abysmal “final” arc where an actual antagonist is brought in.  No, the antagonist is not Adagaki Aki, it’s just a random kid who looks like Masamune when he was fat, and he’s to take Adagaki Aki’s hand in marriage as some sort of business arrangement or something.  So, this kid is an obstacle for Masamune to tackle so he can not get his revenge.The problem is that I’m expected to believe this is a bad thing.I don’t care about Masamune.  He’s not an interesting character.  I like the fact that he was a fat kid who ended up getting buff, and uhhhhhhhhhh, yep that’s pretty much it.  Beyond this, he’s just a high school protagonist who gets a small harem that’s still big enough to include a trap, because that’s WITTY ANIME HUMOR.  I don’t care about his revenge plot either.  Yeah, I would kinda like to see it, but I also see it as something worth giving up.  Masamune has almost nothing to lose by not getting his revenge; all that happens as a result is that he’ll feel a little bested by that one prick from his childhood--who the hell cares, anyway?  Just leave that shit in the past--if you want, you can aggressively bang one of the eighteen billion other girls in school and think of Badagaki the whole time.  I’d watch that hentai. Or anime. Or cartoon. Or attack helicopter. Whatever the community is arguing about.  Hey, isn’t that what that shitstorm Scum’s Wish is doing, anyway?Yet, despite these things, Masamune-kun thinks I do actually care about Masamune’s endgame, ‘cuz he’s the main character and all.  So this lookalike dude is apparently a bad thing. And to that, I say…Fuck you.Masamune-kun actually made me angry at this point of the story, because this abominable terrorist is a nice kid who just wants to do the right thing.  He’s sucked into the marriage just like Whaki is, but his intentions are angelically good.  He even approaches Adagaki’s friends in private to clear up any misconceptions they have, because he truly respects his to-be bride.  What’s the problem? Yeah, Adagaki Aki is an obnoxious bitch who deserves to trip and fall into a vat of rotten donkey milk.  But you know what they say:  bitches ain’t shit.  Why do we gotta worry about them so much?  Just let them go.  She might’ve embarrassed a few people in brutal ways (even though they were all basically fedora tippers so they got what they deserved), but it’s not like she throws rocks at kittens and steps on fennec foxes in her free time.  She’s not so horrible that she NEEDS a taste of her own shit.I’m just baffled at how completely pointless Masamune-kun’s Revenge is.  Really, all it needed to do was set up this grand revenge, but instead it insisted on taking this weird detour so that it could evolve the romance.  Give me a break.  I didn’t want to see that in the first place.  Not just because I’m expecting a revenge plot, but also because I don’t like these two characters, and seeing them form a relationship isn’t satisfying.  In fact, Adagaki Aki is meant to be unlikable, so why would I want the main character to date her?  She’s supposed to be the villain, but then at the last minute they throw in this secret side of her that actually found fat Masamune to be attractive??  What????  All of the sudden the revenge plot is gone, so now she needs to be presented as likable.  Ten episodes is a bit too late to change my mind on someone’s personality.  It’s also too late to rewrite the entire show. Man, I thought I avoided the new Rewrite this season.The other thing about Adagaki Aki that strikes me as odd is how she’s supposed to be the most beautiful and magnificent creature in the entire world; that world being the high school.  They demonstrate this by showing people I don’t care about saying that she’s beautiful. Adagaki Aki in the flesh has a fairly tall and slender figure with a sharp face and uh… oh yeah, NOTHING.  Remember, this is the most beautiful girl in the entire school, according to literally everybody in the school.  So the anime then dumps all of the jiggle physics and panty shots onto Aki’s sidekick, a maid girl with short hair and big tits voiced by Inori Minase.  Now that's some good casting.   Good job, Silver Link.If this were a live-action series with actual human beings and all of their many physical flaws, these comments wouldn’t exist as Adagaki Aki could look like an actually attractive person with as few flaws as possible.  But when you have an anime (or manga) where every character is painstakingly drawn to be beautiful and perfect and eye-catching to the audience, I have no idea how I’m supposed to believe that any single one of them are considered attractive in comparison to the others.  I guess if you have a domination fetish, yeah, Aki’s your girl, but if you’re one of…  *ahem*  THOSE people…  then you might prefer Mr. Boipussy~ over there with the weird yellow pluses in his or her eyes.  Why is that a thing.Anyway, my point is the character designs all suck and that NotRem is the better girl because her tits are bigger. Masamune doesn’t even look muscular despite that being his entire character, but whatever.You might think that the lack of strong character designs could imply more movement, but if you believe that then you probably thought that Masamune would get his revenge, didn’t you.  No, there’s not any single bit of interesting art direction or animation or anything.  It takes place in a boring school with a decent dress code--the boys’ uniforms look a little unusual with the yellow and dark blue color scheme, but calling them garish would be extreme.  The girls’ uniforms are equally decent at the top, but the yellow skirts are a weird combination.“shut up lux who cares”Me.Now, the soundtrack is an interesting sort of entity.  For the most part, it’s obnoxiously loud and mind-shreddingly irritating, but in a way that could’ve possibly been ideal.  The OST places heavy emphasis on each scene, making simple decisions more dramatic and making characters more imposing than they actually are.  The bigger problem is that the art direction is completely lifeless and boring, making the grandiose soundtrack utterly pointless.  If the show looked as intense and excessive as it sounds, this could've made things funnier in a way that Nichijou has mastered, but of course that wouldn't happen.  I hope Silver Link gave the composer a nice participation ribbon for his effort, he deserves it.The OP and ED suck.  I don’t have anything to say about them because I skipped them every episode except the first, because they’re completely boring.  Too bad I couldn’t skip the entire show tho.  Next.Oh wait, that’s all I need to say.Masamune-kun could’ve been a strong four to a light five, which I’m okay with, and I could’ve let it go about its business without a care in the world… but the complete lack of delivery alone brings it down to a 2, a number I use to notate something that’s SLIGHTLY watchable, because you could argue that Masamune-kun is a decent and funny rom-com even though it should be a revenge story.The non-existent ending and last few episodes just pissed me off so much that I need to let myself go and burn everything in my path.  Damn you, Masamune-kun, let it be known I shall have my own revenge by posting this 2228-word review on a Western database not seen by anyone significant in the industry, for it’s currently the only platform I have to post upon!

So, this kid is an obstacle for Masamune to tackle so he can not get his revenge.The problem is that I’m expected to believe this is a bad thing.I don’t care about Masamune.  He’s not an interesting character.  I like the fact that he was a fat kid who ended up getting buff, and uhhhhhhhhhh, yep that’s pretty much it.  Beyond this, he’s just a high school protagonist who gets a small harem that’s still big enough to include a trap, because that’s WITTY ANIME HUMOR.  I don’t care about his revenge plot either.  Yeah, I would kinda like to see it, but I also see it as something worth giving up.  Masamune has almost nothing to lose by not getting his revenge; all that happens as a result is that he’ll feel a little bested by that one prick from his childhood--who the hell cares, anyway?  Just leave that shit in the past--if you want, you can aggressively bang one of the eighteen billion other girls in school and think of Badagaki the whole time.  I’d watch that hentai. Or anime. Or cartoon. Or attack helicopter. Whatever the community is arguing about.  Hey, isn’t that what that shitstorm Scum’s Wish is doing, anyway?Yet, despite these things, Masamune-kun thinks I do actually care about Masamune’s endgame, ‘cuz he’s the main character and all.  So this lookalike dude is apparently a bad thing. And to that, I say…Fuck you.Masamune-kun actually made me angry at this point of the story, because this abominable terrorist is a nice kid who just wants to do the right thing.  He’s sucked into the marriage just like Whaki is, but his intentions are angelically good.  He even approaches Adagaki’s friends in private to clear up any misconceptions they have, because he truly respects his to-be bride.  What’s the problem? Yeah, Adagaki Aki is an obnoxious bitch who deserves to trip and fall into a vat of rotten donkey milk.  But you know what they say:  bitches ain’t shit.  Why do we gotta worry about them so much?  Just let them go.  She might’ve embarrassed a few people in brutal ways (even though they were all basically fedora tippers so they got what they deserved), but it’s not like she throws rocks at kittens and steps on fennec foxes in her free time.  She’s not so horrible that she NEEDS a taste of her own shit.I’m just baffled at how completely pointless Masamune-kun’s Revenge is.  Really, all it needed to do was set up this grand revenge, but instead it insisted on taking this weird detour so that it could evolve the romance.  Give me a break.  I didn’t want to see that in the first place.  Not just because I’m expecting a revenge plot, but also because I don’t like these two characters, and seeing them form a relationship isn’t satisfying.  In fact, Adagaki Aki is meant to be unlikable, so why would I want the main character to date her?  She’s supposed to be the villain, but then at the last minute they throw in this secret side of her that actually found fat Masamune to be attractive??  What????  All of the sudden the revenge plot is gone, so now she needs to be presented as likable.  Ten episodes is a bit too late to change my mind on someone’s personality.  It’s also too late to rewrite the entire show. Man, I thought I avoided the new Rewrite this season.The other thing about Adagaki Aki that strikes me as odd is how she’s supposed to be the most beautiful and magnificent creature in the entire world; that world being the high school.  They demonstrate this by showing people I don’t care about saying that she’s beautiful. Adagaki Aki in the flesh has a fairly tall and slender figure with a sharp face and uh… oh yeah, NOTHING.  Remember, this is the most beautiful girl in the entire school, according to literally everybody in the school.  So the anime then dumps all of the jiggle physics and panty shots onto Aki’s sidekick, a maid girl with short hair and big tits voiced by Inori Minase.  Now that's some good casting.   Good job, Silver Link.If this were a live-action series with actual human beings and all of their many physical flaws, these comments wouldn’t exist as Adagaki Aki could look like an actually attractive person with as few flaws as possible.  But when you have an anime (or manga) where every character is painstakingly drawn to be beautiful and perfect and eye-catching to the audience, I have no idea how I’m supposed to believe that any single one of them are considered attractive in comparison to the others.  I guess if you have a domination fetish, yeah, Aki’s your girl, but if you’re one of…  *ahem*  THOSE people…  then you might prefer Mr. Boipussy~ over there with the weird yellow pluses in his or her eyes.  Why is that a thing.Anyway, my point is the character designs all suck and that NotRem is the better girl because her tits are bigger. Masamune doesn’t even look muscular despite that being his entire character, but whatever.You might think that the lack of strong character designs could imply more movement, but if you believe that then you probably thought that Masamune would get his revenge, didn’t you.  No, there’s not any single bit of interesting art direction or animation or anything.  It takes place in a boring school with a decent dress code--the boys’ uniforms look a little unusual with the yellow and dark blue color scheme, but calling them garish would be extreme.  The girls’ uniforms are equally decent at the top, but the yellow skirts are a weird combination.“shut up lux who cares”Me.Now, the soundtrack is an interesting sort of entity.  For the most part, it’s obnoxiously loud and mind-shreddingly irritating, but in a way that could’ve possibly been ideal.  The OST places heavy emphasis on each scene, making simple decisions more dramatic and making characters more imposing than they actually are.  The bigger problem is that the art direction is completely lifeless and boring, making the grandiose soundtrack utterly pointless.  If the show looked as intense and excessive as it sounds, this could've made things funnier in a way that Nichijou has mastered, but of course that wouldn't happen.  I hope Silver Link gave the composer a nice participation ribbon for his effort, he deserves it.The OP and ED suck.  I don’t have anything to say about them because I skipped them every episode except the first, because they’re completely boring.  Too bad I couldn’t skip the entire show tho.  Next.Oh wait, that’s all I need to say.Masamune-kun could’ve been a strong four to a light five, which I’m okay with, and I could’ve let it go about its business without a care in the world… but the complete lack of delivery alone brings it down to a 2, a number I use to notate something that’s SLIGHTLY watchable, because you could argue that Masamune-kun is a decent and funny rom-com even though it should be a revenge story.The non-existent ending and last few episodes just pissed me off so much that I need to let myself go and burn everything in my path.  Damn you, Masamune-kun, let it be known I shall have my own revenge by posting this 2228-word review on a Western database not seen by anyone significant in the industry, for it’s currently the only platform I have to post upon!

Just by reading the synopsis you get attracted and curiosity makes you watch it, and what do you find? Masamune wants revenge. Why? Because his feelings were rejected as a child. How will he do that? Wasting his life finding the chick who rejected him, and then wasting even more time making her love him back to reject her and breake her heart. Wow, how mature of his part!This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, so the plot should not be taken so seriously, but that\'s...the main problem. While it has comical moments, the serie wants you to take the revenge issue (the main focus the serie gives) as something totally serious and justified, which fully collides with the fact that the serie is EXTREMELY CLICHE. Having cliches is not the problem, as long as they are used in a way that makes something entertaining to watch at the very least; this is not the case, the ""serious"" revenge issue is contradicted by cliches, ending up in a ridiculous, pitiful and generic development, since the revenge gradually fades off to make way to the inevitable: Masamune and Aki end up falling in love, then the serie resorts to plot devices out of nowhere in order to force the revenge and introduce unnecessary drama (Gasou and the moron bodyguard trio), because we already know how this will end, as the synopsis itself tells you: ""However, his friendship with Aki begins to grow, Masamune begins to question the objectives of his devious plans"".All this also carries the fact that, with the passage of time, the goal of revenge disappears, leaving the serie\'s main focus as a nonsense, and emphasizing how poor and predictable the development is. But do you know what\'s the worst part? At the end, nothing happened! Revenge? No. Real love? No. Absolutely nothing happened. THIS is the real nonsense...Some people defend this serie saying the initial approach to the revenge is something original and rarely seen among other animes of this genre... Which is true, but no matter how original the approach is, if its development is disastrous and it\'s supported by cliches, then the serie will end up being more of the same with other condiments, exactly what happened here. In this sense the serie reminds me to Oregairu, where it pretends to be something different from the usual and ends up falling in more of the same already seen in other animes of the genre.But if there is anything worse than the poor plot development, those are the characters. EVERYBODY AND EACH OF THEM are awful. Starting with the central axis: the protagonist. In the case of many romantic comedies (with or without harem), no matter how fun it is or how nice the girls are, if the protagonist is insufferable, the serie becomes insufferable too, albeit this obviously depends on how much focus it gives to him. In this case, the whole serie is shown from Masamune\'s perspective, so it\'s expected this character to be interesting or likable at least. Of course, it\'s not the case. I will not deny that Masamune stands out for not being your typical dense loser harem MC, and his internal monologues add some depth to the plot and the character in general, but a lot of people think that this, and only this, make him a good character, which is false:-His revenge motive is stupid: as a child he was a target of bullying, and when he met someone who accepted him, he was rejected by that person, which motivated him to change. This is actually not bad, but this change was driven merely by the fact of wanting revenge and not by personal improvement. Not to mention all the time wasted on something so empty. Also, just by getting fit he thinks he matured, how innocent...-His narcissistic attitude is both annoying and unnecessary. It\'s possible to show self-confidence without resorting to narcissism. Besides, the serie focuses TOO MUCH on how every girl that appears on screen drools for him (something VERY ridiculous to see), feeding more his ego. As if they wanted to force his philosophy of ""only handsome boys win in life"", or narcissism was a necessary and obligatory part of his characterization.-His personality is ambiguous, and changes at script convenience. He goes from being bold and self-confident (supported by the aforementioned narcissism), to an insecure boy who is afraid even of talking to a girl, and gets lost in his own plans. Basically, he turns in that typical dense loser harem MC for moments. Where is the supposed maturity he was talking about? A very bland characterization, and a very bad written character in every way.Then we have Aki, ""The Cruel Princess"". The girl who is cruel to everyone but is actually insecure and has a ""cute side"" with chibi faces included to make up for her bitch side so half world can treat her as waifu... This is by far the worst character in the whole serie, and one of the worst ""tsunderes"" I\'ve ever seen. A poorly written character, with a shallow and non-existent development, and a very insufferable attitude that changes to the script convenience, as well as Masamune. Her motives for being cruel are quite questionable and her current personality doesn\'t go according to them. Her attitude contrasts with her ""feed me with 20kg of food while I make moe faces"" and ""I want you to kiss me or tell me you like me... but you\'re still a piece of crap. Get away, you scum!"" traits. The worst thing is that, I insist, the serie wants you to take this bitch side so badly written seriously to justify Masamune\'s revenge.Similarly, the way her attitude goes from being aggressive to being totally passive according to Masamune\'s plans is quite fictional (again, as the plot forcibly requires it), and from one moment to another she goes aggressive again. You can\'t see an actual evolution on her, how her hard exterior breaks and she reveals her dere side little by little. No. you see how she changes from ""tsun"" to ""dere"" in a very fake way when the setting requires it. This is not to be ""hard in the outside, fragile in the inside"" as normal tsunderes, and neither is a gap moe, this is to be hard and fragile at the same time, a mixture of personalities, as if they didn\'t know how to give her a fixed characterization, and it remains as something that changes conveniently. Something that is demonstrated in Chapters 4 and 5, for example, hell, even Masamune himself says it in Chapter 9!And if all that was not enough, she ditched all this tiny characterization with Gasou\'s coming. What happened to what she said about ""I always hurt people so they don\'t hurt me""? Someone who said to have changed and promised not to fall in love, said to hate men and rejects everyone in a cruel way, then falls in love instantly... That\'s plain stupid. Even if she thinks this is the Masamune of her childhood, it\'s not justified if she said she has changed. This is just to force the plot in a terrible last minute plot twist. Now do you see what I meant with ït changes at the script convenience""? I insist: the worst character in the serie, and one of the worst ""tsunshits"", because she doesn\'t even deserve to be called as a ""normal tsundere"".Watching this pair of protagonists interacting is a real cringe festival. Their ""love-hate"" relationship feels so forced, so poorly executed and without any sort of charisma. However, in most of chapter 6, Aki does not show up, so there was not much of this interaction and revenge issue was barely touched. They also explored better the relationships between Masamune and the other characters, which was kinda nice to see. In the same way, in chapter 9, where a fairly mature discussion happened between Masamune and Neko, and then some comic relief among the other characters, again, the revenge issue was not touched. These two chapters were the most tolerable ones of the entire serie. Coincidence? I don\'t think so…Yoshino is the typical clumsy and moe kuudere who has a ""dark side"". That stereotype has always seemed illogical and senseless to me, since you can\'t take this dark side seriously (again, what the serie tries to do) with a deadpan chick who barely talks and keeps falling down showing the pantsu. Nonetheless, she is arguably the most decent character in the serie, her role is actually interesting and adds to the plot, even her actions can be unpredictable and leave to the expectation... But her characterization is not, and makes you quickly lose a little interest in her. I also dare to say she is maybe one of the most decent Inori Minase characters, something that is not very difficult to actually achieve...Neko is the top of the cliche between the characters: a generic rich girl who falls down from the sky and then immediately falls in love with MC ""just because"", and in the end, she will be the first friendzoned girl from the harem (well, that was the class rep)... So many cliches and so little creativity in a single character! literally she is a Tachibana 2.0. Even is just as sickly! She seems to have no personality beyond Masamune. What is the real reason why she loves him so desperately? ""Because he is kind""? Albeit she said her motives, those are not enough justification to why she loves him with such determination. The only answer I find is: because the plot says, and they need another waifu bait that shows love interest in him so the story doesn\'t feel so linear, even when her intervention didn\'t contribute significantly anything more than the classic Team War. It\'s worth clarifying, that I think her rejection was right (although Masamune\'s motives remain stupid), after all, we are talking about a liar who is in love with him for questionable reasons, the logical thing to do is refuse. After that, we were shown a conversation between them where they clarified their motivations in a kinda clear way, showing maturity from both characters and a good management of the subject of a love rejection. Point for Masamune and the serie in general, because not everything has to be ""That stupid Masamune should accept her... Because she\'s my waifu!... And she\'s the best girl... And... And she kissed him!""There were other characters we can summarize with a simple archetype, like the genki girl (it\'s a shame she has fallen in love with an idiot like Masamune who, aside from rejecting her, he didn\'t care about and only increased his ego, more negative points for this character), the trap, the loli and the sassy sister. We also have Gasou... Who shouldn\'t even count as a character, since he has no characterization, he\'s literally a plot device with legs (and a very forced one), someone who only got introduced to set up unnecessary drama and force the disastrous plot development even more, like Aki\'s ""bodyguards"" trio, stereotyped girls that only showed up at the end to works as a wall between the inevitable. A whole cast of characters with almost no glow or charm. I don\'t ask for complex characters or deep development, only likable characters, according to what the serie tries to be. They don\'t have to be 100% original either, but that doesn\'t mean they have to be archetypes already seen a thousand times pasted on it without subtlety and basically any change.There is no reason to talk about the audiovisual aspects: nice but generic designs, decent quality, an acceptable but very forgettable soundtrack. The important general aspects of the serie are pitiful, the comedy, even when it made me laugh in several occasions (after all I enjoy this genre), is just cringe most of the time, and characters are mediocre and horribly written. The plot from the beginning is ridiculous and stupid even when it sounds attractive in lyrics, and after focusing on it in a serious way (because I insist that this is what the series tried, even with all comedy in the middle), the minimum to be expected is an acceptable development, but this is lousy. It\'s worth mentioning that I usually like harems no matter how generic they are, as long as the girls AND the MC are charismatic and interesting. This is not the case. This will undoubtedly endure as one of the worst romantic comedies I\'ve ever seen, only surpassed by Nisekoi. the main problem.

This will undoubtedly endure as one of the worst romantic comedies I\'ve ever seen, only surpassed by Nisekoi.', 'There are a lot of things that factor into creating a well-rounded enjoyable anime title. It’s a combination of the story writing, uniqueness, sounds and animation poured into the creation of the work that produces that golden quality to it. But there’s another category that needs to be touched upon to create a good anime and that is characters. Smart intellectual characters and ones that strive from the common cheap use of stereotypes make a title memorable due to the unique ways these characters are presented through dialogue and interaction. Your characters are the fore-front in the anime, they are the lens the viewer experiences...the story through, and so having them well fleshed out and smartly written enhances the experience for the viewer.But contrary to my statement listed above, “Masamune-kun’s Revenge” brings nothing smart to the table. In concept the show is about some revenge plan thought out by a prepubescent child after getting rejected when he was about 6 years old, a “lovers” squabble that has lasted around a decade, why is he so angered that he can’t move on in life and accept fate? I doubt we will ever know.  Our main character Makabe; is optimistic in his revenge plans. Accompanied with tedious actions and that cocky and cool attitude that make me want to fist the table in rage whenever he’s on screen, he makes Subaru look like the second-coming of Christ in comparison. Having a likeable main character should be what many anime strive to portray, this is the character we are supposed to be rooting for and hoping his plans go to success. (if we can scuttle through the ridiculous idea of the plan in the first place that is) stereotypes may piss you off after seeing that same trope rehashed over and over again over many titles of anime, but having a character who is un-bearable to watch due to his unintentional cringe aspects really burdens the show down a lot. His whole “revenge plan” is some of the stupidest shit I have seen in my life, who honestly gives a fuck if he was rejected years prior, his character just comes off as immature but not in the good sense.Hey I’m sure immature characters can be enjoyable to watch at times but Makabe emits the entire opposite enjoyment of that, he’s unlikeable, unfunny and one dimensional all around, I really don’t see the appeal of having this guy being the perspective we enjoy the show through.  Next we have the evil, misandristic; Adagaki Aki or better known as “text-book tsundere.” She’s the main target and antagonist of Masamune-kun’s Revenge. Though has more characterisation to her compared to our main character, and is overall a better more tolerable character to watch; even if she may just be pretty stereotypical. She is the stated “antagonist” of the show, but due to her past and better development in helping us understand her she becomes greater than Makabe. Overall the cast is a bunch of dumb, unlikeable assholes which are painful to watch.Though I’ve only touched upon the surface of characters, alongside the two main characters we have some more terribly written side characters. Firstly; Yoshino Koiwai who is the most enjoyable out of the bunch; and no that’s not just because she is voiced by Inori Minase, she serves as the “master” role for Makabe and plans to assist him in his execution of his dumbfounded revenge plan. She’s cute, and funny at times that’s about it. Then we have Neko Fujinomiya who is another rich girl, but she’s mysterious, she knows Makabe prior, but Makabe does not recall ever meeting her. But to be honest I bet if you had an encounter with Makabe he would forget you within the next ten minutes of your conversation (evident in how he forgot of Yoshino’s existence entirely.) Then to top that off we have weird Lolita mom who tries serving Makabe food but whenever there is over a certain amount of calories he becomes extremely triggered by the situation due to him trying to keep up his muscular fit body to impress the ladies. Oh and introduced near the end we have this painfully un-needed and unlikeable fat kid and the SJW brigade who turn to illegal acts to stop the straights and turn Aki into a lesbian man-hater.The weaknesses of these said characters is most evident in their interaction; there’s always an awkward pause mid-conversation. With Makabe’s one track mind on the path to revenge nothing said to him ever enters his mind and flies past him; he may have recollection of those words but prefers to ignore those after a while and snap back into his revenge mind-set. The drama in this anime is god damn awful as well; it is impossible to take seriously with the nature of the show and is just as awkward as every other character interaction; bland, stupid and un-meaningful. Most of it is started by Makabe’s dumb irrational attitude constantly messing things up; he can’t fix the problems because he is so mindless on top of that and the quite common “comedic” part where he falls over constantly.Aside from this the show does have some redeemable capabilities that don’t drag the show down into devastation. For the most part the animation is pretty decent; it’s of course nothing special but the bright colours help with the lively atmosphere of some dumb-founded romance revenge plan, so it’s a pleasant sight to the eye for this factor. Its atmospheric shots are pleasant of course bringing light to sights that look pretty generic in terms of animation as a whole but work well.For the sound department we are met with an “odd” soundtrack to say the least; nothing really stands out and sticks in your head; but overall it weirdly goes along with the shows sense of direction; the opening theme: “Wagamama MIRROR HEART” hypes up the show and creates brilliant anticipation; which is how I found myself watching this show in the first place, and contrast to the opening “Elemental World” provides a calm yet upbeat theme to lead out the show.I understand that this anime is simply here to provide a romance comedy; but the problem for me is it wasn’t funny, compared to other romance comedies, the effect and experience I gained from this was weak, and of course mainly because of my statement against the characters of the show which drag down the quality. But even if this was intentional and I am just over analysing this; the show really did not work for me. The show is obviously enjoyable, even if I’m hesitant at watching each episode most of the time provides a decent experience with not the best enjoyment the show could have produced but not enough to create a bitter taste of disgust when watching. On top of that the show features an anti-climactic ending which I will not delve into here; but there’s a possibility that the show will receive a second season.Overall; Masamune-kun’s short comings lie in trying to create a decent romance/comedy which falls flat due to its unbearable main character and generic side characters. But the side dishes to the show create decent sides to the anime which stop it from plummeting down into the abyss. If you want a bright show with some mutual redeeming factors and decent enjoyment, look no further than this show. There are of course many greater titles out there, but I’m sure if you are the average Joe who doesn’t really care much for the criticisms against this show you will find this for the most part enjoyable. If you do care about the above; I advise you to move on, as this offers nothing new. the story through, and so having them well fleshed out and smartly written enhances the experience for the viewer.But contrary to my statement listed above, “Masamune-kun’s Revenge” brings nothing smart to the table. In concept the show is about some revenge plan thought out by a prepubescent child after getting rejected when he was about 6 years old, a “lovers” squabble that has lasted around a decade, why is he so angered that he can’t move on in life and accept fate? I doubt we will ever know.  Our main character Makabe; is optimistic in his revenge plans. Accompanied with tedious actions and that cocky and cool attitude that make me want to fist the table in rage whenever he’s on screen, he makes Subaru look like the second-coming of Christ in comparison. Having a likeable main character should be what many anime strive to portray, this is the character we are supposed to be rooting for and hoping his plans go to success. (if we can scuttle through the ridiculous idea of the plan in the first place that is) stereotypes may piss you off after seeing that same trope rehashed over and over again over many titles of anime, but having a character who is un-bearable to watch due to his unintentional cringe aspects really burdens the show down a lot. His whole “revenge plan” is some of the stupidest shit I have seen in my life, who honestly gives a fuck if he was rejected years prior, his character just comes off as immature but not in the good sense.Hey I’m sure immature characters can be enjoyable to watch at times but Makabe emits the entire opposite enjoyment of that, he’s unlikeable, unfunny and one dimensional all around, I really don’t see the appeal of having this guy being the perspective we enjoy the show through.  Next we have the evil, misandristic; Adagaki Aki or better known as “text-book tsundere.” She’s the main target and antagonist of Masamune-kun’s Revenge. Though has more characterisation to her compared to our main character, and is overall a better more tolerable character to watch; even if she may just be pretty stereotypical. She is the stated “antagonist” of the show, but due to her past and better development in helping us understand her she becomes greater than Makabe. Overall the cast is a bunch of dumb, unlikeable assholes which are painful to watch.Though I’ve only touched upon the surface of characters, alongside the two main characters we have some more terribly written side characters. Firstly; Yoshino Koiwai who is the most enjoyable out of the bunch; and no that’s not just because she is voiced by Inori Minase, she serves as the “master” role for Makabe and plans to assist him in his execution of his dumbfounded revenge plan. She’s cute, and funny at times that’s about it. Then we have Neko Fujinomiya who is another rich girl, but she’s mysterious, she knows Makabe prior, but Makabe does not recall ever meeting her. But to be honest I bet if you had an encounter with Makabe he would forget you within the next ten minutes of your conversation (evident in how he forgot of Yoshino’s existence entirely.) Then to top that off we have weird Lolita mom who tries serving Makabe food but whenever there is over a certain amount of calories he becomes extremely triggered by the situation due to him trying to keep up his muscular fit body to impress the ladies.

A plot of blurb that anyone can read so generically and your typical protagonist. However, I don't find that to be the case as I actually find the protagonist quite likable. The revenge theme is also something that rarely happens in the romance genre so the plot isn't exactly linear and boring.Masamune-kun's Revenge is interesting as it is able to take a rehashed idea and execute it with the sort of panache that leaves you wanting more. By the...end of the first episode, I was left speculating about what directions the anime could take. The second, third and fourth episodes are also pretty decent so far.The music of the romance genre is notorious for being generic. The OP and ED animation sequences are overdone-to death cuts from your typical romance anime. They are either happy-go-lucky or sad depending on the sub-genre. However, the songs accompanying this anime are actually ringtone-worthy.The art and the animation in a simple sentence, I would say it’s not at all masterpiece level, but it is gorgeous. I have no complaints here. The character designs look very appealing which I also have no issue with at all.All in all, Masamune-kun's Revenge is an anime I will definitely be seeing through this to the end, even if it ends up going downhill later on. end of the first episode, I was left speculating about what directions the anime could take.

I can’t exactly say this show is something for everyone. It’s a dramedy teen soap opera that some will find entertaining while others will leave with the thought of never getting their time back. Listen. This show isn’t really hard to understand but to appreciate it? That’s another story.Adapted from the manga of the same name, the series is pretty straightforward. Well, it is straightforward at first glance considering the premise. You got this hot main male protagonist (Masamune Makabe) who is...popular, handsome, athletic, and pretty much the IT guy that every woman wants to get their hands on. Except of course, he was totally the opposite before. When he was a kid, Masamune used to be fat, unpopular, and subject to being bullied. To add to the injury? A girl he used to have a crush on rejected him while giving him the cruel nickname, “Pig’s Foot”. You can probably guess Masamune didn’t take that well so he is set out to commit the ultimate revenge against Aki Adagaki, the girl who wronged him.First things first, while the show sounds like it can be a potentially heavy drama show, it’s really more of a lighthearted romantic comedy. Sure, it has the ingredients for cooking up a melancholic heavy story but it’s really not much so throughout the course of the series. Viewers will come to understand that revenge is far more complicated than how Masamune plans out. Every episode serves as a step forward or backward for Masamune in his plans. And while we also find out more about the characters, the series likes to have fun often with what it has to offer.However, I can’t exactly say fun is a term to describe while watching the characters in their roles. Masamune Makabe is a straightforward guy that shows a bit of narcissism. Don’t believe me? Just watch what he does in the morning before going to school or how he eats his food. In the meantime, there’s Aki Agadaki, a character that many viewers will probably dislike from the start. I wouldn’t even be surprised if Aki is a make or break factor for the fans to drop this series. With a cruel personality (she’s even nicknamed “Cruel Princess” at school) and has a hobby of tormenting others, the show seems to intentionally make people hate her. I would also say that she’s a spoiled brat as her reliance on Yoshino (her personal maid) is very evident. So at this point, you’re probably asking yourself “Should I really watch this?”At its core, Masamune no Revenge emphasizes on relationship developments and how Masamune’s story develops as context gets more and more complicated. This includes the appearance of other characters. I’ve already mentioned Yoshino but viewers will also discover that she is more than she appears to be. Neko Fujinomiya, a transfer student also enters the story and formulates what viewers may designate as a generic love triangle. On top of that, the show seems to be saturated with generic characters. From best friend trap to fujoshi, this show pulls the oldest gags from the book. Still, Masamune can actually be a decent character once you see through his flaws. Although he is narcissistic, he isn’t necessarily a cruel person. In fact, he is actually an ideal character that anyone would want to be friends with. Hanging out with the most popular guy at school gives social status and Masamune is a symbolic image of that. At times, Masamune also shows genuine concern for his friends and even comes to aid of total strangers. Unlike Aki, Masamune’s relationship with others isn’t always one sided either.Speaking of relationships, what can you really expect from this show? At its core, Aki and Masamune’s relationship is perhaps the most complicated. There’s mind games going on between the two in almost every segment. While Aki often asserts herself to be the superior individual, Masamune’s clever tactics helps him understand her better. The two even goes out on dates and some episode shows that Aki has a vulnerable side to her as well. On the other hand, Masamune’s relationship with others are generally casual, friendly, and straightforward. He gets along well with most people such as his best friend Kojuro Shuri, transfer student Neko, and close friend Tae Futaba. As he is a handsome guy, Masamune is also the ideal image of girls at his school. The only other complicated relationship he has with is with Yoshino. In retrospect, the relationships in this show is nothing impressive and on the surface level, you can probably discover them in any romantic comedy literature or on TV.As a manga reader, I confess that the series didn’t do justice in adapting the show. While it starts off in the right direction, certain parts of the story is cut off while other parts are overemphasized. In addition, the opening song is very spoilerish and a degeneration of crafty storytelling. As such, I express not only disappointment at the length of the series but also at what they really adapted. On the other hand, the comedy of the series can be entertaining at times. Popcorn entertainment might be a better way to put it as we see how the characters interact under certain circumstances. Remember, this series is lighthearted and not something for mature audiences.If there’s one major thing they handled right, it would be the art direction. I have to admit, Tiv (the author of the series) has a talent at creating attractive characters. Silver Link brings that attractiveness in full color and animation. In general, the show has a decent production and every main character has their physical appeal. Fan service appears from time to time ranging from full commando scenes or the infamous beach episode. Putting that aside, Masamune no Revenge is a pretty show.There’s not much impression I can say about the overall soundtrack or the music. It just seems to be there and does its job although easily forgettable. The OP and ED theme songs reflects the show’s theme and agendas while dropping many hints at the storytelling. Finally, there’s the voice acting, something that I found to be slightly above average yet nothing too impressive overall. Ironically, I find Aki’s voice to be the best performed as the character really does sound like a cruel princess. The way she speaks to others with her sarcastic tone while mocking others fits her personality just right.So by the time you’re reading this part, you’re probably thinking a lot of things on your mind. Just know this though, Masamune no Revenge is still a romantic comedy regardless how the premise appears to be. Revenge is a controversial word and for some of us, it’s something we may even have experienced or want to inflict upon someone we have intense feelings towards. For Masamune, it’s his story and one that begins with his revenge. popular, handsome, athletic, and pretty much the IT guy that every woman wants to get their hands on.

Revenge is a controversial word and for some of us, it’s something we may even have experienced or want to inflict upon someone we have intense feelings towards. For Masamune, it’s his story and one that begins with his revenge.', 'You might be thinking, “Ugh, is this just another typical harem anime?!” Well, to that I say, “Yeah. It is…"" But, at the same time, ""No. It isn’t.” Let me explain why without spoilers:The reason why I say “yes” is because if you’ve seen a few harem anime before, you will most likely be able to predict how the story will end from the first episode. There\'s no concluding ending (probably because it\'s setting the stage for a second season). This series reminds me a lot of Nisekoi: the story isn\'t too amazing and doesn\'t stand out too much, so you most likely won\'t like...them if it you don\'t like harem anime in general. The reason why I say “no” is because this isn’t actually a typical harem anime because Masamune-kun (main guy) does actually turn down potential love interests in this season. Also, the route that masamune-kun takes to get to the ending is a new one that I haven’t seen in any other other harem-like anime, but the characters are all pretty much dumbasses in romance. The story\'s not bad unless you really just don\'t like harem anime.TL;DR at the endStory: 7/10The story is actually pretty good and relatively unique among harem anime, but it\'s not anything spectacularly different at all. For example, this anime’s plot is a bit special because rather than trying to find his old love interest and win her over to live happily ever after, Masamune-kun actually trains to become a very “hot” and “muscular” guy that seeks to win her love... and then he wants wreck her (Adagaki Aki’s) feelings as revenge for rejecting him as a kid while giving him the nickname “piggy”. Luckily, she doesn’t recognize him, but she is extremely difficult to win over since she is well-known for turning down everybody that asks her out and giving them terrible nicknames.The story starts out with a series of convenient coincidences and some random one-time only pantyshots occur (did somebody say plot convenience panty shots?! mmm... my favorite…), he then discovers an embarrassing secret about Adagaki Aki that actually makes it too risky for her to just give him a bad nickname, which sets the groundwork for this series’ progression. There are a good amount of plot twists, which allows the anime to put you through the wringer with suspense occasionally. The pacing was great, the comedy was entertaining, so I really believe that the story deserves an 7/10.Art: 7/10The art’s not particularly impressive. The background art’s pretty good and relatively detailed, but I don’t think the characters were detailed and/or expressionate enough for me to give this category a higher score. The visual effects, angles, and lighting were all pretty good. The animation’s frame rate is low enough that you can see some lack of fluidity, but it’s fluid enough that you probably won’t be able to notice it unless you really look for it.Sound: 9/10The characters are all voiced well and their actors/actresses fill the roles very well. The music in this series is great! This is another factor that I think sets this anime apart from other harem anime. The background music style ranges from this one dramatic flamboyant orchestral piece that sounds like music played when a really fat noble is walking, to other orchestral and harpsichord pieces that are all just generally pretty great background music overall. The opening fits the anime and sounds pretty good. The ending sounds pretty generic, but also fits. Sound effects are good enough. Overall, I think the sound deserves a 9/10 overall.Character: 7/10I actually enjoyed the characters in this series. Masamune’s character actually sucks pretty badly (because he turned down best girl), but all jokes aside he’s a pretty solid character and is actually pretty funny. Adagaki Aki is pretty much just a generic small breasted tsundere, but she’s not voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so that’s always a plus. Koiwai Yoshino… she’s essential to the plot and has lots of PLOT material herself (if you know what I mean). The characters get pretty well-developed by the end, but they are still pretty generic. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters in this series.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall, I think the series was pretty entertaining. The story kept me in suspense as we watched Masamune kun teeter on the edges of getting caught during his revenge and all of the various plot twists that came up. It was actually a pretty enjoyable series to watch!TL;DROverall: 7/10At first glance, Masamune-Kun seems like a generic harem anime but it has elements that sets it apart from other harem anime: while the characters are indeed generic, the story line has a major difference from other common generic harem anime (it reminded me of Nisekoi, but without Shaft’s studio skills). This is definitely one of the better harem anime out there, so I feel that it does deserve a 7/10. The art’s good, the characters are good, the music’s great, and the concept of revenge sets this anime apart from other harem anime.Bottom line: Should you watch this?If you like harem anime, then of course.If you want to see an unusual harem anime, then yeah.If you like dramatic romance anime, then ehh you can give it a shot... but both the drama and the romance weren’t really central elements of this anime.If you like tsundere small breasted characters, well… this series has you covered.If you’re looking for some mesmerizing inspirational story or serious anime romance, drama, or anything other than a romantic-harem-comedy, you’re definitely in the wrong place.Hope this helps you decide! If it didn’t help, or you disagree, feel free to let me know by sending me a message so I can be better next time! them if it you don\'t like harem anime in general.

It was actually a pretty enjoyable series to watch!TL;DROverall: 7/10At first glance, Masamune-Kun seems like a generic harem anime but it has elements that sets it apart from other harem anime: while the characters are indeed generic, the story line has a major difference from other common generic harem anime (it reminded me of Nisekoi, but without Shaft’s studio skills). This is definitely one of the better harem anime out there, so I feel that it does deserve a 7/10. The art’s good, the characters are good, the music’s great, and the concept of revenge sets this anime apart from other harem anime.Bottom line: Should you watch this?If you like harem anime, then of course.If you want to see an unusual harem anime, then yeah.If you like dramatic romance anime, then ehh you can give it a shot... but both the drama and the romance weren’t really central elements of this anime.If you like tsundere small breasted characters, well… this series has you covered.If you’re looking for some mesmerizing inspirational story or serious anime romance, drama, or anything other than a romantic-harem-comedy, you’re definitely in the wrong place.Hope this helps you decide! If it didn’t help, or you disagree, feel free to let me know by sending me a message so I can be better next time!', 'You know I was actually having a fun time with this one. I liked the premise. I liked the chemistry and dynamic of the main characters. I liked the budding romance. I liked the characters as a whole. I liked the drama and conflict. It was all pretty solid (I would like to point out this is all in anime romcom terms, it would still be cringe even if I stopped here). But there was one thing that pissed me off so much that I just couldn’t enjoy the show anymore. It was only in the last couple episodes but it ruined the entire show...for me. Basically this bitch turned down this fat boy when she was younger. The fat boy worked out and planned to make her fall for him so he could reject her in turn. Kinda petty but whatever, it’s the premise of the show, what’re you gonna do? So it’s working, right? and I’m enjoying the show, having a good ol’ time, but then this fat dude comes along, pretends to be the fat boy that she turned down, and she, thinking that it was in fact the fat boy she turned down but apparently had a crush on, instantly falls for the imposter and becomes his girlfriend. This dude pretends to be her childhood friend and not only does it work, she instantly becomes his girlfriend. Fuck I’m getting pissed off just typing this. Fuck this show. Fuck it. I’m done, I don’t need to explain more. I don’t know why it Pissses me off so much but it does. I’m fucking out. I’m done. Fuck anime, fuck this show, fuck Japan, and fuck this fucking bitch. for me.

Just really average.The story of Masamune-kun is pretty much your generic RomCom harem anime but a little twist in it. Masamune is trying to hook up with the ''Cruel Princess'' to dump her later and getting his revenge on her. Why ? Just read the synopsis, it's not really worth to write about it again here. Fair enough, this could be potentially good but you can pretty much see miles away what's going to happen next and its filled with cliché. Also the comedy in it is really hit or miss.However, episode 4 gave...me good hopes that maybe it's going the right way with the story ... but something at the end of the episode pretty much ruined the development between Masamune and Aki and at this point, looks like its going to be a good old love triangle/harem thing with some drama in it. Definitly was not a good time to introduce it and its more annoying than anything else.Also, Yoshino, Aki's maid, is pretty interesting. Can't really say too much though because.. spoilers. But she's definitly one of the 2 reason that i keep watching it.Oh yeah, we have a trap and Masamune's mom is a loli. Of course.The art and animation are pretty decent, nothing to write home about but Silver Link. does a good enough job. They definitly has done better though. Most of the girls designs are nice, specially Yoshino. Masamune's design is pretty disappointing since he looks like a protagonist from a generic light novel.The music in the anime is pretty average. The OST does it's job but nothing really standout so far. The Opening is your usual RomCom opening. The ending song by Choucho is pretty nice thought.Sooo, is it enjoyable ? For me not really. But i'm still going to watch it since i'm still interested enough to see where this goes right now. Wouldn't be surprised if they do the predictable route of Masamune not getting his revenge and actually end up with Aki though. I also want to know more about Yoshino and see what's going to happen with her since its pretty much the only character that i still enjoy to watch.So yeah, right now i'm at episode 4 and it's pretty much average.5/10. me good hopes that maybe it's going the right way with the story ... but something at the end of the episode pretty much ruined the development between Masamune and Aki and at this point, looks like its going to be a good old love triangle/harem thing with some drama in it.

It's not outright disgusting, but it leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. In effect, Masamune-kun no Revenge is certainly not a terrible anime, but it's not really worth investing time on either.Story (5/10):Creating a mediocre anime by throwing in a bunch of tried and tested cliches is a sure fire way to earn some cash (by appealing to the otaku audience), and that's exactly what Silver Link has done here.The story is absolutely nothing new - a fat kid works out and diets, becomes a pretty-boy and tries to publicly humiliate the girl who...rejected him... only to find that he's falling for her. Of course, when he starts getting somewhere, a couple of other girls appear and voila!- a harem is made.The developments are all rather abrupt and tasteless. It lacks any semblance of flow and the pacing is quite erratic. All put together, the story aspect is average, if not slightly below average.Art (5/10):I'm usually not one to criticize an anime for its artwork, but this one has some major issues. The main thing I found is that the character designs were rather weird - the faces and limbs were all elongated beyond an level that could be ignored, so much so that it almost felt like Code Geass. Other than that, the animation was alright and the color palette used was quite bright. Yet again, average.Sound (6/10):The sound in Masamune-kun no Revenge was alright. The opening and ending songs were decent, but the voice actors sometimes felt a little emotionless and flat. The soundtrack was rather bland.Character (2/10):I'm actually rather impressed with the creators of this series for being able to make characters this weak, while using only the common cliches as raw material. It's not that the characters are terrible or anything - they're just so shallow and two-dimensional that they can't even be taken seriously. I'll give a short description of two of the characters, just to give you an idea of what I mean --Makabe Masamune: The 'hero' of the series. Previously a fat kid who was constantly humiliated, he worked extremely hard to improve his appearance. Now that he's hot stuff, he wants to take revenge on the girl who humiliated him in the past... Sounds all well and good, until you find that he starts falling for her within 3-4 episodes. And that's it - That's the entirety of his character, nothing more.-Adagaki Aki: The one-word description of her is (forgive my language) bitch. She has no positive points other than being rich - as for what draws all those men (including our protagonist) to her, I have absolutely no clue.Other than those two, there are no characters of any real importance. Then again, having those two as the main characters already makes Masamune-kun no Revenge a failure.Enjoyment (3/10):It's extremely difficult to enjoy something you've seen hundreds of times before, but executed far worse than most. I, for one, couldn't go any further than 7 episodes before dropping it (although I would've dropped it long back had I not wanted to review it)Overall (4.2/10 ~ 4/10):The end result is that Masamune-kun no Revenge is a mediocre anime which doesn't bring anything new to the table. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if cardboard characters, boring story and somewhat weird artwork is what you're looking for, then by all means, give it a go. rejected him... only to find that he's falling for her.

What could have been an intriguing story about a man\'s almost lifelong quest for vengeance through devoted self-improvement and utilization of deceit against the girl who made his childhood a living hell instead ended up being nothing more than a cliché, predictable and rather generic romcom. Ultimately, it only leaves you thinking about what it could have been.In the distant past, Makabe Masamune was a fat kid who found himself being a victim of bullying from numerous other...people his age, but especially bad was the abuse from the spoiled rich girl Adagaki Aki, who among other things gave him the nickname ""Pig\'s Foot"" for his chubby appearance. This experience seemingly traumatized Masamune growing up, and he started working hard at improving himself through excessive body training and studying shoujo manga to learn what girls are into when it comes to boys. Many years down the road, Masamune has become a handsome narcissistic asshole by the time he starts high school, where he once again meets Aki. She fails to recognize Masamune due to his drastic change in appearance but he identifies her immediately, and vows to finally have his revenge on her by making her fall in love with him only to cruelly dump her on the spot once she confesses to him. Perfect.Honestly, if that was all the anime was about, I think I would have liked it quite a lot. Having a smartass MC trying to seduce a cold-hearted bitch, only to then promptly enact his revenge upon her by breaking her heart... I mean it sounds like something really amusing and unique on paper, albeit in a somewhat sadistic way. But unfortunately, that is not how the story plays out at all. In the first four episodes, the story mostly consists of Masamune trying to get closer and closer to Aki with the help of his newfound insider accomplice in Aki\'s maid Yoshino. We get to learn more about Aki\'s habits and what she\'s like as a person, and although he has some difficulties with it, the revenge plan still feels like it is slowly moving forwards. However, with the start of episode five, things quickly start to stagnate as a love rival (Neko) is suddenly brought into the picture and the story turns into a more typical romcom all of a sudden. If this had been a series with a premise designed to be nothing more than that from the start then this would have been fine, but really this story did not need to slowly become a harem. The main plot concept revolves around solely Masamune and Aki, so bringing in outsiders merely results in them coming across as obstacles to the story\'s progression. More importantly though, at this point the revenge concept is all but gone because since this an anime, our MC and main heroine *obviously* have to end up falling in love with each other. Gone was the interesting original premise, and instead we are left with a narcissist and a bitch crushing on each other, but of course they\'re both far too dense to realize it, especially Aki. How incredibly original.Another problem with this is that Aki as a character does not really function very well outside the revenge concept. No matter how you look at it, she is just a terrible person through and through. Even discounting the childhood trauma that she inflicted upon Masamune, in her current high school life she is known as the Cruel Princess: a girl totally abusing every single male person she comes across, giving them offensive nicknames, insulting them, rejecting everyone who tries to be nice to her, and just plain treats them like crap. Why? Well supposedly because some guys had been mean to her in her own childhood as well, but what right does that give her to treat completely unrelated people in such a discriminating way? Her entire character is perfectly suited for the villain role of the original revenge plot, but when she is suddenly forced to become a tsundere love interest romcom-style... it just does not fit her at all. And even more mindboggling, what the hell does Masamune of all people see in her to make him fall in love with her despite everything? What happened to your resolve? Even discounting her current terrible personality, did you also somehow forget about everything she put you through as a kid? You know, the reason you sought revenge in the first place? Just how mentally weak can you be?On the other hand, while his romantic feelings may be questionable, Masamune can at least be somewhat manly about them at times, as he showcases to great effect in episode eight, which is by far and wide the best episode of the anime. But what does that all amount to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Whatever strong impact one would have thought that seemingly game-changing episode would have, the anime completely throws it away immediately in the very next episode for seemingly no apparent reason. It felt like the author finally hit the right note for the story without even realizing it himself, and ended up backing on it too quickly. So not only did he first throw away the anime\'s original potential as a revenge story, but just as it seemed he might actually have successfully converted it into a promising romance story... he throws away that too? Goodness, why? Just what are you trying to do here exactly?But as if that was not enough, the story then does not just return to the status quo, but it also gets much, much worse. The final three episodes of Masamune-kun no Revenge are simply horrible. I will not spoil any details, but basically at the start of episode 10, a new character called Gasou is introduced whose backstory and mere appearance are so far-fetched it made me twitch my eyebrows. Has the author ever heard of something known as suspension of disbelief? The whole story suddenly starts feeling incredibly implausible, but the way everyone reacts to the situation is even more ridiculous. To begin with Gasou himself is rather tedious to watch in general, but how Aki reacts to his presence is just absurd. It feels like her entire character changes in a split second as if she had some bizarre personality split, and while I technically understand why it happens, that is only a direct consequence of her being unbelievably dense and stupid. How can she possibly not realize the truth? I thought she was supposed to be a pretty smart girl? Again, it all just feels like too much of a plot convenience. And do not even get me started on Aki\'s so-called ""personal guard"" and how they decide to interfere with the whole situation for their own absolutely ridiculous reasons, they are just plain annoying and their actions are honestly borderline criminal yet the show treats them as if they are somehow okay or excusable. Furthermore, it is also painfully obvious that the entire story arc (if you can call it that) is just designed to be a roundabout way for Masamune and Aki to eventually get closer to each other, but really... we did not need this. If that was all you wanted, why did you not just continue from the plot development in episode eight instead?? The end result would probably have been the same, but the journey there would have been ten times better. It just baffles me.Overall, Masamune-kun no Revenge feels like a story written without much initial thought put into it by the author, almost like if he changed his mind every few weeks while writing about what direction he wanted to take the story in. As a result, it just ends up all over the place but ultimately going almost nowhere. It leaves behind an uncomfortable feeling of wasted potential on multiple levels, and a story which could and perhaps should have been a lot better than what it actually turned out to be. However, if we look past whatever potential the series may have had for a second and just look at the final product instead, then at the very least it passes as an average generic romcom. That is certainly not what I wanted it to be, but it is what we got, and looking at it that way it is at least rarely straight-up boring. Yes, it is packed to the brim with clichés, but really what romcom is not nowadays? Masamune-kun no Revenge could have been a great anime. It did not become a great anime however, but it is still at least a tolerable one. I just wish premises like this could be left for authors who actually plan on doing something interesting with them rather than just going back to what has already been done in a hundred different other anime already.Oh and Masamune\'s mother is also a loli who looks to be about five years younger than her own daughter.

The premise made me hope that it’s going to be what I wanted it to be, an actual fulfilling story about revenge through love. As an overweight loser who daydreams about obtaining the perfect body and being popular with girls, I quite find Makabe relatable in his endeavor. I was interested how he is going to carry out his plan on Adagaki, but I guess I was asking too much. I...know I shouldn’t be this disappointed, but damn this show went nowhere.First of all, the story makes it too convenient for Makabe to get closer with Adagaki. For a cruel princess, she acts very inconsistent. You could say “Oh you know, women are really confusing” but I digress. What makes Makabe different from any other dude she has declined? I’m sure they also used the same tactics Makabe is using. To further add into the convenience, Adagaki’s maid Yoshino agrees to help Makabe in his plan for no really good reason. I mean wow, there are so many things in favor of Makabe but ultimately the greatest hindrance to his plan is really himself.Second, the show has unwanted love interests. Sure, it attempts to create a conflict in which it prevents Makabe’s plan progress but all it does really is derail the main story and put unnecessary complications.Third, why is Makabe’s mom a loli?Fourth, Makabe is too naïve. While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it can serve as a lesson for him to be more careful and considerate, he is still the same overconfident musclehead at the end of the show. His lack of expertise in female interactions is already a bad signal why his plan is challenging to accomplish. Still, he persists in making his plan succeed out of desperation. I would’ve liked it more if some significant development actually happened due to his flaws.Finally, I really had a hard time whether I should even take the show seriously or not. I mean, I liked some of its dramatic moments like flashbacks of Makabe’s past but how both the serious and non-serious moments flow together is mediocre. The execution also somehow lacks to put a punch on supposedly comedic moments, though I appreciate some of its subtle sarcasm. Overall, the show is a decent time waster if you keep expectations to a minimum. There’s no really profound development and it only serves as a failed attempt at making a dynamic rom-com story. However, it’s not downright terrible and a complete trainwreck. It’s just a show that had a strong start but then forgot what it really wants to go for and then tries to make you deal with its complications for the rest of the duration.

It was orignally a forum comment that I cleaned up to be more appropriate. I'll stick to more detailed manga reviews in the future.)The story seems pretty original at first but then it devolves into your generic RomCom, with all the cliché.1) Story and Characters: 4 eachIn the beginning, it looked like the main characters have it all. Yet, under the veneer of wealth, all is not so good. Masamune is popular but thinks excessively of himself. He also has a complex because of of his past. He is confident if we compare him to other MCs of the...genre but he just as dense and stupid at times.Aki is your generic run-of-the mill  tsundere. She has underlying trust issues and often treats others with contempt. However, she will gradually open her heart to other characters. There's not much to say about it without spoiling the story. As our two protagonists get close to each other, they introduce various plot elements and we get to see their quirks. This their interactions rather entertaining. The side characters are gradually introduced, each adding some spice to the plot.The most prominent one would be Yoshino. Presented early into the show as an innocent klutz, she fashionably proved that looks are often deceptive. Who would think that the seemingly innocuous Koiwai would be the catalyst behind the premise of the story? Yet, this is the case. Her past is the most tragic one amoing the whole cast and her interactions with the MC are fascinating, to say the least.Kojuuro is your habitual trap. Gentle and shy, he is the opposite of the MC. This is a nice contrast. He is a loyal friend better taste that the main characters when it concerns matters of the heart. Tae Futaba aka Class President is also a moderaely fascinating character. The de facto tomboy genki. Energetic and extraverted, she brings life to the show. Her spontaneity often moved the plot when it began to stagnate and made the show much more enjoyable. Her candour would have won me over if it weren’t for Neko.Oh Neko! Many dislike her because her introduction more or less ruined an intimate moment between the two protagonists. Yet, she remains my favorite Character in the show. She reminds me a lot of Marika Tachibana, with a hint of Rem from Re: Zero. Her past is heart-warming and her personality is enthralling.  She is a very forward character and her moments with the other characters are fun to watch. It would be interesting to see a character like her in a leading role.The show’s main villain was introduced fairly late, at a fairly inauspicious moment. He does have some genuine motications but nothing much to write about him. He serves more as a plot device and introduced some forced drama.2) Art and Sound: 6 and 5 respectivelyThe voice acting is quite good but nothing spectacular. My biggest complaint would be the generic, annoying high-pitched girl voice opening song. It is way too overused nowadays. On the other side, it’s quite rare for the main Seiyuu (VA) to sing the OP. The sound effects are appropriately used but then again, it's a Rom Com not an Action Anime. The visuals are actually the best part of this anime. There are some gorgeous scenes and they do not suffer from budget issues. The animation is also fluid.3) Enjoyment: 5The pace was more or less satisfactory if we exclude the ending and the direction was average. It isn’t very deep but lies somewhere between a traditional romcom and a romantic drama. Masamune-kun no Revenge managed to portray the restless behaviour that accurs in adolescence in a somehow enjoyable way.4) Overall Impression: 4Overall, this was a passable adaptation of the manga.

Masamune\'s Revenge requires a little amount of disbelief in the premise, because of course it is going to end with the main girl he is trying to get revenge on become his lover, and while I would fault this anime for making it so starkingly obvious upon reading the synopsis, I am somewhat of a fan of these stories, where hostiles give way to mutual understanding and feelings of affection. How Masamune\'s will learn to forgive Aki could be execute...well, but....That is not what I received.For the attempted progress in Nisekoi that did not happen to ""acts of God"", Masamune\'s Revenge suffers from plot induced stupidity just as often, and in frustration for the writer prolonging the development for more slice of life segments, this also makes the characters infuriating to watch. This, coupled with convenient prolonging inconsistency in the character\'s\' attitude and actions, makes it an exercise in futility This leads to arcs being longer than they should be for the information known, with irrational display of actions to pile on, which is what makes my score a humbling 3.But first of, let me argue the story: Masamune is trying to get revenge on a girl who break his heart when they children, by breaking her heart as an unknown High Schooler. This premise is already shaky. Besides establishing that Masamune being supposedly narcissistic, it also exclaims that Masamune is an asshole. A petty one at that. This does not mean we do not initially root for him, because conveniently, Aki, the one who broke his heart, has grown to be an even bigger asshole, fond of maintaining a schedule of constantly rejecting boys who confessed based on her misandry. Besides begging the question, “Why any of these boys would find a cruel, man hating bitch being prominent potential girlfriend material”, this establishes a conflict for Masamune to overcome, with his methods being...using shoujo manga as guides to woo Aki’s heart. For some, it may be funny, and I chuckled at times, but contrasting his intelligence, Masamune honestly believes they would work, especially without any real life innovation on his part, and consistently uses them for the first few episodes, making an alliance with Aki’s Maid Koiwai (Who has been Aki’s maid since they were children, despite the whole ethical nature of coerced child labor) in the meantime, who instead of just giving him advice, sometimes has to directly talk to Aki at times to push her in a certain direction.Besides being a little unimaginative, with various animes, such as The World God Only Knows, profiting off of this now trite humor, this was okay if you were a fan of the genre, with other tropperiffic romance hijinxs thrown in for good measure. People who want a better than “decent” romantic comedy should search elsewhere at this point. This was also a reason why it was rated highly, because many put up preemptive reviews before finishing the series, or at least the end of the Neko “arc”. It serves as an okay transition to the first appearance of Neko in episode 5.Now to rant.Honestly, I disliked the Neko saga. It was prolonged out of stupidity, and Neko\'s reasoning to be rather built up for no reason, and even a little bit of shallow randomness at that, even if she did end up loving him. For all she knows, Masamune could have attacked you with scissors or something, be in a relationship, anything, which bites Neko in the butt for falling in love before meeting him, seeing as he has admittedly cruel reasons for breaking off any potential relationships for the sole purpose of getting his revenge, contrary to the nice guy you imagine he would be. Nevertheless, in hindsight, one would ask “Why bother with the fake background story that Masamune knew was false? Why didn\'t he confront her then, or about the missing picture?” She could have easily just as confessed her reasons without hiding behind a fake love story, and the honesty would have been a lot more better for the show, especially as being a contrast to Masamune\'s deception with Aki. The reason was built up beyond importance, sure, but it isn\'t a bad reason in itself. I do not see any reason to hide it at all. Teenagers are extraordinarily stupid to think they should fall in love with someone at a distance, before a relationship starts. That is not how it usually works, and Neko might have been a subversion of that reasoning if she did not play it straight based on a photograph Masamune\'s Loli mother sent, out a heap of other suitors. To an extent, we can exercise the choice over who we love, and it is entirely possible to fall in love after repeated social engagements, even outside of dating, among other things. I mean, is that not the point of the Masamune\'s relationship with Aki? Although, he sure was accepting of Neko laying him on the bed after all that creepy shit that has happened in the previous 5 minutes. Never stick your dick into crazy.That being said, Masamune is a hypocrite, for refusing Neko, on the basis of her love not being ""genuine"" (Partly because he did not interrogate her, partly because she thought the truth was ""inconvenient, neither of which are really logical), when he is in a insincere relation with Aki for the sole purpose of breaking her heart, for an incident that happened when they fucking 8 years old. Masamune\'s standards are sorts of fucked up here to criticize someone for the same thing he is doing (In the case of Neko, it was an assumption bought by a lack of asking, of all things, not a truthful observation), even if it could be demonstrated to be an example of why revenge is bad, or that Masamune is unknowingly falling in love with Aki (Questionable after the scene at the school where he watches her laments her own struggles with love, angering him deeply), because we both know that he will end up with Aki because she is the designated heroine.If I did not explain Neko’s reasoning good enough, she wanted to fall in love before her surgery, and thus seeked a relationship with Masamune, and ends up falling for him, having picked him as a potential suitor based on a photograph Masamune’s Loli Mother sent.  Again, sometimes you fall in love with someone you know or just seem, but at other times, it arises out of a mutual physical attraction cemented by personalities that get along, not “love at first sight”, but a slow process of fondness growing out of being familiar and enjoying each others’ company. This is not bad, and Neko has no reason to “hide” it with a fake story. She should have just transferred, and expressed romantic interest in Masamune, however uninteresting that is.Point being, the plot investigation of the mysterious Neko, who appeared her entirety in episode 5 and being promptly declared a liar without her motives being known, did not get any headway till episode 8, and promptly ended with a life or death situation in episode 9, without any real reason than teenagers gonna teenage, with the episodes in between being filler. Fuck, you do not state a plot point that the protagonists needs to address, fuck around for 3 episodes, then have it turned into a dramatic show of events, especially after episode 7 was a fucking beach episode. This is plot induced stupidity at its finest, and hamming it up with an inconsistent tone is nonsensical.Now for Gasou, oh poor Gasuo, pretending to be Masamune. Apparently, he is a rival for Aki’s affection, despite the truth later being found out. The difference being, that his intentions were expected to have actually good consequences for people besides himself, even if the deception requires taking advantage of a girl, who hates men, because she thought the very same Masamune had left her….causing her to hate men? Does not compute, not at all. Not to mention Aki wants to marry this imposter off the bat, despite supposedly never seeing each other for years? No offense anime, but the childhood tag kind of feels ridiculous when things ended the way that they did, with reverberations to the modern days, and for love to blossom right where it picked off….because? I mean, Gasou might not have try to seduce Aki out of love for her, but Masamune is exceptionally more self interested and obsessed for his own self satisfaction, which makes him seem more villainous if anything else. I think Aki is a bitch, but she is not one worth obsessing over, even if she does deserve a comeuppance. She is worth less than spending most of your high school life breaking, which is not easy.And now for why I REALLY despise this series. You might have heard of the source material’s imminent ending, I myself was able to figure it out quickly enough, due to inconsistent freudian excuses and hints that the characters know different stories, but…Aki isn\'t responsible for what happened 8 years ago it seems, and that is fucking perfect. What is the point of revenge in the title then? This isn\'t so much forgiveness because she is the wrong target of his ire in the first place, and this subverts the premise to allow a romantic situation to happen without the debate of revenge versus forgiveness and love, with all those feelings included being irrelevant too, because it is entirely cast aside to another person who may or may not be forgiven. This still doesn\'t absolve Aki of her bitchiness. Everyone has a sob story in anime, but it does not matter, especially when you are a sexist brat in High School acting out childhood trauma that is not even so bad, if not a little enforced.It subverts its “Revenge”  tag entirely, something that the anime made obvious in the last 4-5 episodes, leaving only the question ""Who caused it"". This is a major plot point over the course of several years for the protagonist that doesn\'t get resolved in any way except that ""She did not do it"", thus leaving forgiveness out of Masamune sorting his feelings for Aki.This is the equivalent of the murderer being a supernatural entity, or that the family has had a long lost secret twin, without the essential backdrop needed for the viewers believe it. It entirely uproots the story narrative, and for Masamune Kun, it is the plot point. It is a plot convenient twist that aims to settle for a romantic pairing without all those complicated working out of feelings, and honestly? That is crap. Complete crap. What a fucking plot twist.I dislike the ending, but it is understandable why, and I personally prefer no ending than badly done anime ending or sequel hook. In any case, the fact that nothing comes from it within 12 episodes is why the ending is so jarring. If there is any change that would happen, it would be here.Characters? Fine.Masamune: I never found him to be that narcissistic, just overconfident, especially in seduction where he relies on shoujo manga. (Unless it was a realistic one, they\'re not step by step panecea to seducing girls like flies to honey, especially with Aki, which is a nice touch to the shallow world we we introduced in the first 5 minutes). In essence, his  cynicism about appearance is wrong the first time he meets Aki, because looks do not ""matter"" to her (In more than one way). His talk with Neko in episode 9 was somewhat reasonable, if not brought on by unreasonable circumstances before, and that is really all I have to say that is decent about his characters.First off, for someone portrayed as a searing knife of directness in a relationship, he never confronts Neko about her lies, despite being a detriment to his plan. Why? He also blushes and forgets to say stuff in the most important moments, specifically ""Who the hell are you"" to Neko, thus making his relation with Aki on the rocks. He also comes off as a hypocrite for his reasoning for breaking up with Neko (An ""I do not know you enough for sexual intercourse"" would have been enough), but is wise and kind when he carries the secretary, saying typical heartwarming lines, from the haunted house one episode before, something that is completely out of character. This is the same dude who relies on shoujo manga all the time, steals romantic quotes, and we expect to take him seriously when he says this line of maturity right here, a teenager trying to get revenge for what has happened as children? This is terribly done, and terrible consistency in his personality, often happening when the plot demands it, or merely hacked on to make him a protagonist we would be able to like. This is not a coincidence, but his personality is dictated by what needs to happen, rather than what happens as a result of his choices. This is common enough in dramas, where it demands dramatic inter-character conflict to happen, even if said characters were establish as being reasonable enough to work it out.Now to take a break, you may wonder that ""teenagers do act this way"", and they do, but realism is hardly an excuse to create an entertaining story, with the author dictating everything as a God. For a romcom, that is the saving grace if the dramas comes off as overly hormonal, so to speak.Aki: She is a bitch. For most of first episodes, that is what she is, complete with ""cute"" segments, such as her eating 3 meals a per lunch to compensate for her metabolism or something, moe face and all. She is also terribly in love with Masamune at some point, asking for a kiss and then freaking out and uppercutting him.She does shine for me in some instances, but a lot of these character moments are also her weakness. She is self aware of her personality, and acknowledges at times that she does not know why anyone would want her, demanding Masamune\'s reasons for choosing to date her, then reasonably being hurt when Masamune comes up with crap reasons. Then, there are similar moments, when she try to justify her current personality for what has happened to her in the past. Except this past hurt manifests as literal misandry, and it comes off as a ""woe is me"" type of deal, and it makes her far more annoying if not slightly more understandable. Everyone has a sob story, huh? This would have been great if she changed, but for the most part of the anime, it isn\'t earnest improvement, but brought on by the plot, with her reminiscing over young, fat Masamune before Gasuo shows up, seducing her, despite previous hints and flashbacks that explained her misandry arised out of the incident with Masamune supposedly leaving her. Yeah. I am not a psychologist or anything, but this is just inconsistency on her part. The change is so sudden that I wonder if Aki is the same person, which then boomerangs back when Masamune and Aki get back together after Gasou was defeated, and literally nothing has changed at this point. You had 12 episodes, what is with this lack of development?That being said, hardly any of the other characters can justify watching this anime. They were cutouts that I found entertaining only as background characters, and based on what has transpired, I hope they stay that way.Overall: This anime is terrible at worst, run of the mill at its better parts. The comedy is okay, but drama is a difficult beast that is not done well. You cannot just pile on more drama like you can do jokes on top of ones that fell flat. A bad dramatic event will usually stay with the viewers as does a good one. Unfortunately, there is a lot of mediocre drama facilitated by poor characters choices and personalities you cannot sympathize with for long.So in short, I rated this a 3/10. well, but....That is not what I received.For the attempted progress in Nisekoi that did not happen to ""acts of God"", Masamune\'s Revenge suffers from plot induced stupidity just as often, and in frustration for the writer prolonging the development for more slice of life segments, this also makes the characters infuriating to watch. This, coupled with convenient prolonging inconsistency in the character\'s\' attitude and actions, makes it an exercise in futility This leads to arcs being longer than they should be for the information known, with irrational display of actions to pile on, which is what makes my score a humbling 3.But first of, let me argue the story: Masamune is trying to get revenge on a girl who break his heart when they children, by breaking her heart as an unknown High Schooler. This premise is already shaky. Besides establishing that Masamune being supposedly narcissistic, it also exclaims that Masamune is an asshole. A petty one at that. This does not mean we do not initially root for him, because conveniently, Aki, the one who broke his heart, has grown to be an even bigger asshole, fond of maintaining a schedule of constantly rejecting boys who confessed based on her misandry. Besides begging the question, “Why any of these boys would find a cruel, man hating bitch being prominent potential girlfriend material”, this establishes a conflict for Masamune to overcome, with his methods being...using shoujo manga as guides to woo Aki’s heart. For some, it may be funny, and I chuckled at times, but contrasting his intelligence, Masamune honestly believes they would work, especially without any real life innovation on his part, and consistently uses them for the first few episodes, making an alliance with Aki’s Maid Koiwai (Who has been Aki’s maid since they were children, despite the whole ethical nature of coerced child labor) in the meantime, who instead of just giving him advice, sometimes has to directly talk to Aki at times to push her in a certain direction.Besides being a little unimaginative, with various animes, such as The World God Only Knows, profiting off of this now trite humor, this was okay if you were a fan of the genre, with other tropperiffic romance hijinxs thrown in for good measure. People who want a better than “decent” romantic comedy should search elsewhere at this point. This was also a reason why it was rated highly, because many put up preemptive reviews before finishing the series, or at least the end of the Neko “arc”. It serves as an okay transition to the first appearance of Neko in episode 5.Now to rant.Honestly, I disliked the Neko saga. It was prolonged out of stupidity, and Neko\'s reasoning to be rather built up for no reason, and even a little bit of shallow randomness at that, even if she did end up loving him. For all she knows, Masamune could have attacked you with scissors or something, be in a relationship, anything, which bites Neko in the butt for falling in love before meeting him, seeing as he has admittedly cruel reasons for breaking off any potential relationships for the sole purpose of getting his revenge, contrary to the nice guy you imagine he would be. Nevertheless, in hindsight, one would ask “Why bother with the fake background story that Masamune knew was false? Why didn\'t he confront her then, or about the missing picture?” She could have easily just as confessed her reasons without hiding behind a fake love story, and the honesty would have been a lot more better for the show, especially as being a contrast to Masamune\'s deception with Aki. The reason was built up beyond importance, sure, but it isn\'t a bad reason in itself. I do not see any reason to hide it at all. Teenagers are extraordinarily stupid to think they should fall in love with someone at a distance, before a relationship starts. That is not how it usually works, and Neko might have been a subversion of that reasoning if she did not play it straight based on a photograph Masamune\'s Loli mother sent, out a heap of other suitors. To an extent, we can exercise the choice over who we love, and it is entirely possible to fall in love after repeated social engagements, even outside of dating, among other things. I mean, is that not the point of the Masamune\'s relationship with Aki? Although, he sure was accepting of Neko laying him on the bed after all that creepy shit that has happened in the previous 5 minutes. Never stick your dick into crazy.That being said, Masamune is a hypocrite, for refusing Neko, on the basis of her love not being ""genuine"" (Partly because he did not interrogate her, partly because she thought the truth was ""inconvenient, neither of which are really logical), when he is in a insincere relation with Aki for the sole purpose of breaking her heart, for an incident that happened when they fucking 8 years old.

Revenge is a dish best served cold. I’ve heard of people exacting revenge on others due to everything from getting cheated on to a murdered relative. The reason I state this is to accentuate the weak premise Silver Link’s (Kokoro Connect, Strike the Blood) “Masamune-kun no Revenge” carries. It is a story about a tormented chubby kid (Masamune Makabe), who grows up to be a modern marvel of handsomeness, vowing to enforce justice...on a vicious vixen (Aki Adagaki) by breaking her heart. Not necessarily the strongest basis for seeking revenge… he could've just, you know, grown up.The TL;DR approach to the anime would be the dollar menu version of Nisekoi, with slightly worse art, protagonists and music... and without the delectable waifu Onodera. Knowing this fact, if you didn’t exactly care for the awkward love triangle that series presented, or the bodacious tsundere that was Chitoge, I would advise you to skip Masamune kun altogether. The added revenge element does little to enhance the series past developing a convenient crutch for the plot to hinge on. Though it doesn’t do anything cringeworthy, the anime is mediocre in almost every category.The bulk of Masamune-kun’s story is eaten up by the relationship development between himself and Adagaki, and the constant inner monologuing of how he’s going to get back at her. After years of floundering through life as a plump and ridiculed young boy, Masamune kun arrives at Adagaki’s school, unrecognizable from the dark times of his past. He’s a perfect student, has a flawless exercise regiment and every room he walks into becomes his own personal harem. On the contrary, not much has changed in Adagaki’s demeanor. She’s evil, pretentious and constantly makes up degrading names for the various male suitors approaching her. Not to mention she has a ravenous appetite. The story continues with Masamune attempting to inflict his revenge on Adagaki by getting her to like him and eventually squashing her hopes, much like she did to him during their younger years. This story approach is predictable but strangely entertaining, if for no other reason than to listen to Masamune’s multitude of internal dilemmas. The comedy is also unsurprising, however it's still good for a few laughs.The writing in Masamune kun is where the series really starts to drop off in quality. It appears that almost every character and facet of storytelling (sans the chubby betrothed kid) is carbon copies from Nisekoi. This checks out in the manga world as well, due to Masamune kun’s release being over a year after Nisekoi’s. These undeniable similarities make for a less exciting plot overall, as the series becomes less about itself and more “Nisekoi did that better” moments. Once the plot is established, it takes a sporadic turn by implanting a random damsel who seemingly wants Masamune at all costs, and a rotund young prince who’s predestined to marry Adagaki. These characters are not eased into the anime, but rather plopped down in the middle of things, with very little backstory to boot. It's really what causes Masamune-kun to meander towards failure. Overall, the series does little to redeem itself and staggers aimlessly toward its bittersweet conclusion.Masamune Makabe is actually a much better character than I initially presumed. His mannerisms played off as conceited, but through discovering the ghosts of his past and his countless acts of kindness, he redeems himself quite astoundingly. His counterparts are far less promising, with Adagaki being the only other character with any real depth among them. She fits the bill for Chitoge quite accurately in terms of tsundere-isms but seems to have less focus on her in the story overall. Perhaps this is a result of the reduced episode count from Nisekoi, but still disappointing nonetheless. There aren't any other characters really worth mentioning, as they either add very little to the story or exist merely as plot devices.The art in Masamune kun is great to look at, but there aren't any scenes of astonishing animation present within its runtime. Character models are attractive and colorful, and the environments are drawn coherently, with no more detail than is required. I didn't notice any framing issues, and no evidence of pixel lag, so it's apparent the artists at least did the proper editing. That being said, I felt the OP was animated quite generically relative to the rest of the series, which is honestly the exact opposite than what I'm used to in an anime. It came by surprise, but it also didn't help me get excited for the series at all.Sound wise, I can't say I really cared for either the OP or ED tracks. Generic and Jpop-py tones resonated with underwhelming animations, hitting par for the course for the quality of the rest of the series. The background OST was a tad more reputable, sparking the mood appropriately with tense or lightened styles, and the sound effects were well placed within the episodes. Voice acting is also very well done, with Ayaka Ohashi making a strong case for Adagaki and Natauki Hanae (Ken, Tokyo Ghoul) absolutely nailing the narcissistic Masamune. They certainly brought out the big guns for this one.Though it certainly won't be in consideration for Anime of the Season, Masamune kun no Revenge is a series that can certainly be enjoyed by the right audience, and perhaps with the right mindset. Preferably if you have seen Nisekoi, do you best to forget the entire series as you watch, because the similarities are uncanny at times. Leave your brain at the door, for there aren't any veiled symbolisms or faint themes to be had here, just your run of the mill comedic romance series. Recommended for modern day anime lovers, or those looking for a laugh or two to change things up. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter ‘17 reviews! on a vicious vixen (Aki Adagaki) by breaking her heart.

There aren't any other characters really worth mentioning, as they either add very little to the story or exist merely as plot devices.The art in Masamune kun is great to look at, but there aren't any scenes of astonishing animation present within its runtime. Character models are attractive and colorful, and the environments are drawn coherently, with no more detail than is required. I didn't notice any framing issues, and no evidence of pixel lag, so it's apparent the artists at least did the proper editing. That being said, I felt the OP was animated quite generically relative to the rest of the series, which is honestly the exact opposite than what I'm used to in an anime. It came by surprise, but it also didn't help me get excited for the series at all.Sound wise, I can't say I really cared for either the OP or ED tracks. Generic and Jpop-py tones resonated with underwhelming animations, hitting par for the course for the quality of the rest of the series. The background OST was a tad more reputable, sparking the mood appropriately with tense or lightened styles, and the sound effects were well placed within the episodes. Voice acting is also very well done, with Ayaka Ohashi making a strong case for Adagaki and Natauki Hanae (Ken, Tokyo Ghoul) absolutely nailing the narcissistic Masamune. They certainly brought out the big guns for this one.Though it certainly won't be in consideration for Anime of the Season, Masamune kun no Revenge is a series that can certainly be enjoyed by the right audience, and perhaps with the right mindset. Preferably if you have seen Nisekoi, do you best to forget the entire series as you watch, because the similarities are uncanny at times. Leave your brain at the door, for there aren't any veiled symbolisms or faint themes to be had here, just your run of the mill comedic romance series. Recommended for modern day anime lovers, or those looking for a laugh or two to change things up. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter ‘17 reviews!"", ""warning: spoilers(The review has a tl;dr section as well.)Once in a while you come across an anime which actually has a nice premise: a boy called Masamune seeking revenge against his former childhood friend Aki Adagaki. So far so good. Then you take a careful look at the genres shown on the MAL page - harem, comedy, romance and school - the absolute worst combination of genres, which usually indicate a mediocre story. Thus the first doubts appear. In the first minutes you are presented a “narcissistic” personality of the MC and think that he could be interesting despite of expecting a generic harem protagonist....Unfortunately, when his mother and Aki appeared for the first time, the death flag for this anime was set and the potential was wasted.I will try to hold back cursing words and talk about the characters first. As I have already said, up to 2 minutes it actually looked decent with the promising trait. But then the clichés started to be used left and right. First his mother, who looks like a kid, not even able to give birth him and his sister with her physique , is used to draw out laughter with the viewer, which it doesn't. Because of the poor timing and bad execution of the joke, she is reduced to a generic one-dimensional character and has no further use in the story later on. Great!!!Besides having a sister, who isn't explored and stays an irrelevant character as well, he meets his fated arch enemy (or not), Aki, when he transfers into the new school. We are shown his pretty delicate past with her and why he “hates” her as well. Thus he swears to retaliate by doing the same. But as it couldn't be made even more predictable, the writer decides to throw in the tsundere archetype besides making her a gluttony just to have a moe trait as well, in order to distract from the bigger problems, her personality. It's not enough to make her a tsundere, but an asshole as well (the way she rejects people). And the other students in the school become even more interested in her because of that. It makes no sense, especially because you would have at least a balance of haters and followers, if not only having haters. Just to make her a “greater existence” and live in her nice fantasy bubble even more. I'll come back to her later. Great!!!Then the next girl, Tae Futaba, who just pops out of nowhere and confesses to him, is another character who makes an appearance for a short time and just serves the purpose of showing, how “popular” Masamune is. Why or how did she fall in love with him? No idea, it just happened. She has a severe case of “falling in love with transfer students” syndrome, which can be found in multiple run-of-the-mill harem stories. Masamune, “determined” to have revenge, rejects her and then she follows him for the whole anime while staying in the background. So what is the point of her character? Probably just to establish a harem and pander to viewers who like girls like her. Great!!But fear not, for there is a guy, yes, you read correctly, a guy, in this show. How could he possibly fit in? There is only one correct answer, as the trap archetype. He receives no development or exploration whatsoever either because his main objective is to pander to fujoshis and he has no deeper reason to be there. You can blank him out and move on, but he actually appears a few times, so you still remember that there was someone like him in the show. If you were to recall one of his traits (not only superficial ones), congratulations, you seem to have more information than me about him, because he is only presented as a bland character in the series. If you want his name, look it up, I've forgotten it. Great!!Just when you think it can't become any worse, a “ninja”, Yoshino Koiwai, joins the scene. While serving as fanservice in the first two episodes, she becomes the supporting pillar for Masamune's revenge because he can't manage it on his own. Unfortunately, the motive for her support is insufficient and doesn't dive any deeper like for the other characters. So she ends up resembling the “kuudere” archetype and who would've guessed, she receives no further development of her motivations either. She is just there like the trap, and while she has a few good moment (her schemes), in the end she is another shallow character. No point in introducing her as a character either other than showing another “cute” girl. Great!Furthermore, the author expands the harem even more by introducing another childhood friend, Neko Fujinomiya. Her convenient introduction looks more of a plot convenience rather than a natural one though. Of course she has to “love” him from the beginning of her introduction. Even she is used to pander again as she is commonly referred to as the “panty-less girl”. Problematic are Masamune's interactions with her. He is distracted by her to the point that he thought about stopping his initial plan against Aki even though this event apparently deeply “scarred” him. Furthermore, he's so dense to the point that he doesn't even notice Neko's issues or her intentions. I'll elaborate later why that is a problem. While her past and issues are a bit explored, they're swept under the rug  and forgotten again. In the end she doesn't play a bigger role than just serving as a side lover. Compared to the other characters, she actually seems to be quite decent in terms of writing, although overall (compared to other stories), it's still mediocre. Great.If you thought that they reached the tip of the iceberg, you're wrong though. By a very convenient chance, another boy, Kanetsugu Gasou, with a same build as Masamune in the past appears and attempts to steal Aki. What a way to accelerate the relationship between them. Besides dragging the story out even more and annoying the hell out of the viewer by including more tropes, he has just as generic motivations to act like he does. The studio/writer probably assumed that it would be enough to just show a short flashback, but that makes it come off as weak motivation and feels like an unnatural twist again. Not to mention Aki's affection to him, being deceived so easily. It starts off a series of events which are rather cliché and ends up conveniently advancing the relationship with Masamune with the play and the kiss at the end. After that he seems to become unimportant again. With his introduction also followed a few annoying girls who messed with Masamune (borderline kidnapping) and got out of the whole mess without even a scolding, pointless characters again for the sake of advancing the plot and creating drama without actual essence. Great...After talking shortly about the characters, I want to further elaborate on Aki and Masamune and their relationship, as they are making up the main cast of the anime and represent the biggest weakness of the anime. As the story progresses, Masamune seems to lose sight of his initial target to crush Aki's heart as well. That is especially bad because 1. it's the premise that Masamune is out for revenge and 2. he was so much scarred by it that he changed his complete appearance and behavior. That isn't just simple resentment, it's way more realistic that he'd hate her to the point, where they can't go back. And yet, he almost falls in love with her. Another example of the convenient way how the story works. The motivations tend to be weak and they change from one scene to another. Not to forget how dumb he behaves at times even though he is the best student in the grade. Although grades aren't everything, they're a general indicator how smart and diligent someone is and when you see scenes where he acts like he can't even calculate with basic operators, I feel slightly hoaxed by the writer. The same applies for Aki at times. Not great.As for the story itself, it's very bad because neither does it have a general direction, proven by the amount of generic events (beach scene etc.) and other ones to draw out the plot, nor is it original because of the amount of clichés thrown into the plot. The series doesn't even flesh them out so that the viewer wouldn't mind the initial use of clichés. Thus the story doesn't really feel like it has any worth or wants to leave a lasting impression. Definitely not great.Another aspect hindering the series is the comedy because it feels out of place. When the anime is actually featuring a serious development, they drop a weak joke (generic joke like it's taken from another anime) and completely destroy the atmosphere. So did it actually make me laugh even once? Maybe once or twice in the whole series, but not more because the transitions were weak and the gestures weren't supporting the joke. Generic empty eyes don't make it funny, if that's what I want, I could watch any other run-of-the-mill comedy. The effort put into the comedy is so low, that it drags the drama and series down. What's left of the drama is, just like I described in the previous paragraphs, pretty bad as well and leaves the anime with a weak balance of drama/comedy. If the series attempted to be more serious about the whole revenge theme, it could have actually been pretty decent. Or if they made fun of the whole revenge affair. But working with the middle ground  damaged the quality a lot especially because of its poor execution. Bad.The other genres (harem, romance, school) are dragging its quality down as well. On one hand, the harem is poorly executed because the girls keep popping up left and right just to disappear completely from the plot or losing all relevance as well. It's unoriginal and generic and doesn't contribute at all to the series. Even if it's meant for pandering, the characters feel so lifeless and unappealing that the pandering itself is actually poor as well. On the other hand, the school genre is just there to make it relatable for students, but even the school aspect is poorly executed, evidenced by Aki's standing (acting like a scumbag → being treated like a goddess) and the lack of real life school themes. Very bad.The only aspect I want to talk about before coming to my conclusion is the final episode. With the final episode always comes the responsibility of a series to either make a satisfying conclusion in the best case or leave it off at a cliffhanger at an ideal moment. Unfortunately, the final episode provides neither. After the kiss in the play, they only go to the karaoke (yes, another typical cliché) and draws out the conclusion even more. By the time you've finally survived the pointless subplot, it ends without answering important questions and using a pretty bad cliffhanger, not hyping up the viewer for more. As a final episode, that's unforgivable. Furthermore, it also looks like Masamune is even torn between revenge and real love. So what was the point of making his past like that? Not to mention that his thoughts are still way too pure. The ending was basically a slap into the face. Atrocious.Overall Masamune-kun no Revenge tries to aim for a pretty interesting idea, just to fall down from a cliff with its execution. Its countless clichés and plot conveniences feel out of place and make the story very unnatural, especially the school setting and Aki's behavior. The characters themselves are also consisting more of stereotypes than being fleshed out during the episodes. Even the main characters flip from one moment to another and stay bland until the very end. Thus most characters feel like they were copy-pasted into the anime and just there because of either pandering or because the writer had no idea how to write characters. Either way, the story and characters have a bad synergy and drag down each other.  Even the comedy was, just like I mentioned, more of a hindrance than increasing my enjoyment. It didn't succeed with anything in any of the categories and will stay in my memory as a bad anime, which I couldn't even laugh at. If the writer perhaps excluded the harem, put more emphasis on the school setting and using it to his advantage for a battle between Aki and Masamune or just using better comedy or relying solely on drama, I could have enjoyed the series at least a bit. Neither did the art or animation change my thoughts significantly because neither is the art pretty original, nor was the music memorable or improving the atmosphere. Especially the OP and ED were very average.The final words from each paragraph of this review have more development than the whole cast of the series._____________________________________________________________________________tl;dr:- very cliché and bland characters with next to no character development- main characters flip personalities and their motivations are forgotten at times- out of place comedy and unfunny jokes + weak transitions with drama- plot conveniences at times just to advance their relationship (especially into the direction of Masamune actually loving Aki and not into the direction of revenge)- harem and romance contribute nothing to the story- weird school with a mentality to worship Aki- drawn out plot- no general direction- weak final episode (especially with the karaoke scenes)- average to mediocre art- not memorable soundtrack and weak OP + EDscores:story: 1/10characters: 1/10setting: 2.5/10art/animation: 4/10music: 4/10overall: 2/10 Unfortunately, when his mother and Aki appeared for the first time, the death flag for this anime was set and the potential was wasted.I will try to hold back cursing words and talk about the characters first.

Nevertheless, this anime was not as bad as most people say.The beginning is clichè; it involves a smart, handsome teen who recently transfers schools. However, there is a twist. He transfers not because of educational reasons or because he got bullied in his old one but because he wants to date a girl and break up with her. What the actual f*ck? Yeah, that was me when I watched it.Nevertheless, I gave it a try, and it was fine. The flashbacks which were told later...on on the anime were really important and I understood the main characters desires at last.Although his reasons were quite childish and immature, the main character still had his own ambitions and points to prove.The character development was going very well, until a lot of obstacles came. Things started getting crazy and unorganized. A girl suddenly proposed to the MC, and another guy was about to date the girl. The other guy was a douche, but he deserved to date the girl much more than the main character. The girl was stupid as crap too.Onto the ranting, I really despised the fact that the main character rejected a cute, perfect wife-material girl who was deeply in love with him to date a tsundere, bully, agressive, unkind, and selfish girl. Honestly, I don\'t know if the MC is smart or not.Additionally, if you haven\'t known, all characters who are not the main ones are plainly stupid. They are just the ""extra"" characters who only react accordingly without any self-identity.Nonetheless, this was a fun anime. It is definitely original, and it has pleasurable art and sound. But if you are competent and do things based on common sense, not by your gut, you would find many scenes relatively irritating. on on the anime were really important and I understood the main characters desires at last.Although his reasons were quite childish and immature, the main character still had his own ambitions and points to prove.The character development was going very well, until a lot of obstacles came.

You will be extremely disappointed. However if you don\'t mind waiting for how the situation is currently resolved in the manga, give this a try.*obvious spoilers ahead*Story (7):The rating of a 7 given to the anime is extremely generous and could have been much worse. My rating is perhaps affected by my knowledge of what happens...after the anime ending, which resolves a lot of the complications left unanswered at the end of the anime ending. The story is a typical ROM-COM with a slight twist to it, where a previously chubby boy, turned hunk, is trying to get revenge on a girl who rejects him. People who didn\'t read the manga will not understand what truly happened *wink wink* and the story created by the mangaka is decent. However, I must agree that the studio\'s aim to have an open-ended ending is somewhat naive, considering there is not enough manga chapters to develop a full season 2. If one was to take the anime at face value, without looking forward to how the complications in the manga, I would have given the story a far worse rating.Art(7):Just the typical art standards. Nothing much to evaluate.Sound (6):The OP and ED are not the most memorable, but still enjoyable to listen to. I usually only listen to the really good and catchy OP and ED\'s.Character(7):All the character analysis is just analysed based on the anime, and not the further development in the manga.Masamune Makabe is just your typical high-school hot-looking dude, with some slight distinctions from the generic character. He is nothing that special.Adagaki Aki is your rich, spoiled girl, who many may consider as the typical ""tsundere"".Fujinomiya, Neko is an interesting character, and even the MC himself wants to fall in love with her. The problem is that apparently Neko is not ""serious"" about falling in love, and rather wanted to just ""try falling in love"". Also, there wasn\'t a large development of her relationship with Masamune, except a brief insight that they knew each other when they were extremely young (just like Adagaki Aki).Yoshino ironically also is an interesting character, because she is extremely elusive. It is extremely hard to evaluate her without talking about the manga, because the manga has GODDAMN good development about what happened 8 years ago.The anime itself has your standard characters, and their standard developments, but the manga itself is where we see the true nature of the characters.Enjoyment (6):Watching this anime was sometimes extremely boring because of ""filler content"". One good example is Episode 12, where they spent half the episode for karaoke. It was not that I didn\'t like it, it\'s just that it felt like it was just put in there to pad run time. There are many other scenes that pad the run time, but this one was the most prominent.Overall (7):If one just evaluates the anime by itself, I can understand why the community has such intense dislike for this anime due to its open-ended ending. I too was disappointed at the end of the anime and it is heavily implied there will be a second season, or at least some OVAs to finish it off (considering how little content there is). It also seemed very naive for the studio to assume they can just start a second season, when the manga has barely anything to produce with. If anyone wants to know what happens after the anime ending, the manga so far has solved a lot of the complications, and perhaps it is why I didn\'t evaluate this anime as harshly because of the decent development in the manga. The manga is also being released irregularly, and the latest chapter has some weird ""cliffhanger"". Nevertheless, I would still give this anime a try and read the manga up to the latest chapter, because it resolves a lot of complications left unanswered in the anime. Even if there is a second season, I would not expect it until 2018 or 2019, because there is not enough close to enough content to adapt. after the anime ending, which resolves a lot of the complications left unanswered at the end of the anime ending. The story is a typical ROM-COM with a slight twist to it, where a previously chubby boy, turned hunk, is trying to get revenge on a girl who rejects him. People who didn\'t read the manga will not understand what truly happened *wink wink* and the story created by the mangaka is decent. However, I must agree that the studio\'s aim to have an open-ended ending is somewhat naive, considering there is not enough manga chapters to develop a full season 2. If one was to take the anime at face value, without looking forward to how the complications in the manga, I would have given the story a far worse rating.Art(7):Just the typical art standards. Nothing much to evaluate.Sound (6):The OP and ED are not the most memorable, but still enjoyable to listen to. I usually only listen to the really good and catchy OP and ED\'s.Character(7):All the character analysis is just analysed based on the anime, and not the further development in the manga.Masamune Makabe is just your typical high-school hot-looking dude, with some slight distinctions from the generic character. He is nothing that special.Adagaki Aki is your rich, spoiled girl, who many may consider as the typical ""tsundere"".Fujinomiya, Neko is an interesting character, and even the MC himself wants to fall in love with her. The problem is that apparently Neko is not ""serious"" about falling in love, and rather wanted to just ""try falling in love"". Also, there wasn\'t a large development of her relationship with Masamune, except a brief insight that they knew each other when they were extremely young (just like Adagaki Aki).Yoshino ironically also is an interesting character, because she is extremely elusive. It is extremely hard to evaluate her without talking about the manga, because the manga has GODDAMN good development about what happened 8 years ago.The anime itself has your standard characters, and their standard developments, but the manga itself is where we see the true nature of the characters.Enjoyment (6):Watching this anime was sometimes extremely boring because of ""filler content"". One good example is Episode 12, where they spent half the episode for karaoke. It was not that I didn\'t like it, it\'s just that it felt like it was just put in there to pad run time. There are many other scenes that pad the run time, but this one was the most prominent.Overall (7):If one just evaluates the anime by itself, I can understand why the community has such intense dislike for this anime due to its open-ended ending. I too was disappointed at the end of the anime and it is heavily implied there will be a second season, or at least some OVAs to finish it off (considering how little content there is). It also seemed very naive for the studio to assume they can just start a second season, when the manga has barely anything to produce with. If anyone wants to know what happens after the anime ending, the manga so far has solved a lot of the complications, and perhaps it is why I didn\'t evaluate this anime as harshly because of the decent development in the manga. The manga is also being released irregularly, and the latest chapter has some weird ""cliffhanger"". Nevertheless, I would still give this anime a try and read the manga up to the latest chapter, because it resolves a lot of complications left unanswered in the anime. Even if there is a second season, I would not expect it until 2018 or 2019, because there is not enough close to enough content to adapt.', 'I don\'t normally write reviews, but since this show is pretty polarizing, it\'s kinda interesting, so I wanna put my thoughts into it. Note that this review will be spoiler free.Masamune no Revenge is definitely a twist unto the original romance genre, and a very good one at that. Typically romance comedy anime have really cliche plot and characters. Masamune no Revenge has exactly the opposite, it has really interesting (though unrealistic) characters and the relationships that occur between them really drove me to the next episode.Story: 8A really unique story, it\'s not often you have a plot where on the surface, one person is...head over heels for another person, while in their secrets, it\'s the other way around. It\'s actually surprising how much the plot progresses for a slice of life anime, but it really did feel like the plot was going somewhere, instead of spinning around in circles. Which is the reason why it\'s not your run in a mill romcom anime.Art: 7Nothing spectacular, but nothing to laugh about either. Although the overall animations were lacking, the character designs (except for Masamune) were unique and really showed their characters. SolidSound: 7Nothing really stands out as the ""WOW OPENING OF THE YEAR DESU"". But, the music does fit with the anime, so there\'s nothing to complain about. The opening, however, to me is pretty good.Characters: 8Oh my, character development in a slice of life anime? Nani????!?!?! Yes, this show actually fleshes out its main characters, while not forgetting to develop it\'s side characters as well. The unique character interactions is really fun to watch, because they are not cardboard cutouts, you really can\'t predict what they are gonna do, like you can in most of these genres. Another thing, is Master one of the most unique character you have ever seen? lol.Overall: 8There\'s no reason not to try this anime, it\'s funny, different, interesting, and just overall a pretty relaxing anime to watch. head over heels for another person, while in their secrets, it\'s the other way around.

The drama is often quite natural, and the characters are quite refreshing to see. Makabe just has me cheering for him, and Aki is glorious in her tropy tsundere personality. It treats it\'s cliches in such a self aware way they just become funny, and to be honest, the story actually got me quite hooked, since there is actual progression, and NO HAREM THANK GOD.Still, the...show suffers from a few typical issues for it\'s genre.

However, it was just painfully obvious throughout the entire season that the team behind the show wasn't good enough to execute on their premise. From the start, you can see that the story will end one of two ways; he'll get his revenge on Adagaki Aki, or won't and they'll fall in love and live happily ever after or whatever. And then, for the entire season, nothing happens. Like, nothing at all.

This isn't a problem, and which you prefer is a matter of taste, but I think everyone can agree that something that focuses so strongly on comedy should at least be funny. The show's best moments, in my opinion, was when it had drama related to the motivations of the central characters, but these were so diluted by poor gags that they didn't have as much impact as they ought to have. Poor writing and poor timing changed a story that, with very few alterations, could have been a six or seven, into a clear four.

Most of the comedy was cringe funny (like how Masamune says weird pick up lines he got from manga, I FELT THE AWKWARDNESS THROUGH THE SCREEN).I really expect Masamune and Aki to actually fall in love at some point (if there will be a 2nd season, I haven't read the manga) so I'm not paying too much attention that Masamune's whole drive is to break her heart.The show ended in the middle of an arc which was pretty awkward, it could have at least had a resolution and...complete the arc.CHARACTERS:Each of the characters are very unique and have lots of detail in their personalities. Some characters are not exactly likable because the cast consists of the narcissist, the men hater, the girl that tries to completely ruins the main characters relationship etc. but they were enjoyable to watchLittle development except for the minimal advancement in the main character’s relationship and *SPOILER* the other girl giving up on Masamune, overall supporting him and Aki *END OF SPOILER*ART:Characters were wonderfully designed.

Overall 7/10"", 'In summary, I absolutely loved this anime. It was a great spin on the typical shojou romance.The story of Adagaki Aki and her cruel outlook on men, mixed with the hilarity of masamune makabe trying to be the cool ikemen he looks like, created a wonderfully entertaining anime.Story 7: The story isn\'t all that satisfying, honestly. There are several ways to look at it of course, I personally love a rich story with comedy and an interesting take to a typical genre. To me, ""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" did that. The story was cute, funny, and light. I feel like these days so many anime are...dark and depressing; Finding an uplifting anime is a nice change to the mainstream stuff I have been seeing.Art 7: The art was not too bad, I didn\'t hate it, however for those that don\'t like typical, or common, you would not like this art style. Yes, it was a typical style but there is nothing wrong with that. The male characters all had the same sort of ""baby face"" that a lot of anime/manga artists fall into occasionally. However, I found the use of typical art style in this anime added to the overall quality. The story follows, what one would assume, is a typical shojou romance, however the plot takes quips and interesting digs at these cliche typical romances with the characters. Adding the typical art style only adds to the comedy and irony of the cliche.Sound 7: I found that the soundtrack in this anime didn\'t really stick. It matched the overall feel of the anime with the lighthearted nature, however I didn\'t find myself, at any point, thinking ""hey these are some pretty cool tunes"". However I don\'t think that the sound quality/soundtrack of an anime should be a part of whether or not you watch it. Unless the anime is something like Starmyu.Character 10: I absolutely loved the characters in this anime. Sure a few of them were rather common, but the majority of them were so masterfully crafted I found myself actually screaming when I was watching their interactions. My personal favourite characters are, in no particular order,  Kae futaba, Kojuuro shuri, yoshino koiwai, and of course, masamune makabe. In order of why I love them: Kae Futaba is a fellow fujoshi, several times throughout the show we see her fangirl over the pairing of Kojuuro-kyun and... Well basically any other guy. Next is my sweet sweet kojuuro-kyun. he is described as the ""designated bottom"" this again appeals to my fujoshi heart as we see several references to this. In the first episode We see so, so, many references. At one point we see him adorably chomp on a NEKO DONUT.. I REPEAT A NEKO DONUT. Yoshino Koiwai is by far one of the most well thought out characters in the whole show. She starts off all sweet and shy but then, oh but then, we see her actual sense of Kuudere-ness. She is so cold and calculating and no one knows it, except for Masamune of course. Then finally our main, dorky, hero: Masamune Kun. Masamune is such a lovable character. From his good looks to quirky/dorky thought process, he is just adorable. Several times throughout the series he tries to be the ""cool ikemen"" his appearance makes him seem to be. However his take on romance is strictly from his ""master"" koiwai-san or from Shojou manga.overall 10: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and think that anyone who is looking for a lighthearted adorable anime should give this one a try. The show was so fun to watch, and I loved the ""cliche yet not"" take the creators took with this. The characters are so enjoyable, the plot is funny, and the overall enjoyment levels I get from this are well beyond a ten out of ten.

Well, maybe this last episode makes an unfavorable impression. very annoying. Of course, I also experienced the same thing.

Overall, I do not really know about genree like harem in detail. but I think, it's been good and not overdone.2) Sounds and Character: 7For the use of sound and character is good enough.

But I think the author is already set it pretty well.3) Enjoyment:...8I especially enjoyed the anime and even I'm still curious about the continuation of the first seasonOverall: 7-7.5This anime gives the good enough impression.

This show was better than expected. I think that's a proper way of summarizing it. If you had read the summary of the show then more than likely you can imagine exactly how the show goes. I guessed most of it fairly accurately, however it was more entertaining than I expected.The story itself isn't a terrible one. A once fat kid attempts to get revenge on a girl who once rejected him because of his fat. How he attempts to get revenge is by becoming hot and then dating her then dumping her.The...show actually flows pretty well with that goal and only gets slightly derailed for what seems like interesting back story. However as anyone with a brain could guess the ending probably will not include revenge. Though I say that I'm not certain as this season ended on a fairly weighty cliff hanger.My problem with the story of this show is actually how quickly they throw it at you. They do a good job making you feel informed about the situation, however this show would probably be really good if they took it a bit more slowly and gave it a two or three seasons to develop.The art was awesome and the soundtrack was equally as good.The characters were pretty typical. Snobby tsundere main girl, strange powerful and detached maid, and fragile rich girl. The only plus side to these tropes is how they were handled. The fragile rich girl doesn't play out like you would expect, and the main character is really fun. I enjoyed the characters as much any other show, however like I mentioned above the way the show paced itself made the characters pointless.Overall this show was really fun to watch, and I look forward to season 2. There are a few odd twists and things here and there but overall its a fun rom com. It could have been better if they took time to introduce and get us attached to the characters. The comedy is pretty good, the main story line is fun and easy to follow. They do add in twists and roadblocks, but it doesn't detract from the show in any real way. Overall I would recommend this show to anyone who likes rom com shows, just be warned its not the best.TLDR: Not bad, better than you might think. Poor character development, and a cliff hanger ending. Rom com fans will probably enjoy it. show actually flows pretty well with that goal and only gets slightly derailed for what seems like interesting back story. However as anyone with a brain could guess the ending probably will not include revenge. Though I say that I'm not certain as this season ended on a fairly weighty cliff hanger.My problem with the story of this show is actually how quickly they throw it at you. They do a good job making you feel informed about the situation, however this show would probably be really good if they took it a bit more slowly and gave it a two or three seasons to develop.The art was awesome and the soundtrack was equally as good.The characters were pretty typical. Snobby tsundere main girl, strange powerful and detached maid, and fragile rich girl. The only plus side to these tropes is how they were handled. The fragile rich girl doesn't play out like you would expect, and the main character is really fun. I enjoyed the characters as much any other show, however like I mentioned above the way the show paced itself made the characters pointless.Overall this show was really fun to watch, and I look forward to season 2.

Well this isn\'t entirely false but as I watched this show, I realized that it was...kind of different.Masamune isn\'t your everyday school type anime protagonist. He is actually a handsome guy who is very popular in school and even though he could get pretty much any girl he wanted,  he is obsessed with his revenge on Adagaki  Aki. The whole anime develops around that.Now I don\'t really want to talk about the plot itself but about my thoughts of what was missing and what was too much in this anime.I really loved the concept of Masamune being a good looking guy after his terrible experiences in the past for being fat. He was bullied and supposedly rejected by his childhood love (Adagaki Aki). He worked very hard to change his appearance and to become the perfect kind of person you would date.It\'s really annoying the whole revenge thing because at certain points it really looks like he is in love with Adagaki-san, not just for her but even for the viewers. I think the story is kind of stuck in the same concept and that prevents it from developing.I really loved  like  the first 4 or 5 episodes. Because the relation between the two main characters seemed to be making sense. But then, all of a sudden, the plot turns and we\'re back at the start. They seem to become more and more distant. Conversations that you\'d expect to happen don\'t happen and the whole thing just gets weird. Then another character shows up and ""steals"" Adagaki\'s heart, as well as Masamune\'s identity. For some reason the main character doesn\'t seem to be much bothered about this and nothing really happens.Maybe it\'s just me being unsatisfied by the fact that the story was getting weirder, simply because the characters wouldn\'t do what I was expecting, or what would be expected in a romance anime.Also what the hell was that ending? Seriously the whole karaoke thing  didn\'t make any sense. That last sheet of paper was, probably, an opening for a future 2nd season or ova. But seriously if the story doesn\'t start developing I don\'t see any reason to keep watching it.I know this is mostly a negative review which contrasts with the score I gave. The thing is, I\'m just really sad and unsatisfied with the plot, I was expecting it to be a little deeper. The whole concept, animations, and characters were very good, soundtrack was OK, but I just feel that there\'s something missing.I did not read the Manga but from the reviews I saw it really is better and deeper than the anime. So if you\'re either planning to watch this show, or, like me, unsatisfied with it, I highly recommend you to read  the manga.Overall it\'s not a bad show and you actually get attracted and familiarized with it\'s characters and story. I\'ve seen the most various opinions about ""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" so go ahead, watch it and take your own conclusions.

After a while of procrastinating and not going through with watching it, I took it off my list, as I thought it would be another stupid romcom show that would be okay, but have no depth.Man, am I grateful I decided to add it back on!Story - 8:As the synopsis goes, ""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" is a tale about a rich, fat brat that fell in love with a beautiful girl when she saved him from bullies. However, once he confessed...his love, she cruelly rejected him, thus nicknaming him \'Pig\'s Foot.\' Grown up, and now a hot guy with a muscly body, Masamune vows revenge on this girl. He will make her fall in love with him and then break her heart. But will things go according to plan?The plot is pretty solid. Intriguing and tells the whole story without spoiling the anime. It\'s what pulled me into the show. The story stays consistent throughout the entire anime, and it doesn\'t change focus, which I loved a lot. It was the focal point that kept me into the anime the whole time. Here\'s a warning, though. Some episodes have an extra scene after the ED, others do not. So watch out for this when watching!Art - 10:The art was absolutely fantastic. The characters, the background scenes, the filters, all exceptionally clear and pristine. The art of this show made me want to draw again. It was detailed without looking gaudy or too realistic. It was still cartoonish--anime, which was easy and appealing on the eyes. The color scheme was very warm and sunny, which made me very emotionally happy while watching it.Sound - 7:The music was pretty good. Upbeat, and matched the show perfectly. The opening theme wasn\'t anything great in the beginning, but as I continued listening to it, I sang along. However, no one would be sad to just skip it. The ending theme was even more unmemorable, and didn\'t stick out too much. I found myself just skipping onto the next episode. The OSTs (Original Sound Tracks) seem very thought out, and are enjoyable to listen to within the scenes. Sometimes they almost sound very fairytale like. Always dramatic and quirky. They fit whatever scene they\'re placed into, and don\'t get very repetitive. However, it\'s easy to overlook their existence.Here\'s a link to the OST if you wanna give it a listen: https://goo.gl/sAAR6FCharacters - 7:The characters are pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, but definitely a good watch.Enter Makabe Masamune: Former bullied fat kid, now reformed hottie. He appears narcissistic at points due to his insecurities. The audience can visibly see him struggle between being his real self and what he wants others to see. As the show is from his point of view, there\'s never a dull moment. Thankfully, he is one of those main characters that isn\'t bland and dull.Enter Adagaki Aki: Renowned man hater. Anything else I have to say about you, you shouldn\'t hear until you watch the film. BUT! People, you can relax because she is not a stereotypical annoying tsundere. That is not all her character consists of, THANK GOD.The other characters shall remain a mystery, but they\'re good~ This anime has a whole range of interesting and unique characters. Some tropes, others not, but they\'re played off well.Near the end of the series, a character is thrown in, and some developments are undergone that kind of shake up the show a little to where I had to take off a point, but it only affects the critical analysis of the anime.Enjoyment - 9:I had a kick out of this show! There were so many times where I was fangirling, laughing, and just having a blast. The comedy never stops, but it never gets overwhelming either. It filled me with such emotions of happiness, that I just couldn\'t get enough. If you want a light watch between your more serious series, I  suggest this one. Or if that\'s all you\'re looking for is a short, no commitment, funny series, come watch this one!Overall - 8:The breakdown is really an 8.2 if you wanna get technical, but MAL only lets you round up or down. This anime deserves an 8 because it is very good, and does a magnificent job of not going off topic like others shows with such a limited episode count.

My first impression was that I thought the main character was irritating but knowing he was influenced because of his past I continued on. Some of his lines and behavior about food and exercise were relatable. However I thought his revenge on his childhood friend was pointless, it felt like the story was iffy and dragging on although I had a feeling there's a reason why she became like that--which i'm itching for the revelation. Although some characters were interesting, out of all characters I don't like Aki not because out how she treats guys...but because of an assumption she made in a certain future episode which made it seem like the story should have ended there. There were few cliche fansevice moments and I think it wasn't necessary as it isn't that funny to see girls undergarments.Story is okay, but the motivation is stupid.Art is mediocre for this century however the manga art is way better.Sound is not bad nor amazing. That rise in the OP theme had a good feeling to it.There were interesting characters. The loli mom bothers me.. is it even possible for someone not to grow old(by growing old I mean not looking like a child) from having 2 children. I'd root for Masamune to pick Neko, she seems fitting with her knowledge about nutrients and Masamune's obsession for fitness.The episodes were somewhat enjoyable and cringey at times.Overall I'd give it a six. I'd say the guy should have just forgotten about her, why go out of your way to exact revenge on someone who rejects you?  I gave it a chance to see if it was good but it isn't my cup of tea. but because of an assumption she made in a certain future episode which made it seem like the story should have ended there.

The worst thing is when 'he' (you know who I am talking about) comes towards the...end and let me say that he is the most random character I have ever seen popping out in a anime in a very long time.Art--5The art is mediocre, nothing special and it does not really stand out. It feels rushed at some parts and I can tell that there is a low budget later on towards the end.Sound--7Surprisingly, I really liked the OST in the anime, and somehow it stands out for me when compared to other anime under the romance or harem category. The op gets a bit annoying after a few episodes but I never got sick of the two ending songs.Character--3There is almost no character development except for one episode (episode 8) which is the only episode which actually surprised me for a increase in quality in terms of writing. Other than that, there is no 'in-depth' character development and I feel like the characters are forced to interact with each other or they all seem aware about the revenge plan, maybe it is just me.Enjoyment-6It has a old, traditional anime vibe and feel from the 90's for some reason, which made me feel excited and can't wait a week for a new episode to be released. However, I lost interest in the last few episodes, especially the final episode which felt like a slap to my face and a manifestation of a headache. The last few episodes were really cringe.Overall--4I must say, I was rather disappointed that the anime ended like that, especially how the series ends with a karaoke night which was filler. What really pissed me off what 'fake Masamune' is forgiven by Aki almost immediately like as if nothing happened, it is as if she is blind after her backlash in the previous episode.The anime is decent and what hurts is that Masamune kun no Revenge had high potential. end and let me say that he is the most random character I have ever seen popping out in a anime in a very long time.Art--5The art is mediocre, nothing special and it does not really stand out.

Though our M protagonist and S princess are annoying as hell, there are some characters which is interesting too. Koiwai is the best (it.. it's not that I like inori minase or anything), her character are solid and her...acting dumb is funny. I like neko as well, and she is not as mysterious as I think first, actually when progress with episodes I find that she is the most simplest and earnest character here.And that's all for the good parts, everything else are disaster. The story is quite promising at first, but sadly, the development is nowhere near fulfilling. The romantic and stupid events are all over the place, the main story itself is not progressing. There are no meaning of every single episode, it just show our masamune stupidity again and again. The S princess just like someone with brain damage and memory disorder, her behaviors are so random which is very annoying. To make it worse, instead of making the past events clear and show the result off this childish revenge, they decide to add half ass characters in the ending, which is neither interesting nor blend well with the story progression.In the end, this is not about revenge, it is just story of some random boy who pathetically chasing after beautiful girl with serious mental issues. For anyone who is interested in masochism and humiliation this anime will be entertaining. For me, I really regret finishing this pathetic comedy. acting dumb is funny.

Or perhaps a psychological drama?! The anime had mixed and match sub genres that were in conflict with each other as  they did not, nor could not mixed without adverse affects.Within this struggle are poorly developed characters that make no absolute sense, such as Fujinomiya - who represented the spontaneous insertion of harem as a sub genre. She and the characters were strangers and pretty much remained strangers by definition. Her backstory turned out to be anti-climatic, despite it having some potential,...and frankly, her presence in the anime had no purpose, aside from trolling the audience. This redundancy with character traits and presence was a common sight in the anime.In fact all the characters can be summed up with one world - ""horrendous"". You had your basics set of Visual novel characters. The Himedere, the Kuudere, the sickly observer/lover, the energetic/popular girl, etc. That set up is fine if you get creative with it, but in this case nothing extra was added to their characteristics. Most anime modify these traits - for example a self-proclaimed rich girl who\'s father is actually bankrupt, or a cold-hearted girl who enjoys the company of domestic animals. In this anime we get all the default traits with the default back stories.The concept was great, but where it fell short was it\'s execution. It could have went down any route, but it crippled it\'s outcome - by choosing to make a story more suited for a Romance/Drama - into a cheesy comedy with unimaginative scenarios, and completely redundant characteristics - that obviously have the intent to amplify the comedy, but fail to do so.  The story is honestly pathetic, with it taking short cuts to skip look dramatic build ups in exchange some progression. It\'s pretty much forced to since the comedy genre slows down progression and at times makes it stagnant .What personally ticked me off was the fact that whenever the opportunity to thicken the plot came around, they ruined it with a gag or just outright ignored it so they could progress onto a beach episode or school festival scene that just reiterated the same sections of the plot and character traits, such as the Main character\'s motives.The art wasn\'t that bad, nor are the special. The art is the sub standard 2 tone drawings with a bit of glow added in the few romance senses. It was simple with only basic creases outlined on characters and an environment that has minimal affects on the animation.

The way they brought up the story was just awesome but  it didn\'t continue well. At first it kinda off looked like an interesting story because it brought up an new idea to the anime world, like how he will take revenge on her because she dumps people for her problems and also dumped the main character  bcas he was fat and stuff. As she didn\'t understand the feeling of getting dumped, so that was the main character aim, but in my point of view the main story line of this anime was not good....i know i am contradicting but wasting all 12 episodes just to show how he will take his revenge ( In my opinion he will not take revenge on her instead he will love her ) is just stupid. The characters are not relatable in any way and one of the character is a boy who looks like a girl and acts like girl, gross. Anyhow the whole point is whether it entertained me or not, right ???

So a ""BIG NO""', 'Story: so it starts with a guy masmune who was walking to school one day and ends up find that the girl who basically gave him the nick name pig foot (MAL has it as ""Piggy"" which is wrong) so basically sense he found her he wants too get revenge on her for her dumping him for giving him the nickname and also for doing what see did too every guy that basically had nicknames (rude ones at that) placed apon themArt: art is very good nothing wrong with itSound: OP and ED were meh at best would probably have 2 listen too them again...before i like them or dont like them otherwise the sound was good.Character: Masamune is basically the male lead and narcissistic in a sense that he cares ALOT about hes looks and just about everything about him but he is easily a nice guy. Aki is basically the female lead and well a total bitch she is that and even more turning down any boy and well mocking the guys who asked her out and gave them nicknames. Neko is a supporting character and also loves Masamune she is a sweet and also cool girl. Yoshino another supporting character she is also the maid for aki but she does turn on her to help Masamune get revenge on aki she is a clumsy but a nice person.Enjoyment: so this anime was HELLA good in my honest opinion the comedy was pure gold and the characters were very good. my gripes were that the ending was just like WTF they basically had a karaoke to basically end it but when i thought she might kiss him nope and they still aren\'t going out so season 2 inbound spoilers incoming. (they basically ended it with him not getting revenge and even Masamune made it like a season 2 will happen so it better)Overall: giving this a 8 for sure again the ending was crap and is why its getting a 8 and not a 9 from me but the characters were so good and the comedy was pure gold a anime worth a watch (please let this anime have a season 2) before i like them or dont like them otherwise the sound was good.Character: Masamune is basically the male lead and narcissistic in a sense that he cares ALOT about hes looks and just about everything about him but he is easily a nice guy.

I'll try to keep this spoiler freeStory:5The story is pretty generic with a few touches here and there, it's not really good story wise, just your generic rom com with some drama added in the middle and it ends with again a generic ass ending. It's about Masamune a boy who is entering a specific high school for one reason, to get revenge on the girl who bullied him when he was a...kid, this girl is named Adagaki Aki a cruel girl who rejects every single boy who wants to date her.

Nothing to complain hereSound:6It's ok, the OP and ED is pretty much your standard rom com OP and ED with a woman singing the OP and ED, the score also isn't special at all.Characters:5They're your standard characters. The male MC Masamune is pretty decent with some things i found interesting, he's pretty much the best character other than one girl. The female MC Aki is not interesting at all, she's just your mean but smart waifu that has no boobs and ass. A character that i do find interesting is Yoshino, she's aki's maid and the only one she trusts. Yoshino has these traits that make her interesting like the fact that she can be a fucking assasin. The supporting cast is generic, that's itEnjoyment:6I enjoyed it enough to the point of actually wanting to finish it, it's actually really disappointing at the end, that's all i can sayOverall:5Masamune-Kun no Revenge is just your standard middle of the road forgettable rom com, if you want to watch this expecting something gold, i hate to break it to you but all you're gonna find watching this is just disappointment if you're expecting something like Oregairu.

And guess what? The idiot here continued to force himself to watch because he had a tiny expectation that it would improve, but in the end it was a cluster of random episodes and extremely boring cliches that exuded the predictable in an uninterrupted and boring way. Holy shit, for the most part, you could predict what would happen in the next episode pretty much all based on what you saw before; It was ridiculous.The whole plot is more like a random...set of OVAS, in which, some parts, will be surprisingly important in the plot. Actually, this was not supposed to be a novelty, most of the anime / manga that approach this annoying and saturated theme, always develop this way, but really, does not stop or tire of being impertinent to see.Visually, it's cute. The visual (environment) of the anime is pleasant, a pity that what the anime has to present does not follow this line ...The animation looked like it would be good, but it suffers a considerable loss of quality.And the soundtrack, nothing much. It does not disturb or help, basically.And now it is here that I lay all my eternal and profound repudiation of the anime; The characters, or rather the two protagonists. God, how horrible they are. In fact, their personality is that it is so hateful.Let's go in parts, first, Masamune: man, it's out of the ordinary, how fucking he is. To start with his goal, which almost completely outlines the plot. It is certain that even the anime itself does not give a seriousness to it, but seriously, it is so unbearably unbearable what it does because of this totally childish and superficial goal, rather than being funny, it is pathetic. He just did not give a fuck what was going on around him (mostly), because of a revenge he was supposed to have been in the past. But no, he holds an extremely strong and ultra relevant rancor because of a... rejection. Wow, it's really pathetic.And second, last, and definitely not least, Aki: I actually wondered, how the hell does one like it, even getting on a level to consider it a love. She has such a fucking boring and unpalatable ego. Why then, moe is not enough to make a character a person's love, okay? Well, let's face it, having a superiority complex so inflated to the point of tearing up a simple love letter, and putting on an embarrassing nickname and humiliating whoever is confessing, I think it's not very lovely...So, in the end, my relevant hate for anime is mainly due to the characters. If they were other than the two protagonists, I probably would have enjoyed the anime much more and would not give such a big deal to a totally boring, predictable, and meager storyline. set of OVAS, in which, some parts, will be surprisingly important in the plot.

Dont get me wrong, they introduced some new characters but there was no incremental progress in the main characters revenge. At ep 10 and 11 I just wanted the anime to be over allready, as the logic behind the main characters actions anoyed me to no end.In conclusion;This anime had a good idea behind it but the story was lacking greatly and got a bit boring after the first 5 eps.

Im not saying that being generic is something bad, but it's just that I had a feeling that they wanted to make something that breaks the typical Romance/Comedy/School-Life genre. A little information (or perhaps a personal impression) of this anime:Art -8-When I first watched the first episode, the first thing that I noticed was that the artwork of the characters was stunning. Our heroine was well animated and had a special and unique look. The background and the side characters also were nicely done. As for our MC,...I had the feeling that the animation studio used more time and cash to animate him than all the other (female) characters (lol).Characters -7-Early in the anime the motive of our MC is already clear; he wants to date the main heroine (Aki) due to seeking revenge to her. Now, you may think: Yeah! Awesome, finally a MC who does his shit for a different reason. Someone who doesn't want to get all Lovey Dovey with the babes in the story. But in reality what we have here is THE typical MC:Coming to a new school where he doesn't know anyone? Check.Having an hyperactive and sweet imouto (lil' sis)? Check.No common sense in terms of love/romance? Cheeeck.And as for our heroine...No common sense in terms of everyday life and social interaction? Check.Having a naturally weird hair color (blue)? Check.100% TSUN, 0% dere??? CHEEECKKKKKK.As I said, the stated stuff up there doesn't strictly mean something bad. It's just my opinion that they wanted to make something special but didn't work out.Story -6-I think you at least until now you understand my point of this anime being generic... The story isn't really something special. The motivation of the MC is different than others but still I think the result is the same. Nothing good and nothing bad either, so a solid 6, although the process in my opinion is a bit slow.Sound -8-Yeah, as long as the sound and music in the anime don't suck, then everything's ok for me I guess... But I think I enjoy that one instrument which you always hear when you see the Eiffel Tower or Paris in TV...Enjoyment -7-In terms of enjoyment, the anime definitely isn't bad, if you like Romance/School Life/Comedy animes like me. All the characters have their certain charm sometimes. I just simply enjoy watching these types of anime no matter if they're special or normal I'd watch them all :).Sooo overall I'd give it a solid 7 right now. The anime isn't over yet so I can't really comment about the final score I'd give it but let's hope for something good and exciting at the end :D I had the feeling that the animation studio used more time and cash to animate him than all the other (female) characters (lol).Characters -7-Early in the anime the motive of our MC is already clear; he wants to date the main heroine (Aki) due to seeking revenge to her.

First it was all serious with a full revenge plot. By the end its a sappy happy mushy high school girl tone when they all cared for each other. Sounds about right but the sappy happy tone started before midway of the season. Leaving a confusing unsatisfying season not as a whole but for the most part.The title literally has the word ""revenge"" on it. So if they are going to make a story about revenge then they should at least make it much longer and more serious.Also don\'t...trust manga fan readers for this series. I already read most of it and it was incredible accurate. However the plot still stayed the same without any fan service. trust manga fan readers for this series.

As well, how much you enjoyed/will enjoy this anime shouldn\'t be dependent on something someone else has to say about it. I will try my best to keep you open-minded about this anime, while I also won\'t shy away from what it does poorly. ANY SPOILERS WILL BE KEPT TO THE END OF THE REVIEW IF ANY.Let\'s start with getting the most objective parts of the anime out of the way.ART...AND SOUND. When it comes down to the art style, I don\'t think you will be disappointed or turned away, and I also don\'t think it will blow your mind. It has the same art style most other shows like it made after 2013 use. They use the classic chibi expressions on funny lighthearted parts, the dramatic camera angles and blushing of the cheeks on dramatic parts, and everything in-between that you would expect. Nothing groundbreaking here, there were a few parts that I noticed looked slightly more professional than normal, typically in the most climatic scenes, which is still normal for most other shows like it. As for the sound, it doesn\'t sound like the characters are too far away or have bad quality audio, and it also doesn\'t sound way too close and crystal clear, which is something you will normally find more of in anime movies or very serious high production value shows. When factoring in music, it\'s also nothing that I would write home about. The show has good background music that fit the tones they were trying to capture perfectly, and that\'s about all there is to say about it. I didn\'t personally find the intro music to be that thrilling, but maybe you will appreciate it more than I did. It all comes down to personal opinion.CHARACTERS. I personally really enjoyed most of the characters in this show. The personalities may annoy you at times as they did me, but I think that is exactly what the writers were trying to portray and they did a great job at it. When you\'re screaming at your computer screen yelling at the main character for being such a narcissist yet not being able to get a single girl\'s phone number, you know that, good or bad, they made you feel some sort of emotion, which is what I strive to get out of watching anime. Although I will admit, sometimes during this show they go a little too far, and you can\'t help but feel that occasionally the characters aren\'t real, just classic tropes you see in every other rom-com anime of it\'s kind. However, I stand by my feeling that the characters personalities bring a fun twist to a typical anime of it\'s kind, as most would make the main character a classic Joe, with no real ""out there"" traits, at least certainly not to the extent of Masamune-kun. That is as far into the characters as I will go to not spoil anything else.STORY. (I WILL TRY MY BEST TO AVOID SPOILERS BUT BE WARNED). The story of this show starts off really really well. Like, with the potential of it becoming one of my top rom-com anime of all time. However, about halfway through the show they start throwing in very very strange plot twists for reasons that can\'t really be explained by the viewer, or even the writers. With random characters showing up and the attitudes and entire purpose of the show seeming to change in the blink of an eye, with no better explanation than, ""It\'s just chance is all hehe"". This is still bearable throughout most of the show though, and these out-of-the-blue characters ended up making the anime even more enjoyable than it already was for me, with a little better tie-in\'s I think they would have nailed it perfectly. That is until almost the end of the show. I won\'t put spoilers here, but I feel the need to help mankind for the better and let you know that if you don\'t like complete out-of-the-blue plot twists right when you think the show is coming to it\'s ultimate badass and heart-throbbing climax- you might not want to bother watching this show. I\'m not stressing this when I say it is BAD. It is the reason I gave the story of this show a 5 instead of a 9. The ending truly ruined a lot for me. I don\'t regret watching it by any means, but if you\'re one of those people that think if the ending isn\'t good then it\'s a waste of time to watch it, then spare yourself the 4 hours.In conclusion, what could have been a great show with refreshing characters and a great plot setup, was just a good show, due to the non-existent tie-in\'s and poorly executed plot twists.

Please do not be mislead as this is in fact nothing of the sort. Masamune-kun no revenge is a romantic comedy at best, and even then has the decency to take it's 'Romcom' moments somewhat seriously, where these moments actually have an impact on progression, and it isn't just dropped like in other anime.The 'harem' in actuality consists of only two girls [SPOILER] one of which even removes herself from the love triangle in the end, leaving the romance we all want. [END SPOILER]By taking this approach, with it's...unique plot of revenge for his mistreatment, Masamune-kun's revenge definitely strikes as something out of the ordinary for School Life anime. There is actual romance, good progression in terms of story elements, setting itself up as a very good romance anime from the mediocre harem that I was expecting before I watched it.A lot of people seemed ticked off by the ending of this show, but it is to keep in mind that is anime is almost identical to it's manga and as such has teased a second season already, with the next plot in mind. Overall, I had a lot of fun watching this, and is in the end a lighthearted anime that has a pretty good spin on romance for what it is. unique plot of revenge for his mistreatment, Masamune-kun's revenge definitely strikes as something out of the ordinary for School Life anime.

StoryStorywise, it was good on the first few episode before the arrival of Neko, but things turned messy upon her arrival, let\'s not forget that the story plot relies...upon Masamune getting even with Aki, but what we see next , was his foolishness of not pushing through with it and often stopping midway despite of the opportunities , situations and even with Yoshino\'s help, that alone was a 360 degree turn around was a turn off for me.Good 7. ArtOk, so there isn\'t much about the art, but what makes me give it a 7 was for Yoshino and Midori\'s panchira, ya know it\'s kinda disappointing, that Yoshino is the only one who has the most panchira here, I mean, no Tae, Aki, Mari, kiba and Kaneko panchira moment? Also, there is Shuri Kojuro, he....or she is a mystery in fact I\'m thinking that he is a she, but that\'s on the next category.Very Good 8. SoundThe score is for the closing theme ""Elemental World"" which pretty much fits in for this anime\'s ending.Poor 3. CharactersMy pet peeves about the characters:Adagaki, Aki, a typical primadonna tsundere, who belong to the upper echelons not only in society but in her school as well, not the kind who wants to show her weakness, and not the kind who openly admits it, then again she is a character that one would like to hate.Koiwai, Yoshino, Aki\'s loyal servant whose personality has a two face in it, one point she is this yes ojosama to Aki, and the other is the ""You Bitch"" ojosama where she helps out Masamune to get even, you know she should just put some snot and boogers in Aki\'s food and just kick Masamune\'s ass outta her life, since he\'s useless anyways.Tae Futaba, ok she likes Masamune, but she isn\'t the kind who should be going for that guy instead she should be smacking him on the face for taking over Gasou place during the festival, now c\'mon what Masamune did is a stabbed on the back for his own class.Shuri Kojuro, I fully believe he is a she, though we would never know that in this anime , it\'s highly certain that in later chapters of the manga all will be reveled, I would never understand as to what\'s going on the mind of original creator, Takeoka, Hazuki for making him or her like that.Fujinomiya, Neko, to me I see her as Masamune\'s lost chance and missed opportunity, she could have serve as the guy\'s tool for getting even with Aki, man, I really like her for Masamune.Gasou, Kanetsugu, well he\'s a nobody here in the anime, so fuck him.Mari, Kikune, and Kaneko, are nothing more that just Aki\'s lesbian lackeys, whom Masamune should have given each of them a bitch slap.And the main disappointment Masamune Makabe, he is the epitome of stupidy, disorganization, vanity and too much bush beating that he never was able to implement what he want\'s to do, and thus makes him totally annoying.Poor 3. EnjoymentIt may be nice to watch, but as one watches, one would be filled with annoyance for the character, Masamune, as we wish that he get\'s even, frankly from episode 1 to 11 would be watchable, but when one get\'s to episode 12, that there is 360 degree turn around, where one would be filled with disappointment for seeing Masamune as this Pussy who is all talk and no action.Poor 3 OverallThis totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don\'t even think about having a season 2, BITCH!OUT!!!!!!! upon Masamune getting even with Aki, but what we see next , was his foolishness of not pushing through with it and often stopping midway despite of the opportunities , situations and even with Yoshino\'s help, that alone was a 360 degree turn around was a turn off for me.Good 7.

It feels as though somewhere along the way the director (or whoever was charge of production) lose sight of the direction they wanted to take.Nevertheless, it produced aspects of comedic behaviour, which allowed viewers to adjust to the anime.In my opinion, though, they still managed to create properties of depth, even if they lacked the ability to accomplish what they wanted,; the overall journey to it was full of gag comedy that provided some balance to the deficit left by the closing of the...story.On the other hand, the transition between love and revenge was much too quick, which made them unable to clearly navigate, rendering it useless to actually develop an end that was befitting the story...Thus why it ended ambiguously with karaoke -this also was reflected on the fact that they attempted fan service of aki and neko. Which ultimately failed (opinion, really?)I wouldn't expect a sequel in the short term, so anyone still interested should move on to the manga story.On the other hand, the transition between love and revenge was much too quick, which made them unable to clearly navigate, rendering it useless to actually develop an end that was befitting the story...Thus why it ended ambiguously with karaoke -this also was reflected on the fact that they attempted fan service of aki and neko.

It\'s just... filled with so much ""filler"". It can\'t seem to stick to it\'s story.Story:The concept is actually really good in my opinion. A mysterious past about getting rejected, and coming back to take ""revenge""? And then it is hinted that it was all a misunderstanding?The romance is MUCH different from shows like Nisekoi. The romance is meant to be forced, and that isn\'t what you really watch it for. This guy doesn\'t love Adagaki Aki, so the romance is meant to feel off.The mystery element is a huge part of why I liked this anime. It...is not clear what happened in the past, and new characters are introduced from the past. The small, vague flashbacks are the best parts of the anime in my opinion.Art: 4/10The art... was not good. I mean, the art style itself wasn\'t too bad, but the animation was rather subpar.Now, is that bad? No. It\'s a story/character driven anime, not an action anme like Fate/Zero. If you want good animation in a romance, I would recommend Oreshura. However, it is not needed here. The animation is okay, and does not positively or negatively affect my viewing experience.Music: 6/10I liked the opening. Many say its rather ""cliche"", but I found it fine. A lot of anime have this type of \'energetic girl singing"" thing, and for good reason. It has been proven to sound good. 7/10 (Also, some say the opening has a lot of spoilers, but as someone who has never read the manga, all of the images are taken out of context, so in reality its not really spoiling anything.)The ending was... okay? It wasn\'t particularly good or bad. Okay music, okay animation etc. 5/10.The OST was also subpar. Not something I would listen to on my own, but didn\'t destroy the mood or anything. 6/10Characters:Every character had some sort of mystery behind them, which was really interesting in my opinion. I found all of the characters very likable, and only one or two characters were particularly irritating.Enjoyment: 9/10I actually enjoyed the shit out of this anime. However, some of it is nostalgia and the parellels between this anime and SNAFU were real. I really liked SNAFU, and one of the elements that it included was the ""mysterious past"" that dragged me in. However, this was a personal taste kind of thing, so although I really enjoyed this anime, I gave it a lower score.So, without spoilers... the ending was shit. No way around it.

He works out, eats healthy, reads a shit tonne of romance manga. After years of ""training"", he becomes the narcissistic sex machine that we know as Masamune Makabe. (Note: no one in this anime has or will have sex throughout the show. Don\'t get your...hopes up ecchi fans)But what has become of the childhood crush? Aki Adagaki has made herself an infamous name at her high school. Dubbed ""The Cruel Princess"", (or as I like to call her ""Mega Bitch"") she has had many men follow after Masamune\'s footsteps, hoping to score a date with the beautiful Adagaki. Instead of accepting any of them, she rejects each and everyone one by giving them all a cruel nickname, ruining their fragile reputation.And that\'s the show. An interesting premise and two interesting main characters. So where did this all go so wrong? Let\'s start with the title of the show. When someone\'s love confession gets rejected, they usually give up. Maybe they\'ll try again, but if it proves futile then they will give up eventually. Not Masamune. How dare a girl say she doesn\'t like him. Sure, she could have said it in a nicer way, but a rejection is a rejection. Instead of letting it go like a certain snow queen, he dedicates his life to his revenge. And for what? If he manages to pull it off, the only person really getting hurt is him. His hard earned reputation as the popular ladykiller crumbles as his classmates will only see him as the new school heartbreaker. Adagaki would, in fact, benefit from this revenge, as it would most probably snap her out of her #HateAllMen phase and allow her to actually get herself a good boyfriend. The consequences are so one sided that you wonder if Masamune accidentally lost more than just his belly fat.The rest of the show is so cliche and predictable, you could remove the revenge theme and turn it into your every day generic harem anime. There is no surprise, no suspense to actually keep you interested. Almost every plot twist does absolutely nothing to change how the anime is progressing. We get a new character, they try and mess up Masamune-kun\'s Revenge, they fail and become dust in the wind, never to be relevant again.So, how can I describe the main character? Well, he\'s an idiot. Masamune\'s only way of getting Adagaki to swoon is to repeat what he has seen done in manga. A cliche pick up line and a wall slam is what he believes are appropriate ways of getting women to fall for him. And when a girl actually does like him and tries to ask him out, he rejects them. Why? Cause he\'s already in a commitment with his revenge. Fuck meaningful relationships and a normal high school life, he\'d rather try and break one girl\'s heart then spend the rest of his life happy with virtually anyone else in the freaking school.Adagaki ain\'t any better. I cannot for the life of me figure out why such an obvious asshole is so popular and has so many people continuously try asking her out. After the first few guys, you would think the school would take a hint and avoid her, but instead, they put her on a high horse and make her the centre of the universe.None of the other characters have anything to offer to the show. Shallow and stereotypical, they rely on overreactions to fool viewers into thinking that they have a decent personality.  Even the character development is teased at best. All the focus is on the narcissist and the bitch, (even though they stay virtually the same throughout the whole series) every other character could be thrown away and replaced and no one would care. Sometimes you see a glimpse of something more than just a background character, but it never gets expanded on and ends up forgotten.The only thing I enjoyed from this dreadful experience is the comedy. I\'m a sucker for overreactions, and it\'s the only thing keeping it from being a 1. Instead of the comedy being a plus, it becomes the single thread that this show hangs on, desperately trying to convince you that it has more to offer, even though it never delivers.What started off as a great first episode filled with potential, crashed and burned harder than Masamune whenever he hears the name ""Pig\'s foot"".

Watch it if you are a masochist, avoid if you have good taste.', 'Masamune-kun no Revenge started with a not quite tired yet premise: a fat guy got rejected by a hot chick so he decided to become a hot guy, seduce the hot chick then dump her. Of course the premise is simply to hook you in. It’s the execution that keeps you in. And maybe this time it’ll be a better and more nuanced take. Maybe this time the guy will be so tunnel-visioned into his revenge it reaches unhealthy levels and he ends up offing his social interactions and a real chance at happiness and love. Maybe this time… oh wait no. They’re making a...harem-comedy and our dumbass MC has a 99.9% chance of ending with one of the least interesting female leads to ever grace the rom-com genre. I mean the title blatantly say “Masamune-kun no Revenge”. (Get it? Because it says no revenge. Eh? Eh…? I have no friends.) To the shows credit, it dashes your hopes early on so you don’t have high expectations.Let’s start with the characters, which I believe are the show’s gravest and greatest weakness. We have the MC who went out of his way to make it flat-out impossible for us to like him, a flat tsundere (and I’m not talking about cup size), a quiet girl that you have a sneaking suspicion is the root of the problem, a tomboyish probably-meant-to-be-a-genki girl that got sidelined so fast before she could even utter “It’s not like I like you or anything ba--baka!”, best gril Kojuurou, an obese monkey wrench, and Stage 4 Plot-itis.The characters are of so little note and lack even the most basic character development that much of the show’s drama relies on external circumstances to wreck havoc. There’s nothing that makes you root for any of them. You have no investment in any of their actions because you know squat diddly what’s in it for them and how it will change them. Even the eponymous revenge you’ll eventually find hard to care because there’s no sense of stake on how it affects the MC or the female lead, other than well putting the female lead, a right bitch, in her place. That’s it for most of the show’s runtime. You get a glimpse who Aki is so late into the story that it doesn’t even matter anymore because by then you’d like nothing more than to make sweet love to her lovely empty head with the business end of a pike.Stage 4 Plot-itis is probably the most likable character, to the point where you’re left wondering what’s a girl like her doing in a show like this. She’s also the most pointless one introduced. Yes, even more than obese monkey wrench. The purpose of Stage 4 Plot-itis is that she represents a way out for the MC -this sweet, soft-spoken, pretty girl who’s going out of her way to make her intentions known and all he has to do is give up on his revenge. But the way she was introduced and the cagey defense of the MC about the circumstances of their encounter only adds unnecessary friction and drama. It feels like the author was just throwing obstacles after obstacles to the main pairing and the characters involved are handed the temporary idiot ball to deliberately make the obstacle worse. And if they actually developed Futaba to be Aki’s competition, Stage 4 Plot-itis could be safely written out and the show could proceed with its drama, but this time coming from the characters themselves as their motivations, dreams, hopes, and feelings collide.The setting and the story aren’t even noteworthy so the show has to rely on their characters to carry the series. Which they failed. They’re not the first and they will not be the last in a genre so rife with the same failures repeated over and over that you’re left wondering if it’s pretty much tradition at this point.But let’s be real, the reason why we’re watching this is to participate in our favorite annual event: Best Gril 2017.

The plot, if ever was one, rapidly fades through the first episodes.You\'ll say to yourself \'what the frick are this characters doing and are we even going anywhere?\' And the obvious answer is no.We\'re in mid series and the main characters fail to accomplish absolutely anything plot, development, romance wise, you name...it! they\'re in a constant rope pulling kind of relationship that takes the series nowhere. After that, a filler episode. Yes, you read that well.Knowing this, the story is a solid 6/10.  I gave it some points, since we have never seen a protagonist get ""jacked"" for ""revenge""(he\'s actually skinny as fried potatoe; revenge was just a word they used to try to give this series some drama)The art man, don\'t even get me started on that one. The drawings of the faces are so inconsistent, that the lead female will look like Adagaki aki, and in the next frame like a deformed teletubbie that doesn\'t know where to point it\'s eyes.This anime makes Dragon Ball Super look like a gibli movie. That all you need to know, seriously.I call this \'The Hunchback of Notre Dame\' art style. And it happens to all the characters! Everytime! So it\'s a constant remainder of \'what i\'m doing with my life?\'.. \'end my suffering onegai shimasu.\'Art is a stone carved 4/10The backgrounds are as generic as they can be, you have your \'generic walking to school background\', \'generic classroom\', \'generic school hallway\' and your \'generic classmate characters\'. I include everyone aside from Masamune and Aki, as part of the background because they don\'t add anything to the non existing plot, they produce the most basic, empty and superficial conversations with our childhood-traumatized main character. They\'re like NPCs but with brain damage.They simply exist to fill the empty spaces of your generic backgroud. Do not expect anything more from this 5/10 mediocre characters.Comedy? Haha nice one. Violence, failed approach attemps, rage, screams, life threats, blackmail are the tools that this series tries to convey as humor, through poor character interactions. Is either this or nothing, because you already know that dialogue wise, this series has nothing to offer, so the poor anime team had to make them all agressive, because nonsence violence is funny right? right?...Take it for 12 stiff episodes or leave it.Masamune Kun no Revenge is a big eyed hunchback teletubbies anime. It won\'t transmite you any feelings, you won\'t care about the characters. As someone who followed the manga and ended up very disappointed with the anime, i advise you not to watch it. Search in your \'plan to watch\' list and you\'ll find something better.Overall: 5. it! they\'re in a constant rope pulling kind of relationship that takes the series nowhere.

We have all been wanting to change for a reason, and we all think it\'s fun and good watching someone achieve their goals. Except that this anime failed MISERABLY in SO MANY LEVELS. Let\'s dig in the review.Story :Masamune is a boy who was overweight in his childhood, and got rejected by Adagaki Aki who rejects every single boy. He wants his revenge. He lose weight and...come as a handsome guy, wanting to make her fall in love with him and then break her heart. We all watch him climb the stairs slowly but surely. We even climb with him. But after episode 6 or 7, we fall to our face. And we keep on falling. You thought it ended there, nope, more falling for you, and in the last episode, you get a shot in the head. CONGRATULATIONS!Seriously, the story takes another turn midway.""Let\'s add a rival to the MC"" they said, ""Let\'s make Adagaki\'s perspective change"" they said, ""It will be alright and fun"" they said. Well, the anime ended in a karaoke party, the MC wasn\'t even in the third stage of his plan. No resolution, nothing. We were left flat. I remember looking at the screen for two minutes after it ended. ""WAIT MAYBE IT\'S A PROMISE FOR A 2ND SEASON?"" LIKE HELL I CARE! A SEASON SHOULD BE SATISFYING IN ITS OWN TO MAKE VIEWERS WANT TO WATCH THE 2ND ONE. IT\'S NOT A DETECTIVE CONAN EPISODE.Art 7/10 :The animation was fluid with some beautiful background sceneries, but nothing over the top or excelling. Easy on the eye.Sound 6/10 :I always watch the opening once, if it\'s good (I\'m looking at you Youjo Senki !) then I make sure to listen to some of it before skipping, but if it\'s not memorable, then SKIPPING is my BFF. That is the case. The OSTs are nothing memorable, too, they serve their purpose if nothing else.Character 6/10 :No development. None at all. Shallow characters with almost no background story (except for Masamune). Also, can someone tell me the purpose of that Loli mom? IT\'S SO EMBARRASSING SHE\'S 1/3 THE CHARACTER\'S HEIGHT. She\'s there just to cook and for comedic relief.Enjoyment 5/10:I looked forward to this series in the beginning, but since that downfall, I basically put it on hold until I had nothing else to do and finished it like a chore. Nonetheless, the comedy was somewhat acceptable.Overall 6/10:(It\'s literally 5.8). I\'m hesitant to watch the 2nd season of this if they decided to do it because I don\'t want a poor ending again and a waste of my time, and, if your anime left this impression on the viewer then you know you failed somewhere. come as a handsome guy, wanting to make her fall in love with him and then break her heart.

I tried to limit them but I feel like the quality of the show is best represented with this information being given out.Masamune-kun was the first show that I started this season. It was something my friend suggested and who knows it had the chance to be interesting so I started it. Luckily because I did so I decided to see what else was airing. In that process I found a lot of other shows that sounded good. So I started them! So thanks to Masamune-kun I was able to find a lot of good anime and watch...it during the season.And that is the last good thing I have to say about this horrible trainwreck of a show.This show was always going to depend on how well they handled the premise. From the very first episode this show reminded me of another show. Take one guess what it is. It's Nisekoi. Of course it's Nisekoi. Now for me then this was a cautionary tale. Why? Because I fucking loathe Nisekoi. There was hope that this show could be good, that it could use its premise and be able to execute it well giving an emotional and interesting rom-com that takes on revenge, and what happens when someone tries to get it but must contend with their feelings. But there was also fear. Fear that it'd end up like Nisekoi. A show that despite an interesting premise decided to screw it up through the usage of filler, unlikeable characters, and just general bad writing BS.Sadly it basically went straight into my worst fears.Almost every part about Masamune-kun is just a worst version of Nisekoi. The play finale? Copied from Nisekoi. Sickly girl who shows up in the middle of the series to add tension to the relationship? Copied from Nisekoi. Annoying side-characters who fight the MC because he's not good enough for the main girl? Copied from Nisekoi. Main Female Character who is a cold tsundere? Copied from Nisekoi. Shitty Writing? Copied from Nisekoi. It's almost as if this show was trying so hard to be Nisekoi instead of trying to be itself. Copying a show is bad enough, but copying a miserable mistake for a show like Nisekoi? WHAT COULD GO WRONG!To be fair Masamune-kun did write Neko better than Nisekoi did Marika, and Aki is nowhere near as bad as Chitoge, but still it copies the same exact problems as Nisekoi. These weren't good ideas to begin with.And then there's fake Masamune-kun.. Due to the length of the show his addition was pointless from the start. Why add on a character just to have him as a rival for 3 episode, it's pointless. Furthermore, he's not exactly a good rival. The only reason why he does well is because Aki thinks that he is Masamune. Which reminds me of the convoluted plot behind all of this. Which happened to NOT BE REVEALED. If you're going to have some important plot point like that at least do the service of actually telling the audience once it's over. Because it's pretty dang important to how the series works and why the characters act like they do. The fact that they left that as a gaping black hole is criminally bad writing.Luckily I can tell you this, the idea is stupid. It only helps make the show a more convoluted mess. Not that it needed any help in that.Have I mentioned Aki's friends yet? I absolutely loathe characters who act like moral guardians for others. They aren't in charge of Aki and they have to deal with that. Seeing them get enduced into rage because Aki dare might be with a man is infuriating. Even worse it adds nothing to the show. So it's just there, making me this much more pissed at this crap while adding absolutely nothing to the show. They're overall a small part of the show since they only matter in the last 3 episodes and even at that they barely matter but they're that detrimental to my enjoyment that I have to point them out.The worst part of this isn't the characters themselves. It's that none of this needed to happen. Neko and Fake Masamune are unnecessary bloatware. They are solutions in need of a problem. They're supposed to serve as reasons for Masamune to strive to go forward and to block his path. To give him challenges.But he never needed any challenge. In fact the challenge itself should have been dealing with his feelings while also dealing with revenge. IT's clear the author wanted Masamune to like Aki and for him to end up with Aki. And that is fine. That works. But the problem is the whole series is set up with this craving for revenge in the background, but it never happens. The issues were all right there from the start. Aki has to deal with her feelings but also deal with her hurt feelings from prior. Masamune would have to deal with his revenge but also his growing love. The opportunity to make a great romcom was sitting right there, lying in the premise. They could have both hurt each other find out that they really did love each other and then try to grow from the misdeeds that they did in the past. That would be been amazing.But sadly we didn't get anything like that. We didn't get any revenge, or any closure, or even anything resembling a cohesive story. Instead, the revenge got delayed farther and farther while time got wasted on Neko and Fake Masamune. And we didn't even get a complete ending or even something resembling an ending in the end.... I was always afraid of this show becoming Nisekoi II. I thought that Aki with her Chitoge like traits would become the new show ruiner for me, but surprisingly Aki was fine. I still dislike her but it's not her fault for ruining this show. Instead, it's the author's' for adding in all these terrible ideas stolen from a terrible show. I never thought this show would be just as bad as Nisekoi, no matter how much I feared it. But it was.2/10(At least Kojuurou was cute.) it during the season.And that is the last good thing I have to say about this horrible trainwreck of a show.This show was always going to depend on how well they handled the premise.

Now, bear with me here.Although people dislike it around the last parts, this anime cant be denied how well crafted it was performed.Besides having the newest animations, music, and characters that resemble your anime favorites, this show ties together both HUMOR and drama in a way that is rarely shown.My god, this anime's romance-struggle was a real cliff hanger, and it only gets better with the plot twist. Truly a fun and thought provoking anime about love.Although Masamune no Kun Revenge was done before the manga ended, and with its...standard 12 episode series, this anime still holds a place in my heart for how satisfying it was to watch, even if it left us with a few questions.I say, not every anime should be allowed to give us all we want. The other movie[ Byousoku 5 Centimeter] taught us that not all things in the real world get resolved.This anime deserves to be watched. The enjoyment outweighs your stubborn flaws. standard 12 episode series, this anime still holds a place in my heart for how satisfying it was to watch, even if it left us with a few questions.I say, not every anime should be allowed to give us all we want.

The problem that some of you may dislikes may be due to the typical and cliche characters in the show, including male trap, loli with big boobs, loli mom, random girls flocking onto our MC for some reason, annoying Tsundere MC (well this one is alot more stubborn than those out there), girl who eat hella alot but still doesn't get fat, side character that lack a story or personality to go in depth with (making them look sorta like...weak and conveniently used character to move the plot forward, they just feels like an AI tbh) and so forth. Even so, the story make remind you of that anime where a fat girl get turn into a beauty just because she was on a diet, and 5 hot or cute men would flocks towards her, and try to at least get into a relationship with her. But the story is pretty original as far as i'm concerned, and that's what makes this anime interesting to watch. While trying to see what would happen in the very end of the story.All the aside though, the music is incredible for an anime such as this, the art is substantially appealing and consistent; however, the drama and the development in the story of those dramatic moment or romances was done pretty crudely, or as if forced as well. But if you do truly enjoy watching this, then that's cool, I somewhat enjoy it as well. But not to the point where I could rewatch the entire thing, while knowing the writing structure, the plot and such. weak and conveniently used character to move the plot forward, they just feels like an AI tbh) and so forth.

What if you planned what you were going to do since you were a very little child, working overly hard to become a very popular handsome/beautiful person to where the other person wouldn’t recognize you? This is sort of the premise of this show and I have to say that I am a little disappointed. With how short the show is, we are barely given any information on what exactly happened to make our main character, Masamune, want to seek revenge outside the idea that she called him...a ‘Pig’s Foot’ because of his looks and weight when he was just a child. We are given a hint there is more to the story then what we are told but never given a answer to our question. Let’s break down the show a little bit.The characters seem to be rather typical in personality although it was sort of a nice change having our main character be more narcissistic. Masamune is mostly a one beat character, very obsessed with his looks and the revenge he wanted to exact on Aki. While he does show signs of being kind and caring, I found I had a hard time liking him. I myself was teased for my weight but his revenge plan seems as though it would be way too harsh for a woman. His plan was to make her fall in love with him, then ditch her. His plan doesn’t even change when he finds that she doesn’t trust any guy out there, he doesn’t even question why she can’t trust them. This goes again into my past and people trying to use me for things only to suddenly turn on me. Because of that, I’m pretty annoyed when revenge is based on someone’s emotions. As the anime went on, I did start to see his own charms but the show wasn’t long enough for me to actually love him as a main character.While I did not like Masamune much, I had a similar feeling for Aki being a rather stuck up rich girl. There have been other stuck up rich girls in anime who’s personality was similar to this tsundere princess but the anime didn’t give me much reason to understand why she was like that. They spent so much time on Masamune and how he was trying to get revenge that when we got to a point that we were starting to understand Aki, we didn’t have much time. It’s only a 12 episode show and definitely did not have enough focus on who should have been our main female lead while other background characters seemed to get most of the screen time for their backgrounds.The animation is pretty good but very basic. If you look at any other anime that came out around the time this one did, you will find that came out in 2017 this year, it just looks very similar to every other show. Bright colors, clean lines, similar drawing styles for the faces and so on. I don’t really have much to talk about with the animation; it’s basically like any other Romantic Comedy. I do have to bring one thing up though, what is with making the best friend a girly looking guy in these sometimes? I kept looking at Masamune’s best friend, Kojuro, and I kept asking myself if he was actually a guy. They designed him rather girly which I do understand is one of the jokes of the show, but did nothing for the plot. Maybe if they do a second season, we can understand him better but as it was, it was only a strange side thing that felt like fan service for yaoi fans.The voice acting is pretty good with most of the characters voiced by Funimations’s super stars. Monica Rial has played characters in 27 other shows (as of this review and the list on Wiki) during 2017 and this was one of them. While I am glad she was acting as more of a supporting role to the two who should have been out mains, her delivery of her lines made Yoshino Koiwai sound more like a robot then a human which made me roll my eyes. Josh Grelle voiced Masamune and gave a rather good self centered delivery of lines and Morgan Garrett as Aki gave a good stuck up voice but as I couldn’t feel for the characters as much as I wanted to because of their lack of drive, I found myself thinking they were pretty generic.So what did I think of this show? Basic. It’s good if you want to watch the present triumphs and fails of the characters but it definitely does not spend enough time giving any sort of background to them more makes you feel much for whom we should be rooting for. The anime is just way too short to give us any sort of ending (probably because the manga isn’t even finished) nor does it give us enough time to understand exactly what happened between Masamune and Aki. With no second season that I have heard about coming in the near future, we are given an ending that says ‘read the manga for the answer’ and I have always hated that. Lots of manga based anime that do the whole read the manga ending don’t actually have a manga that is easy to find translated or even outside of Japan. I searched forever for the Ghost Hunt manga to give me an ending and answers I wanted. If you're fine with open endings then it's okay to watch or if you're already a fan of the manga but if not, you would be better off reading the manga I think. a ‘Pig’s Foot’ because of his looks and weight when he was just a child.

It\'s really hard to describe exactly what I think about this series and why I disliked it as much as I did mostly because it seems like the show itself wasn\'t sure what it wants to do and what it\'s trying to be. It is consistently inconsistent about everything. From the extremely generic and unlikeable characters, a story that is all over the place and extremely cringy and just plain dumb interactions between the characters to a plot that focuses on all the wrong things, this anime was honestly hard to watch....But having said that, there were some moments that, while felt completely out of place, were entertaining to watch. And this inconsistency was the thing that infuriated me the most. Seeing an anime like this, that has glimpses of potential in some scenes which are then quickly ruined by stupid, cringe-worthy writing, idiotic character dialogue and stupid decisions of the MC. As I\'m writing this review I\'m still trying to wrap my head around what the fuck have I just watched and why have I watched it.I\'ll just start with the plot. The story follows an extremely cringy and shy gym rat called Masamune as he tries to take revenge on a girl that rejected him several years ago. His main objective is to get her to fall in love with him and when she finally reveals her feelings, to dump her in the harshest way possible just like she once did to him. Now before I start ripping this anime apart I do have to commend them for one thing they did right and that is the idea itself. Among all the anime I have seen until now and all others I have at least heard of, there are no other shows with a plot quite like this one. The idea is really original and sounds like it would be really entertaining to watch. It was actually the thing that motivated me to watch this show in the first place. But sadly poor writing, sub-par character-building and design and a perfunctory effort to create the show in the first placecompletely ruined that amazing idea. For the sake of not making this review too long, I\'ll only list off a few main problems I had with the plot. Firstly the inconsistency of Masamune\'s determination really got on my nerves. You would think a guy who was plotting his revenge plan for years, sacrificing thousands of hours of his life for exercise simply to become hot, would have at least planned something for the interaction with the victim of his revenge, read some dating tips, thought of at least a few lies to achieve his goal. Nope, he did none of that, all he did was gain some muscle and when it came to any social interaction, he would fail miserably. I have never felt such cringe watching a show in my life. Practically every single interaction Masamune had with another human being is worth the cringe hall of fame, my dude would see a person and freeze for twenty seconds thinking of how to say hi. My man was so shy he barely managed to answer a phone call simply because a female was calling him. I can\'t think of a single conversation Masamune had with a girl, that went by without him talking to himself in his mind for a straight minute, him getting completely stunned or flustered and not knowing what to answer or trying to act cool in the cringiest way possible. This got a little better as the series progressed but it never fully went away. Secondly and probably the biggest letdown in the plot department was the ending. To say it was just underwhelming would be a huge understatement. The whole ending felt almost like going back to square one. Barely any progress in Masamune\'s plan was done and no plot points were ever completed. The revenge was never executed, the so-called villain that was introduced near the end of the series was never dealt with which made it many times more unsatisfying and all the viewers got was one kiss between the main characters that ultimately lead to nothing. And the last big issue I had with the plot was how the writers would just forget really important details that were shown. For example in one of the episodes, Masamune asks Aki (his revenge victim and the other mc of the show) an extremely important question that should have been the most important moment in the series and it was supposed to reveal the whole plan to her and the truth would finally surface, but no, Masamune just ran off right after asking it and that question never got brought up again and everyone just forgot that something so important just happened. Aki didn\'t even try to figure out what he said or meant, simply forgot that ever happened. If you can\'t tell already I\'m furious at this anime for having such an amazing idea and completely ruining it.As for the characters I don\'t have as many complaints as I do for the plot, mainly because they are all generic and plain annoying. So there is never much to say about characters like these. If seeing the MC on screen makes the viewer cringe, you probably did something wrong. I liked almost every side character way more than I did the lead protagonist. Even the cruel princess Aki was way less annoying and more loveable than Masamune even tho she was supposed to be somewhat of an antagonist. I can get around the childishness of Masamune\'s plan since childhood trauma does sometimes impact a person in a very bad way and leads them to such decisions, but I can\'t excuse his lack of basic communicational skills, his unjustified cowardness and straight-up lack of brain cells. Not only his plan is childish but he acts like one as well. As for the rest of the characters, I actually liked Neko and Yoshino. Neko is a girl who fell in love with Masamune and did everything she could to make those feelings mutual but our dear thick-skulled MC coldly rejected her. In my opinion, she is a much better choice than Aki could ever be, and is way more entertaining to watch, but alas she gets tossed aside and becomes a sidekick for Masamune\'s great plan. Yoshino is a glorified slave of Aki and follows her every command, but decides to help Masamune with his revenge plan at the same time. And she doesn\'t just help, she basically does everything for him, without her this anime wouldn\'t exist. She is the main person driving the plot forward and practically the only character who is actually smart has a deeper personality and makes good decisions. And yet again she would be a much better candidate for the MC\'s love interest than Aki. To be honest, these two characters carried the whole show, since without them we would be left with a childish lead that is a complete idiot, his sadistic mega tsundere love interest, a guy whose only character trait is that he looks like a girl, so basically a trap, Masamune\'s overprotective mother, who for some reason looks 6 years old and a bunch of non-important side characters that never really do anything worth mentioning. Gasou was also a great addition to the roster of garbage characters. His only use as a character was to move the plot forward and create some unnecessary drama since Masamune clearly couldn\'t do anything himself and needed a push, but even that didn\'t help. Even after introducing a ""villain"" for him to beat he was still as useless as ever so the whole existence of Gasou was pointless.Besides the plot and the characters, I didn\'t really have a big problem with anything else. The art was decent, something you would expect from an ordinary rom-com anime, nothing amazing, but not horrible as well. The character designs were quite good, everyone apart from the MC had quite an original design. Although the MC himself was as cliche as they come. The sound design was also average, nothing bad to point out, but nothing grand either.  And finally, the soundtrack and the OP were also extremely average, I personally listened to the OP twice and skipped it every other time.This anime had an amazing opportunity to be great for its original and interesting idea which was sadly tarnished by awful writing, bucket loads of cliches, an incredibly annoying MC and its baffling inconsistency. It\'s truly depressing to see such a good idea wasted in such an infuriating way and what makes it even worse is that it\'s not all bad, the show had a few good moments and a couple of decent characters that could have been amazing but sadly got overshadowed by the dumpster fire that was the rest of the show and the other characters.Welp all I can do now is cry myself to sleep knowing I have wasted five more hours of my life watching a bad anime and cry even more for all the wasted potential this show had.I give Masamune\'s revenge a 4/10That\'s the end of my TedTalk, hope you enjoyed. But having said that, there were some moments that, while felt completely out of place, were entertaining to watch. And this inconsistency was the thing that infuriated me the most. Seeing an anime like this, that has glimpses of potential in some scenes which are then quickly ruined by stupid, cringe-worthy writing, idiotic character dialogue and stupid decisions of the MC.

Neko is a girl who fell in love with Masamune and did everything she could to make those feelings mutual but our dear thick-skulled MC coldly rejected her. In my opinion, she is a much better choice than Aki could ever be, and is way more entertaining to watch, but alas she gets tossed aside and becomes a sidekick for Masamune\'s great plan. Yoshino is a glorified slave of Aki and follows her every command, but decides to help Masamune with his revenge plan at the same time. And she doesn\'t just help, she basically does everything for him, without her this anime wouldn\'t exist. She is the main person driving the plot forward and practically the only character who is actually smart has a deeper personality and makes good decisions. And yet again she would be a much better candidate for the MC\'s love interest than Aki. To be honest, these two characters carried the whole show, since without them we would be left with a childish lead that is a complete idiot, his sadistic mega tsundere love interest, a guy whose only character trait is that he looks like a girl, so basically a trap, Masamune\'s overprotective mother, who for some reason looks 6 years old and a bunch of non-important side characters that never really do anything worth mentioning. Gasou was also a great addition to the roster of garbage characters. His only use as a character was to move the plot forward and create some unnecessary drama since Masamune clearly couldn\'t do anything himself and needed a push, but even that didn\'t help. Even after introducing a ""villain"" for him to beat he was still as useless as ever so the whole existence of Gasou was pointless.Besides the plot and the characters, I didn\'t really have a big problem with anything else. The art was decent, something you would expect from an ordinary rom-com anime, nothing amazing, but not horrible as well. The character designs were quite good, everyone apart from the MC had quite an original design. Although the MC himself was as cliche as they come. The sound design was also average, nothing bad to point out, but nothing grand either.  And finally, the soundtrack and the OP were also extremely average, I personally listened to the OP twice and skipped it every other time.This anime had an amazing opportunity to be great for its original and interesting idea which was sadly tarnished by awful writing, bucket loads of cliches, an incredibly annoying MC and its baffling inconsistency. It\'s truly depressing to see such a good idea wasted in such an infuriating way and what makes it even worse is that it\'s not all bad, the show had a few good moments and a couple of decent characters that could have been amazing but sadly got overshadowed by the dumpster fire that was the rest of the show and the other characters.Welp all I can do now is cry myself to sleep knowing I have wasted five more hours of my life watching a bad anime and cry even more for all the wasted potential this show had.I give Masamune\'s revenge a 4/10That\'s the end of my TedTalk, hope you enjoyed.', 'So... I agree with everyone here, This anime was all fun and shit until that Fat guy arrived, he had nothing to do here.I hated 10th episode, and the Constancy of  the ""main heroine"" feelings.First you hate him, Then you love him, Then You hate him, Then you ignore him, Then you fall in love with another guy, Then you love him again, IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE!All apart, something i wanted to add, its that the music, THE MUSIC WAS INSANELY GOOD! I LOVED IT! And the character & Stage design was good too, the ART of this anime was amazing, too bad it...was wasted on this show. was wasted on this show.', ""I don't know why something so crappy exists in the first place. In my opinion, the anime could have had a good ending, but it's not nice that they ended so badly to make season 2.Spoilers!!!At first, Masamune was going to very calmly take revenge by making Adagaki fall in love with him and rejecting her, which was different, and I thought it was worth watching. But then gradually I started to like Adagaki and I said I hope they change the plan and they get together. Then someone named Neko came along. At first I didn't like the girl because I thought she'd be...among Masamune and Adagaki, but it didn't happen. I was very surprised after I learned that the girl was sick. I wouldn't be lying if I said I fell in love with the girl, she definitely deserved to be with Masamune. THEN A FAT BOY CAME AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS MASAMUNE AND ADAGAKI FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. Where did you see such logic, what brainless person wrote such a script, why did he write it, I don't understand, it's not funny. Adagaki started ignoring Masamune (mc). This incident probably made everyone angry, because it was pretty annoying when a fat boy(i'm not discriminating idc if you're fat it's your opinion) came and talked to Adagaki while she was thinking about Masamune(mc). I know I've extended it a lot, but it's a little short for an anime that is this crap. I still don't understand, I still think, why did they make such a crappy ending to an anime that was going to be great. Sorry for those who love this anime, but fuck your taste. I don't want to say much before the 2nd season comes, but let's call it a hassle. I couldn't sleep because I finished the anime at night, I'm writing this comment at school anyway. Don't watch this anime if you're smart. This anime does not deserve more than 2 points.

No anyone of them actually has a real personality and they feel like dolls.

No, it's more akin to a shallow kiddie pool. It's a rom-com, through and through, brimming with the usual suspects—clichéd characters, plots, and narratives.Picture this: it's a quintessential Harem anime featuring a formerly overweight protagonist who, after an extensive workout regimen, metamorphoses into a physically appealing figure. His mission? A rendezvous with revenge. Specifically, on a girl who once mocked his corpulent self when he harbored a crush on her.Sure, there are instances of endearing charm, episodes that evoke...a chuckle or two—exactly as the creators intended. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking it's a masterclass in profound storytelling. Yet, amidst a season where options were rather scant, this one shone as a pleasantly enjoyable distraction.An edit, if you will: Season 2—brace yourselves—elevates this anime to a whole new level. It's not just good; it's downright spectacular. It's the upgrade this series desperately needed, propelling it from the realms of mundane to the heights of magnificence. a chuckle or two—exactly as the creators intended.

It's not just good; it's downright spectacular. It's the upgrade this series desperately needed, propelling it from the realms of mundane to the heights of magnificence."", 'Masamune-kun no Revenge, also known as Masamune-kun\'s Revenge, is an anime that focuses around our protagonist named Makabe Masamune and his attempts to win Adagaki Aki\'s heart with the intent on rejecting her once she\'s fallen for him, hence the title being ""Masamune-kun\'s Revenge"".Now yes, our protagonist does have the intent of crushing a girl\'s heart but he has reasoning behind his actions.  In the past Makabe Masamune has been hurt by Adagaki Aki when they were children and he works towards winning her over now that they are older by being muscular, handsome, studious, and everything you\'d want in a guy....He and Adagaki Aki\'s maid, Koiwai Yoshino, believe that Adagaki Aki thinks too highly of herself and needs a taste of her own medicine.Now that the summary is over lets break down this review into sections for you:Story  -  The plot of Masamune-kun no Revenge is quite original in my opinion, however I do believe it could have been executed better in many areas.  This anime does have the occasional clichés you\'d expect to see in a romance comedy and some areas of the story have been seen and done before, but that being said it doesn\'t mean this anime was bad.  I found the plot to be interesting as well somewhat unique and I did enjoy watching the characters interact with each other and develop the story further, the only downside was that this anime ended a bit abruptly and leaves the viewer wanting more because the story didn\'t feel finished.Art  -  The art style for this anime was very pleasant and easy to look at, characters were well drawn and animation wasn\'t choppy, and the backgrounds were well executed.  All in all, there was nothing in particular wrong with this anime visually.Sound  -  The audio present in Masamune-kun no Revenge revealed no issues.  Voice acting was well done and both the opening and ending song were catchy and pleasant to listen to.  Background music blended in well with scenes and conveyed the feel and mood of what was going on as well.Characters  -  Characters for the most part were very diverse design wise and thought out well too.  Even though the characters were planned on being unique, they did have many cliché personalities stuck onto them.  This wasn\'t too much of an issue though because although they can be labeled for what the base of their personality is, the creator did also give characters quirks about them that still made them appealing to the viewer.  For the most part most characters were likeable.Enjoyment  -  After finishing this anime and looking back on it, I can say that I have enjoyed it and had no hesitation to keep watching nor did I feel bored with it, in fact I looked forward to finishing it.  The only major issue I have with this anime is how it ended.  The ending deserved more or at least a season two because the story feels incomplete.  Around halfway through the anime it seemed as though the story was making lots of progress at a good pace, but it never did reach it\'s potential.Overall, Masamune-kun no Revenge was interesting to watch due to its unique plot for its genre and the fact that it stayed being somewhat original throughout the season.  If you enjoy romance anime I would suggest watching this, however do keep in mind that this anime does end leaving many with the feeling that more should have happened, but don\'t let that deter you because in the end Masamune-kun no Revenge was an interesting anime and I do hope for a season two so I can continue to watch this story go on and I\'m sure after watching this you will probably be left with similar feelings.Enjoy the anime if you plan on watching it, and thank you for reading!

now it\'s a guy trying to get a girl out of revenge. now that\'s something not seen that much....however what it has for an interesting premise; it lacks for the actual content the show has. it\'s a show that doesn\'t try to distance itself from it\'s tropes and cliches, but tries to use them in an interesting way yet in the end fall for the same traps that made them unsatisfactory in the first place.it still goes through the same motions of a rom-com, since even though it\'s about revenge it\'s still about how to get miss popular,  then there\'s the love-rival, the beach episode, and the school festival/play for that icing on top. in the end nothing is resolved and in the end very little happened, second season or not the conclusion for the anime was disappointing.all the characters in the show are flat and two/one-dimensional, with each fitting their respective arch-types and not much else, although i would give them that they did a little more for our main guy and gal. the main character Makabe is a narcissist out for revenge, but also has a past he\'d like to keep hidden and that\'s about it. the main girl Aki is a hime/tsundere with a eating habit and guilt about her past, and that\'s about it.there\'s also Aki\'s maid that was bullied by her and because of that conspires with Makabe, but i wouldn\'t say she\'s overflowing with personlaity and feels more like a plot device to get things going. than for the rest there\'s the class rep just cuz, the guy that looks like a girl,  the sickly pretty girl, some bullshit love rival and Aki\'s entourage but aren\'t worth noting for each. there\'s little development character or plot wise other than the introduction of more characters, and everyone remains the same.in terms of art/animation it all feels same at this point. there\'s not much that makes this show stand out from the rest. the color pallet, and the lighting feel like something i have seen a hundred times over. the animation is decent , but than again there\'s not a lot of movement going on. the character designs aren\'t interesting and the comedic scenes with differing art style don\'t cut it much.the ost as pretty good surprisingly if you bother to give a listen, but since it\'s in this show it now feels like a tragedy. the voice acting is okay i guess. however those sfx for those comedic bits do get annoying pretty fastcouldn\'t care less i knew i was in for disappointment , and that\'s exactly what i got. no moments to rule an exception, no one interesting character to rule out an exception. just dullness through and throughoverall- the writing isn\'t that good even with the ""effort"" they put in and the art and sound are good enough even if generic however what it has for an interesting premise;

Or what I consider a pale imitation of Nisekoi, but instead of having a fake relationship, there is a revenge story between the male and female MCs. In a few words, this anime is trash and it is not worth your time. But, with a greater analysis...Story: 1.0/10Well, I have to admit that Nisekoi's story also is kind of shit, but just watching the chemistry between the characters was a little bit endearing. In M-knR, there is not something like that and the plot is just mind-numbing forced melodrama. I also cannot understand why he would become even more terrible of...a person just to take his revenge. Even if he got his revenge, none would ever like him anymore because he is a major jerk.  As far as originality goes, this show has none.And now to the icing of this disgusting cake:Characters: 0.2/10Let me show you what I think of each character:-Masamune Makabe: A huge narcissistic jerk that I hope he gets karmic retribution. (If you saw Episode 8, you will know what I mean).-Aki Adagaki (aka The Wicked Witch of the Show): A run of the mill tsundere who is just the unlikeable aspects of Chitoge (Nisekoi) in one person. Chitoge's mannerisms could be slightly justified because she is forced in a situation she hates to be in and she had difficulties during her childhood which is explained later in the anime. But Aki is just a cold, spoiled, savage c*** who is clearly a nasty person that you must stay away from as much as you can.-Yoshino Kowai (the Master): The person that helps the main protagonist who is completely apathetic and feels nothing about him. Basically, Kosaki Onodera's friend from Nisekoi, but with a kawaii upgrade and a stone-faced mask.-Neko Fujinomiya: An exact copy of Marika Tachibana from Nisekoi. Basically, a beautiful and polite girl whose kindness is just a facade since she suffers from an illness and knew the main protagonist from her childhood. Even though I hated Marika from Nisekoi as much as I do not like Neko, she is actually the character that I dislike the least. Go figure!-Tae Futaba (aka The Stereotype of the Class Rep): Kosaki Onodera but without a soul. She is just a walking trope with no character.-Kojuurou Shuri: A pale unmemorable imitation of Hideyoshi from BakaTest. Just your typical trap.-Masamune's mom: Why a loli mom? Only in Anime!Overall, none of these characters is at least likable because either they are horrible persons or they are copies of characters already seen and done better in other shows. However, I feel a little empathy for Neko since she holds such a stance in her life even though she is sick.Art/Animation: 6.7/10I will admit that the art is actually fair to a certain extent, but it is generic as hell. And that sums up my thoughts about the animation.Sound: 5/10I did not like the op and the ost. The op was so annoying to listen to and the ost is as standard as it gets. The ed is not bad but it is unmemorable.Enjoyment: 0.5/10It is true that at the beginning I thought this show might actually be interesting but in the way of guilty pleasure. But after episode 4, it fails at even being that.Overall: 2.68/10My recommendation is to avoid it. But if you get into this show, suit yourself. What I know is that this show is just deplorable for existing and it is yet another proof that anime quality has declined throughout the years. Off to the trash can!Alternative Recommendations:-Nisekoi for doing this formula better in every way, although being the same sh*t.-Trinity Seven for a way more interesting lead and with no Ice Queens. a person just to take his revenge.

Also, introducing a brand new ""alter ego-fatassmune"" character in the last few episodes.... How original! Hmm a doppelganger introduced to throw a wrench in the protagonists plan! That isn\'t the laziest run-of-the-mill harem anime implementation ever or anything.

Seeing as it was made by Silver Link, which has been known for some consistent entertainment with their school anime (Kokoro Connect, Baka and Test, Watamote, Tanaka-kun is Always Listless and others) everyone quickly picked it up after craving for another classic, clean romance. A word about a decent first episode started spreading around and even more users picked it up.But this review isn\'t really about all that, it\'s about what I think of it. So let\'s jump right into it....*Slight spoilers warning*Everything started off better than I could expect, the main character was a guy that actually worked out every day and studied to the point of becoming the best on his entrance exams. As he walked alongside the tennis court with his phone out, all the girls expressed how much would they like it if he took the photos of their underwear. It made sense, Masamune was presented as the hottest and smartest guy around. It was a clear message to the viewer, all girls in the world should want that piece of ass. We don\'t see that often enough in anime romances. They didn\'t stop there though. There\'s a reason why he tried so hard, why he put himself through inhuman training in the mountains a goal that let him study day after day, a dream that pushed him to his absolute limits.HE WANTED TO CUCK THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE GIRL WHO FAT SHAMED HIM WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE OBESE PIG.(Disclaimer: It\'s the show\'s fault, not mine)And still, that\'s not all. The girl who he wanted to cuck, was Aki Adagaki - the omega bitch, the tsundere that is able to send  all affection she receives flying in a way that will destroy someone\'s life. She gives all the rejected guys awful nicknames and she does it in the most ridiculous way she can come up with. In the first episode alone, after sending one of her underlings to do a background check, she reveals to the entire school that the guy who confessed love to her has weird fetishes and rolls down a huge scroll with a nickname from the top of the school roof.Now that\'s quite the beginning to a story isn\'t it? All of that happens in the first 5 minutes of the show. The more it went on, the more harem tropes it blew out of proportion. That\'s exactly why the expectations for it were skewed. You see, this show isn\'t a parody of the harem genre, nor is it one of the romance genre, nor is a parody at all. It turned out to be only a romance, with the unique spin being that everyone is a walking stereotype multiplied by ten.That didn\'t bring down my spirit though, I don\'t mind cliches and stereotypes as long as they\'re done well, so I continued with good faith, and wouldn\'t you know, the comedy got better, the ideas and the execution were still providing new sources of absurdity, the dialogues were quite funny and my happiness was on the rise. It provided solid entertainment without major flaws, but with no big positives as well.However, just as every other series, it had to hit a rough patch at one point, but  unfortunately, unlike some, it wasn\'t able to pick itself up from the falls it made. Every major event felt inconsequential, story progressed and regressed through the span of one episode. It wasn\'t long until I realized that the only ones getting cucked in this show were going to be Masamune and me, because this show is going nowhere with its main plot points. Masamune pushed to get Aki to fall for him, but then something came up and she hated him again. He got close to a romantic moment, but then something was misinterpreted and it all went back to square one. Even when everything went right according to the plan, no progress was made, every character acted the same way towards each other, the only places where something would change were the supposedly serious scenes that often got interrupted so nothing could ever go down.Was this the show\'s plan all along? Is this entire experience supposed to teach the viewer that cucking is wrong and it hurts? Was the lack of progression intended, so it could make me feel this way? Who knows! I just know that I\'ve had enough for now. This story provided a clear example of how to annoy me with the persistent lack of any sort of progression in the behavior of the main couple. Even if their feelings changed, that doesn\'t help to fill the void it leaves me with. This show is full of dialogues, monologues. It doesn\'t leave a lot of empty places where one character could sit around and just think about her situation. All I could do is speculate whether something really did change, but in the end I realized that even if it did, it didn\'t help the show\'s flow and pacing feel less empty.Now don\'t get me wrong, there were fun moments where the cast got into amusing situations, several unexpected plot twists and mysteries going on in the background, most of which thankfully got resolved in a respectable way. As mentioned before, it threw many characters and multiple themes to feed my brain. I never felt bored while watching an episode, but upon finishing, I was left scratching my head thinking about the main point of the series and how it once again didn\'t go anywhere. I\'m fine with a lot of side stories, but Masamune-kun\'s Revenge lost itself in all of them. It sidetracked me from what was supposed to be a story about understanding revenge and long lost love. None of those stories provided any motive for that purpose. It was like some other anime just barged in to steal Masamune into its own world, like all the girls could only dream about.To be fair, some episodes contained more substance than others, the slice of life breathers helped the character\'s interact more casually than at any other point in the show, some even brought back the overblown motives and that was pretty fun, but all that was still just filling in the spot of all the things that I liked about it in the beginning. Everything was just a distraction that used the characters who show bits of romantic interest. Nothing connected to anything. while there were places where it felt like it\'s back on track again, it always turned out that it\'s just a beginning of another arc.In conclusion, the main premise of Masamune-kun\'s Revenge got pushed away too far to make me care about it. What I got instead is a bunch of stories, some more solid, some less solid, but everything felt wrong because it missed the points it tried to make at first, not to mention it being rushed towards the end, unfinished and bland.I\'m not mad, I\'m just disappointed.The characters could be split into groups, where one would be the Masamune\'s main harem, the second one would be Masamune\'s side harem that tries to not be a harem but it is, the third one would be Adagaki\'s harem, and the individual characters like Masamune, Aki and some very minor ones are ungrouped.What I expected out of the main character, Makabe Masamune, is to be the deconstruction of the ""harem MC"", because in the first episode he was aware of the feelings of the girls he met, all of them except the specific ones. He praised himself and felt proud about the state he\'s currently in. Hell, the entire idea of the show was supposed to be based around him dominating the relationship and then dropping the girl he was trying to get at the worst possible moment! But no! He doesn\'t do any of that! He gets pushed around by another characters, he gets into a group of ""friends"" that consist of the girls that want/wanted to be with him and one trap, he fails to realize some people\'s feelings for him and whenever he tried to do something himself, he either ultimately chickened out or got interrupted. All that\'s because he\'s actually not the guy he seemed to be. He wasn\'t a popular guy before, so he\'s still antisocial on the inside, after all it\'s his first year being the hot guy. He gets all his  knowledge from shoujo manga, which would explain his initial behavior and the the cheesy, typical hot guy lines he nonchalantly throws around. It turns out he\'s just a muscular otaku who has no experience talking to girls and he begins to spend time with them.Oh goodie!I\'m not mad because he isn\'t a deconstruction, I\'m not like that and I was surprised and excited for the idea of him secretly being someone else, but his best moments are the ones where he tries to be the perfect guy and throws those cheesy lines around, at least for me. Despite that, every time he gets confident and actually tries harder, when he seems like he\'ll start changing and developing, he regresses back into his original, otaku-like self. His character doesn\'t go anywhere, even by the end when some major complications come up, he still acts the same way, pretending to be someone who he never became in the first place. It isn\'t played for the jokes or anything at all actually, all the special moments between him and Aki are just that - the circle of nothingness.Speaking of Aki and her relationship with Masamune, it was really weird. I don\'t understand why would it be done like this. The Omega Bitch does exactly what she wants, sometimes with dubious reasoning and sometimes with none. She just hates men, but when Masamune does something she always blushes. It\'s giving this feeling of some kind of progression in their relationship, but then she pushes him away completely next episode. This continues throughout the entire run of the show. The way they interact with each other is so random and all over the place that it might as well have been a shonen rivalry for all I care. It certainly felt that way.Later on we start to see more of Adagaki\'s sidekick who decided to pretty much play a prank on her to bash reality into her head, which should be interesting and it was, but she got pushed back and forth, working in the background or in the front, wasn\'t really consistent, she pulled off just as many random decisions as the other characters. I like her because she feels like she can from a different setting and it surprisingly didn\'t affect anything negatively, but the show doesn\'t know how to handle its characters for a viewer like me to care.Oh, and there\'s also Neko, that best girl candidate that hops on Masamune\'s biceps around the middle of the show. She had a good arc thematically, but the execution was once again snatchy, but it threw bits and pieces of it around to hint at certain things and it actually had a conclusion, which was solid. She definitely brought out one of the best parts of the series out and she had a lot going for her. I do think about her character in a positive light, not a very strong one, but noticeable enough to get me through the dark tunnel that this show was in the end.Despite the likable side cast with their goofy, strong moments, the cast overall fails at doing anything well. Nobody had the potential to make this anime great ever since episode two or so. The writing is inconsistent and yet never great, the dialogues are always plain and sometimes cheesy, the romantic touches didn\'t even exist. There was nothing good about the interactions. Everything felt like it was done just to get it through, like not much effort went into it. It\'s like the romantic comedy level of writing.The art wasn\'t particularly great. While the close ups are solid, the character designs are well done and tidy, I don\'t like the mushy color pallet which consists of either too many shades of blue or too many shades of red and orange, with the occasional green mixed in. It\'s a bit too simplistic for me and it wouldn\'t be a problem if the art style looked better on its own. Not to mention the awful looking zoomed out shots, which were a very noticeable huge gaps in comparison to the standard look of the rest of the show, which wasn\'t that good to begin with.The animation is passable. Lots of still shots and sever lack of movement in the backgrounds when other people appear in it. It isn\'t something that bugged me constantly throughout the series, but sometimes when it happens it stands out. I like the use of the shaky camera, even if it isn\'t something special it adds something to look out for here and there, and it doesn\'t make me sick like in some other series. On the other hand, the animation feels a bit choppy sometimes. There were numerous scenes where that was easily visible.I\'m simply indifferent about the art. I\'ve seen all those cons before done worse, and all those pros done better. I\'m okay with it.The music on the other hand, while technically not worse than the animation, was so bland and forgettable that it almost made the series boring on its own, especially in the later episodes. Usually when I finish an anime, even those that I didn\'t like, there are some tracks that stick in my mind, for better or worse. In Masamune kun no Revenge there were none. I guess the opening sounded nice and the ED was okay, but if someone would tell me to hum some music from this show right now, I would struggle to find anything.It doesn\'t fit the scenes well, it barely helps with setting the atmosphere, certain tracks repeat too often for my taste and so on. I can\'t rag on it too much, it really did nothing wrong, but for a romance to not have an emotional track or a solid, happy and catchy one for the slice of life moments, there must be something wrong with it. Or me. There\'s always that possibility.My personal thoughts on the show are pretty positive. While not the best, Masamune-kun\'s Revenge was a highlight of the season for me. It was easy to watch, entertaining, well paced, consistently funny with the well build up jokes that avoided feeling repetitive and the visual gags that kept me smirking throughout episodes, kept me interested and satisfied until the last arc and had some good, though not particularly memorable moments. As an experience it was solid, as a show that I would look back to, it failed.The important question is: Would I recommend this to anyone, and if so, to who?If you don\'t have anything planned, if you already watched all the other Silver Link school anime or simply don\'t feel like checking them out, if you just feel like watching a romance with a small harem, if you\'re still new on the genre or simply really want to watch this specifically, then yeah, I\'d say it\'s worth a shot. This is still a pretty broad statement, because I\'m pretty sure people from other groups could find something for themselves here as well.  It definitely had something going for it, there are several well thought out elements that some may find more enjoyable than others. I wouldn\'t go around telling people about this series, but if someone would stumble upon it, I\'d say they might as well check it out. Perhaps it\'s a series more fitted for other anime fans out there.To wrap it up in a few short sentences: To me Masamune-kun\'s Revenge is an okay beginners anime at best. The mass audience could certainly enjoy it, but for people who\'ve seen other things that they consider great, this might even feel offensive, as the flaws are certainly noticeable and will most likely influence their experience negatively. I found it enjoyable, but very flawed. Watch at your own risk, or at your own whim if that\'s what you want.As always, this is purely my opinion and I kinda recommend you to develop you own. *Slight spoilers warning*Everything started off better than I could expect, the main character was a guy that actually worked out every day and studied to the point of becoming the best on his entrance exams.

As an experience it was solid, as a show that I would look back to, it failed.The important question is: Would I recommend this to anyone, and if so, to who?If you don\'t have anything planned, if you already watched all the other Silver Link school anime or simply don\'t feel like checking them out, if you just feel like watching a romance with a small harem, if you\'re still new on the genre or simply really want to watch this specifically, then yeah, I\'d say it\'s worth a shot. This is still a pretty broad statement, because I\'m pretty sure people from other groups could find something for themselves here as well.  It definitely had something going for it, there are several well thought out elements that some may find more enjoyable than others. I wouldn\'t go around telling people about this series, but if someone would stumble upon it, I\'d say they might as well check it out. Perhaps it\'s a series more fitted for other anime fans out there.To wrap it up in a few short sentences: To me Masamune-kun\'s Revenge is an okay beginners anime at best. The mass audience could certainly enjoy it, but for people who\'ve seen other things that they consider great, this might even feel offensive, as the flaws are certainly noticeable and will most likely influence their experience negatively. I found it enjoyable, but very flawed. Watch at your own risk, or at your own whim if that\'s what you want.As always, this is purely my opinion and I kinda recommend you to develop you own.', ""The series ran quite almost perfectly at the first half.I enjoyed all of the episodes though but the thing is the revenge plot.It didn't feel that it will happen.The feeling that you will finally see his revenge.The plot felt like Makabe was really serious in falling in love with Aki.You wouldn't even sense the revenge plot anymore, instead it was almost serious romance.I loved how they put a comedy on it. It worked at least in some segments.Well wrapping up this short review.The story didn't pick up yet on what it is supposed to take. I still enjoyed it though because of the comedy.

Animation is awesome, characters looks perfect, scenes are great but anything it lacks is story. Don\'t get me wrong but it doesn\'t teach anything like other animes (I mean there is much of the learning in love too!). It doesn\'t co-relate with actual life and that\'s what many viewers don\'t like about ""Non-action, romantic type"" anime. Masamune don\'t have any friends, how is it possible? At least one should be there, everyone have. This one should have a funny guy who is the friend of Masamune and he falls in love with any of the ""girl-friends"" and watching...them, Masamune always rethink about revenge (Getting different views about love).Season 2 is not coming at least this year. If we see the quality : story ratio then i would say that the quality of anime is far better than the story-line, they put lot of money in animations and left some brains for the story-line.

It is, in essence, a harem, high school life, comedy, light romance show. It is the kind of show that would appeal to younger anime fans, especially those with less experience in knowing the tropes and cliches in the industry.Don\'t get me wrong. Just because an anime roots itself in a genre that can easily be seen as cliched does not mean it has to be so. My subjective opinions aside, there are definitely some good shows that I\'ve seen in the past in this genre that have some...unique aspects to them. However, Masamune is definitely not one of them. It does have a premise that has potential. As it turns out, though, the plot is more or less filled with tropes from the standard drama shows, of which plot development depends on. The eye-catching premise of ""revenge for childhood rejection"" is just another excuse to make the main romantic pairing, without going very deep.One of the things that this show suffers from is that it tries to adapt the entire source material so far in 12 episodes. While even the source story is not complex, adapting the whole thing in one season turned out to be not so great. The show starts off fine, but rushes through character relationship with other main heroines during the middle, only to abruptly sweep them aside as ""side characters"" to make way for the main heroine in the end. While this seems to be the standard adaptation practice for harem shows nowadays, it is still very bad for the story.What else is there to say? If you\'ve seen a dozen shows in this genre you can predict how the story is going to go. The artwork is vibrant and character design is quite nice, but there is no ""wow"" factor to be found in visuals. BGM and theme songs are typical JPOP. If you enjoy it, you would like the music. Obviously, songs vocalized by upstart seiyuus are nowhere near the levels of ""professional music"", as you would expect. I would not call the main characters flat, but their depth are quite far from being intricate. In fact, the main girl is the amalgam of two tropes: ojousama and tsundere. The protagonist is just... another male harem lead.All in all, Masamune is an above average harem show, but still deeply entrenched in cliches and tropes of the genre without its own quirks.

To accurately describe my frustration in regret after watching this series, I really delve into one fundamental question, ""was it bad""?Masamune Kun is exactly what you would expect it to be. A cliche plot that the teeters the line from being easily digestible filth to above average fanfare. If this show receives a lot of hate, it is not because it is low quality but mostly because...it is an easy target. The entire premise of a boy who loses weight and becomes obsessed with his image to get revenge on a girl is the most trite premise in history. Anime of this kind are meant to hit certain plot points and build to emotional crescendo\'s; that is the baseline understanding you need to have to enjoy this series. Which is asking more knowledge that the average viewer probably does not have. I think some people approach a series of this type and expect it to be more similar to Aku No Hana or Toradora. But here is your disclaimer, this show is just dumb entertainment, turn your brain off type entertainment.Everything in this show, with the exception of the writing, is just passable or bad. After having watched so many animes of this type, it is easy for me to see the inner workings of the writing. Masamune Kun has pretty lazy character writing. Characters are just meant to be window dressing. They either contribute absolutely nothing to the story, or do something really eccentric and wacky that either makes me laugh or skip to the next scene. Frankly, that is the way this show is structured, the mangaka throws something out there, hopes it is good; if not, well we have moved on to the next scene before you have even noticed.The only reason I am being a little lenient is because it was not a complete waste of my time. About halfway through there is a subplot that involves ""a mysterious transfer student""(Fujinomiya) that has a romantic interest in Masamune. From her introduction, to her rivalry with Aki. I was extremely skeptical of this character. However, I was pleasantly surprise. This character serves as a much needed foil to Masamune, who for all intents and purposes is a narcissistic manipulator. His entire identity is driven by this desire to be attractive, and his motivations for all of his actions are shrouded in dishonesty. On top of that he is a high schooler who does not understand this about himself. Where Fujinomiya is the polar opposite, her innocent love and genuine pursuit of him causes him to self reflect. These interactions were the bedrock of emotional depth that caused me to enjoy an otherwise lackluster high school comedy.In my opinion Masamune\'s biggest problem is that the source material is still unfinished. This show has twelve episodes and 11/12 episodes covered the bulk of content from the still in production manga. Although this is somewhat of a tangent, the last episode is the best example of how not to do a non-canon anime episode. They did not have anymore material to adapt in the twenty minute runtime, so what was their solution. ""Well let\'s just animate all the characters singing karaoke. "" I would actually go as far to say that the last episode was the worst of the entire series.Masamune had a fair bit of charm. The source material is good enough that it will not bore you. On the same end of that spectrum the characterization of this show takes a backseat to all of the boring details that the audience does not care about. There is scene after scene of Masamune working out, or Adagaki shoving her face full of food. The first time, the joke is funny. After the fifth or sixth time, the joke just becomes repetitive.I have a hard time recommending this show. I enjoyed it enough, especially from episode 6-8. The lack of any meaningful characterization and the repetitive nature of the show will probably lead most to drop the series before it manages to pick up steam. it is an easy target.

It has a unique idea but ultimately fails because of all the cliches.  Let me explain:The whole idea of revenge was promising, but, to be honest, it quickly became a typical tsundere romcom sort of thing. The whole ""getting rejected as a child"" backstory was pretty decent, but it could have been explored more. There were many moments that were sorta like filler, except that they were canon. The relationship progression is pretty slow and the whole plot with...the ""second guy"" was not actually finished. The ending felt like a cliff hanger to me, so I hope they make a second season. The side characters really dragged on the story, because no one really cared about them.The two main characters have a decent backstory but the show doesn\'t really bring it up very much. The MC Makabe was pretty unique, in my opinion,  because I haven\'t seen too many hot guys that were not experienced with relationships and had a toxic motive. The female MC, Aki, was a pretty generic tsundere that hated guys, but her motives are pretty unique. She has a weird fetish for a certain kind of person too....  Most of the characters are pretty bland and I could care less about them. Many of them are super annoying because they cause conflict within the story (too keep it going), but they just extend the length of the story. A few of the minor characters were into the gay/lesbian stuff, so If you don\'t like watching fujoshi characters shipping guys, you may be slightly annoyed.The art was pretty good and the characters looked great! I really liked the colourfulness and art style.The sound was pretty decent, with good voice actors/actresses and a good OP and ED. The background music was sorta boring and not really important.However, even though the anime isn\'t the most unique or has the best story, It was enjoyable to watch and one of the only anime that I kept up to date with. If you want a rom-com to watch, this should be on your list, albeit on the bottom of the list. If you want something new and unique with a great plot, you should look elsewhere.NOTE: Rating it a 5 means that overall, it was a positive experience watching the anime, but It lacked a story and had meh characters. I do not hate the anime, so don\'t message me saying ""OMG you suck because you hate my favourite anime!"" I liked it, but I didn\'t LOVE it.TL:DR : Had a promising idea, but ended up being a generic romcom. The story isn\'t finished yet, so I hope for a second season.

So what irritates me that cause this great anime to crash is that until episode 9 is very climatic and enjoyable then the next episodes are crap wherein the identity of this impostor is not revealed and the story goes on. Well I just found out Gasou's true identity in MAL.

Many plot lines were one and dones that don\'t actually go anywhere, and once we reached the last few episodes, it destroys all character development and a sucker punch to the face. The character are very unremarkable with very one dimensional personalties; even then, things that we thought to be true weren\'t. For instance, in the first episode, it was established how Aki used her high status/popularity to...defile certain people, however she never once used it on Masamune nor did she do anything to psychologically attack him. Other side characters, such as Neko, are just as plain and boring. Neko was shown as a happy go lucky girl who secretly turned out to be sick with a certain disease similar to- Your Lie In April, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, Clannad- but unlike these masterpieces it seemed like the build up was supposed to be a surprise and when the ""VERY SUDDEN REALIZATION"" was supposed to make you feel ""sad"", but no, instead the very next episode it turned out she was completely fine.However, despite the terrible characters and their boring subplots, it does not completely drag the anime through the mud. That\'s when the last 3-4 episodes come into to play; this one character completely destroyed this anime: The one and only Kanetsugu. I\'m not going to one of those kids that are mad about Kanetsugu ruining the ship, but instead the fact that she completely destroyed story, character development, and left a punch of plot holes. First things first, when she (yes Kanetsugu is a girl) she was somehow able to convince the prestigious family Aki\'s in. into letting her stay. Now you might be wondering if she used a cunning or deceitful tactic, but instead it turned out to be some random certificate that she somehow got with no explanation about it at all. Even more, as soon as she shows up Aki\'s entire personality shifts and it turned out she actually like Masamune but couldn\'t tell the real Masamune was Masamune and thought Kanetsugu was Masamune. The most annoying part, however, was how random this was and it directly contradict Masamune\'s side of the story. Then alas in the last 2 episodes some kidnapping shenanigans go on which I couldn\'t care much of and just leaves the anime hanging after Kanetsugu completely cuts off the relationship between Aki and Masamune for seemingly no reason, leaving a really bad taste in your mouth. defile certain people, however she never once used it on Masamune nor did she do anything to psychologically attack him.

The thing is, I\'ve been heavily into and watching anime for about a year now, and the anime I\'ve seen are the ones people recommended to me and the ones I know are quite popular and well received--and you can\'t know  what bad anime are unless you watch the bad ones. That was my mindset, I wanted to see why people said it was not good and see the ending for...myself. So, I binged it in one day and.......Yeah, I can see why. But enough of this long introduction, let\'s begin with the review.Story: The story was quite mediocre. I liked the idea of the show, that\'s one of the reasons why I wanted to watch the show. It wasn\'t horrible, but it wasn\'t very good either.Art/Animation: The art was fine, nothing eye-catching or outstanding.Sound: I guess it was fine? I don\'t really know how to rate sound for anime right now.Character: The cast was not great for the most part. My favourite character was Masamune\'s sister.- Masamune was quite bland. He\'s like the standard male protagonist of your standard harem show. He wasn\'t that bad and he had his moments, but like I said, pretty bland.- Aki made me mad almost every time she came on screen. I don\'t know if the writers did that on purpose, but if so they did a great job. Not a big fan of ""tsunderes"" in anime, and she\'s quite the tsundere.Ending: The ending.... oh man. The ending was straight-up BULLCRAP. Other people have said it as well, but I also agree. The last few scenes were them just doing karaoke and then the credits is where, FINALLY, Masamune and Aki were alone and had the chance to clear up things, BUT NO. When Masamune asked for a kiss, the tsundere did the, ""Close your eyes when I\'m gonna kiss you  because I\'m nervous and then get jebaited by her putting something in his mouth, most likely food"" trope.All the work Masamune did for the past 12 episodes to make her fall for him and then coldly reject her comes up to what? Them just being ever-so-slightly more than friends.OP and ED: Nothing special. I skipped it every time past episode one because I listen and watch the whole OP ad ED in episode one to fully experience it.Enjoyment: It was interesting enough to keep me watching the show, and I enjoyed some parts of it. But, most of what I didn\'t enjoy was the fanservice. Like bruh, why would you need to be focusing on za pantsu while she\'s sitting down when it has nothing to do with what they\'re saying or their situation, but I digress.Overall: I would give it a 4.5, quite high, but it\'s because I would want to see a second season be made and see where it goes, but it\'d probably never happen; and second, because I feel like I didn\'t want to see it burn in the trash.Could\'ve been better, but mediocre for the most part. Would I recommend this? Probably not. Only if I wanted to prank someone into watching an anime with a cool premise but mediocre story and a wack ending to that story. myself.

It wasn\'t horrible, but it wasn\'t very good either.Art/Animation: The art was fine, nothing eye-catching or outstanding.Sound: I guess it was fine? I don\'t really know how to rate sound for anime right now.Character: The cast was not great for the most part. My favourite character was Masamune\'s sister.- Masamune was quite bland. He\'s like the standard male protagonist of your standard harem show. He wasn\'t that bad and he had his moments, but like I said, pretty bland.- Aki made me mad almost every time she came on screen. I don\'t know if the writers did that on purpose, but if so they did a great job. Not a big fan of ""tsunderes"" in anime, and she\'s quite the tsundere.Ending: The ending.... oh man. The ending was straight-up BULLCRAP. Other people have said it as well, but I also agree. The last few scenes were them just doing karaoke and then the credits is where, FINALLY, Masamune and Aki were alone and had the chance to clear up things, BUT NO. When Masamune asked for a kiss, the tsundere did the, ""Close your eyes when I\'m gonna kiss you  because I\'m nervous and then get jebaited by her putting something in his mouth, most likely food"" trope.All the work Masamune did for the past 12 episodes to make her fall for him and then coldly reject her comes up to what? Them just being ever-so-slightly more than friends.OP and ED: Nothing special. I skipped it every time past episode one because I listen and watch the whole OP ad ED in episode one to fully experience it.Enjoyment: It was interesting enough to keep me watching the show, and I enjoyed some parts of it. But, most of what I didn\'t enjoy was the fanservice. Like bruh, why would you need to be focusing on za pantsu while she\'s sitting down when it has nothing to do with what they\'re saying or their situation, but I digress.Overall: I would give it a 4.5, quite high, but it\'s because I would want to see a second season be made and see where it goes, but it\'d probably never happen; and second, because I feel like I didn\'t want to see it burn in the trash.Could\'ve been better, but mediocre for the most part. Would I recommend this? Probably not. Only if I wanted to prank someone into watching an anime with a cool premise but mediocre story and a wack ending to that story.', 'BIG SPOILER!What a pathetic anime this is.The first episodes were quite good, until this random girl appears in the third episode just at the freaking ending.Allthough she felt really out of place here, i was starting to like her, especially at the bed scene in (i think) episode 5, where she refers to Masamune that the picture of their childhood with Akigaki was cute, ""even tho he was fat"". It was so cute...It was really sad that he rejected her, cause she obviously could change his narcisstic ego and can colorize his likeable inside. But didnt turn out that way.They wanted to focus everything...on Akigaki and Masmune, good. I like how Aki changed through the series, starting to hang out with nice people etc.And then, when she finally started to feel something for him, this little kid appears, showing himself as the real ""Masamune"" she felt inlove back in those days.She immiadetly fells inlove with him and now literally only has eyes for him and our main character is so obsessed with getting his stupid revenge.This Anime made me so depressed. It could have been a cute lovestory but these ""plottwists"". I mean ok, if it happens once. But the second one was so pathetic for real i cannot express my anger about it. I mean they just played with everyones feelings in that scene. Its just so bad.There is no ending here. Dont watch this. Its not worth your time. Im seriously pissed. on Akigaki and Masmune, good.

Im seriously pissed.', ""So when I first started the anime I thought it was a really interesting concept. The story was different from most romance animes if you want to call this a romance anime. In the last few episodes of this show, it's like they just made up stuff and the creators did not care. The main character was pretty cool in the beginning but near the end, I started to dislike him just like most of the other characters in the show except Yoshino. The only things I appreciated in this anime were the opening and Yoshino was pretty funny. 4/10 I wasted my time watching...this when I could be trying to finish Bleach this when I could be trying to finish Bleach"", ""I did not like this anime. The main reasons I hated this series are:The terrible ending- the entire storyline was ended in the lamest way. There was a lot of build-up to basically nothing. This totally triggered me. He didn't even get his revenge! One would think there might be another season or something but we just get left on an awful cliffhang.Random Plotholes- The plot would be going smoothly, and then they'd chuck in a random new thing that doesn't even match up with the storyline and they wouldn't even explain it. Then after an episode or two, the new character or scene or...dialogue would have just disappeared and been forgotten about. It ends up leaving you confused and curious and with a hundred questions you would never get answers to.Overall was not impressed with this anime. Not reccomended. dialogue would have just disappeared and been forgotten about.

Not reccomended."", ""This anime was for sure a roller coaster that went pretty steep then just went right on down at the end.The first episodes had some nice plot and some nice character development but once you start going towards the end you see where stuff just doesn't feel right being in there. I will say this anime is really nice to watch at the start but I slowly fell off of it near the ending of it. This is a decent anime overall, its not a go to anime I would recommend towards people but I wouldn't say to not watch it at all either. "", ""I decided to watch this because I thought it would be fun. I didn't expect that it would disappoint me so much. There were funny scenes, but most of the time, it pissed me off. The plot seemed intriguing, but there was no actual progress in the storyline. There were characters introduced that didn't add anything to the storyline (Kanetsugo and Neko). They just made things more confusing. I think the plot points weren't resolved properly. I dislike most of the characters. Maybe the source material is better, but the anime sucked. Also, it ended in a cliffhanger way that would make you hate it.Makabe...was such a disgusting main character. I didn't see any redeeming qualities in him. Sure, he had childhood trauma, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. He was vain, childish, and a jerk. Aki is not the best person in the world, but she didn't deserve the betrayal. By the end, I'm still not sure about Makabe's feelings towards Aki, but I sure as hell don't like them together in the anime. I don't like people who play with other people's feelings.FULL THOUGHTS HERE: http://booksequalhappiness.blogspot.com/2020/06/anime-masamune-kuns-revenge.html was such a disgusting main character.

With the interesting premise of a revenge story mixed with a romance and comedy this anime sure piqued my interest when looking through the seasonal anime. Although I haven’t read the source material for the anime I may do so after watching this anime.Story and settingThe main story of Masamune kun’s revenge is centered on the titular character Masamune Makabe’s  goal of attaining revenge on the stories main heroine Aki Adagaki for a perceived humiliation that she had inflicted on him when they were...little. The story largely follows the plans of Makabe as he tries to follow the plan that he has created and set up and try and get the heroine to fall in love with him. Along the way Makabe would encounter a number of support characters that either hinder or aid him in his plans. The anime itself is largely set within the school that Makabe and the majority of the cast attend though it does feature other locations when the plot demands it.As a comedy/romance anime the story itself I felt was a mix between being serious and being funny with equal emphasis on both aspects. The story was one aspect that I quite enjoyed and the fact that the cast was well integrated into the story and was played by an excellent cast really helped in making the story enjoyable. Like most anime, the story for Masamune Kun’s revenge features a subplot that features its focus on one of the main characters in this case being Neko.  This subplot I felt was reasonably done and made even better by the actions of Neko and the skill of her seiyuu Suzuko Mimori.MasamuneMasamune Makabe voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Twin stars’ exorcist and the Digimon Tri movies fame is the one of the main characters of the show and the titular protagonist. A confident, quick thinking and resourceful teenager that is determined to enact the plan that he has created and attain the revenge that he wants on Aki for the humiliation that he thinks she inflicted on him. Makabe’s life and personality can be said to revolve around his revenge plan which seems to have the funniest of names. Masamune’s personality like his plan exhibits subtle changes as the series progresses as he encounters a number of characters in his school life that change his perception on things. In the beginning Masamune’s personality and life was focused on the plan of his which had the effect making appear both devious and bold especially when he stands up to Aki. However, this also had the effect of making him look villainous. It’s not until Masamune meets Neko that his personally really starts to change becoming more caring and understanding of others than before. Although his plan remains meeting Neko and seeing Aki’s true self helped create a better personality for Masamune that I felt was more suited to him. The main point of Masamune is that he’s equally serious but at the same time can be quite comedic at times as well. This makes him somewhat of a hard character to portray as being too serious will make him look like a villain while too comedic will make him look like a clown. All in all, I felt that Natsuki Hanae did a pretty good job portraying him.AkiAki Adagaki played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayaka Ohashi of Akame ga kill fame is one of the main characters of the show and the main heroine of the series. A rich girl and a childhood friend of Masamune before an incident made him create a plan of revenge Aki is a bossy, arrogant and somewhat cruel girl on the outside. However, Aki’s true personality is slightly different as she is innocent, loyal to her classmates and somewhat considerate to others. Although ruthless towards people that she doesn’t like she can be surprisingly loyal and considerate towards her friends and kohai. Aki has two prominent traits that make her stand out more than the fact that she’s a rich girl that’s also relatively pretty. Her first trait is that she has a real intense hatred towards men and would humiliate any that try to ask her out usually by giving them embarrassing nicknames in a little show that she arranges. However, this doesn’t have any effect on the number of men that confess to her. Her second but probably most notable trait is that she has a rather monstrous appetite for food so much in fact that im amazed that she can still maintain such a good figure. Like Masamune Aki’s personality changes as the series goes on with her caring more about the feelings of others and being truer to herself. I felt that her seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi did a pretty good job portraying the character of Aki.YoshinoYoshino voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon fame is one of the main characters of the show. The personal maid of Aki and at the same time a supporter of Masamune Yoshino is a quiet, clumsy and shy girl who from surface appearances appears to be someone that’s easily bullied and intimidated. However unknown to others Yoshino has another personally that’s the opposite to what she appears to be to others. Beneath the clumsy exterior Yoshino is a cold, methodical and deceptive person that also a mind for strategy and deception. Yoshino’s greatest asset is actually her analytical mind that can come up with the most devious of strategies that is mostly followed by Masamune to allow him to get further with his plans. These plans for the most part are usually funny and is mostly disinformation that Aki due to her naive nature easily falls for. At the same time, it’s quite funny when seeing Yoshino try to safeguard her plans from interlopers in which she can quite intimidating which is best shown when the cast go to Aki’s beach villa. As an analogy, Yoshino is more akin to a puppet master that manipulates both Masamune and her master Aki in her plans. Overall I feel that Inori Minase did a pretty good job voicing Yoshino.TaeTae played by veteran seiyuu singer Azusa Todokoro is one of the support characters of the anime. A classmate of Masamune and the class rep of the class Tae is a positive, upbeat and earnest person that also has a rather weird fascination with BL. When not talking about BL Tae is a dependable student that tries to put the needs of the class first and foremost.  When Tae gets serious however she can become quite stubborn and not be willing to give up easy even when the odds are stacked against her. Despite that at her heart Tae is still a teenager and a maiden at heart and her confession to Masamune early on was quite unexpected but still sweet.KojuroKojuro voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada and the seven witches fame and my fourth favourite seiyuu is one of the support characters of the show. A classmate of Masamune and Tae Kojuro is a positive, upbeat and somewhat shy person that is nonetheless loyal to his friends and classmates. The most notable trait of Kojuro is that due to his appearance he is often mistaken as a girl despite being a boy which I found to be pretty funny. This fact is often used against him by Tae when she due to her fascination with BL often pairs Masamune with him. Despite that Kojuro bears no hatred towards Tae and indeed treats the fact that he can be mistaken as a natural occurrence. It’s interesting to note that Tae is popular with both boys and girls which is probably due to his quiet but helpful nature. As a support character Kojuro has more limited screen time than other characters but when he does appear he tends to bring a sort of comedic relief to the scene. Kojuro can be considered to be Masamune’s best friend as he was the first person in class that he met plus he also provides some good advice to Masamune when needed. Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a reasonable job portraying Kojuro though I felt that this role was a waste of her talents.NekoNeko voiced by veteran seiyuu Suzuko Mimori of Denpa Kyoushi and Digimon Tri fame is one of the main support characters of the show. A rich girl from a reasonably rich family Neko is kind, caring and sincere and can be the ideal image of a good natured one. Masamune and Neko first met by chance halfway through the series though in actual fact they met ages ago. Neko actually has her own story arc within the main story that revolves around her relationship with Masamune and her love for him. Neko’s most prominent traits is her kind and understanding nature and her utter devotion to Masamune which comes from her relationship with him. All in all, I felt that as a character Neko was a well-designed one that was also paired with an excellent seiyuu and thus making her one of the best characters on the series. In fact, after Aki she is undoubtedly one of the best girls on the series. I also like the fact that as a role Neko acts as a good contrast and counter to the likes of Aki in that they have opposite personalities.  This allows Neko to easily smooth over moments when things are tense. I felt that Suzuko Mimori did a pretty good job voicing Neko.Kanetsugu GasoKanetsugu Gaso voiced by veteran seiyuu Mitsuki Saiga is one of the main support characters of the show. A transfer student that shows up near the end of the series Kanetsugu is the spitting image of Masamune before he started his fitness regimen and acts as rival for Masamune in the main story. A good natured, kind hearted person that seems to be able to get on with just about anyone Kanetsugu is a rather simple person in that he doesn’t seem to bear any ill intent towards anyone and in fact is nice to everyone that he meets. This easy-going nature enabled him to easily fit into the school after the transfer. His relationship with Aki serves as the main obstacle for the main plot in the latter half of the series but as he enters the series at such a late time the amount of damage that he can do is limited. However, the interesting thing about him is that his appearance which is a spitting image of how Masamune looked like before actually caused changes in Aki’s behavior due in part to what his appearance has bought to her family. All in all, I felt that Kanetsugu helped bring a nice opponent to the game that Masamune is playing in that it forced him to be more active rather than going for the long game that he seems to have been playing.Student council (Sonoka, Mari and Kikuon)Sonoka, Mari and Kikuon voiced by veteran seiyuu’s Mariya Ise, Satomi Sato and Kanae Itou respectively are the members of the student council within the school that the cast attends in this series. The three are very loyal to Aki and share her belief that all males are up to no good. However humorously they also have a rather strange view of Aki who they seen to see as the man killer who represents the hopes of the girls that have been hurt by men by hurting them back by rejecting them. The three don’t really have much of a role until the latter part of the series but their plans were actually quite funny.Arts and animationThe character designs for each of the characters I felt was pretty well done and I especially like the uniforms that are worn by the main cast. Animation wise I felt the anime’s animations were pretty well done with the animation being pretty crisp and clear and having a good balance of color in it.MusicI felt that the music that was used in the anime was reasonably done with the opening song that was sung by Aki’s seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi being my favourite. The ending theme I though was also well done.Voice actingIn general I thought that the voice acting for each of the characters was done pretty well but I have to say that I was really impressed by Ayaka Ohashi who voiced Aki. The first and only other time that I heard her in was in Akame Ga kill in which she played the main character’s sister. At that time, I felt her voice was ok but not standing out as much. In this however I was surprised by how much her voice has grown since then. I felt that Ayaka did a pretty good job voicing Aki who is not the easiest of characters to portray. Another seiyuu that I felt deserves special praise is Suzuko Mimori who voiced Neko. I felt that she did a great job portraying Neko helped by the fact that she has a pretty unique tone of voice which actually made Neko stand out more.Overall conclusionAs an anime that is both a comedy and a romance story it is important that it strikes the balance between the two as featuring too many of one genre would affect the other genre as well. In this I felt that the series managed to accomplish this as Masamune Kun’s revenge is filled not just with jokes and funny moments but also with a well-designed and though out romance story. The main story I felt was pretty interesting in that I never thought that a childhood trauma could actually cause a character to not just have the motivation to get fit but also to use that time to create a plan in which he hopes to use to get back at the person that wronged him in the past. Having this as the main plot I felt was a good move on the writer’s part as it was both compelling and made the story stand out more. However, since this anime is a part comedy part love story the story was never designed to be serious but still it was enjoyable. The combo of being an anime that has both genres means that the anime has plenty of funny and sweet and cute moments between Aki and Masamune most of which are quite funny. I also felt that the support characters also did a great job in moving the story along while also advice and support to the main characters. Neko in particular was a pretty compelling character with her story arc being equally sweet and sad at the same time. Of course, the main thing that we look for in all animes is character development and im glad to say that just about every character that was featured had good levels of character development especially the leads. With a combination of an interesting premise, setting, story and a great cast of characters that are voiced by great cast of seiyuu’s I felt that Masamune Kun’s revenge was a pretty good anime and one that I enjoyed immensely. little. The story largely follows the plans of Makabe as he tries to follow the plan that he has created and set up and try and get the heroine to fall in love with him.

The combo of being an anime that has both genres means that the anime has plenty of funny and sweet and cute moments between Aki and Masamune most of which are quite funny. I also felt that the support characters also did a great job in moving the story along while also advice and support to the main characters. Neko in particular was a pretty compelling character with her story arc being equally sweet and sad at the same time. Of course, the main thing that we look for in all animes is character development and im glad to say that just about every character that was featured had good levels of character development especially the leads. With a combination of an interesting premise, setting, story and a great cast of characters that are voiced by great cast of seiyuu’s I felt that Masamune Kun’s revenge was a pretty good anime and one that I enjoyed immensely.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)When I was a teenager, my mother and I would sometimes try to spook the other for fun.I can’t remember who started it, but my mother was mad because it often happened near a dangerous area: the steps leading into the basement. The door would be closed, and someone would round the corner after reaching the top, only to find the spookster ready and waiting.It was initially revenge on both ends. “She scared me, so I’m going to scare her back” and vice versa. But the petty revenge eventually waned and it became more of...a “game” that kept us on our toes.Nowadays, my spooking habits are over. No more revenge either. Yet Masamune-kun no Revenge reminds me of just how far some people are willing to go to exact the latter (minus the spookiness).STORYPoor Masamune-kun of Masamune-kun no Revenge has been bullied his entire life. His only friend as a kid was a young girl by the name of Aki Adagaki. However, she also (presumably) turned on Masamune-kun, going so far as to call him “Pig’s Foot.” In that moment, Masamune-kun concocted the ultimate revenge plan against her: become the hunkiest hunk imaginable, make her fall in love with him, and turn her down as cruelly as possible.When thinking about the anime, it’s actually a very fun setup. In other, similar stories where the show “asks” the audience to place themselves in the shoes of the main protagonist – otherwise known as “self-insert” – it’s usually done with someone as plain, as normal, and as unassuming as possible. All to feel as though the audience are the ones in his or her shoes.Masamune-kun no Revenge takes a slightly different approach. Rather than “becoming” the main character, the audience gets to live vicariously through him. Beefing up? Regulating a diet? Dedicating a portion of a lifetime to exact some petty revenge? A lot of people don’t have or cannot have the chance at such a life, so the anime provides that opportunity for them.And it does so with the usual rom-com-drama direction in mind. A normal venture for most viewers given that the anime doesn’t do anything exceptionally unique.Comedically, the anime (understandably) achieves most of its laughs through the characters’ attempts at maintaining their facades. Aki hiding away to munch on a lot of fattening foods all cute like. Masamune-kun cursing Aki under his breath. Neko coughing up “blood.” This constant contrast of the characters easily gets at the laughs the anime aims for.Doubly so when the characters clash and interact. Masamune-kun’s “son of a bitch” line during Aki’s rapid-fire, mid-hallway questioning comes out of nowhere in hysterical fashion. And his mother worries about her baby boy when she believes him to be catching a cold, sprinting into the room with blankets and love at the ready. None of these examples even count the harsh responses from Yoshino or the running gag of Kojuurou always tagging along with the girls despite being a boy himself. In short, Masamune-kun no Revenge can be quite the funny show when it so chooses.Dramatically, the anime doesn’t always do its best, for it can sometimes lean on many a cliché rather than going for more inventive setups. Opening the dressing-room curtain as Aki undresses earns Masamune-kun a punch to the face. Later, he saves her from an oncoming vehicle to win her heart. The whole group tackles the super-common test of courage while away at a private island. Then, near the end of the show, there’s the classic (in this case Snow White) on-stage, mid-play kiss.It’s not all clichés, though. In using its façade premise, the anime takes the time to present its plot through other means. Small flashbacks of the characters provide better insight on their pasts. Their inner thoughts in the moment feel natural given the motif. And it has a few memorable scenes, too, like when Neko lays bare her own feelings to Masamune-kun in her room. In this sense, the anime balances its comedy with a reasonable level of drama.Romantically, Masamune-kun no Revenge does have its moments, too. There’s sacrifice when Masamune-kun gets injured from a crazy dude with scissors, and there’s affection when Aki gets extremely shy when she can’t comprehend why Masamune-kun has been ignoring her on purpose for so long. Much like the comedy and the drama, the romance can work. If only because Masamune-kun and Aki must do a lot to make it work, giving their romance a more meaningful backing.Yet much of the romance feels like a game of one step forward, two steps back. Masamune-kun will often have those romantic moments – only it goes nowhere or, even worse, regresses their relationship. This annoyance amplifies when Neko officially arrives. Aki’s about to reveal her feelings for him, but Neko throws herself into his arms. Masamune-kun is distracted by Neko stealing the picture of him as a kid, angering Aki when he doesn’t listen to her. He gives Aki the cold shoulder when he leaves Neko’s hospital room.Altogether, it’s a lot of highs and lows mixed between the comedy, the drama, and the romance. If any one item should be discussed, though, it’s the final arc due to its conflicting nature.When Gasou appears, it does feel entirely too convenient since he shows up out of nowhere and Masamune-kun just-so-happens to be out of the loop as he trains in the mountains without cell service. Worse still, Gasou maximizes that romantic regression seen multiple times throughout the season, practically ruining all that Masamune-kun had done up to this point.In all honesty, it’s very annoying to watch unfold. But (as hard as it is to admit) that’s exactly how it should feel. If Gasou’s interference wasn’t frustrating, then this plot point wouldn’t be doing its job. Not to mention, it’s a natural extension of the plot itself. Masamune-kun cannot reveal his true identity without compromising his revenge, so a “rival” impersonating him simply makes sense on a narrative level.Even so, the final episode is poorly constructed. It gives the audience the climax of the plot: Masamune-kun kisses Adagaki. The kiss itself doesn’t really have any emotional foundation since it’s tied to the play in which it happens. But it still gives the audience the satisfaction of seeing the two destined lovebirds having a decidedly special moment together. That’s pretty good.What’s bad comes in the second half of the episode, and it’s a two-fold problem.One, the anime doesn’t resolve its last conflict. Gasou doesn’t leave Aki’s side let alone have his cover blown. Instead, he sticks around, the whole group taking part in an awkward karaoke scene that sucks away the satisfaction from the climactic moment minutes prior.Two, the anime introduces a final plot point very near the last scene of the show. It’s what people in the community call a “read the source material” maneuver. Rather than ending on a narrative high, it chooses instead to conclude the story in an unfinished state.All told, Masamune-kun’s plan may be nicknamed “Dead or Love,” but it’s leaning towards dead for the time being.ART/ANIMATIONMasamune-kun no Revenge doesn’t do too much on a visual level. In other words, it continues its standard streak with a standard set of visuals.It doesn’t get too adventurous, sticking with its simple school setting and nominal level of cinematography. Given how the anime mostly focuses on the characters talking or interacting with one another, its subdued presentation does make sense. But it leads to a less engaging experience overall.A couple of noticeable errors do pop up, like when Masamune-kun runs away with his bag over his shoulder but without a bag when the same scene is shown from Aki’s perspective. Or how, when he’s talking to Neko in the hospital room, he’s standing in one shot but suddenly sitting down the next. These errors are few and far between, though, and they don’t cause a huge distraction, so they can be mostly ignored.The anime does include fantasy-based scenes from time to time. For example, Masamune-kun imagines what the finale of his revenge will look like, and Aki quarrels with Tae about their competing plays, the backdrop changing into a menacing dragon and a fierce tiger ready to attack each other. Again, these scenes aren’t used a whole lot, but they do help in spicing up the visuals whenever possible.The characters’ designs are the only constantly interesting visual aspect.Aki’s predominately blue-and-white outfit highlights her ice-cold personality while simultaneously hinting at a depressing, more innocent girl trapped within.Masamune-kun’s contrast between his derpy child self and his super-handsome current self makes his transformation even more impressive.Yoshino’s small white hair clips and yellow eyes give her a semi-robotic look that fits her character well.And Neko is just unfairly attractive: long brown hair, ample assets, beauty marks, and a gentle demeanor. She no doubt has the looks, but it also serves the purpose of further hiding her sickliness behind an air of perfection. (It also helps that she’s constantly going commando.)CHARACTERSThematically, the cast of Masamune-kun no Revenge do well in keeping focus on a common idea: ulterior motives. These main characters are by no means complex, but their façade-formed parallels keep a nice consistency within the cast, upping the show’s execution overall.It’s somewhat easy to pinpoint. Masamune-kun does tone his body, and he gains the brains to boot, but he only strove so hard to eventually exact his revenge against Aki. Aki herself seems to suppress her original “betrayal” on Masamune-kun. Yoshino pretends to work for Aki, but she secretly helps Masamune-kun in his quest. Neko lies about her lies. Gasou impersonates the Masamune-kun of old.It’s an interesting setup. As the characters interact, they sometimes know of their deception and sometimes not. What results are characters making deliberate actions that progress their façade that much more. For instance, Gasou befriends Aki’s “defenders,” giving him more outs as he pursues his own motives. Yoshino, too. She becomes Masamune-kun’s “master” as she guides him on how to best melt Aki’s icy exterior.They also accentuate the characters who don’t have ulterior motives. Characters like Kojuurou and Tae wear their intentions and personalities right on their sleeves, allowing them to balance out the façade-laden main cast.Beginning with Neko, she makes her appearance at the absolute worst (but for her the best) time possible. She’s quite the saint, what with her formal speech and utmost kindness. However, her no-panties policy and penchant for dietary nuance suggest that she’s (like everyone else) more than meets the eye.Indeed, the more Masamune-kun interacts with her, the more obvious it becomes that Neko isn’t being very honest. She makes up a backstory as to how she came to fall in love with him, and she even goes so far as to steal his childhood picture, the biggest piece of incriminating evidence against him.It’s what makes Neko arguably the most interesting character of the show. She lies about being sick by pretending to be sick (the ultimate cover-up move), and she lies about her origins even after her butler reveals her medical problems. Constantly lying, her façade has a façade, and her façade’s façade has a façade. It’s what ultimately makes Masamune-kun reject her advances, for, while her feelings are true, he sees himself in her, acting dishonest in her delivery.Aki is nowhere near as interesting as Neko, but, as the main female love interest, she gets attention all the same. Her rejections of the boys who ask to go out with her are almost as legendary as the nicknames she “bestows” upon them. She despises men, and she actively proves it by leading Masamune-kun on a wild answer hunt that ends with his rejection, too.But she’s not entirely an ice queen. She seems to eat a lot of food (a habit she keeps secret from everyone else), and, in true tsundere fashion, she has her cute moments such as when she attempts to justify why she went on her first date with Masamune-kun to begin with.Unfortunately, while Aki may get a lot time, she doesn’t have much substance. She rarely has the chance to improve herself as a character since whatever potential progression she earns is stripped away by the plot. Neko’s interference, Gasou’s arrival, and some of Masamune-kun’s decisions push her away rather than bring her closer, disrupting the shift in mindset that must inevitably occur for her character.Because, as far as the audience can tell, she’s troubled by something. Her gluttonous eating habit derives from an event in her past, she’s saddened by Neko’s loneliness, and her flashbacks reveal that she wasn’t always so cruel. Indeed, Masamune-kun no Revenge seems to imply that Masamune-kun’s beef with Aki may not be exactly as he remembers it.Whether he’s an unreliable narrator or not (unintentional or not), Masamune-kun proceeds with his plans. After becoming the hunkiest hunk imaginable, he commences his revenge against Aki, plotting to make her fall in love with him just so he can reject her without remorse.Expectedly, the time he spends following through on his plan and interacting with Aki affects his feelings. Especially when the other characters get involved. Yoshino makes him realize he cannot always rely on somebody else to grant him the personal revenge he seeks. Neko’s rejection and sickened state acts as a metaphor for what could be Masamune-kun’s fate should he fail in his quest. And Gasou pushes him to fight harder than he ever has before.To reiterate once more, the season doesn’t have him flip his switch about Aki, meaning his whole character arc isn’t finished either. However, he messes up a lot, and he sometimes makes the right move, crafting him into at the minimum a believable guy whose trying his best at earning love and seeking revenge.As for Kanetsugu Gasou, the anime surprisingly doesn’t go as cliched with him as it does with its story. He’s the fat guy who’s neither gross nor evil but instead normal. A regular dude who, while holding similar schemes as everyone else, isn’t outwardly menacing. At the very least, he’s no different from the others in that he lies and does whatever he can to get his way. Plus, he’s only in it for the money. That’s more to appease the minds of the audience since it makes his “marriage” to Aki less creepy and more about his own personal gain.There’s nothing else to him besides being a wrench in the works. And he still deserves all the hate he receives for his insufferable goody-two-shoes attitude. Despite this direction, he does deserve credit for his slightly unconventional antagonist role.MUSIC/SOUNDMost people praise Masamune-kun no Revenge for its original soundtrack – and for good reason. These tracks are not only filled with variety but also fit to a tee. To the point that almost nothing else could work within the show. A pronounced acoustic guitar signals tension like a modern Western film. Flutes, choirs, and harps spell out mystery. Sharp, high-pitched piano keys haunt the air. An Italian accordion arrangement spells out a bittersweet feeling. It’s musical diversity at its finest, and it gives the show a lot of power during its different scenes.Voice acting also remains strong throughout the season. In particular, Natsuki Hanae as Masamune-kun channels his frustration when monologuing his inner thoughts, and Inori Minase as Yoshino delivers deadpan speech with softness in mind, proving yet again how cute her voice tends to be.The opening track doesn’t reach the same heights. It’s a rather upbeat piece due to the dainty instrumental choices and the quickness of it all. The English “please don’t; please wait” line doesn’t flow very well within the middle of the song, but final lyrical push, where the words and the beat step together, does introduce some much-needed flavor. Overall, though, the song is about as standard as the story itself.The ending track is a small step above its OP counterpart. A prominent electric guitar leads into yet another normal beat that doesn’t go for anything interesting. However, compared to the OP, its English lines fit a bit better, and the higher focus on the vocals gives it more emotion. Again, though, it’s not too immersive.And, while a strange complaint, it should be noted that the stomach sound-effects are weird in design. It seemed as if the anime didn’t want to use the same stock sound (which any anime fan can hear in his or her head right now), but it tried way too hard. Aki sounded more like she had to go to the bathroom due to constipation than needing to eat food loaded with carbs.ENJOYMENTLike most others who watched the show, I, too, was very frustrated and annoyed by Gasou. Even though he was only it for the money, and he’s technically the same as everyone else in his conniving, I still disliked those last three episodes either because of or indirectly due to him. He was annoyingly, overly kind, and Aki being all super sweet when around Gasou got on my nerves right quick.That’s why I liked Masamune-kun quite a bit; he wasn’t afraid to call her a “damn bitch” or a “stupid ham.” Under his breath or in his mind, of course, but seeing and hearing him being absolutely fed up with her horrible personality had me both laughing at the show and relating with its main protagonist.The other characters could also be a lot of fun, too. Yoshino’s innocent and emotionless personas made for a hilarious silly-serious combo. Neko trying to play off dropping her ketchup packet had me laughing. And Kojuurou always failing to explain that he is, in fact, a boy was a simple joke, but it got me smiling with ease.And even though Aki was a big meanie, that -dere side of hers was often worth such abrasiveness. Sadly, she didn’t have enough moments in the way romance, and, even when she did, she was usually the one ruining them. So, as a mega-fan of romance – it’s my number-one favorite genre – Aki was too much of a brute in this regard. Upper-cutting Masamune-kun as he went in for a kiss that she herself asked for? Lame.I get it. She can’t change her tune instantly, and she can’t fall for him fully. Doing either would eliminate the crux of the conflict, leaving no story to tell. Still, I wish Aki would have been affected a bit more than she was. Her progress simply never felt all that satisfying.So, in the end, my favorite character was the secretary lady, Midori Yukisaki. Beautiful, mature, and she likes to sing death metal songs during karaoke? Yes, please.Masamune-kun no Revenge has its plans backfired. A consistent set of characters and a very strong original soundtrack do what they can. However, the story does more wrong than right, the art and animation are plain, and it can be too frustrating to watch at times. It’s not spooky; it’s simply unfortunate.SUMMARYStory: Bad, fun comedy, mixed drama, and weak romance support a vicarious premise that ends up unfinished and unresponsiveArt/Animation: Fine, a plain visual offering does little else besides give the audience something to look at, but the character designs no doubt have their appealing qualitiesCharacters: Good, a consistent ulterior-motives motif connects the characters, Neko’s lies make her the most interesting of the bunch, Aki doesn’t have much substance, Gasou isn’t a conventional antagonist, and everyone affects Masamune-kun in their own wayMusic/Sound: Fine, a strong OST and some nice VA performances offset the boring OP and ED, but the stomach gurgling sound-effect is weird no matter whatEnjoyment: Bad, Masamune-kun, Neko, and Yoshino are fun, Midori rocks, but lacking romance scenes and the infuriating last arc doesn’t do any favorsFinal Score: 4/10 a “game” that kept us on our toes.Nowadays, my spooking habits are over.

That’s more to appease the minds of the audience since it makes his “marriage” to Aki less creepy and more about his own personal gain.There’s nothing else to him besides being a wrench in the works. And he still deserves all the hate he receives for his insufferable goody-two-shoes attitude. Despite this direction, he does deserve credit for his slightly unconventional antagonist role.MUSIC/SOUNDMost people praise Masamune-kun no Revenge for its original soundtrack – and for good reason. These tracks are not only filled with variety but also fit to a tee. To the point that almost nothing else could work within the show. A pronounced acoustic guitar signals tension like a modern Western film. Flutes, choirs, and harps spell out mystery. Sharp, high-pitched piano keys haunt the air. An Italian accordion arrangement spells out a bittersweet feeling. It’s musical diversity at its finest, and it gives the show a lot of power during its different scenes.Voice acting also remains strong throughout the season. In particular, Natsuki Hanae as Masamune-kun channels his frustration when monologuing his inner thoughts, and Inori Minase as Yoshino delivers deadpan speech with softness in mind, proving yet again how cute her voice tends to be.The opening track doesn’t reach the same heights. It’s a rather upbeat piece due to the dainty instrumental choices and the quickness of it all. The English “please don’t; please wait” line doesn’t flow very well within the middle of the song, but final lyrical push, where the words and the beat step together, does introduce some much-needed flavor. Overall, though, the song is about as standard as the story itself.The ending track is a small step above its OP counterpart. A prominent electric guitar leads into yet another normal beat that doesn’t go for anything interesting. However, compared to the OP, its English lines fit a bit better, and the higher focus on the vocals gives it more emotion. Again, though, it’s not too immersive.And, while a strange complaint, it should be noted that the stomach sound-effects are weird in design. It seemed as if the anime didn’t want to use the same stock sound (which any anime fan can hear in his or her head right now), but it tried way too hard. Aki sounded more like she had to go to the bathroom due to constipation than needing to eat food loaded with carbs.ENJOYMENTLike most others who watched the show, I, too, was very frustrated and annoyed by Gasou. Even though he was only it for the money, and he’s technically the same as everyone else in his conniving, I still disliked those last three episodes either because of or indirectly due to him. He was annoyingly, overly kind, and Aki being all super sweet when around Gasou got on my nerves right quick.That’s why I liked Masamune-kun quite a bit; he wasn’t afraid to call her a “damn bitch” or a “stupid ham.” Under his breath or in his mind, of course, but seeing and hearing him being absolutely fed up with her horrible personality had me both laughing at the show and relating with its main protagonist.The other characters could also be a lot of fun, too. Yoshino’s innocent and emotionless personas made for a hilarious silly-serious combo. Neko trying to play off dropping her ketchup packet had me laughing. And Kojuurou always failing to explain that he is, in fact, a boy was a simple joke, but it got me smiling with ease.And even though Aki was a big meanie, that -dere side of hers was often worth such abrasiveness. Sadly, she didn’t have enough moments in the way romance, and, even when she did, she was usually the one ruining them. So, as a mega-fan of romance – it’s my number-one favorite genre – Aki was too much of a brute in this regard. Upper-cutting Masamune-kun as he went in for a kiss that she herself asked for? Lame.I get it. She can’t change her tune instantly, and she can’t fall for him fully. Doing either would eliminate the crux of the conflict, leaving no story to tell. Still, I wish Aki would have been affected a bit more than she was. Her progress simply never felt all that satisfying.So, in the end, my favorite character was the secretary lady, Midori Yukisaki. Beautiful, mature, and she likes to sing death metal songs during karaoke? Yes, please.Masamune-kun no Revenge has its plans backfired. A consistent set of characters and a very strong original soundtrack do what they can. However, the story does more wrong than right, the art and animation are plain, and it can be too frustrating to watch at times. It’s not spooky; it’s simply unfortunate.SUMMARYStory: Bad, fun comedy, mixed drama, and weak romance support a vicarious premise that ends up unfinished and unresponsiveArt/Animation: Fine, a plain visual offering does little else besides give the audience something to look at, but the character designs no doubt have their appealing qualitiesCharacters: Good, a consistent ulterior-motives motif connects the characters, Neko’s lies make her the most interesting of the bunch, Aki doesn’t have much substance, Gasou isn’t a conventional antagonist, and everyone affects Masamune-kun in their own wayMusic/Sound: Fine, a strong OST and some nice VA performances offset the boring OP and ED, but the stomach gurgling sound-effect is weird no matter whatEnjoyment: Bad, Masamune-kun, Neko, and Yoshino are fun, Midori rocks, but lacking romance scenes and the infuriating last arc doesn’t do any favorsFinal Score: 4/10', 'Potential:The anime had a great potential, after watching the trailer I had so much hopes for it. For a starter, the animation is beautiful, it is light, fun and enjoyable.The story itself is new, and could have turned into something great.Reality:But at the end of the day Masamune-kun no Revenge ended up being a total disappointment and a big fat CLICHE! It has a very attractive main character with shitty personality, and a harem squad that are totally falling in love with him, it had a classical beach episode, a classical school festival episode.Story line:The script is very poor, there no intelligent humor...nor mature dialog, and it is not enjoyable at all, you could also predict pretty much all of the upcoming events.All in all it is an anime to watch an episode of it after a long day, wanting to think of nothing. nor mature dialog, and it is not enjoyable at all, you could also predict pretty much all of the upcoming events.All in all it is an anime to watch an episode of it after a long day, wanting to think of nothing.', ""tldr; starts off pretty good but gets more confused than a homeless guy on house arrest.it starts off pretty typical with  a narcissistic main character with all these characters, and by characters i mean women (dont think there isa single male character in this show besides the main character), wanting his dick but because of some strange back story he wants to get back at the main and obviously best girl. cool.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryA cute little harem Anime with odd goals. What made this a bit more unique than most of the this type of Anime, the characters were a bit more ""real"" on top of having stereotype.Aside that I seriously cannot mention much, would be spoiler. But mostly it\'s daily high school life with minimal drama and a bit of cute romance. Also how lot of things were oddly shadowed and hidden, made the story element a bit annoying, but at the same time kinda real. Which isn\'t exactly...a good thing, but in this Anime I did end up enjoying it quite a lot. I\'ll talk about it in character section a bit more.Long story short, it\'s a harem school life Anime that has a touch of oddness and ""realism"" in a sense. But sadly it\'s one of those Anime where you have to read the source material if you want to know how it all will end, as this was pretty much prelude of possible drama and romance that could be. So story wise this Anime did not wrap up anything pretty much, but it gave fair amount initial love/hate towards the characters and the premise.I probably forgot to add something....✦Art & SoundGood enough, nothing special. Pretty basic, but pretty fitting.✦CharactersWell in short, type of Anime where I dislike every character for certain reasons but as well like them for certain reasons.Aside having stereotypes, this anime had a lot of double facades behind each character actions and feelings. Which did quite annoy me as I dislike lies to others and self. Justifying lies in the end just hurts someone, so no matter what lies they still are something I hate and in this Anime pretty much the whole cast had their past and reasons which added lot of facades and lies to their growth. For sake of changing on not having similar experiences, they decided to create false personas.Our main girl, I would say she is stereotypical tsundere, but she feels more of a just selfish b****, but the at same time she really has adorable cute side. But her own self-consciousness and past that kinda created her face of hatred/evilbeing. But her development slowly being true and cute as she is, is probably the endgame of this series.Main guy is as well someone with past they didn\'t like, but for some reason he ended up growing kinda superficial as people who he had to deal with in the past. But in comedic value his narcissism, ego facade he created, was actually entertaining and as well slowly the mask was torn off.In-between I\'m going to mention, that every character has basically layer or two stupid facades because of their past and for some reason the need to lie to others and self. (feelings as well) is the whole plot of this series.Them we have ojou-sama\'esque girl who has ""good ojou-sama"" type of a facade with a little naughty and teasing character, but again. Kinda disliked her at the start for the trying to steal the guy with ""?"" reasons. But again... her background seems actually not be at all what I felt at start. (but damn, I love her ""dress sense"", if you know what I mean). Her teasing, soothing and naughty personality made her one of the favorite characters in this series.Moral of the story, I have something to say about pretty much every character. That is how much they did interest me. But they all have similar pattern, development, which is nice. But I do want to know how all of them will end up. And sadly.. for that you will have to check out the source material.✦Enjoyment & OverallI had mixed feelings and wanted to give it 6, but somehow growing in the characters and having semi like/dislike feelings towards em, made me somehow want to praise this Anime. But indeed, it doesn\'t really wrap up anything and is simply one of those Anime where in the end it simply staples a paper in your face that says ""read the manga"".Also the whole lies thing, having facades makes me relate it to reality too much which I absolutely hate. In both ways. Lies, facades for sake of ""image"" or for sake of ""not hurting someone"" or for sake of ""getting something/someone"" is just ugly business. Manipulation and lies.... never understood them nor ever thought in such process. Thus why I end up getting burnt as I cannot comprehend/see through lies, facades and using people.So that wise, this Anime was kinda uncomfortable and angering? But at the same times as Anime always, such things are taken to more extremes and idealized, which kinda makes it comedic or even as it did, cute. And that is why I said its stereotypes + kinda ""realism"" . But more precise would probably be stereotypes + facades.To sum it up, I can\'t say it\'s bad Anime nor amazing. Maybe even 7 is too much. But I did seriously feel like praising it a bit more. And it did interest me enough to actually add manga to ""plan to read"". So yeah, I did enjoy this binge watch. a good thing, but in this Anime I did end up enjoying it quite a lot.

So yeah, I did enjoy this binge watch.', ""tl;dr: An anime that somehow successfully derives strength from cringe but ends at the worst possible moment leaving an incredibly bitter after taste.The best word to describe this anime is cringe. Masamune is self absorbed to the point of ridiculousness which combined with his social incompetence results in him often making a complete fool of himself. Adagaki too is somewhat of a moron due to a combination of her pride and her emotions being a complete mess she doesn't seem to understand at all. And the plot of the first of these characters trying to make the second fall in love with them despite not...being in love with them as some sort of revenge is just a never ending string of feeling awkward for everyone involved. But none of that is a problem. Rather, all of that results in an anime that is incredibly unique and very interesting. Furthermore, it feels pretty well written and paced, with the other characters and their arcs while still being pretty strange, balance out the mess that is Masamune and Adagaki. The comedy surrounding all this is also hilarious at times. It feels like its a train wreck just waiting to happen, but for the most part the ride has been a good one.So no, none of that is a problem with the anime, but rather it's strength and what makes it stand out. The problem with the anime that greatly diminishes all of this is that the anime ends in the middle of an arc. Of course no one expects that they'd do the entire story in a single cour anime. However, most anime try to pick a good point to stop at where things aren't too messy and there's some level of closure, even if there are clearly a lot of plot threads still hanging. This didn't do that. Rather, it picked what is likely the worst point to possible stop at. It stops in the middle of an arc, and not just any sort of arc, but the standard kind of sort of NTR arc. Sure, these are pretty standard and generally end with some sort of craziness that often reveals it was never NTR or something like that, so everyone can see that coming. But the anime never gets there because this ended in the middle of that arc. Once again, with a bit of spoilers to be completely clear, this anime ends with the main heroine going out with someone other than the main character, which makes everything that happened over the course of the show feel pretty pointless.I'm sorry, but how the hell did no one think that was a terrible idea. They should have either pushed through to the end of that arc regardless of how fast they'd have to pace it or have used filler at the end and not gone into that arc at all, because the alternative is that the anime ends at an incredibly disappointing point that leaves a terrible after taste. It certainly makes me want to read the manga to find how said arc ends, and since that's often a goal of such anime I suppose that might be considered a win, but it also leaves me incredibly bitter on the whole franchise.In terms of art and animation it was solid enough. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable. The OP was good visually and in terms of the song. The ED was pretty standard but solid. being in love with them as some sort of revenge is just a never ending string of feeling awkward for everyone involved. But none of that is a problem.

I\'m not trying to write them, but my review may spoil you.Masamune-kun no Revenge seemed like something I\'d like.

Pretty much.The disappointment can be summed up in a few words - not the outcome I had hoped for. Ever since the first episodes it makes you think his revenge will be that legendary ending this anime is aiming for, but it flunked when it...didn\'t do anything it so openly promised.

I can hardly see any good thing at how the romance in this story is bring handled, There is multiple girls on one guy but obviously because of the plot, the main coupling cannot be toppled (Just like other animes), the story stopped going forward at one...point just to announce at the end about a possible super cliché second season.The art is ok,  but the colors are a little too satured for my taste and it looks like the characters were drawn in a little hurry in the few last episodes.

That leads into the best thing about their relationship, Yoshino Kowai voiced by Inori Minase, Aki\'s personal maid, she is the unpredictable factor and ""Master"" to Makabe in getting his revenge that makes this horrible relationship intriguing to say the least.Moving onto the other cast, we have Tae Futaba voiced by Azusa Tadokoro and Neko Fujinomiya voiced by Suzuko Mimori, THEY are the BEST characters in the anime overall for LA, Tae for being the general nice girl of the series and Neko for both her character development, unpredictable love interest and connection to Makabe as well as shaking up the entire revenge plot by making Neko ""a way out"" in  a ways, but nonetheless Tae and Neko were the best characters in an anime filled with horrible characters. The only other character to take note is the very feminine yet he\'s totally a guy Kojuurou Shuri voiced by......Saori Hayami and he\'s your expected friend of Makabe and is more a satellite character until he gains something of a development during the Cultural festival arc.Now there are a couple of flaws to note about Masamune-kun no Revenge. Let\'s easily start with Makabe himself, he is seriously your cliche, dunce about romance main male protagonist in a romance anime, his only thoughts are nothing but his revenge and his hobby of being constantly fit (and demeaning anyone who\'s remotely fat let alone romantic rival), he has a VERY one-track mind not making him very likable and for the majority of the time, he is and that directly factors into the romance not being believable in some sense due to how stupid both Makabe and Aki are (in the common sense and romance variety) to how crippling how Makabe\'s goal turns into as we start to get to know more about Aki\'s backstory as his goal slowly shifts away from revenge (heck add in Neko AND Kanetsugu Gasou voiced by Mitsuki Saiga into this mix and his goal strays even further!) as to whether he\'ll succeed or not. But to this anime\'s defense, both the straying away from his main goal and how both horrible our main leads are kinda WANTS us to root for Makabe\'s goal (depends but you get LA point with this), thus because of how sadistic and horrible Makabe is, makes US the people who root for Makabe\'s root somewhat sadistic too and this anime kinda knows what these characters are, no matter how horrible or good they are. Next is that before Neko\'s appearance, there\'s a bit of a lull concerning the pacing of the plot with Makabe\'s futile attempts at wooing her and it\'s episodic feel to it was the lull, LA kinda just wanted something crazy to arrive and that crazy and this defense turned out to be Neko!. Finally, the last flaw is how many cliche they pull from this anime, we have our typical beach, test of courage, cultural festival and our main protagonist being a dunce at romance all listed BUT once again, to this anime\'s credit, although NOT all put a crazy twist to it (see test of courage and beach episodes), but for the rest, they do put in a crazy twist to it\'s proceedings making it at least a bit interesting to it. Ohhh and to add a bit of salt to the flaws, the ending leaves it as it is, still having Makabe\'s goal still hanging with a hint if there\'s gonna be another season...it\'s a ""read the manga"" ending alright.In terms of animation by Studio Sliver Link, the animation is decent enough with vibrant and polished character designs and with ok backgrounding makes the anime very good to look at. -sigh- if anything, the animation is decent but not the focal point of this anime overall and LA thinks the anime itself knows this, it\'s not the animation as it\'s characters, ironic for a main male protagonist who cares NOTHING BUT APPEARANCE.As for voice cast is where things get interesting however, we have Ayaka Ohashi as the Cruel Princess Aki and this ISN\'T the first time LA saw her voicing a quote ""horrible character"" unquote before, LA thought Natsuki Hanae was acceptable as Makabe as he had the right tones of being an ass and narcissistic as possible. Suzuko Mimori as a mysterious girl with ojou vocals?...seen it but nonetheless did a great job as Neko. Inori Minase as a maid who has a dark side with deadpan vocals..where has LA heard THAT before?...again seen it but still great performance from Inori Minase as well. The minor voice cast did decent with some well known names as well such as Yui Ogura as Makabe\'s loli mother (no seriously, with all her squeakiness to boot!), Kanae Ito, Mariya Ise and Satomi Sato as Aki\'s friends of Kikuon Kiba, Sonoka Kaneko and Mari Mizuno respectively (with LA really liking Satomi Sato\'s role in playing against the type of the cute yet sadistically coordinated thorn in Makabe\'s side). The weird but fitting choice is Saori Hayami as Kojuurou, why?...is because of Saori\'s purposeful feminine vocals in a guy role, nonetheless as weird as it is, is a GREAT playing against the type role for Saori. Overall, this voice cast is decent with some hidden gems here and there (those hidden gems being Satomi Sato, Saori Hayami and Suzuko Mimori being LA\'s favourite voice actor in Masamune-kun no Revenge).Yes, Masamune-kun no Revenge has lots of flaws especially concerning the main goal and focus of the anime and even worse if you don\'t like the main romance can easily turn you off with this anime, but LA kep throwing this word, but it\'s kinda ""exotic"" look at a revenge story within a cliche romance story and that intrigue is kinda what kept LA going through all this and even to the point LA consciously started to root for the growing beta couple *cough Neko best girl *cough* by the later episodes, LA still kinda saw some potential in Makabe\'s conquest for revenge in all the kerfuffle that occurs. Masamune-kun no Revenge entirely relies on the audience to root for our main leads as horrible as they are, whether you do or not WILL differ the experience at looking at this anime. For LA, LA hated these our main leads at first but kinda wanted Makabe\'s goal to succeed (as well as not seeing the cliches laid in front of LA), but as the anime went on with more characters and chaos added to it, LA started legitimately wanting Makabe and Aki to get together as well as really liking the anime as cliched as it is all due how it defies expectations ""at times"" AAAAAND Neko best girl. who nicknamed him ""Pig\'s Foot"" or ""Piggy"", thus years later, Makabe turned slim and wanted revenge on Aki by romancing Aki then dumping her...as much as this goal is horrible and the current Makabe IS a horrible character only thinking about revenge and him burning calories no matter what and is a complete dunce at romance in the first place, it doesn\'t give him much leeway into liking him....however the only thing that does IS his goal for revenge as weird as that sounds and that\'s because of Aki Adagaki herself voiced by Ayaka Ohashi, dubbed the ""Cruel Princess"", giving horrible nicknames to ANYONE who dares tries to go out with her and with her extreme tsundereness and general cold-hearted nature (besides her friends of course), she too is generally a horrible love interest BUT two horrible characters together is better than a horrible character together with a GREAT one right?. That leads into the best thing about their relationship, Yoshino Kowai voiced by Inori Minase, Aki\'s personal maid, she is the unpredictable factor and ""Master"" to Makabe in getting his revenge that makes this horrible relationship intriguing to say the least.Moving onto the other cast, we have Tae Futaba voiced by Azusa Tadokoro and Neko Fujinomiya voiced by Suzuko Mimori, THEY are the BEST characters in the anime overall for LA, Tae for being the general nice girl of the series and Neko for both her character development, unpredictable love interest and connection to Makabe as well as shaking up the entire revenge plot by making Neko ""a way out"" in  a ways, but nonetheless Tae and Neko were the best characters in an anime filled with horrible characters. The only other character to take note is the very feminine yet he\'s totally a guy Kojuurou Shuri voiced by......Saori Hayami and he\'s your expected friend of Makabe and is more a satellite character until he gains something of a development during the Cultural festival arc.Now there are a couple of flaws to note about Masamune-kun no Revenge. Let\'s easily start with Makabe himself, he is seriously your cliche, dunce about romance main male protagonist in a romance anime, his only thoughts are nothing but his revenge and his hobby of being constantly fit (and demeaning anyone who\'s remotely fat let alone romantic rival), he has a VERY one-track mind not making him very likable and for the majority of the time, he is and that directly factors into the romance not being believable in some sense due to how stupid both Makabe and Aki are (in the common sense and romance variety) to how crippling how Makabe\'s goal turns into as we start to get to know more about Aki\'s backstory as his goal slowly shifts away from revenge (heck add in Neko AND Kanetsugu Gasou voiced by Mitsuki Saiga into this mix and his goal strays even further!) as to whether he\'ll succeed or not. But to this anime\'s defense, both the straying away from his main goal and how both horrible our main leads are kinda WANTS us to root for Makabe\'s goal (depends but you get LA point with this), thus because of how sadistic and horrible Makabe is, makes US the people who root for Makabe\'s root somewhat sadistic too and this anime kinda knows what these characters are, no matter how horrible or good they are. Next is that before Neko\'s appearance, there\'s a bit of a lull concerning the pacing of the plot with Makabe\'s futile attempts at wooing her and it\'s episodic feel to it was the lull, LA kinda just wanted something crazy to arrive and that crazy and this defense turned out to be Neko!. Finally, the last flaw is how many cliche they pull from this anime, we have our typical beach, test of courage, cultural festival and our main protagonist being a dunce at romance all listed BUT once again, to this anime\'s credit, although NOT all put a crazy twist to it (see test of courage and beach episodes), but for the rest, they do put in a crazy twist to it\'s proceedings making it at least a bit interesting to it.

The standard plotline for romance anime is to make the ending of the entire series the confession where the two main characters get together, and the entire runtime is a slog up to that point with the majority of it being the classic will they/won\'t they push/pull action that gets cumbersome and tiring after it has been done over and over again.  So, does Masamune-kun\'s Revenge break that mold?  If I\'m being honest here, kind of?Story: Makabe Masamune was a kid, a very chubby fat kid when he was young.  During his youth, he...made friends with a rich girl named Adagaki Aki, and a friendship between the two sparked.  But one day, after being bullied repeatedly, Masamune asks Aki to defend him and help him out of his predicament, only to be spat on and thrown away like a piece of garbage.  Now in high school with a body shaven down to that of a male model, Masamune returns with sworn vengeance against Aki.  His plan: Make her fall in love with him.  Then dump her!  MUAHAHAHA!!!As ridiculous as the plot sounds, Masamune-kun\'s revenge is an interesting twist on the romance formula.  Though watching it has a lot of moments that will have predictable results, the plotline follows the classic revenge plot that\'s not too commonly seen in the romance genre.  Each episode follows Masamune\'s progress to try and raise Aki\'s flags and try to achieve the end goal of dumping her to make her feel the pain that he felt many years ago.  For this, I have to commend the series for trying something that feels new, and it doesn\'t part from the series\'s runtime at any point in the show.  While yes it\'s not completely immersed in the revenge plot, as many common highschool anime tropes like the school festival, beach episode, etc, are used as the backdrops for many of its episodes, they at least feel different enough to not just feature them just for the sake of having them.  (Though your mileage may vary on some of those tropes.)Additionally, the plot features several \'wrenches\' in Masamune\'s plan in the form on new characters that get introduced in the middle and last areas of the series.  These characters help make up the majority of the later arcs of the series and help serve as catalysts to further Masamune\'s revenge plot.  The quality of these characters vary however, as some of them work while others could\'ve been handled better.The downside to the whole series however comes in the form of the series\'s ending and its overall pacing.  This adaptation covers roughly 30 chapters of the original manga, and succeeds in squeezing in all of that content in 12 episodes by cutting out a lot of seemingly unnecessary scenes.  As someone who reads the manga, the story still holds up, but the last arc that they decided to do for this adaptation could\'ve been handled better, as the last three episodes that were used for that arc rushed through the content and created some disparity in the urgency of the situation.  Not only that, but the anime ends on a \'read the manga\' ending, where they tease the next arc in the last few scenes of the anime before ending it off.  To anyone who doesn\'t read the original series, this leaves a bad taste in anyone\'s mouth, and it honestly bugged me cause I feel like they could\'ve handled it a little better.Overview:+ The revenge plot stays consistent+ Doesn\'t feel too too generic-  Uneven pacing at the end-  Read the manga endingCharacters: While I do praise the story for having some form of originality with how it plays out anime highschool scenes, characters, particularly one, have some faults that I really want to point out.First, the easy stuff.  Makabe Masamune.  Having an extremely vain personality to the point that he has on occasion spent time looking at himself in the mirror, Masamune is our MC hellbent on making Aki pay for her past transgressions.  While seemingly one-note, Masamune progresses through the series trying to make heads or tails about what his true intentions are with trying to make Aki confess to him.  I feel like there\'s genuine growth with him as the series progresses, and the whole thought of trying to make his revenge happen feels like it persists, but changes in how he does it the longer the series goes on.  Personally, I quite like Masamune.  While he might not be the most original character, there\'s something about him that feels worthwhile to watch.  And that\'s honestly something that I don\'t find a lot of in most MCs.  Especially those in romance anime.Then there\'s Kowai Yoshino, the large-breasted (cause we always need one of these kinds of girls) stone-faced girl who\'s the personal attendant of Adagaki Aki.  Largely playing a supporting role in the series, Yoshino acts as Masamune\'s ally in helping him with his revenge against her mistress and spends the majority of the series working from behind the scenes and aiding our main character whenever he needs a little help to get things working.  She\'s a seemingly clueless girl with a silver tongue and while not important beyond being a mentor for Masamune on how to deal with Aki and/or pulling strings behind the scenes, Yoshino does play a big role in the series even if it doesn\'t seem like it.And...last but not least...Adagaki Aki...  Being honest here, I don\'t like this girl.  Aki is what you would come to expect when it comes to a main rich love interest in a romance series.  A spoiled tsundere brat who lengthens the series more by being stubborn and hardheaded while both never being true to your feelings and being a bitch in the process.  No matter how many times the series tries to make her seem cute by making her clueless to the world or inhaling unholy amounts of food into that frail-looking body of hers, Aki exists as Masamune\'s struggle to fulfill his plan.  Sure we may understand a little bit more about her as time goes on, but the first impression and the trope she represents is god fucking awful, and I didn\'t realize how much I didn\'t like her until I watched the adaptation.  I didn\'t like her while reading the manga, but the anime told me again and intensified why I didn\'t like her in the first place.Other characters fall into one of two categories.  Side characters like Koujuuro and Futaba are those that persist throughout the series and are basically dragged along to the romance drama that goes on in the series, and ones like Neko are characters who have the arc wrapped around them with changes to Masamune in particular packaged along with them.  Neko in particular is the more interesting one of the lot, as she has a large portion of the middle of the series dedicated to her arc, which is a section of the story that was given the attention it deserved, and for that I\'m grateful.Overview:+ Most of the MCs don\'t feel too trope-ish+ Most side characters have a great real of relevance, screentime, and impact-  Aki\'s a bitchArt:  Silver Link\'s bad habit of taking on multiple shows in a single season has reared its ugly head on more than one occasion.  Winter 2017 has them take on two shows, and Masamune is one of those two.  So how does it fair?  To be honest, not bad.Masamune-kun\'s art is largely what I would say is standard fare for the company.  The colors are light, the art has little to no flaws with the quality of the drawings, and everything looks pretty good.  Admittedly there\'re no dramatic action scenes or anything that require hundreds of frames in order to animate correctly, so that would help save time and money, I suppose.Overview:+/- Art is standard fareSound: Admittedly, the soundtrack is not really all that\'s cracked up to be.  It\'s not a bad OP or ED to listen to, and there were a few times where I didn\'t feel like skipping them, but they\'re just...not worth remembering.  Which for me, is a bit of a disappointment, as we have ""Elemental World"" by ChouCho as the ED, which was a bit of a lackluster track to listen to considering the artist has stuff like Prillya\'s 4th season OP and Heaven\'s memopad\'s OP under her belt as previous works.  It just doesn\'t stack up, so I\'m not too bothered wth the sound.Personal Enjoyment:  I honestly like this series.  As someone who has the majority of their lists consist of romance stuff, Masamune-kun separates itself from the pack by being a more interesting version of your slow-paced romance.  Sure, it\'s expected that the two MC\'s will get together, but at the very least, the journey that they\'re taking to reach that point is something different.Did I like this series?I did.  Particularly Neko.  I love Neko.  She\'s a fun character that adds quite a bit of impact in the middle portion of the series.  Which ends up becoming naught because best girl never wins anything, now do they?What didn\'t I like about this series?Aside from the clear and obvious one of our main \'heroine\' (if you can even call her that), the whole last arc didn\'t sit right with me.  It felt too fast-paced and I was disappointed with the execution.  Also with what happened to Neko.  I don\'t think a lot of people were happy with what happened to Neko.  Did I mention that I\'m a fan of Neko?  Neko.  (Insert more ""Neko""s here.)Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re looking for a different kind of romance anime that doesn\'t stray too far from the norm, Masamune-kun\'s revenge is probably your best bet.

The art style and the character development is considered as average in my personal opinion. Although by the end of the series I was enrage as the ending did not capture the story that was leaning to, which was the big reveal of Masamune revenge to Aki (the girl that rejected Masamune when he was a kid).The ending left question about other characters (Kanetsugu Gasou) that could potentiality change the course of the story itself. As well as the end did not explain...the sudden change of emotion towards main character (Masamune) when ask for a kiss when the problem of Kanetsugu Gasou was still at hand. the sudden change of emotion towards main character (Masamune) when ask for a kiss when the problem of Kanetsugu Gasou was still at hand.', ""So I started watching the series and I love it.

The first few episodes were promising, and showed some great characters with funny interactions, but as the series went on it started to fall flat.Masamune-kun suffers the same problem as a number of other anime (angel beats comes to mind), in that there are too many characters whose backstory and motivations aren't given a chance to be explained. Only the most central characters to the story have their intentions considered, and some of the interesting, less central characters are...left out. What can be called the 'major' plot twist doesn't occur until nearly the end of the series, and as such it isn't given much chance for development.Even the main character, whose initial intentions are set in stone, quickly falters on his plans when complications arise, and at times I wasn't sure if he was even seriously pursuing his main goal, one which he had striven for his whole life.The art style and sound were both redeeming features, as to be expected of silver link.

It's filled with obnoxious and down-right horrible characters. Let's talk bout the main character, Masamune is a teenage high school-er who cares about nothing else than staying skinny. Here's my problem, this show makes it sound like your not handsome or good looking if your not skinny. That is not really a good message. I can't remember any of the other characters name's. Which shows how poor they're.The story is about Masamune getting revenge on a girl that called him a pig's foot when he was a kid. He gets revenge by trying to get the...girl to fall in love with him and then Masamune is going to dump her and make her feel bad. The story is not good at all because even the main character forgets what he is doing. Overall the results are cliche.The art I'll admit is wonderful.

That made me very sceptical and I was actually scared to watch. But that feeling flew away within the first few episodes of Masamune-kun no Revenge.I think that the storyline is pretty unique. Someone getting bullied, a beautiful girl broke his heart. And now instead of accepting the fate that he could never reach her, he is trying to improve himself and goes through a tough process doing a lot of sport to loss weight and gain muscle. Howether, after this process he is...able to approach her in a very different situation and the mind to broke her heart as she did to him.The Art of the anime is really good and pretty as expected from a SIlver Link production. I felt the sound and especially the music made the anime unique at some situations and I don`t know how you feel, but the intro is definetely worth watching everytime.I think Masamume itself it a great, lovely and especially humorful character, but I`m not happy about it that he might will do the same as Aki did to him.I will say that I will give this anime an overall rating of 9/10, why? Because the genres are so matching. You definetely see sort of harem, a lot of comedy and romance. The fact that he might will break her heart during the next season If there will be any, what I hope because the letter in the last episode said so, is making me very uncomfortable to continue to watch this anime.Without the revenge, this anime could have been the best romance comedy animes of the winter season of 2017, or maybe the best of 4 seasons for me.

Whenever someone hurt us, whenever someone insult is, it already became our way of thinking to fight back, to get even. Though the concept of this anime is somewhat cliche, there is also something that capture my attention when watching this one. There is one thing I'm waiting to play in front of my eyes. I want the protagonist to be himself. To take away his mask and show the true him. Like what Neko said, he is charming and he just did not realize it. It is not worth...it to waste his time taking revenge to someone. In short, I ship Neko and Makabe, always!CHARACTER: 8/10It is always the tsundere one who's going to end up in a romance anime. But I hope in this one, Neko will end up with Makabe. He is too charming and simple minded. He is also a kind person and he take action to help as long as he can. Ge is somewhat narcissist and full of himself but it's what makes him cute. Cause he really does not know anything, most of the time. And who appreciate it all? Who's the person who accept it? I don't hate a tsundere character, in fact, I love Taiga's personality in Tora Dora. But of course, it's not always pushing away those people around them, a simple voicing out of their feelings would be good enough.SOUND AND ANIMATION: 9/10Masamune Makabe looks like Kirito of SAO, and the protagonist of the series The devil is a part timer, and also the one in Black Bullet. Oh! If Makabe looks like Kirito and Neko looks like Asuna, is there a chance that they'll end up together? The animation is somewhat common, but it's good. And I do love the song with Hadapure, though I really don't know it. Is it from a child's TV Program? The voices of the character also suit each others expression and actions. While the song is catchy and entertaining.ENJOYMENT: 10/10This series is cute and funny. Sometimes, it's also annoying that I want to take Aki away from the scenario. Well, that just means I'm hooked up watching it. I think it's somewhat a typical story, but watching something like this from time to time is good and the way the story deliver the scenarios are great so it breakeven.ENDING: 8/10This really tear my heart. Where's the next episode? I want to know who will end up together. I want to see more of Makabe's expression. When he's serious. When he's in pain. When he get enough of Aki's attitude and give up. I did want to continue it by reading in manga but after I'd check it out, it seems that the continuation is not that far. I'll be wating for season 2.

Neko and Makabe please!"", 'I usually would have a much more comprehensive and outlined review because that\'s just how I like to do things and it makes it easier for people to understand my points. BUT THIS ONE WILL BE AN EXCEPTION AND I WILL  JUMP RIGHT INTO SPOILERS AND I\'M JUST GONNA BE EVERYWHERE. If you haven\'t, please do watch the anime first before reading this review. You\'ll have a much better understanding of what I\'m about to talk about. Also, I might come off as harsh with this review but I just have a lot of questions, that\'s all. I actually don\'t despise this anime for...the record.With that out of the way, I only really have only have one question: WHY?WHY on earth would you give me a revenge plot only for you to not even commit to it in the end? I understand having other arcs in your story but abandoning your main narrative doesn\'t really count as an artistic choice. You just come off as confusing. I actually had some form of anticipation in the very beginning since the plot line is something I\'m not very familiar with when it comes to RomCom. A revenge story, cool, will they actually fall in love? Will he actually reject her spectacularly and get another girl? Or will it just have such a sad ending that nobody is happy at all? DAMNED IF I KNOW. This anime was too busy focusing on Masamune THINKING about his revenge and never gets on with it. IF YOU\'RE GONNA TEASE ME WITH A ROMANCE BETWEEN THEM, THEN GO WITH IT YOU COWARDS. Otherwise, stick with what you intended.WHY would you give me a memory of the protagonist being rejected by the heroine because he was fat only to show me that she actually liked him being fat?! YOU DIDN\'T EVEN EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS REJECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. The beginning episode of this anime will greet you with the arc of Masamune working out for the past 8 years of his life because he was rejected by Aki and called him a pig. We get reminded of this ""tragic"" backstory quite often through his flashbacks. My one concern though is the fact that later on in the series, Aki mentions that she actually loved Masamune when he was fat. WHAT\'S UP WITH THAT?! I get it, you wanna mix things up. Cool. Good for you. But at least  give me something to connect those two ideas with. For starters, it was never really revealed to Aki that Masamune was the fat kid in the past, so if you wanted that to happen, tough luck bud, it was only teased. Secondly, why did Aki call him a pig and rejected him if she actually liked him? We even see in Masamune\'s flashback that he had flowers for her but when she rejected him, he just dropped it on the spot, THEN in Aki\'s flashback, she actually found the flowers and waited for him to come back, which he never did since he did get rejected. SO WHAT DID HAPPEN? Give me something. Clear it up please. You don\'t even have to tell me the whole thing,  it can be subtle. Otherwise I\'m just here thinking one of them has a false memory or something.WHY is he still plotting revenge? Look, in the beginning, the plot was actually sounding pretty neat-o. I was genuinely interested for a while. But after everything that plays out, especially with Neko and Gasou coming in, Masamune didn\'t need his revenge anymore. WHAT\'S THE POINT OF THIS ANIME? Neko fell in love with him. Gasou (which by the way is a man who pissed me off at first but when I saw his character as a whole, he really doesn\'t have bad intentions) is gonna be married to Aki. There really is no loss here if he gave up on her. It would be much different if Masamune ACTUALLY fell in love with her and they develop romance. OR HELL, YOU CAN EVEN GO ON WITH YOUR REVENGE PLOT AND I\'LL SUPPORT YOU, BUT PLEASE, ACTUALLY STICK WITH IT. But no, the anime ends in a cheesy ""oh are they gonna kiss?"" thing. I think they had intentions for a second season which honestly sounds like it\'s just gonna drag this story pretty long when it could\'ve honestly been told with 13 episodes.So what\'s the verdict? Well, you can probably tell I\'m not the biggest fan. Saying that I\'m disappointed would mean I had some form of expectation, which I honestly didn\'t. It was (personally) an enticing plot but it falls apart immediately. There were some parts that I enjoyed but to be honest,  the only thing that sticks out is the fact that this anime seems to not have an idea of how to go through with his EPIC revenge plot that they decided to half-ass the ending.

The art and sound are mediocre, the characters are unrelatable and somwhat boring, and the show lacks alot of humor. On top of it all some of the plot points and episodes are suspiciously similar to Nisekoi. The story is what originally drew me in as i have always had a soft spot for cheesy rom-coms. But i do realise its not something to be praising...the anime for.-Spoilers-But the thing I have the most problems with is the ending. And it made me so mad i almost lost it. The whole point of the series is centered around the fact that he was a childhood friend and that he would get his revenge, but nothing happens. Nothing. I remember watching the last episode as i watch the timer slowly go downwards, i remember patiently waiting for the big finale. But as the timer slowly came closer and closer to zero. I realised that there would be no finale. I immediatly started searching for some kind of season 2, just to have some kind of conclusion. But absolutely nothing happens, meaning that i have succesfully wasted 4 hours of my life on a trash anime that lead nowhere. If you are reading this, dont watch this unless you REALLY feel intrigued by the plot. the anime for.-Spoilers-But the thing I have the most problems with is the ending.

Lets see.Story 8/10 : Basically in Masamune-Kun no Revenge we have our main protagonist Masamune Makabe, and this guy has a very unusual past. Eight years ago from the time where the story takes place our buddy Masamune used to be a fat loser. He was always getting bullied and called a pig. Without spoiling anything he meets a female named Adagaki Aki. Long story short he had a certain event happen to him to make him hate Adagaki. Then he proceeds to develop a sexy body and is no longer...a loser, and using this body he plans to get Adagaki to love him and then destroy her feelings as revenge (hence the name of the show ). The story seems like it would be goofy and stupid but it is suprisingly enjoyable. ( if you feel like the story wasnt full enough, read the manga to get a better sense of whats going on )Art & Sound 7/10 : The art in this show in my opinion was very good. The character designs were very beautiful and none of the characters had overly large boobs or wierd features. However ther were no moments i can recall with gorgeous backgrounds or noticable things like that ( thats why I have art at 8 instead of a 9 ). The sound was pretty unnoticable  and I guess the opening was not that bad but I usually skipped it. The voice actors all did a good job and none of the characters had annoying voices. So overall the sound was good but forgettable.Characters 8/10 : I believe the characters in this anime were the determining factor in if you like it or not. Adagaki ( the heroine ) is a really big asshole to everyone around her for certain reasons in her past and you can never really tell what she is thinking because she is very unpredictable in her actions. If her character sounds interesting to you it will greatly increase your enjoyment of the show. Masamune ( the MC ) is very different from Adakagi but similar at the same time. He is very popular and nice to everyone but all of the things he does are a part of his plan to become a "" hot guy "" so its kind of all a lie. He also has his master plan to get revenge which makes you think he is even more of an asshole deep down. The support characters in this show are all likable but kind of forgettable in my opinion because of how focused I was on Adakagi and Masamune\'s relationship. There is also a love triangle in the middle of the show, however I still could tell which girl he would choose. The characters are very unpredictable in this show and the main two develop nicely so thats why I give the characers an 8/10.Enjoyment 6.5/10 : After all of the good things I said about this show you were probably expecting a higher score here but that is not the case for two main reasons. The backstory of Masamune and Adagaki is revealed very slowly throughout the show. The other reason is that the ending was garbage  and unsatisfying but I guess that is a little bit unfair because I believe the show is eventually getting a second season.Overall 7/10 : In conclusion this is a decent anime to watch if you are simply looking for new animes in the genre because like me you seem to have seen everything else. It has its cute moments and the story is pretty good and unique. Another thing about this show was that the pacing was very good as even though there is only 12 episodes, I felt like it was longer which was a bonus for me. I also realized that this anime did not really seem like a harem but I know why it is in that genre from the manga. The ecchi tag is also on a barely needed level as there was next to no ecchi it seemed to me at least.I feel I had to add this part at the end. I highly recommend that you watch this anime and then read the manga afterwards. It goes more into detail on the story and it is ongoing as well so it continues after the anime ending. I give this anime a 7/10 but i would give the manga an 8.5.This was my first review. a loser, and using this body he plans to get Adagaki to love him and then destroy her feelings as revenge (hence the name of the show ).

The only reason for people to not enjoy it is because it isn't finished. Is as if you are watching a 26 episode anime and it was canceled after chapter 20, so you don't get to watch the ending.The story is enjoyable, there are some characters that look like cliché but then they turn not to be so. I LOVED how stupid Masamune-kun worked so hard to achieve his goals, (for a change, the main character isn't someone who just has everyone else in the anime giving him/her everything for free, even the deus ex...machina), he is clueless but a hard worker.There are a lot of cliché characters but there are others that get to develop and so, they become more interesting.Finally, I wouldn't have missed this trip even if I knew before-hand that it doesn't have an ending. machina), he is clueless but a hard worker.There are a lot of cliché characters but there are others that get to develop and so, they become more interesting.Finally, I wouldn't have missed this trip even if I knew before-hand that it doesn't have an ending."", '""Masamune-Kun\'s Revenge"" stands out in the crowded field of harem anime with its unique spin on the genre. It presents a story that, at first glance, appears to follow the traditional harem formula but quickly diverges with its focus on revenge rather than romance. The protagonist, Masamune, seeks to turn the tables on his childhood crush, Aki, by making her fall for him only to reject her, a plot that introduces a refreshing narrative of personal transformation and retribution.While the series indulges in some typical genre conventions, such as predictable plotlines and fan service, it distinguishes itself with its approach to storytelling and character development....The narrative is peppered with twists that keep the viewer engaged, and the pacing is well-managed, blending comedy and drama effectively.The animation and sound design are competent, supporting the story without stealing the spotlight. Character development is adequate, with some characters falling into familiar tropes but still offering enough depth to maintain interest. The series\' exploration of themes like self-improvement and the consequences of revenge adds a layer of complexity not often found in harem anime.Overall, ""Masamune-Kun\'s Revenge"" offers a distinctive experience within its genre, making it a worthwhile watch for those seeking a harem anime with a twist. Its execution may not be flawless, but it provides a compelling narrative that balances humor, drama, and a bit of introspection.Story  15/25Art  7/10Music  7/10Characters  15/20Enjoyment  12/15Thematic Execution  15/20Overall Rating: 71/100This anime is a refreshing take on the harem genre, offering something more than just the typical romantic entanglements.

Would rather be a 24 ep series than a 12 ep series with a cliffhanger that the 2nd season will appear a few years in advance. I feel like it will most fans frustrated because the ending was very vague on what Aki feels. A few ep back we were introduced to another antagonist but so few were to explain how deep their relationship is which makes me so frustrated haha. overall good anime but please stop with the cliff hangers T-T. ', 'I liked this anime, but only until the 9th episode.There is a story that is well thought out, however not everyone will like it, the realization of the anime is excellent, the roles / lines of each character are great and go according to the story.However, they managed to ruin the whole story and characters, in 3 final episodes, which I am really sorry because it would be an anime with a fantastic note, and that in my opinion does not pass 6/10 in the classification.However for those who like an anime of the type romance and history I think you will not regret seeing,...although if you have an opinion similar to mine, you will be very disappointed in the final episodes. although if you have an opinion similar to mine, you will be very disappointed in the final episodes.', ""After watching 12 episodes of this anime, I knew a lot of people give negative thought about this anime but don't get me wrong, I kidda of like and enjoy it.

The story build up nicely and simple, can say almost like Nisekoi feeling. I slightly sad about OVA series which is not that good and mixed bag, as for 12 episodes is quite good I think. No annoying characters in this anime which is nice. I like Masamune-kun and Aki Adagaki...hating each other weakness, be punish at the pool scene, Masamune-kun buying bread for Aki Adagaki due to her easily stomuch rumbles extreme hungry, kidda funny and interesting.

So I\'d like to point out things that can be noticed.- Typos, exaggerated descriptions, unusual behavior, and different opinions.Let\'s start!STORY:From what I understood about the story, it derives from Makabe Masamune wanting revenge for the cruel girl who rejected her. Well, it\'s pretty original. Though as the story progresses, you can notice each flaw. I don\'t have anything else to say about the story nor do I have problems but it is certainly lacking....ART:The art is seemingly the life-saver of the anime. It animate\'s the characters beautifully. Hair physics are pretty well done, the studio\'s budget came pretty handily. I don\'t seem to notice sluggish movements, and it well derives the mood. Whenever the mood focuses on sexiness, it expresses it firmly. Whenever it cringes, it also expresses it perfectly.Sound:The OST isn\'t the best, but it is beyond average so its pretty fine to me. No more to say about the sounds.CHARACTERS:Ah, finally. Say, If I were the MC. If I had to pick between Aki Adagaki or Neko Fujinomiya, I\'d prefer Neko. It seems like Neko was the only one who fought her love for Makabe, I\'m basing about worthiness. Yeah yeah, Aki misses her chubby friend, not realizing its Makabe. But we all agree that Aki is complete Ditchhole.""That\'s why they named her *X NAME*!""At first, I loved the Makabe\'s relationship with Aki, it all seemed cute and quite amusing at some occasions. But as soon as Neko came, I\'d had a feeling Neko was the plot device. It turned out for me was the complete opposite. Neko deserved WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than Aki. After the arrival of *Mr.*ImposterChubbyPants, I was really infuriated at how quickly she believed it was her childhood friend. Without confirming, on the other hand. Yoshino was more than a supporting character, I\'d say she was my favorite from all of them. She had done the best job for Makabe. She deserves an oscar. Makabe\'s mom is a Lolli device. His sister was Moe. So this was my review of the characters. Sorry if I exaggerated too much.Enjoyment:Well, I enjoyed the first 9 episodes, but after watching 10-12, I was quite disappointed.

I see that many speak badly about this anime, personally I enjoyed it, it's a shame that it has an open end. The truth bothers me the protagonist, has a very unpleasant attitude and makes and humiliates many people in a cruel way, in addition to making silly silly decisions and not being honest things happen. I was also irritated by the boy who was posing as a masamune. Omitting that, I laughed a lot and enjoyed it. I would recommend it, despite not being the best I think is good.Spanish:...La historia es bastante interesante y divertida.

También me irritaba el chico que se hacía pasar por masamune. Además probablemente la historia debió de cerrar algunos cabos y desarollarse mejor.

The beginning was entertaining and sometimes it was good, but there are a lot of things that don't make any sense. Let's not talk about the ending, which makes no sense at all, who ends an anime with a karaoke episode? I don't understand why some characters do something or the other thing, they change personality according to what the plot needs them to do. I find some traits of this anime toxic, but the anime makes you think that they're perfectly fine (not valuing others' feelings, being treated like a slave, the man is always the...one after the woman, etc). I don't see the point on making such a big drama over Neko, she wasn't gonna die, was it necessary so much drama and flashbacks for something that had no importance in the story? And what illness can be cured just in a month after doing one surgery? Seems unrealistic. And I don't understand why the cold princess fell in love with the fake Masamune, I thought she wanted all boys to get out of her life because they never come to save her. I don't see how, between rich families, they didn't realize that the fake Masamune's family went bankrupt and that he's only there for money.Too many things don't make any sense. one after the woman, etc).

But as episodes goes by, it gets very boring to watch.Story: 3/10The story is centered around Makabe Masamune who is plotting to revenge against Adagaki Aki. That’s it. No serious plot twist or anything. Truth to be told, I think the story would be much better if the main heroine is Fujinomiya Neko.Art: 9/10It’s very good. Characters are beautifully drawn.  Backgrounds are lively as my backyard. Adagaki Aki is a candy to my eye. This is the only thing this anime could be proud of.Sound:...6/10OP and ED songs actually fun to listen.

I\'ll explain why so you can kind of get what I am worked up about. Also, fair warning I will say a bit of cuss words as it suits what I am saying with emotion.The art was the most horrible animation I have seen in recent years of watching anime. There are some areas where it looks good but then the faces are completely messed up and horrible. I am artist myself I felt that animators didn\'t know what they were...doing. I can\'t stress enough that even poorly written animes such as this one; it would of been better if they try to make the faces appealing in majority of the anime. Do they do this? NO, they don\'t fucking do this. A lot of the screentime they don\'t look good especially at certain angles. It felt like they put them in photoshop and press CTRL+T and tried to make them look like they belonged in those dramatic angles. It didn\'t work, nothing about the way they drew the animation worked. The backgrounds are pretty generic,  nothing stands out as new but those were better than animation of the characters.-I actually liked the soundtrack and felt this was the best part of the series. The director did good on this area and I am happy with the results in every scene which made this easier to watch as long as I did.-Now onto the real issue I had with it: The Story and characters.-To start with this anime claims it\'s about revenge when in reality it is not even about it. I can\'t even wrap my head around it but it just turned into harem after harem. The whole anime is set up on the fuel Masamune uses to want revenge on a girl. Well, it could of been as simple as they explained the reasoning in the beginning about being hurt over other\'s cruelness in the past. Which the idea in itself is interesting to see because you know two things already with a few minutes into the series. One, the characters are flawed and will need change. Two, the characters are different from one another. They didn\'t use any of the two things I mentioned. The story is flat and it could of went other routes that would of made it interesting and new. It ended up being the same old story about harem romance. Had some good pacing and first few episodes weren\'t bad but then episode 4 comes along then throws another girl into the mix. Just when I thought the harem is over they bring another character into the mix. UGHHHH//// The thing that can make or break harem animes is the conflict and solution part. Toradora is good example of how to do a harem right, it isn\'t unrealistic as majority of animes. This anime is with the majority. The revenge isn\'t in the story anymore after 8 episodes. Just becomes an anime that is about people fighting over one character\'s love. To sum up the route the anime took: Harem is not over yet just you wait until we add another character in, don\'t worry it\'s not a character flaw it\'s a misunderstanding. Eye for an eye would of been more filled with climaxes, solutions, conflicts, and deep story. This anime is what could of  been a better story but destroys all of it. The whole story is filled with a build up that leads to nothing at all. It just keeps building up and falling down never hitting the right amount of conflict or climax the story needed. The only conflict is played out to be a mistunderstanding in the end so they can have a chance at true love.The characters are okay but some of them are just bad. The male lead ""Makabe, Masamune"", he is superficial and popular among his school mates. He use to be fat so this is used as fuel for him becoming thin and trying to use his new appearance to manipulate others. He is the alright character in the series, near the end his personality and flaws that made the character were destroyed. He became this generic anime guy that we see in so much animes already. All the interesting things about him are gone.The canon ""Adagaki, Aki"", she is cold princess and bosses everyone around because people fear and like her. Her rejections of so many males doesn\'t have any back lash. The show only gives one scene with a guy trying to cut her hair which is not for the sake of cause and affect. That is it, nothing after that no rumors or people talking poorly of her actions. There is no back lash for any of the character\'s actions especially Aki. It breaks the very rule of reactions cause reactions. Meaning if one character does something then another character can react. The anime doesn\'t have any depth to her character other than she is cruel because she was heart broken as a child. Really? They would of made this character have better reason for rejecting guys that could of made her happy. Her character is hollow and lacks any true strong flaws. Her personality goes from shy to nice to rude to I don\'t care to I do care.""Cinderella, Shishou"" her character made no sense and really was only there to move the poor story along. Her personality is to airhead to sharp then to moe to robotic. At this point I think you get all the characters are poorly written. Her whole reasoning is because she wants to make her own life easier and that\'s it. Most of the stuff this character does through is not even cruel other than the few remarks about being slow. That is about it.Finally,"" Neko Fujinomiya"" She is the only character that was decent in the whole series. She didn\'t have the ever changing personality and her actions had reasoning behind it. She even lies in the sake to help the person she loves get what they want. I ended up liking her more than the canon since she was just better written. When I say written I don\'t  mean she is 100% likable, she has flaws that stay the same through most of her time on screen. Only character that actually follows the cause and effect in the whole anime. Writing on this character should of been applied to other characters it would of made the series better.-To end everythingI will  never finish this series and I will not watch the second season as these type of shows make me mad and uninterested in quickly. I don\'t wanna even go into the design of the uniforms since I don\'t wanna do a whole essay ranting about how horrible and shit they are. doing.

I can\'t even wrap my head around it but it just turned into harem after harem. The whole anime is set up on the fuel Masamune uses to want revenge on a girl. Well, it could of been as simple as they explained the reasoning in the beginning about being hurt over other\'s cruelness in the past. Which the idea in itself is interesting to see because you know two things already with a few minutes into the series. One, the characters are flawed and will need change. Two, the characters are different from one another. They didn\'t use any of the two things I mentioned. The story is flat and it could of went other routes that would of made it interesting and new. It ended up being the same old story about harem romance. Had some good pacing and first few episodes weren\'t bad but then episode 4 comes along then throws another girl into the mix. Just when I thought the harem is over they bring another character into the mix. UGHHHH//// The thing that can make or break harem animes is the conflict and solution part. Toradora is good example of how to do a harem right, it isn\'t unrealistic as majority of animes. This anime is with the majority. The revenge isn\'t in the story anymore after 8 episodes. Just becomes an anime that is about people fighting over one character\'s love. To sum up the route the anime took: Harem is not over yet just you wait until we add another character in, don\'t worry it\'s not a character flaw it\'s a misunderstanding. Eye for an eye would of been more filled with climaxes, solutions, conflicts, and deep story. This anime is what could of  been a better story but destroys all of it. The whole story is filled with a build up that leads to nothing at all. It just keeps building up and falling down never hitting the right amount of conflict or climax the story needed. The only conflict is played out to be a mistunderstanding in the end so they can have a chance at true love.The characters are okay but some of them are just bad. The male lead ""Makabe, Masamune"", he is superficial and popular among his school mates. He use to be fat so this is used as fuel for him becoming thin and trying to use his new appearance to manipulate others. He is the alright character in the series, near the end his personality and flaws that made the character were destroyed. He became this generic anime guy that we see in so much animes already. All the interesting things about him are gone.The canon ""Adagaki, Aki"", she is cold princess and bosses everyone around because people fear and like her. Her rejections of so many males doesn\'t have any back lash. The show only gives one scene with a guy trying to cut her hair which is not for the sake of cause and affect. That is it, nothing after that no rumors or people talking poorly of her actions. There is no back lash for any of the character\'s actions especially Aki. It breaks the very rule of reactions cause reactions. Meaning if one character does something then another character can react. The anime doesn\'t have any depth to her character other than she is cruel because she was heart broken as a child. Really? They would of made this character have better reason for rejecting guys that could of made her happy. Her character is hollow and lacks any true strong flaws. Her personality goes from shy to nice to rude to I don\'t care to I do care.""Cinderella, Shishou"" her character made no sense and really was only there to move the poor story along. Her personality is to airhead to sharp then to moe to robotic. At this point I think you get all the characters are poorly written. Her whole reasoning is because she wants to make her own life easier and that\'s it. Most of the stuff this character does through is not even cruel other than the few remarks about being slow. That is about it.Finally,"" Neko Fujinomiya"" She is the only character that was decent in the whole series. She didn\'t have the ever changing personality and her actions had reasoning behind it. She even lies in the sake to help the person she loves get what they want. I ended up liking her more than the canon since she was just better written. When I say written I don\'t  mean she is 100% likable, she has flaws that stay the same through most of her time on screen. Only character that actually follows the cause and effect in the whole anime. Writing on this character should of been applied to other characters it would of made the series better.-To end everythingI will  never finish this series and I will not watch the second season as these type of shows make me mad and uninterested in quickly. I don\'t wanna even go into the design of the uniforms since I don\'t wanna do a whole essay ranting about how horrible and shit they are.', ""STORY: The title speaks for itself as Masamune tries to get his revenge against Aki-chan. For 12 episodes, there is a lot of hype and momentum where it seems Masamune will win. Overtime, it looks like his revenge may take him into another direction. There is also some funny moments, a bit of fan service, and origins of the characters past and reason for wanting revenge.CHARACTERS:MASAMUNE MAKABE: He is part of a wealthy family, and lives with his mom (who looks like could possibly be seen as his younger sister). Plus, he actually has a little sister too. His reputation is being the good looking,...hot guy at his high school. His motto in life involves being healthy and maintaining that lifestyle. His personality traits: funny, dense, clueless at times, (possibly narcissistic) but he is also caring.AKI ADAGAKI: (aka the Cruel Princess). She is a SAVAGE and has her own group (sounds like Mean Girls). She is also part of a rich family. Growing up, she is also very mean. Whenever guys tries to ask her out or make a move on her... She bullies them by getting a permanent marker and write it down on their shirt or body parts (i.e.: fore head or stomach). But there is also another side to her, she can be very sweet and kind.OVERALL: After watching the first episode, I had a feeling that Masamune would not be getting his revenge by the end of the series. Hopefully there is a season 2 that will give some kind of indication of revenge. I feel really bad for Masamune. It's great that he's very healthy and maintains that lifestyle, but the anime really shows the psychology and his state of mind of how he truly feels. Adagaki-san is a savage as (bleep). She is very merciless and I would love to see her in her vulnerable state (as Masamune) when she is extremely hurt. Later on in the series, there is a part with one character in the anime that did not go in-depth (as much, ohh okay maybe a lot). I still pray for a season 2 because the ending was kind of a let down. hot guy at his high school. His motto in life involves being healthy and maintaining that lifestyle.

He grows up and he thinks she didn't like him because he was fat. The girl actually likes the boy very much, but she doesn't trust males. The boy tries yet again to make her fall in love with him and then planning to irrationaly deny her. The plot gives me an headache but I'm correct. Honestly, the plot feels very cringey to me and it just hurts reading what I have just written. Several things happen...in the anime, he goes to a japanese high school, the girls like him there because he is attractive.. (i'm depressed now). Pathetic proposals to the main heroine and she denies them all and gives them stupid nicknames which I've forgotten. The main heroine has some kind of feminist anti-male cult.

There was also a lot of promise with the characters of this show and it made me really want to know about them, but very few characters really had extensive backstories while others, it\'s just a small comment about what they do, there is very little character development, and some characters I just got sick of. This show is by far not great, but there were things I enjoyed about, it being a ""RomCom"", harem, high school, etc... I enjoyed that aspect of it like I do with Most.

(just in case)STORY (3/10): For an anime about revenge, there seemed to be less and less revenge/plotting revenge happening as the anime progressed. The revenge plot seemed to be the main focus for about 5 or 6 episodes and then the story just went off in its own direction. And as far as the ending goes, it was probably the most lackluster ending I\'ve seen in an anime. Why would you have your main climactic point be in the middle of the last episode and then have the last half of the episode feel more like filler than actual story progression? The last...3 minutes didn\'t even feel like the ending even though it was played off as ""story progression"". This had a very definite ""We\'re planning on a season 2!"" or ""Go read the manga!"" ending. Also, throwing a major plot twist into the tenth episode really confused me, especially since they didn\'t really resolve that whole situation.ART (5/10): Nothing special about the animation on this one. It looked very much like your average high school anime. It wasn\'t bad by any means, but it didn\'t stand out from the crowd.SOUND (5/10): Same as the art. Nothing special. The OP was okay, but I wouldn\'t rank it among my favorites.CHARACTER (3/10): I didn\'t feel any kind of connection to any of these characters. If I\'m into the story and the characters, I\'ll get this kind of excitement/nervousness for the ending, no matter how predictable it is. I didn\'t get that with this. Makabe was a jerk most of the time, only occasionally showing that he could be a decent human being. His mother looking like a 12 year old lolly and Makabe actually calling her Lolly Hag was just very strange. Aki seemed like your average tsundere, but I didn\'t find myself liking or hating her at any given time -- she was just kind of there. The character development in this was absolutely zero, which can usually be expected from this type of anime, but when the characters feel very flat from the beginning, there should be SOME kind of change in them by the end. I just didn\'t feel emotionally invested in them.ENJOYMENT (3/10): Honestly, the episodes went by pretty quickly for me. I didn\'t find myself constantly checking to see how much longer I had to watch each episode. However, I did find myself questioning what the heck I\'d just watched at the end of every episode starting at around episode 6 or 7. The ending really killed this for me.OVERALL (4/10): Everything combined averages out to a 3.8, but I\'ll round that up to a 4. It was honestly not the worst anime I\'ve ever seen, but it certainly wasn\'t the best. If they do end up continuing this, I\'m not sure that I\'ll be willing to keep watching. 3 minutes didn\'t even feel like the ending even though it was played off as ""story progression"".

It is in no way groundbreaking, or revolutionary to the romantic-comedy anime scene, but delivers just enough with each episode to keep you watching to the end of its short-lived season. Although I was entertained, I would never regard it as a particularly ""good"" anime.On it\'s own, the plot is simply very unrealistic; in many instances we see the main character doing things that contrast with his own previously made statements, and the very premise of the main character working out for years to improve his physique, passing an entrance exam...with a perfect score, and desperately trying to make a girl fall in love with him for the sole purpose of dumping this girl to take revenge on her for something that happened when he was basically a toddler, is idiotic in its own right.Despite the main protagonist\'s incredibly stupid reason  for most of his actions throughout the show(and his enormous ego), one can\'t help but be somewhat invested in the series for the sake of seeing him carry out his goal. Another thing that makes this show worthwhile is the interesting dynamic between Masamune and Adagaki-san - I can\'t help but laugh at the sheer irony of the main character simping so hard for a girl he claims to hate.Masamune-kun no Revenge can be incredibly funny at times, but it\'s certainly far from perfect(like very, very far), so my advice to you is that if you do decide to give it a try, don\'t go expecting a series with some sort of hidden meaning or characters you would love to see yourself becoming like, and don\'t even bother trying to explain to other people why you watch it at all.

The characters are funny and eccentric in their own ways, while the chemistry between the main leads can be compelling at times. Of course, the characters tend to stray to archetypes of the genre but they are funny enough to be okay.My main nitpick of the show is that its conclusion is completely unsatisfactory.

I was very happy to see a different approach at a romance anime, until I realized that it was ultimately as basic as it could be, with little development.As I said before, the premise really intrigued me. A romance which takes a different route than your average anime, with 'revenge' being the main drive of the plot, or so it is advertised. In reality however, there doesn't really happen anything at all.This is mostly because of our main character. He has a goal, but he seems to forget it at every important moment. He wants revenge,...oh wait no; He wants to help because- oh never mind, he wants revenge again. I can deal with a little confusion, concerning the fact whether or not he's 'in-love'. But our main character seems to suffer from dementia every time an event has happened. Every time a plot point has finished, it's as if we start all over again. It's frustrating.Overall though, the anime does seem to have good points. The art is impressive, though not outstanding, and there are genuinely funny moments in here. As long as the anime doesn't take itself too seriously it seems to do just fine. It's just as if it can't decide what to do with the story, and therefore does nothing at all. oh wait no; He wants to help because- oh never mind, he wants revenge again.

After watching all episodes I quite enjoyed it but understand where some issues are.Story: 7Good: The idea of getting revenge from breaking someone's heart is an unpleasant thing to do. I was expecting not to like the main protagonist for this reason but after watching his backstory I could understand his character better and grew to sympathise with him. The main love interest would be normally a character I could not stand but they show though glimpses that she is actually a nice person who has a...reason why she is like the way she is. All other characters I did enjoy and had some funny moments with. Every episode I enjoyed watching and did laugh occasionally.Bad: The last three episodes are not very good. The characters that cause the final events to occur are not well thought out and just annoyed me watching them. The back stories for their motives are also weak with some massive plot holes. Also the overall motive of the MC seems to die down and his motives are unclear to the audience. The karaoke scene at the end seems to be filler, along with a lot of the last episode.There is also NO conclusion to ANYTHING as they obviously were trying to get a second series.

Please note that this review may contain minor spoilers. Enjoy!Story: Masamune-kun no Revenge entails the story of young Masamune Makabe and Aki Adagaki. What makes this stand out from standard romcoms is that Masamune aims to break her heart as she did to him long ago, instead of aiming to be a true couple. However, Aki’s pristine looks and ice cold nature of turning down any who dare ask her out while also giving them a humiliating nickname has earned her the moniker “Cruel Princess.” Will Masamune have his revenge, or will Aki crush him like everyone...prior to him?Characters: Overall, the characters in this show each have their own charm and quirks to make them likeable and possibly relatable in a way. While our grand MC is sometimes as dumb as a brick and can’t take a hint, he still works earnestly towards his goal. Aki’s tsundere-type actions and thoughts are surprisingly not boring and can still be entertaining to see how she reacts to his advances. Fujinomiya Neko plays the girl that loves Masamune since the moment the met, and acts extremely flirty, forward, amongst other things whilst keeping her reason for her love a secret. The supporting characters in the show add some spice and variety (specifically Koiwai Yoshino aka “Master”), but are limited in how much they participate at times.Main Point: Masamune-kun no Revenge was a fairly well received show this season, landing in the 7.5 and up zone (as of writing this review) and for the most part, this is a fairly above how I felt the show should be rated overall as well (with my score being a 6 out of 10). What makes this show enjoyable from a viewer’s standpoint is that while it is from the romcom / harem genre, it doesn’t overdo it like *some* shows. Granted, the story isn’t too original and is quite honestly bland at some points (i.e. the test of courage scene). Other than cute girls, some fanservice, and a rather mediocre soundtrack, Masamune-kun no Revenge relies more so on keeping it a lighthearted-fun show while trying to keep you interested with how Masamune learns to make Aki fall in love with him. You can easily drop in and out of watching with full attention just to catch the main points per episode and still understand what’s going on.TL;DR – All in all, Masamune-kun no Revenge is a fairly standard romcom / harem show that you can easily jump in and out of, but you shouldn’t expect any insane twists or huge character developments. This show isn’t a bad place to start if you’re looking to get into this type of genre, and just as easily enjoyable if you’re a veteran watcher.

So as I was watching this I was thinking this is a fairly good anime. It had a few plot holes and overly cringey moments here and there but I was able to over look them. I probably would've given it about a 9 rating. That was until kanetsugu gasou was introduced and wow. He genuinely just ruined it. It was episode 10 or 11 and I was considering dropping it just because it was so awful. So many plot holes. While watching the openings that led up to the introduction of him I thought he would've been...one of masamunes bullies that realized who he was. I feel like this would've been a much better path to approach but hey we will let it slide. This could've easily been a one season 12 episode anime but of course they had to drag it out for that $$. I'm also not quite sure what sort of a ending that was. When I finished watching it I had to go back and make sure I wasn't missing and episode or something because I just watched 12 episodes for that... What. Since I won't judge an anime by one or two episode I figured I would still give it an 8 because I was feeling considerate.

They\'re arrogant and often act nonsensically, with the titular Masamune relying on manga and magazines to figure out how-to romance. Hell, there seemed to be actual development at the tail end of Fujinomiya\'s arc (episode 9), but then that gets reversed by the start of episode 10. And there\'s no solid ending with the subplot...that started in episode 10 not being resolved. It\'s just left open with a ""to be continued"" sign at the end, yet no promises of a second season or OVAs or a movie. I get that it\'s adapted from an ongoing manga, but that\'s no reason to leave gaping plot holes. It will be a better show if it gets an ending. A real ending.

Watch at your own risk.', 'This review contains spoilers.It\'s hard to rate this anime as there are so many good and bad things that can be said about it, so I will point those things out and try to weigh it.Masamune-kun no Revenge, as the title suggests, is the story of Makabe Masamune trying to get revenge on the girl who rejected him in his childhood when he as a little fat boy. And in order to do so, he became a muscle head, doing his best to become a hottie and attract all the girs. His ultimate goal is to make the girl who once rejected him fall for...him and then reject her. The premise was interesting and funny, in the beginning of the anime we see Masamune\'s frame of mind, he thinks beauty is all that matters and will always have his way as long as his is beautiful, and this is confirmed by the way he is treated by the other characters in the first scenes. When Masamune arrives at the school, It\'s known that the girl who rejected him, Adagaki Aki, is there and there\'s a funny introduction of her character showing her rejecting a boy in front of all the students. Adagaki is a tsundere, hot tempered and haughty who is known for rejecting all the boys who try anything on her. So far so good, this setting was engaging and could make for a good story, showing Masamune\'s endeavor to accomplish his goal. Unfortunately, the way in which the story developed was not interesting and the humor was for the most part really bad, there were some good scenes, but most of them were just annoying and childish like the characters yelling and overreacting in a ""funny"" way. The plot wavered between boring cliché and ridiculous nonsense.The first part of the story is Masamune and Adaki meeting and the start of his revenge plan. Adagaki doesn\'t remember Masamune, which is understandable for he changed so much in appearance and thinks she is meeting him for the first time. The start of their relationship was really unexpected for me, as Masamune acts as a simp for Adagaki and is constantly telling he liker her, instead of making her fall for him and rejecting her afterwards as you would expect with the premise of the anime. The revenge deal already got really confusing here, would he just say ""Joke is on you, I was only pretending liking you"" after she finally succumb to him? I think that would be pointless and wouldn\'t really fulfil the revenge, but that\'s how the it  goes. During this part, it\'s introduced another important character for the story, Adagaki\'s servant, Koiwai Yoshino. Yoshino is aware of Masamune being the fat boy once rejected by Adagaki and his plans, and is willing to help him, since she wants to humble Adagaki, thinking it would be good for her. Yoshino becomes a crucial character in the story as she is constantly helping Masamune in every arc, giving information and tips for him, and she is a funny character, so I really liked her addiction in to the story.The next girl added to Masamune\'s harem is Fujinomiya Neko. Fujinomiya is introduced as a meek and sweet girl, who, for some reason, is in love with Masamune. Her introduction scene makes the viewer believe that she has known him from before but he doesn\'t remember it, and that there\'s a reason behind she liking him. Masamune rejects her many times during the anime, using the revenge as an excuse, but it can be inferred that he still really likes Adagaki or had developed feelings for her while trying his plan. Fujinomiya\'s arc is appalling, not only her introduction felt off, but we get to know later that there\'s no reason for her to like him, she just chose randomly. There are some good scenes like the replication of the roof scene that she read in a manga and the dialogue in the hospital. That dialogue scene should be a turning point in the plot as it makes Masamune reflect on his relationship with Adagaki, and there\'s a lot of explanation on Fujinomiya\'s character, it tells that she has a bad healthy and a lot of things are explained by that. That scene could be really good, except that her character was bad and her relationship with Masamune was shallow, so it was hard to care, and it got worse when the scene was ruined by the revelation of how she came to like him in the middle of the scene.The last arc is about a contest between Masamune and the new antagonist, Kanetsugu. Kanetsugu is a chubby boy who has a nickname of ""Masamune"" and uses it for his advantage, pretending he is the Masamune that once got rejected by Adagaki. In this arc, we get to know that Adagaki actually likes fatties and that she actually longs for the Masamune that she rejected when she was a kid. That makes the plot really confusing and raises a lot of questions which are not answered by the end of the anime. Adagaki and Kanetsugu have a lovey-dovey relationship which enrages Masamune. Their discord ends up in a contest between Kanetsugu and Masamune\'s classes doing a Snow White play and deciding who is the winner by votes. How it ended up like that is something that can\'t be fathomed unfortunately as it was a result of nonsensical scenes chain reaction. This arc was just boring all around and didn\'t have many qualities, the only good scene is Masamune\'s entering the stage in place of Kanetsugu. The anime ends after that arc without conclusion.One good point of the story which is important mention is the ecchi content. There are a lot of those scenes in the anime, and some of them were really good and tried to carry the plot. Special mention to the pool scene in episode 5 in which we got to see a beautiful display of Adagaki\'s figure. Another scene that deserves attention is when she changes clothes in episode 3 and shows a piece of pink garment. Those scenes are particularly pleasant for someone who likes Adagaki. There are many others like Yoshino\'s panty shots, but those were the ones that were worth mentioning the most here.The characters were the best thing in this anime for me and saved it from being a complete disaster. When I was watching the first episodes, I really hated them and was thinking about being them as a bad point when reviewing later. But they grew on me as the story went on and by the end of the anime, I came to love most of the characters. Masamune is a character with good ideals, while it may be exaggerated sometimes, there\'s truth to his beliefs regarding the importance of image, affecting how the worlds treats you. He is not a good or bad guy, which is a good point to give depth to his character and make him more unpredictable. The bad thing about him is that he is incredibly stupid, that makes for some funny scenes but sometimes it\'s jut annoying, but that\'s a common think in this kind of anime. The fact he has changed so much both physically and mentally compared to his child version makes you esteem his current character. Adagaki is probably my favourite character, she is the typical tsundere type which I\'m fond of, her design is very cute, and I like the fact she is not crazy in love with the main character despite it being a harem anime. Her feelings towards Masamune are developed steadily along the anime and they are subtly displayed. It\'s hard to have a full grasp on her character as many things were left unanswered in the anime, but it appears the way she treats and reject men are due to some insecurity she has, which added another layer to her personality. She also has an ingenuous side as it\'s shown in the date scene when she was deceived into thinking it was a normal thing to wear a cosplay attire in the first date, that is probably due to her being overly spoiled for being so rich and always having people doing things for her, which makes her somewhat cute and funny. Her apparent eating disorder also makes for some funny interactions throughout the anime.Yoshino is also my favourite along with Adagaki. She has a important role in the story helping Masamune and their interactions were really cute and funny, like him calling her ""shishou"". I didn\'t like her in the beginning as I thought she was just a lifeless servant for Adagaki and wouldn\'t be more than that, but I liked her more with each scene. She is introduced as a clumsy and naive girl, but it\'s shown later that she is actually very smart and cunning, she can be described as a kuudere in terms of her personality. I wondered if she was part of the harem, because it was not clear if she had any feelings for Masamune, at least in this anime. Her personality along with her design make for a really lovable character. Unfortunately, she didn\'t get an arc for her, so there was lack in depth of her character in my opinion. Fujinomiya, as I talked in the story section, didn\'t have a good introduction and was not an interesting character at all for me, even her design is plain and could pass for a random character. One thing that distinguished her a lot was her way of speaking excessively formal, like saying ""watakushi"" instead of ""watashi"" and just a formal language in general. Her insistence without any reasons for Masamune was annoying. That being said, after her arc she became a lot better with some development, she was more restrained and became the cheerful girl who would be there when Masamune needed, and there were also some hints of a relationship between her and Kojuurou, which was really cute, but it was just a tease as it didn\'t develop to anything in this anime, one more thing that was just teased and ended up in nothing.Those four are pretty much the relevant character in the story, there are other that you could mention by they don\'t have much relevance. For example, Futaba Tae, who is another girl in the harem, and is portrayed as an important character sometimes like in the ending, when she seems to be as important as the other girls. But she doesn\'t actually have any importance in the story and little to none development. I don\'t dislike her character, she is fine as one of Masamune\'s friends, but that\'s just it, she is unremarkable. Kojuurou is Totsuka from Oregairu, seriously, it\'s the same deal, a kind and feminine boy who is mistaken as a girl and is friendly towards the mc. The things about Futaba can also be said about him, he is just fine as Masamune\'s friend, but at least there was a tease of a possible romance between him and Fujinomiya. Those are the characters worth mentioning, but I will just add that Masamune\'s mother is a little girl, which took me a while to realize. I thought it was his imouto or something, and it was really funny when I saw it.The art was good, but nothing too impressive to elevate my assessment of the anime.There were some scenes that had striking visuals, It was a lot better than some other animes that I watched from SILVER LINK., so it exceeded my expectations on this regard.The OST was overused in this anime and this was one of the worse things about it. There are a lot of different music, many of them are good and there were some great usage in some memorable scenes. But for the most part, it was so excessive, specially in the first episodes, that it got annoying, even for a comedy. I loved both the opening and ending, the opening pretty much tells all the story and has a catchy song. The ending was even better, they were so good that I thought the anime was good as well every time I was watching them, until the episode began. The voice acting was good overall, I was not familiar with the VAs for the protagonists, the voices for Adagaki, Yoshino and Kojuurou were particularly remarkable for me, which was expected from Hayamin and Inorin, but Ohashi Ayaka was a great surprise for me. Masamune\'s VA was ok, pretty average I think.Despite all the flaws, this anime was enjoyable for me overall, mainly because I like this genre and I am not fussy about it. I wouldn\'t recommend it for everyone though, as I don\'t think anyone can enjoy it considering the weak plot, but only for people who really like this kind of anime and are not picky about the animes they watch. It also made me excited to know more about and read the manga, which I\'m not sure if it is a good thing or not. All in all, this anime was a disappointment, as there were so many good things about it, and still ended up being mediocre or just fine. It could and should be much better. him and then reject her. The premise was interesting and funny, in the beginning of the anime we see Masamune\'s frame of mind, he thinks beauty is all that matters and will always have his way as long as his is beautiful, and this is confirmed by the way he is treated by the other characters in the first scenes. When Masamune arrives at the school, It\'s known that the girl who rejected him, Adagaki Aki, is there and there\'s a funny introduction of her character showing her rejecting a boy in front of all the students. Adagaki is a tsundere, hot tempered and haughty who is known for rejecting all the boys who try anything on her. So far so good, this setting was engaging and could make for a good story, showing Masamune\'s endeavor to accomplish his goal. Unfortunately, the way in which the story developed was not interesting and the humor was for the most part really bad, there were some good scenes, but most of them were just annoying and childish like the characters yelling and overreacting in a ""funny"" way. The plot wavered between boring cliché and ridiculous nonsense.The first part of the story is Masamune and Adaki meeting and the start of his revenge plan. Adagaki doesn\'t remember Masamune, which is understandable for he changed so much in appearance and thinks she is meeting him for the first time. The start of their relationship was really unexpected for me, as Masamune acts as a simp for Adagaki and is constantly telling he liker her, instead of making her fall for him and rejecting her afterwards as you would expect with the premise of the anime. The revenge deal already got really confusing here, would he just say ""Joke is on you, I was only pretending liking you"" after she finally succumb to him? I think that would be pointless and wouldn\'t really fulfil the revenge, but that\'s how the it  goes. During this part, it\'s introduced another important character for the story, Adagaki\'s servant, Koiwai Yoshino. Yoshino is aware of Masamune being the fat boy once rejected by Adagaki and his plans, and is willing to help him, since she wants to humble Adagaki, thinking it would be good for her. Yoshino becomes a crucial character in the story as she is constantly helping Masamune in every arc, giving information and tips for him, and she is a funny character, so I really liked her addiction in to the story.The next girl added to Masamune\'s harem is Fujinomiya Neko. Fujinomiya is introduced as a meek and sweet girl, who, for some reason, is in love with Masamune. Her introduction scene makes the viewer believe that she has known him from before but he doesn\'t remember it, and that there\'s a reason behind she liking him. Masamune rejects her many times during the anime, using the revenge as an excuse, but it can be inferred that he still really likes Adagaki or had developed feelings for her while trying his plan. Fujinomiya\'s arc is appalling, not only her introduction felt off, but we get to know later that there\'s no reason for her to like him, she just chose randomly. There are some good scenes like the replication of the roof scene that she read in a manga and the dialogue in the hospital. That dialogue scene should be a turning point in the plot as it makes Masamune reflect on his relationship with Adagaki, and there\'s a lot of explanation on Fujinomiya\'s character, it tells that she has a bad healthy and a lot of things are explained by that. That scene could be really good, except that her character was bad and her relationship with Masamune was shallow, so it was hard to care, and it got worse when the scene was ruined by the revelation of how she came to like him in the middle of the scene.The last arc is about a contest between Masamune and the new antagonist, Kanetsugu. Kanetsugu is a chubby boy who has a nickname of ""Masamune"" and uses it for his advantage, pretending he is the Masamune that once got rejected by Adagaki. In this arc, we get to know that Adagaki actually likes fatties and that she actually longs for the Masamune that she rejected when she was a kid. That makes the plot really confusing and raises a lot of questions which are not answered by the end of the anime. Adagaki and Kanetsugu have a lovey-dovey relationship which enrages Masamune. Their discord ends up in a contest between Kanetsugu and Masamune\'s classes doing a Snow White play and deciding who is the winner by votes. How it ended up like that is something that can\'t be fathomed unfortunately as it was a result of nonsensical scenes chain reaction. This arc was just boring all around and didn\'t have many qualities, the only good scene is Masamune\'s entering the stage in place of Kanetsugu.

It could and should be much better.', ""As a sucker for romance anime, I walked into this anime expecting something extremely unique based off the description of the story. It's almost like a typical romance anime with a little twist so I thought that it would actually be that unique. As I got further and further into the anime I realized it was going to be similar to a lot of other bland romance anime that plague the genre. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy it because there are some characters and moments that are charming and cute.MINOR SPOILERS AHEADStory - 6As far as stories go I was actually interested...in the beginning and in the first episode especially. Things progressed fairly decently right until around episode 4 where the plot basically remains in a standstill until one scene in the final episode, but after the one scene Masamune falls into absolute shambles in the rest of the episode. The story is just a repetitive series of failures for the protagonist to try and make this girl fall in love with him. There are some cute moments here and there where he thinks he might begin to fall for her, but then something dumb happens and everything is right back to square one. No matter what happens in the last episode in regards to advancing the relationship of the protagonist, it's as though everything resets when the episode ends. The promise of a unique story is quickly ruined as nothing besides the protagonist messing up is of any relevance.Art - 8The art is actually something I really enjoyed. It isn't something that blows you away, but it isn't ugly by any means and you always get a sense of how a character is feeling or what the mood should be by the art style and what is added, so the art part of the anime I actually enjoyed.Sound - 8Along the same lines as art, the sound is never obnoxious but it is never that spectacular either. It does help to add to the intensity of some romantic moments or the silliness of a scene. The music does its job and never overstays its welcome for too long.Character - 6The characters on this show are really hit and miss. Some characters you'll grow to love and other characters are the absolute epitome of abominations. Some of these characters and their stories made me want to rip out my hair at the sheer absurdity and lack of contribution to making the story better. The most likeable characters are the protagonist's friends as they are the only constant stream of likeable and comedy throughout each episode. The backstories of most every character is pretty shallow and seems like a quick way to explain their pointless existence.Enjoyment - 6I enjoyed the anime at the beginning a lot and it really capture my interest and I thought it was quite funny, but as the episodes dragged along I realized there wasn't going to be any payoff or decent plot progression. I still found a way to enjoy moments in episodes when the characters were being serious or when they actually looked like something romantic or genuine was going to happen. So there are moments and scenes worth watching throughout these repetitive episodes.Overall - 7Despite some harsh critiques and thoughts, I find myself rooting for this anime and I want it to so badly have these cute moments and scenes that I know it's capable of. Most of what we got in these episodes were small tastes of something that could be truly be unique and special. I loved the intimate scenes of romance that were teased and I enjoyed the anime taking a premise that we don't see very often and trying to make it work. I don't think Masamune is a bad anime. I think it has some major flaws that holds it back from being great, but it is overall an enjoyable anime for someone who wants to enjoy an unlikely budding romance between two characters. in the beginning and in the first episode especially.

There may or may not be spoilers ahead of this rant review. (Well not like it matters since the last episode was close to being redundant if not for the first 10 minutes or so.)Masamune-kun no revenge, an anime that hyped people up, including me, since the PV of the video was released. You could say many people were in fact “jumping out of their chairs”  to see how this adaptation would play out(?). As the anime was released in the first week, it certainly managed to live up to its hype, ranking...3rd in Anime Trending charts. However, it dropped down to rank 8 in week 4. Why is that? Well, if you did watch this anime, you’ll probably know why, so I won’t being go into detail. (Best girl showed up at the wrong moment, thus ruining the show entirely.) And that’s not the only reason why this show manages to disappoint itself, but I will save that for later.Masamune-kun is a decent and entertaining anime to watch. The plot revolves around the issue of “Revenge”, which is quite different from the stereotypical “Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with said girl. Boy tries to chase the girl. Girl then falls in love with the boy and they become a... Whoops, i meant, anime ends in an inconclusive ending.” But then again, it did use some of the clichés, especially the last one, but all for a different purpose. The purpose for revenge. I was constantly clicking the “Next” button after each episode, and hence managed to finish the anime in one sitting. “How is he going to take revenge? How is he going to prove that he is the one that Adagaki-san used to be close friends with? How is Adagaki-san going to react?” These were the thoughts that were constantly running through my mind, which thus led me to hoping that the last episode would bring a conclusive ending to everything. (Although it actually seems quite restricted within the span of 20 minutes.)At last, my prayers were answered, we got what we wanted in the last episode. A KAROKE SESSION! I mean, who wouldn’t want it in the last episode instead of Masamune-kun confessing everything to Adagaki, am I right? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  . I dare say the anime actually did a good job on the plot in the first few episodes, until they started introducing more side characters whose backgrounds were so minor that it didn’t even make any sense why they were there besides to create drama. Yes, I’m talking about Gasou. As much as I hated him, the anime just threw him in there as a new obstacle Masamune-kun has to overcome, and once it was done, they just left him in the corner to rot, not considering how he felt after the incident. Whereas, Neko-san was introduced to inflict jealousy on Adagaki-san, which worked in one way or another. To be honest, I didn’t feel sad at all when Neko-san was rejected, and that’s because they didn’t develop her character enough the make the scene feel impactful. As I mentioned, she was introduced to be thrown away later on. You could say it’s quite obvious it will happen so people won’t be surprised by that. But something cliché isn’t necessarily bad, especially when they are done right. Look at Toradora for instance, that’s how romances are supposed to be done despite the fact that everyone knew Taiga will end up with Ryuuji. There are even some tear-jerking moments in Toradora, and why is that? It’s because of how they portrayed it.Masamune-kun is by far not a BAD anime. It just feels lacklustre. But this is not the reason why you should completely skip or drop this anime. Different people have different tastes and opinions. Who knows, this might be your cup of tea if you’re into animes that doesn’t have a conclusive ending. If the author didn’t lose focus on the theme “revenge” perhaps this anime would have played out much better. The journey that I went through while watching Masamune-kun no Revenge was bitter yet sweet. (Mostly bitter because of the last episode but oh well.) If you really want to watch this, then just go for the manga instead as it is still ongoing, which would probably not leave you hanging. I hope.Conclusion: 6/10To be frank, I enjoyed this show, but it still disappointed me nonetheless. 3rd in Anime Trending charts. However, it dropped down to rank 8 in week 4. Why is that? Well, if you did watch this anime, you’ll probably know why, so I won’t being go into detail. (Best girl showed up at the wrong moment, thus ruining the show entirely.) And that’s not the only reason why this show manages to disappoint itself, but I will save that for later.Masamune-kun is a decent and entertaining anime to watch. The plot revolves around the issue of “Revenge”, which is quite different from the stereotypical “Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with said girl. Boy tries to chase the girl. Girl then falls in love with the boy and they become a... Whoops, i meant, anime ends in an inconclusive ending.” But then again, it did use some of the clichés, especially the last one, but all for a different purpose. The purpose for revenge. I was constantly clicking the “Next” button after each episode, and hence managed to finish the anime in one sitting. “How is he going to take revenge? How is he going to prove that he is the one that Adagaki-san used to be close friends with? How is Adagaki-san going to react?” These were the thoughts that were constantly running through my mind, which thus led me to hoping that the last episode would bring a conclusive ending to everything. (Although it actually seems quite restricted within the span of 20 minutes.)At last, my prayers were answered, we got what we wanted in the last episode. A KAROKE SESSION! I mean, who wouldn’t want it in the last episode instead of Masamune-kun confessing everything to Adagaki, am I right? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  . I dare say the anime actually did a good job on the plot in the first few episodes, until they started introducing more side characters whose backgrounds were so minor that it didn’t even make any sense why they were there besides to create drama. Yes, I’m talking about Gasou. As much as I hated him, the anime just threw him in there as a new obstacle Masamune-kun has to overcome, and once it was done, they just left him in the corner to rot, not considering how he felt after the incident. Whereas, Neko-san was introduced to inflict jealousy on Adagaki-san, which worked in one way or another. To be honest, I didn’t feel sad at all when Neko-san was rejected, and that’s because they didn’t develop her character enough the make the scene feel impactful. As I mentioned, she was introduced to be thrown away later on. You could say it’s quite obvious it will happen so people won’t be surprised by that. But something cliché isn’t necessarily bad, especially when they are done right. Look at Toradora for instance, that’s how romances are supposed to be done despite the fact that everyone knew Taiga will end up with Ryuuji. There are even some tear-jerking moments in Toradora, and why is that? It’s because of how they portrayed it.Masamune-kun is by far not a BAD anime. It just feels lacklustre. But this is not the reason why you should completely skip or drop this anime. Different people have different tastes and opinions. Who knows, this might be your cup of tea if you’re into animes that doesn’t have a conclusive ending. If the author didn’t lose focus on the theme “revenge” perhaps this anime would have played out much better. The journey that I went through while watching Masamune-kun no Revenge was bitter yet sweet. (Mostly bitter because of the last episode but oh well.) If you really want to watch this, then just go for the manga instead as it is still ongoing, which would probably not leave you hanging. I hope.Conclusion: 6/10To be frank, I enjoyed this show, but it still disappointed me nonetheless.', '""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" (or ""Masamune\'s Revenge"") is an anime that had good potential, but the way that the main character acts to get his goal is something that left me upset.Story: 6/10The story revolves around a first-year student named Masamune who spent 8 years of his life getting in shape and improving his attractiveness. Why? To win the heart of his childhood friend, Aki, who dumped him 8 years prior and to break her heart. The only thing is, he comes to this high school with her with a different name in order to throw her off. The story basically is him trying to win...her over by befriending her and getting her to open up.Art: 7/10The art style was alright, with the eyes looking bright and nice, the body proportions were pretty good as well.Sound: 7/10The OP was okay, although not memorable, as well as the ED. Nothing was bad out of the soundtrack throughout the episodes.Character: 7/10This anime had two characters that generally made me upset, mainly because of their personalities. Masamune is basically an asshole who wins over the hearts of many girls but is too hellbent to even consider them since he\'s after Aki. Aki is another character who made me laugh at points, but I honestly didn\'t like her for her bitchy attitude and her cruel rejections (But I guess that\'s how they have to portray the character). Yoshino is Aki\'s servant who on the outside is clumsy and stotic (Stotic like Setsuna from School Days or Koneko from High School DxD), but is really cold and deceptive, which made me interested in her façade. Neko is a kind girl who is frail due to a medical condition and is honestly my favorite character due to her personality and her kindness with the characters. There are other characters that are alright, but they\'re not so noteworthy as in terms of the plot.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite the crude and ruthless intentions of Masamune, I did enjoy scenes where he tries to think his way through issues without blowing his cover, not to mention a few comedic scenes with him. I did enjoy some of the interactions with the characters, but the one thing I did enjoy was the cliffhangers some of the episodes had. They would just make me want more and more of the show and it did have me coming back for more.Overall: 7/10Masamune\'s Revenge is a good anime that has its pros and cons, but don\'t expect anything amazing or ""revolutionary"" for an anime series. If you want something from recent times that\'s good enjoy to enjoy or with a different plot compared to animes that take place in school, I recommend this anime. her over by befriending her and getting her to open up.Art: 7/10The art style was alright, with the eyes looking bright and nice, the body proportions were pretty good as well.Sound: 7/10The OP was okay, although not memorable, as well as the ED.

I’ve seen many others but decided to review this one because it somewhat relates to me. Like Masamune, I was bullied a lot when I was younger because I was fat. Like him, I also worry about foods with high calories. Other than that, there is nothing else relatable as I didn\'t try or want to get revenge on those who bullied me. I also didn\'t want to have a build like his.Anyway, on to the story. It\'s about I guy who used to be fat and bullied when he was younger and was called ""Pigs Foot""...from Aki when he asked her out even though she told hm him to be stronger. As time went by, his grandfather trained him to lose weight. Later on, he also built muscles.He then transfers to a school where every girl flirts with him. He figured that Aki goes to the same school and plans to get revenge by rejecting her after getting her to love him. As the story went on, Masasume keeps getting close to his goal but his plans keep getting messed up.

I enjoyed seeing Makabe plan out his plot to make Aki his girlfriend then break up with her in the worst possible way it was actually entertaining, but the more he did this he was rethinking about whether what he was doing was worth it or not at times, then when the story gets closer towards the end it decides say fuck all that and bring in an element that pretty much ruined the show for me, it took away the fun feeling I had throughout most of the show and then just defecated on it for tricking me into thinking this was a great show.Now the characters were sort of mixed really, the MC Makabe was a really good character it's not often you see an MC trying to get revenge on an old crush for making him feel bad in the past plus the way his personality was very intriguing because at times he would be mischievous and other times he would be either whining or shocked which showed he wasn't entirely perfect even though he thinks he is, then there is the female MC Aki who I can add to the annoying Tsundere pile well kinda I mean she isn't the worst, but she annoyed me more over the course of the show, but she was clumsy at times which whenever it happened made her a bit likeable, though she was mostly dislikeable.The supporting characters were actually ok Yoshino who looked like a shy and helpless maid or servant was actually and even more mischievous and plot making person than Makabe was which did surprise me and her monotone attitude sometimes made a scene very funny, Neko was very mixed sometimes I liked her sometimes I didn't mainly because you don't really understand her motive until just after the halfway point, the trap character Kojuurou was really just a basic trap character to me there wasn't much to set him apart from other trap characters apart from that they actually tried to get him with one of the female characters which was interesting and Tae Futaba is that energetic and positive female character that always pushes the right buttons with me.There's also one other character that was introduced near the end, but he pretty ruined the whole show for me by making the situation stupid and this made me lose interest very quickly.The artstyle looked pretty basic for an anime like this although some of the characters eye colours like Yoshino's and Kojuurou's actually looked quite nice mainly because they were colours I haven't seen often in other anime characters. The comedy was actually pretty good it was funny seeing the major differences with Makabe and his family, Aki's food eating habit isn't really something new in anime, but at least this time it's a condition she has and not just a random power a character has which made seem a little bit more realistic.Despite the Harem tag being among the genres this didn't feel like a Harem, yes some of the girls had crushes on makabe, but most didn't really take action on those feeling's the only one's who acted were Aki and Neko and two characters doesn't fill the requirements for a Harem.Overall this anime started out good, got better and then just decided to throw it away in the end and there is a possibility for a season 2, though I'm not really sure if I'll watch it because of how disappointing the final episodes were, but if you're someone who is looking for a different take the Romance aspect then be my guest just don't expect a lot by the end. and fall in love this time we get a revenge story that becomes something else overtime then becomes garbage by the end.

But, they overused this dynamic to the point where it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief. They obviously plan to carry the same tired dynamic into the next season, so they gave us no climax and no conclusions.It's hard to empathize with most of the characters in this show. The plot revolves around secrecy and generally mean-spirited behavior,...so naturally the release would come with someone getting what's coming to them, but that is withheld in every way.An important plot point is that Masamune is concealing his identity in his revenge plot.

Late in the season a new character was introduced who was apparently impersonating Masamune in order to marry Aki for her money, but the series already has plenty of unlikable characters. It's convoluted. Aki becomes demure and agreeable to the impersonator without any event to catalyze it. Again, it's difficult to suspend disbelief.I wish they would have given us the success of Masamune's plan, and ended the season with Aki's confusion and depression. Season 2 could have been a redemption story for Aki as she processes the grief into positive change, learns the truth of Masamune, and becomes a sympathetic character. Instead, we're going to get more of the same tired tropes and more unlikable characters for who know's how many seasons. so naturally the release would come with someone getting what's coming to them, but that is withheld in every way.An important plot point is that Masamune is concealing his identity in his revenge plot.

It's what I do ok? SPOILERS AHEADStory 7/10: So.. the main story is based on a guy whose trying to get revenge for being rejected by a girl who humiliated him as a child. So plot wise, I thought this was actually pretty decent and it could of made for some killer drama moments where the two finally come together and realize that they're actually childhood friends... But at last it...did not come down to that! The series ended quickly with basically so many unsolved questions and it could of gone a hundred different ways! The ending definitely was the worst thing about this entire show and if there is no season 2 then I think they've got a screw loose... The story was decent though and it made for some interesting parts! I loved the part where he gave her the cold shoulder and she couldn't take it anymore, I was really hoping to see another one of those and I'm definitely a big fan of those situations!I like to see how the endings go to animes before watching and tbh.. I'm glad I do this because if it's not a happy ending then I'll try not to bother watching it.. It's just how I am and I probs won't change. I did enjoy the little thing with the fiance thing at the end and wish it would of been solved before it ended but it didn't and I'm bitter inside because of it! Overall to sum this up.. Really good story line which could of gone so many ways and I'm glad it went this way! I really enjoyed it and it made for interesting twists and turns!Art 7/10: Art is decent and I didn't really find anything drastically wrong with it at any point!Sound 7/10: Same goes for sound, it had some nice soundtracks at some points and nothing really felt out of place..Character 8/10: I thoroughly enjoyed each character in their separate way and also the main protagonist was really enjoyable to watch! Although I dislike the types of characters like Aki and don't approve of them in anime, I still enjoyed parts of her character including alot of her backstory to the entire thing! Even though alot of it was unanswered, I would of really liked to see more of her cute/romantic side!Supporting characters were fairly decent and none of them were over used to a point where it made no sense for them to be there..Overall: I really enjoyed the watch and would recommend it to anyone whose looking for a semi-decent comedy with a good romance story line! BUT do NOT get your hopes with it all working out in the end!

The number of times that I felt the show went off on an unnecessary tangent or avoided character development was too many. As for the finale... well, it lacks any sort of resolution, and hardly even provides a hook to pull you into a second season. In my opinion, the last few episodes were half-assed, especially the finale. I spent a good ten minutes after the last episode looking for where the next one was, not out of excitement or want to watch more, but just because I felt so dissatisfied with the ending...of it that I thought there would be something better to come.

I would like another season of this anime but like so many others that actually are worthy of one I doubt it as they need room for another lame season of dudes doing sports, or trying to make cooking exciting.

I myself have even gotten out of relationships and tried to make myself better mentally or physically to show that person what they are missing out on.

He was bullied and used by the other kids and the only person that talked to him rejected him. Throughout the story, instances are hinting that he still may have lingering feelings for her. Which would make sense considering his ability to hold a grudge for multiple years and especially remembering the event. While people view the main character as pathetic and thus use that to hate the character it is clear that he still never got over what happened when he was younger. Likewise neither did the girl....Also, people don’t realize that there was ultimately an irony in the actions of the main character.

It’s just another high school harem comedy with a dubious premise. On one hand, Masamune’s motivation is just. Aki-sama is a bitch, needlessly so and deserves a taste of her own medicine. On the other hand Masamune is being petty to the nth degree. There are plenty of other girls in this harem he could choose and just live a happy high school life. But he’s so hell bent on revenge that he doesn’t bother. That wouldn’t be a problem if the series didn’t make it obvious that he’s gonna...develop feelings for her. And that’s not a spoiler because the revenge motivation seems insufficient for all the effort and drama Masamune endures. At one point, an actual person (rather than a cartoon character) would see their own self worth and the fact they could have virtually any other girl in this school as a win (and a better revenge) and move on with their life.But, there’s a break even point with Aki. The fact that she has her own motivations for behaving in this manner is a positive. If she were just a bitch for the sake of being a bitch the show would have no depth and Masamune would be wasting his time and effort. Also the show portrays that Aki actually has feelings too. something that anyone who absolutely relates to Masamune probably wouldn't know or care to know. Since she’s not mean just for the sake of being mean, neither come across as one dimensional characters. It’s a nice little rom com, but it’s only average. Some are better than this; some are worse.

You are genuinely curious on how the story will develop, what kind of plot twists it will have. I for one...certainly looked forward to the episodes every week, and it was fun until late in the anime when a new arc emerged, shitty one I might add, in which we didn't get any closure on it until the end of the anime. On top of leaving the anime on an unsatisfactory finale, in the end we didn't get to see any noticeable character development between the main characters to at least give us a taste of next season, if any.I love the characters in this movie, they are beautifully drawn and the art is amazing. You have the always hungry tsundere, a frail rich girl who likes to go commando and a badass female loli sensei. The sound and music is your typical moe moe kyun opening and ending which isn't my cup of tea, but it does its job.Overall a 6 for me. Mostly because I had high hopes for this anime and was ultimately disappointed. If they do decide to create a season 2 without any dumb ass fillers and just pure character development and smart directing, then it would certainly be a huge rise on ratings for S2. We're not 6 year olds who can't figure out what will eventually happen, but that doesn't mean we don't want to see it happen, WE DO, SO GIVE IT TO US without all the money milking fillers... and what was that shitty ending anyways? Don't pull a Nisekoi!I'm only this mad because I love the anime that much and I don't want to see it not live to its potential. Fingers effin' crossed. certainly looked forward to the episodes every week, and it was fun until late in the anime when a new arc emerged, shitty one I might add, in which we didn't get any closure on it until the end of the anime.

Or at least so I thought until about halfway through the anime where it alMOST took a bad turn, but I guess it was okay.At some times, it felt like such a chore to be watching this particular series just because of how predictable it was with all the shoujo manga cliches being thrown around throughout. I don\'t even remember how many years ago this was, but I initially learned about the existence of this ""Masamune-kun no Revenge"" from a manga site, and it was...really promising. But this 12 episode anime, though, brings only maybe 2 good events and that\'s it.I am really disappointed. The ending also made it seem as if there is going to be Season 2, but why isn\'t it out even now? Did they really overestimate how their sales would do and just crashed down when it didn\'t meet expectations? Just disappointed, again lol really promising.

However, I think it's rather appropriate for this anime. An event in both Aki's and Masamune's turned their lives upside down in a way that shapes them to a stronger, yet more self-insecure version of themselves. This anime is rather deep plot-wise but at the same time, I feel like the ending sucked. I get what the writers were trying to...do, but I feel like Masamune and Aki both wouldn't have invested so much into the Cinderella play arc, and I wish the anime used a more interesting arc.Edgar: This is a fun anime that I think deserves a watch. I think the premise of the plot is fine and the animation is pretty solid. However, after thinking about it a bit more, I am questioning how much I like Masamune as a character. His whole deal in this show is to enact revenge on someone who harmed him in the past and also constantly rejects all the affection from other women (both main and side characters). It shows how much more he values vengeance over forgiveness and love, which is a thing that happens in real life sure, but I feel it's hard for me to root for.Together: We recommend this anime!Edgar_x_Riika :) do, but I feel like Masamune and Aki both wouldn't have invested so much into the Cinderella play arc, and I wish the anime used a more interesting arc.Edgar: This is a fun anime that I think deserves a watch.

At some point few characters ,...including the main heroine herself,felt annoying, but they didn't put the effort to make sure it's interesting enough to like the characters for who they are,because here the main character's can be empathized by the viewers; Rejected by a girl, and hence he takes revenge.I felt that instead of adding extra character and extra side story and wasting time, they could have actually utilized the runtime more on the main plot.And that's exactly why the story never got finished by episode 12, thus leaving yet another a rom com cliffhanger.Art was beautiful and the character designs, i loved them.Op and Ed were equally good,especially the lyrics; it was extremely apt for the plot of the story.Characters were something that was neither bad nor good, because the negative traits weren't justified properly,but atleast i'm glad that most of the characters stuck to their true nature that they were sometimes good,sometimes annoying as hell,sometimes mature, and at that same time they were all different from each other.I enjoyed it well, except from the ending and some episodes in between during the part where they added some annoying characters, for no good reason.I hope the directors take up atleast another season or minimum to minimum case, 3 or 4 ovas to fix this. including the main heroine herself,felt annoying, but they didn't put the effort to make sure it's interesting enough to like the characters for who they are,because here the main character's can be empathized by the viewers; Rejected by a girl, and hence he takes revenge.I felt that instead of adding extra character and extra side story and wasting time, they could have actually utilized the runtime more on the main plot.And that's exactly why the story never got finished by episode 12, thus leaving yet another a rom com cliffhanger.Art was beautiful and the character designs, i loved them.Op and Ed were equally good,especially the lyrics; it was extremely apt for the plot of the story.Characters were something that was neither bad nor good, because the negative traits weren't justified properly,but atleast i'm glad that most of the characters stuck to their true nature that they were sometimes good,sometimes annoying as hell,sometimes mature, and at that same time they were all different from each other.I enjoyed it well, except from the ending and some episodes in between during the part where they added some annoying characters, for no good reason.I hope the directors take up atleast another season or minimum to minimum case, 3 or 4 ovas to fix this."", ""A tradgedy in it's own right.Masamune-kun no Revenge is an anime I'll always hold dear, no matter how anyone else feels about this anime, I was charmed all the way through.It's worth noting, that after finishing the anime I couldn't go on without knowing the end, and have finished the manga - but will try to keep this reveiw based on how I felt about the anime.I'm under no illusion - throughout the series I could see the direction it was heading almost from the start, but it was the journey that made it sparkle.

It will never have the second season it so desperatley needs, and that will forever be it's downfall.Also, if you're a dub only, the VA for Aki is absolutley incredible for this anime.

Very frustrating to watch, with total lack of progression, depth in any of the character or their relationship and lack of story development.The plot idea is kinda interesting, or at least, the first of it\'s kind that I saw. But the anime just doesn\'t develop.Protagonist was in love with this girl that rejected him, now he wants to make her fall for him to then reject her and get his revenge, alright, interesting idea.Now you may ask, how does it end? Does he reject her? Does she reject him again? Do both fall for each other? Nothing happens.The first couple...episodes are kind of interesting because you get introduced to the idea, from there on until the last few episodes it\'s just the same thing over and over again, some dumb idea to make Aki fall for the protagonist, and whether the idea works or not, it doesn\'t matter, next episode there is a huge reset as if nothing happened. All the past actions and feelings developed, meaningless, it\'s the same thing over and over again.In the last few episodes the classic ""misunderstanding"" happens, Aki doesn\'t know that Musamane (the protagonist) is the children that she rejected in her childhood, and he doesn\'t know that she actually had feelings for him; so randomly this dude shows up and apparently she gave him the other dude name as a nickname or something? What? Huh? Why? No idea, but apparently she\'s just magically kind to him, even thought he actually doesn\'t really want to be with her. You get the idea, classical, frustrating, annoying, somewhat cringe cliche situation.All the characters are shallow, you always know how the protagonist or every other character is going to behave or react, there is no sense of progression in the relationship between any of the character, in a few episodes there is somewhat of a sense of progress, but once again, it\'s as if everything is just lost the second you move onto a new episode.It is pretty clear that the anime didn\'t really have many ideas apart from the plot and little else, they tried to drag out the whole story probably to make a second season when they could have just started and ended the anime in one season.In the end, you end up with what essentially are filler episodes and no ending, if they actually let the story develop and come to an end, or at least have some degree of progress, it would have been a decent anime just for the idea (once again, this is the first time I saw something like this, maybe it isn\'t even original), if it had better characters it would have been good. But it has none of either.It would have been nice if they at least managed to clear out that Aki actually confused Gasou for Makabe, at least then they could have had somewhat of a progression since they would have actually achieved Aki falling for Makabe, then whether they decided to actually go on with Makabe actually loving her or him rejecting her... both would have been fine.They could also go in more depth about Koiwai, she helps the protagonist, why? Because she might benefit from it ever so slightly.. that\'s all? Some minor improvement in your quality of life is the reason why you go through all this trouble? They could have added a little more character to her I feel like, make her a little more interesting, maybe give her some more meaningful motives rather than ""it\'d make my job easier!!"".Neko (best name ever btw) is the only interesting character in all of this, she has some degree of backstory and she does have emotions, even thought, the part when she\'s like ""oh yeah, I chose you randomly out of a phot book"" was a bit... off? You\'d imagine the protagonist would have some reaction since he rejected her with the excuse ""you don\'t actually like me"", and you wouldn\'t expect her to say that after the risked her life like that... Maybe she was joking and I didn\'t get it? I don\'t know, but it felt a bit off. So, don\'t necessarily take this as criticism, maybe I didn\'t interpret it correctly.The animation is alright, it\'s not good nor bad, just... average, nothing to complain about and nothing to praise about either.Overall it\'s a pretty frustrating watch that leaves you pretty unsatisfied, personally I\'d say skip this, I\'m not sure if this is based on a manga and if so maybe the manga has better pacing.There is an OVA... nothing really happens there either, Aki and Makabe have only a single interaction in which they seem more friendly, I guess implying that the final episode did bring that ever so slight story progression that you\'d expect in... I don\'t know, episode 5 or something. Aside from that, we get a glimpse of Koiwai on her own... she does... nothing, gets bored and goes back home, apparently she likes serving Aki considering the smile at the end, then why try to ""humble her by having her love interest reject"" no idea.Aside from that the other scenes are pretty meaningless, nor particularly fun or interesting... They could have done better.Once again thought, I think it\'s a shame, the idea was cool I think, with better characters and development (which, would be almost natural by letting the plot develop itself) and by cutting down on the filler time while begging for a season 2 to happen, they would have ended up with a good anime.I think they just lacked ideas for season 2 and so they tried to stretch a 12 episode anime into a two season thing, delivering an unfinished product that sadly probably won\'t be completed.If they release a season 2 I\'d watch it thought, I\'d like to see the story come to an end... If they let that happen that is.TL;DRAnimation == AverageCharacters == All shallow and extremely predictableMain plot == Somewhat interesting idea, unfortunately not well developed due to the very slow pacing of the anime and total lack of progression in the story, nothing happens, the main plot doesn\'t develop past the ""they\'re friends and they like each other in secret somewhat"" and none of the character have any meaningful relationship to be interested in.To be honest, 4 is too low of a vote, I mean, I\'m sure that there is much worse stuff, there still are a couple fun scenes here and there, but calling it ""average"" is definitely too much.I\'d say this is bad, but not as bad as other animes. episodes are kind of interesting because you get introduced to the idea, from there on until the last few episodes it\'s just the same thing over and over again, some dumb idea to make Aki fall for the protagonist, and whether the idea works or not, it doesn\'t matter, next episode there is a huge reset as if nothing happened.

What makes it worse, is that the OVA takes place after all of the issues were solved, so it seems there will be no conclusion shown in the anime (meaning you need to read the manga).All in all, the show was funny and entertaining. If you know, however, that there would be no conclusion, you may not think that. There were countless ridiculous out-of-the-blue setbacks to the MC's progression (the other girl & guy), which I didn't mind because they added obstacles for...the MC's to clear and grow closer over. This didn't happen though, instead we get no conclusion and a bitter taste in our mouth, just like Masamune in the last scene.I also have to say, there is just not enough to make the audience prefer the main girl over the other girl. Everything about the other girl is just better. But you don't know that because there is supposed to be payoff, and a reason behind the main girl's behavior... yet this is not shown.I would rate this higher if not for the ending. the MC's to clear and grow closer over.

I know that it's simple and I knew how it going to end even after the first episode, but it was fun.Story: Very simple story about a spoiled girl and a boy who has low self-confidence. I personally really enjoyed the way how the story developed slowly. He never looses his main goal and that made me laugh several times. However, there is nothing deep in it, so don't look for any meaningful emotions. This is a comedy so I watched it with that mentality. Sadly only 12 episodes and quite a few just...fillers which feel like a waste of time. I'm sure they planned to do the 2nd session as the ending absolutely not satisfying. 6/10Art: I was very happy with the look of this anime. The characters are very pretty and the whole show just has the right atmosphere. 8/10Sound: Mostly it wasn't a big deal, but from time to time it caught my attention. Especially when they used horror music for funny scenes. I found it very amusing.I only listen to intro if it's really good. Well, it wasn't this time so skipped it from the really beginning.  7/10Characters: If I think about Masamune's thought, they still put a smile on my face. He was very entertaining to watch. He is a good guy with a bad goal, and he is very much determined to get his so-called revenge. I loved how he is a very normal person in real and how he surprised by his own achievements. I found it very funny that he like a teenager's Instagram - everyone sees all the perfect pictures and they think he/she is so cool, but that's not even close to reality. He made me laugh so many times.The other great character is Yoshino.All the others are okay. 7/10Enjoyment: I had such a fun time. I didn't set a high bar for this series so I could just freely enjoy it without expecting something more. 8/10Overall: This is purely just for fun. Don't wait for huge plot twists, deep meaningful emotions, or real character development because it's not going to happen. But you will get a very nice looking comedy with lots of humorous moments. 7/10 fillers which feel like a waste of time.

There\'s so many bad reviews on Masamune-kun no revenge, for some reason, that i just felt like i had to give it some recognition, because it does not deserve the amount of harsh scores it has, in the slightest! (I will try to make this spoiler free for anyone considering to watch the Anime).Storywise. I gave it a 6. Many people have said that Anime does flop...at the end and I guess... It kinda did? but to me, It wasn\'t so bad and I enjoyed the story overall. I definitely laughed here and there. The story are not short of entertaining. The plot is interesting enough to keep watching. There was one particular arc in the Anime that I found to be absolute genius concerning Fujinomiya Neko, which is what brought the score to a 6. It wasn\'t a 7 because, I think there was something missing from the overall story and in order to avoid spoilers I will not go on about it, but those of you that have watched it will understand what I mean when I say that (hopefully).Art: 7. It is pretty standard to be honest. Doesn\'t look horrible but there\'s nothing outstanding about it. I like the look of the characters and the art does nothing wrong in terms of portraying its story. Not much I can say about this section.Sound: 7. The overall OST is Great actually! It blends well with the scenes it accompanies. And there was one song, that was outstanding to me - not sure of the name but - It was in the arc I mentioned before and that arc was pretty sad to be honest. I think the song really made that particular scene, that much more touching. Apart from the OP and ED, the rest of the OST i have no further comment.The OP (Wagamama Mirror Heart) is great actually. It hyped me up every episode and is very fitting since Wagamama means selfish, which is exactly what Masamune and Adagaki are. (I literally just took a pause typing this just to dance weirdly along with the OP) The ED is pretty standard. Not much I can say about it except it was sung by Choucho, (Outstanding singer btw, check her out!) and out all the songs she has sung in various Anime, this isn\'t the best but is still pretty good. The whole OST was nice to listen to. (sorry, if that was a bit long, I love listening to music so in turn, I love talking about it xD)Characters: 6. The characters are not the best but not the worst by any circumstance. Concerning the main characters, I thought they were pretty enjoyable, with at least some depth in them. The other characters. I feel like they are just there to carry on the story with not much depth. Fujinomiya Neko was the one character that I absolutely loved (sorry I\'m actually simping) because I full on hated her and then completely adored her at the end.Overall, I gave my personal enjoyment a 8 and the anime as a whole a 7, because I thoroughly enjoyed watching Masamune kun but I do understand it has its setbacks. Still, very engaging from start to finish. I really do think the anime deserves to be praised more and that MAL score should go up by a 0.5, because it just simply doesn\'t deserve that. I do recommend watching this anime with an open mind. I say \'open mind\', because although I\'m saying it is underrated, I definitely understand why people say the Masamune kun is under par. There are some minor plot holes here and there and unfortunately I don\'t think there is going to be a season 2 to cover it all up, according to the time I am writing this review now. It definitely isn\'t the best in any circumstance, but it also does a good job of adapting the source material to portray a very entertaining story. I definitely will look back on this Anime and say""Yep, loved that one!"" so GO WATCH IT!(sorry! I hardly write reviews at all so I hope this was able to give some insight into the Anime)Have a nice rest of your day, whoever you are! ^^ at the end and I guess...

Cause I know I do! Reading the little blurb to Masamune-Kun\'s Revenge got me so pumped because I finally thought I had found the perfect romance anime I\'ve been searching for! And despite the first couple episodes being thoroughly enjoyable, this anime did not deliver in its initial premise nor...did it execute itself properly at all. Full of cliches, irritating main characters, forgettable side characters, and a plot that goes absolutely fucking nowhere, this anime was a disappointment, to say the least.CharactersLet\'s start with the characters. I don\'t think the cast of characters was bad per say, though they weren\'t that good also. They were either written as very static or inconsistent characters, so no one actually felt like a real-life, living, and breathing human being with individual needs and wants-- instead, they just seemed like a re-enactment of shallow stereotypes that were painted over with cute character designs.Not only that, but we never got to see any personal quirks-- what do they like to do? Their hobbies? Their fears? Their dreams? I think the writers did try to attempt this with the main protagonist (Masamune, we\'ll just call him Masa here) but goddamn, one-worded answers do not count! It\'s like the writers\' half-assed Masa\'s profile so much so that they were too lazy to change it! Because that\'s exactly how Masa came across: half-assed. So he likes to look at his own reflection, his hobby is the gym, he\'s scared of spiders, and he wants to get a girl to fall in love with him. Bruh. That\'s basically the description of any good-looking guy ever.The only distinct quality Masa brings to the table is that he outwardly acts like a narcissistic asshole sometimes (but like a likable one? I actually find these moments to be the funniest), and since the anime is mostly from his perspective, we get to see this ""cool-guy"" facade fade away as well. A cool concept (reminds me of Kanie from Amagi Brilliant Park) but fails on its delivery because of how vastly inconsistent he acts! While the ""putting on a cool-guy act"" makes sense, it just doesn\'t make sense when Masa\'s two personalities feel like two entirely different people! It also doesn\'t help that the character switch feels like it only happens when it\'s convenient for the plot (although, this was less of an issue earlier on in the story because Masa\'s two personalities weren\'t as amplified as it was towards to end, so there was still a semblance of a middle ground within his character-- but by the climax, big yikes). Masa goes from ""Mister Imma-Steal-Yo-Girl"" level smoothness to a stumbling, bumbling nervous dimwit that is too scared to stand close to a girl.Needless to say, while I found the writing of Masa\'s character to be problematic, it\'s actually not as bad compared to the rest of the characters (especially the other MC/ female love interest). But before going more into detail about her, I\'ll just get the side characters out of the way just for the sake of time: they\'re boring and cliche. You\'ve seen their type before and you\'ll see them again. Nothing new, nothing great.The romanceAnyway, back to the female love interest, the girl Masa wants to make fall in love with him so he can execute his revenge plan. Yup, she\'s your typical tsundere alright. She\'s the cold-hearted bitch that hates all men and has her own female harem. Wait-- why does this sound similar? Oh right, because it\'s been overdone at this point. That\'s probably why I have such a hard time remembering her name (it\'s Aki by the way). And of course, this notorious, ungrateful, man-hating character (with no character growth) has to be the female love interest--- sigh. With a personality compatible with shit, I\'m just mind-boggled as to why writers love to write this type of character so much! My god, Aki is just so damn unlikeable that it\'s hard to root for the romance when all you want is for her to rot in hell!Worse, you know the romance is a fail when a love triangle appears and you don\'t root for the (obvious) main couple because of how much you hate one of them (cough, ungrateful man-hater, cough)! You see, in these types of shojo animes, the love triangles aren\'t actually meant to debate over who\'s ""best girl"", but instead add drama and bring the main couple closer together. It\'s meant to highlight why they\'re good for one another even when there\'s another contestant in the way. Unfortunately, that love triangle didn\'t serve its purpose because I wasn\'t hoping for the main ship to sail at all. As much as Masa was a ""meh"" character to me, he 100% deserved better and should\'ve chosen the other girl (he even had more chemistry with her).PlotOH MY GOD, WHAT PLOT. I thought there was revenge plan at play? Where the fuck did it go? Where are the stakes, the betrayal, the drama? I thought there would be at least some kind of build-up or tension within the last episodes but nope! I got bamboozled and so did you if you went into this anime by its synopsis!Absolutely nothing happened! Was the revenge plan revealed? No. Was true love achieved? No. Was the relationship even progressing along? Ha, NOPE! The romance felt the same from the start to finish: no growth nor development.Essentially, this anime was directionless despite a premise that warranted an obvious goal: A FUCKING REVENGE PLAN. Is it because they wanted a season 2 in the making? Who knows, but ending season 1 that weak was not a smart move, especially if they wanted to hype their audience for a continuation story. Season 2 should serve as the next chapter, not some cheap excuse to justify season\'s 1 lackluster, uneventful and nondescript ""ending.""Animation and SoundtrackThe art is pretty good, it has that modern ""sleekness"" to it that I really like. I also think the warm color palettes were a nice touch, especially towards the backgrounds. They stuck with gold as the dominant color for lighting and it looked really beautiful when the characters were illuminated within it. I also liked the general character designs: nothing new but still has this anime\'s own flair.As for the soundtrack, there\'s a purely instrumental song on the ost called ""Heartbreak"" that I really enjoyed. Actually, that song caught my attention when it played in Episode 8-9 and was probably the highlight for that segment of the anime. The rest of the ost is forgettable, and the op and ep songs are also pretty mediocre.Final ThoughtsSo why 6/10 when this was a somewhat scathing review? Well, the first few episodes were enjoyable, it had its good comedic moments, and I didn\'t necessarily have a bad time watching this anime (I found problems within it but it didn\'t hinder my viewing experience that badly), so I\'m going to be nice and file Masamune-Kun\'s Revenge under the ""it\'s alright"" category. did it execute itself properly at all.

As many of the reviews I've seen have already pointed out, it just doesn't deliver many of its promises that it sets up. I went in wanting typical shoujo tropes but with the unique angle of a character getting comeuppance of some kind as the title indicated would happen. Instead plot shenanigans sort of took over by the last few episodes and there's no resolution to anything. What made it more frustrating was that it felt like the show was intentionally setting up reasons to hate the target of the revenge to make the revenge all the sweeter...when it did finally happen... but the character pretty much skates through the shenanigans without being bothered by much of anything. And the MC seeking his revenge is the one who suffers more. Now, I can dig the idea of portraying the double-edged sword of an unforgiving mindset or unyielding grudge as well as a sort of lesson about the sunk-cost fallacy, but the show delivers absolutely no upsides to what the MC is trying to carry out that make the sustained disappointments worth it. So it doesn't really satisfy with that lesson, either. Ultimately, what I seek in my consumption of entertainment is that characters get what they deserve. It may be unrealistic, but that's more or less the point of fiction: it's unrealistic, but satisfying. This show was both unrealistic and unsatisfying.

I haven't watched anything of similar concept yet, it was new for me. The characters are very well designed and the anime world is beautiful too.From the start, the anime had me hooked and I kept binging one episode after another. I loved how the anime progressed but then something happened that I had never expected, the creators of the anime LEFT THE ANIME INCOMPLETE AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO RELEASE A SECOND SEASON, WHY WOULD YOU CREATE SUCH A GOOD ANIME AND THEN SHUN OFF YOUR VIEWERS LIKE THAT.The first 8...episodes were going just perfect, when they introduced the impostor they never bothered revealing his true face in the anime, they didn't even bother clearing up the misunderstanding between Makamune and Aki. This simply blows my mind that anime creators of this can be that much careless.Both of them are living in a lie that they were dumped by their first love, the main culprit behind it was Yoshino.I have never read a manga before but as the creators left the anime on such a cliffhanger, I had to read that MANGA!Anyone that was a tad bit curious and interested in the anime is asked to read the MANGA.How can one do this to the public, even the OVA isn't satisfying nor does it answer anything unless you read the manga.I believe this anime could have been in the top 20 list if the creators bothered a bit about the viewers.If you just watch the anime, you will be left with a hole in your heart and it can only be filled by reading the manga. After putting so much effort into creating such thought-out characters, you just cannot be that lazy to NOT FINISH THE DAMN STORY.This has become more of a rant than a review but it's very true!The characters are lovely and the anime can even make you feel sad during the middle, the voice acting is totally pinpoint and you can become fond of the characters from the beginning of the anime, I'd say if you really liked the anime's starting and also binged like me and became disappointed, again I'M BEGGING MY MATE PLEASE READ THE MANGA.The anime deserved a freaking 85-90/100 but it wasn't finished well so deserved in the 60/10 ish catagory, I decided to give it 69 to make it the FUNNY.If you have read it that far, don't shy away from reading the manga. Put your time to it and read it, you my friend deserve the SATISFACTION that you crave!It saddens me that I binge watched the anime last night and loved it until episode 9, only to be disappointed by the ending at 3am in the morning. I did not have a good night's sleep.Aki is a memorable Tsundere character and those who like such stuff should give it a view. episodes were going just perfect, when they introduced the impostor they never bothered revealing his true face in the anime, they didn't even bother clearing up the misunderstanding between Makamune and Aki.

That being said this anime was very mediocre as I stated before and I was not disappointed to say the least. Decent anime with decent story-telling and decent character design and development. It is worth a shot for those who are into romance, comedy anime with small harem added to it.

But somehow, it is not that bad. Actually, it portrays some real-life situations, such as getting revenge from someone who rejected you when you gave everything.HOWEVER, man I really hate the part when someone impersonated Masamune like the Gasuo doesn't even look like Masamune (Kid) like they have a major difference.Setting that aside, this anime was actually a huge cliffhanger. Somehow it is. If you would watch the anime, you would think that it ended smoothly. However, the problem of the story was not resolved. Making the anime a cliffhanger. This is actually...a problem especially for those non-manga readers since you have to read the manga in order to catch up with the story.The story was supposed to be fine, there are some cringey parts where Masamune is getting too confident.

And after that he gets to the point where he is going to break her heart, but reflects back to what Neko said when she was in the hospital and they live happily ever after. I feel like the team gave up in the middle of it all. It was a good twist where the chubby boy comes out of nowhere but he became a...annoying character. In the end Masamune didn't even tell Aki who he really was and about the past which sucked because if it were to end on that it would've been fine instead of having us wonder did chubby boy really marry her, did Mamamune end up breaking her heart ? I guess these questions could be answered in the manga which i wil be reading in the Summer of 2021 annoying character.

I didn't feel like I was excited for the next episode every time one ended and I found myself repeatedly seeing how much of the episode was left. It's not really a romance, and it's not really a comedy, it's just a weird middle ground that didn't work IMO. Besides one or two decent moments, there was nothing in the show that was overly enjoyable; it was just the most mediocre anime. It's not a bad anime by any means, but there are better ones to watch.

The ending made me want to be the sleepless driver."", 'NOT A SPOILER FREE REVIEWI\'ll admit, most of the reviews giving this a low rating aren\'t far off. The only reason why I rated it fairly high is because I enjoyed it.Let\'s start with the bad. Masamune-kun\'s Revenge is unfinished. Actually, even yet, the OVA jumps ahead and doesn\'t even attempt to explain what happened in between. The characters are somewhat... one-dimensional. There\'s not really much depth to them, and the MC is lowkey bland. He\'s nice, attractive, has a mission to make Aki fall in love with him... and yet that\'s the most interesting thing about him. I hardly even understand why anyone...would like Aki other than the fact that she\'s ""pretty"". At one point, I started to ship the MC with Fujinomiya (but then he wouldn\'t have been able to extract his revenge) (but imagine if she found out who he was and that he started dating someone else, that sounds like an even better way to get his revenge, esp. after she falls in love with him).Now onto the good. Despite not understanding why anyone would like Aki off the bat, she has her moments. But those moments are only found once you\'re close, and Masamune actually got to see moments where she was flustered, shy, and just overall cute. It was super endearing, and after seeing that, I\'m not surprised he started to fall for her. I quite liked them together after the first couple of episodes, though I\'m surprised she nor anyone else, questioned why he immediately went for her.There\'s a lot of funny moments too. I found myself genuinely laughing out loud. But you have your generic characters/tropes/whatever they\'re called, a guy who looks girly and is soft and treated like a girl, someone who gets in the way of Aki and Masamune x2, the female lead who\'s only liked by girls because she hates men.I quite liked Koiwai. She was refreshing as a character. I wish they delved further into her, because it\'s not like the anime delved into the MC\'s that much. There wasn\'t enough development of characters or the plot, and it made me question whether Masamune-kun\'s Revenge was meant to be a serious romance or just a comedic not-serious one.Either way, that\'s how I took it. Despite the bad I mentioned (and the others that everyone else mentioned), I still enjoyed it. I would\'ve been able to watch another season easily and some of the romance scenes were quite cute (AKA Aki acting like a normal girl in love and just overall being the opposite of how she usually is).Overall, I\'d recommend watching this anime if you\'ve exhausted your list of romance animes. It\'s decent at best, but don\'t expect anything on the same scale as Blue Spring Ride (romance wise) or Monthly Girls\' Nozaki-kun (comedy romance wise). would like Aki other than the fact that she\'s ""pretty"".
