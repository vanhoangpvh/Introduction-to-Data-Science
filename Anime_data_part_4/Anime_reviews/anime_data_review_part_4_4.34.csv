Cardfight!! Vanguard: will+Dress Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49820/Cardfight_Vanguard__will_Dress_Season_2,"['Vanguard Will Dress is an interesting to watch, especially for anyone who enjoys playing the game. Also, not only is it interesting, it is enjoyable. There are many backlash for its first season for having less focused on the cardfight itself, but for Will Dress, it is definitely more focused. Whoever have not watch the Overdress series yet because of less cardfights are recommended to watch the first season of Will Dress moving forward to this second season. For the game itself, there are no units appearing animations similar to the original anime but it only shows the characters only playing. To clarify, it is...like watching a real life players playing Vanguard where there are no units appearing every time it is added to the field. This new method is not bad either because it is faster and less boring to watch. However, most of the episodes do animate the units battling near the end of the game which is a nice addition. Overall, a decent and improved anime for newcomers and long time fans to stream on.

Cardfight!! Vanguard (2018),https://myanimelist.net/anime/37476/Cardfight_Vanguard_2018,"['Okay, so it seems like I am the first one to write a review about this anime series.First let\'s talk about the story. Now I am not reading the manga of this anime and I know that this is the second version of the anime adaptation of this story. I have watched the first version of this and I can say that there are some changes in the story. Now I won\'t talk abt this further because it will turn into a spoiler. The only thing that I can say for the story is it is still good in a way that makes me...want to still watch it.Now for the art. Now I can see that the animation quality has improved since the original cardfight vanguard series. I also liked how they used bold lines in some part of the characters. The new thing with the player switches out and goes in again when riding a new unit is also a good idea.For the sound, I liked it when they make vanguard speaks ""Yes, my vanguard"" and other similar phrases. But I think it\'s too frequent and it has become a bit boring. A suggestion is they should only make the vanguards speak on important scenes to build up excitement with the watchers.Now I have nothing to say a bit much about the characters because they are just the same with the original series. Hoping to see those overpowered characters later on in this story like the one in the original one.All in all, I can say that I have enjoyed not only the story but also the community around it. I think I might have to read the manga to further my reviews about this anime.I hope this review was helpful  to you guys. want to still watch it.Now for the art.

Ok story, but the characters are fun and very likable.The fights are faster than the original and have less pauses in the fights. There is always something going on without unnecessary scenes.The characters feel more alive and fun. The story was very amusing and the card fights at certain points made you feel tense, on the edge of your seat.I say they did pretty well when trying to promote the game, because I for sure bought some cards and thought about buying more cards when I watched the show. I felt like I wanted to become the best...at cardfighting. at cardfighting.']"
Dragon Ball Movie 2: Majinjou no Nemurihime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/891/Dragon_Ball_Movie_2__Majinjou_no_Nemurihime,"[""After watching the 2010 dub version on youtube I can say this: FINE MOVIE.The movie occurs in the timeline after goku finished his first jurney for obtaining the 7 dragonballs. Master roshi promises goku to train him when suddenly we meet krillin, who appears on the island and askes roshi to be his pupile. But master roshi won't agree that easily and sends the two boys to resque a princess trapped in a castle.Goku's dubbed voice finaly actually sounds like a normal boy, the rest of the cast get to keep their normal voices. The movie was a direct sequal to the first movie, and...I think it was a little better. As usuall it creates an alternate story to what really happened, but the idea stayed the same. I think it was a little better. As usuall it creates an alternate story to what really happened, but the idea stayed the same."", 'Review of the Dub movie.Pros:1. The Vampire was a cool designed villain, not like the usual cliche anime movie villain.2. He had an alright motive, blowing up the sun to create permanent darkness for him and the demons.3. Very cool art design for the ""Devil\'s Hand"". Very spooky design and it gave off some Fantasia ""Night on Bald Mountain"" vibes.4. We get to see more of Goku being a Great Ape.5. Launch is in this movie, so I gotta list this here because she is such a cutie!Cons:1. The dub voice in this movie for Goku is terrible, he sounds like hes always whispering...and exhaling at the same time.2. The dub voice for Bulma wasnt very fitting in my opinion. I don\'t know why they couldn\'t get the original voice actors, seeing as Master Roshi and Krillin have their respected voice actors.3. The first 15 minutes are basically scenes we have already seen before in the anime. Like the first movie it is a retelling, this time of how Goku and Krillin become Master Roshi\'s students. I am not a fan of these retellings. I would rather see something new and original not recycled story.4. Bulma is a damsel in distress in this movie and she trusts a very vampire looking man named LUCIFER. She also walks into the coliseum looking room filled with demons in the stands and doesn\'t seem scared and acts like nothing is out of the ordinary. Like seriously? Bulma isn\'t that dumb, as she is an inventor.5. Even though I put Goku turning into a Great Ape into the pros, I also have to list it here as it only lasts a little over a minute before Puar turns into a giants pair of scissors and cuts Goku\'s tail off. I want more Great Ape epicness please!5. The whole Sleeping Princess thing was confusing. First of all, why is this blue crystal called the sleeping princess? How did they come across it? The purpose for it was that they needed the crystal and the blood of a girl (coming from bulma) to power up a canon to take out the sun. Why did they have to use this specific canon? Couldn\'t they just make a canon that used normal explosives?6. All of the demons used guns. Instead of using..I don\'t know maybe their claws or teeth? Nah, give them the human creation called guns!7. There was plenty of fan service of Bulma\'s breasts, including 2 close ups, the demons were even joking about them, and not to mention the recycled scene of Oolong transforming into Bulma to show Roshi her boobs.8. Krillin really didn\'t do anything in this movie and was a big burden to Goku who had to save him countless times, even Yamcha did more in this movie than Krillin.9. The ending. Goku managed to blow up the canon as it was about to shoot the moon, thus resulting in a big explosion. It does not show what happens to the vampire, so it is assumed that he perished in the explosion. But what about Goku and the gang? How did they all get out of there? It is not explained. and exhaling at the same time.2. The dub voice for Bulma wasnt very fitting in my opinion.

Which is natural, I suppose, given how influential it is and how many films it has. We're kicking off this year's film festival with a look at the second Dragonball film. This one hit theatres in 1987, when most of you weren't born and I was just a baby. I understand I was already highly critical of media and snubbed Maya the Bee for being too pedestrian.Story:We open with a quick retread of Goku & Krillin approaching Roshi for training. He sends them...on an errand to bring him a beautiful young girl but he doesn't trust them so he specifies that he wants the sleeping princess who's been imprisoned by demons for centuries according to legend. Which, I guess still makes her young when compared to Roshi. The pair set off, each determined to be the one who finds her. Unbeknownst to them, there's more to the situation than meets the eye. And no, the castle isn't a Transformer. As awesome as that would have been.The biggest narrative issue does lie in the retread. First off, there's no real reason for this. You could easily have Roshi send them during their training whilst offering some reward that they both want. Secondly, there are parts of it that really don't work when you think about it. Bulma, Yamcha, Oolong & Pu'ar all arrive on Roshi's island to look for Goku, for example. And there's no reason they should expect him to be there if he's not being trained. It would be like if I asked a store's manager if they knew where my friend was because I saw her shop there once and just assumed the staff would know her whereabouts because of it. It's like they want to have the established situation of the series proper but they also want to reset it.On some more positive notes, the film does to a good job of encapsulating the show's aesthetic. It's the type of quick, goofy scenario you might just get for one or two episodes. It has a\xa0 strong sense of fun to it and just the right ratio of weirdness.Characters:The film has all your favourite characters, from the point it's set. You have Krillin, Goku, Roshi, Bulma, Oolong, Lunch & Pu'ar. Also, Yamcha is there but he'd already begun his spiral into uselessness at this point and, while Goku & Krillin are fighting demons he punches out a physically deformed old man and that's pretty much it. I'll echo a question from DBZ fans everywhere. Why is Yamcha even here? Anyone could've decked that deformed elderly man. Even Oolong.The best part of the characterisation in this film has to be the portrayal of Krillin & Goku's rivalry and transition into friendship. It's a nicely done element that's actually kind of genuine, in spite of all the absurd elements around them.Art:The film looks like the series that spawned it.\xa0 Which comes with the good and the bad. They recycle some bits. The backgrounds aren't the best. However, the aesthetic is appealing,the monster designs are pretty good and the crazy futuristic technology is nicely done.Sound:I'll focus primarily on the film only characters since every single member of our main cast was well acted in the series proper, occasional overdone moment notwithstanding. They were also strong in the last film and I'm sure they'll be strong in the final two\xa0Dragonball films\xa0\xa0when I eventually review them. And that's not even going into the Z related part of the franchise. In this case, we only really have the antagonists\xa0 voiced by Nozawa Nachi, Iizuka Shouzou (who also voiced good old number 8 in the main series) & Gouri Daisuke (who voiced a plethora of minor characters including the tortoise, Colonel Yellow, Cymbal & Drum). Gouri also voices my favourite antagonist in the film because he just seems to be having such a grand time although all three give good performances. The music is solid as well.Ho-yay:Not really any here. Unless you think Goku's eagerness to be friends with Krillin has to do with romantic tension. Which I don't but I'm not averse to the idea.Final Thoughts:Majinjou no Nemuri Hime\xa0is a solid film. It's enjoyable with some strong action sequences, good comedic moments and, frankly, if you're a fan of\xa0Dragonball\xa0this is forty five more minutes of the same type of thing. So, you'll enjoy it. It's definitely a vast improvement over the first film. I give it a solid 7/10.

Outside of curiosity you have no reason to watch this.The animation in particular is shoddy. Seems like characters just don't move around as well as they should. Couple this with some awkward scene transitions. The audio is also really bad. Even on the direct streaming version from Funimation it seems like voices are way too low and certain sounds are ear piercing. It becomes annoying to watch.Speaking of audio, yes a lot of the English voice actors are different. Goku and Bulma in particular sound awful....Luckily Roshi and Krillin are the proper English voice actors.The story is painfully dull. Roshi decides before he can train Golku or Krillin they must rescue a princess. The main villain is a vampire and is not interesting in the slightest. The whole thing is a struggle to watch. Nothing interesting happens the entire time.Watch something else. Luckily Roshi and Krillin are the proper English voice actors.The story is painfully dull.

Nothing interesting happens the entire time.Watch something else."", ""While it's starts of similarly to the first Dragon Ball movie in that it's a semi retelling of part of the TV show set in an alternate universe and has a similar issue of not having enough explanation to stop newcomers from being confused, Sleeping Princess makes much better use of the concept with the vast majority of the movie being completely original rather than simply retreading old material like in Curse of the Blood Rubies.While the plot is mostly a very basic affair with a similar charming and light-hearted vibe to the previous movie and TV show, the Gothic style of the setting the...movie takes place in the design of all of the creatures is excellent and different from the typical Dragon Ball style. I think that really helps the movie stand apart from others in the franchise give it a very unique feel, which to me made it much more interesting and entertaining.I doubt it would convert anyone who hates Dragon Ball or be a great jumping off point for people just getting into Dragon Ball, but if you're a fan it's definitely worth the time and despite its rating, in my opinion it is one of the better movies in the whole franchise. movie takes place in the design of all of the creatures is excellent and different from the typical Dragon Ball style.

A movie is supposed to have some level of grandiosity, but this really didn\'t have that at all. The movie felt slow, and there were noticeable points of reused animation such as the vampire\'s attack. Shots were dragged and panned needlessly, and it feels like for the era, especially for a movie, that is sorta lazy. The strongest comparison is probably Angel\'s Egg for me, whose animation is nothing but near masterful, with much...of the same architectural and world styling that this movie had, yet really come alive.The strongest thing going for it is the pseudo Garlic Jr. precursor. It\'s pretty clear some of the ideas were reused, the whole ""invading the world and filling it with demons"" and even the main Vampire guy is obvious very Garlic Jr, with ""garlic"" even being the Achilles heel of a vampire. Hard to wonder if they didn\'t look at this movie and think, as I do, ""wow this could be done far better"". Garlic Jr is a great arc, to be clear.I watched the dub, so that may skew things, but at the same time I\'m not a big fan of Dragonball\'s general audio compression that exists in pretty much any digital copy you are going to find. Perhaps on TV it wasn\'t as bad, but the peaking makes it nearly unwatchable in Japanese with the high pitched voices. of the same architectural and world styling that this movie had, yet really come alive.The strongest thing going for it is the pseudo Garlic Jr. precursor.

I loved it back then and gave it an 8, but now after rewatching it I realise it is amazing and deserves at the very least a 9. Here is why:Story: The story follows Gunma Akagi who is a country boy who loves to drive. He has a friend who is a mechanic and loves working on engines. We follow these boys as they try to get to the top in order to reach Formula One together. The road is not as smooth...as one could think and many problems have to be tackled. The nuances and sometimes actually the realistic story makes this anime great. It really shows the struggles to get to the top as a racing driver, or actually in any profession! I have to say that the story is not the strongest in the beginning but it more than makes up for it! - 9/10Art: I think the art was why I only gave it an 8 when I watched this years ago, but I have to say that the art is sublime. For this being 1988 it is amazing, and even today I would still say that this is great. The art has so much character and you can truly se that they use the medium to the fullest. It is not unusual for the animators to reuse frames or not have a developed background, but they do it in a way that it either does not affect the experience or actually improves it by the team being creative! These creative ideas makes you miss that this artstyle is not used any more! - 10/10Sound: The soundtrack is in my opinion great. The opening for the first half of the show is what you have to call a banger! The second one is not as good in my opinion but still quite good. The music in the background is quite good with the 'epic' distorted electric guitars that sounds like they are borrowed from Top Gun. My favorite part of the sound is the sounds of the engines. It feels like they put a large amount of energy in recording convincing engine sounds that corresponds with the correct car. Bravo! - 9/10Character: I think almost every character is great in this show. Some are better than others though; you can feel this especially with some characters that sometimes 'act out of their character'. And in the case of Gunma, I love his character, but from time to time you can't ignore his attitude and anger issues. Despite these frankly small issues, I believe that this show has a great character roster with a lot of development! - 8/10Enjoyment: This one is easy for me. There was not really a minute spent where I was bored, there were constantly issues to solve or epic races to watch. It was not like a flood either, they balanced the heavier things with the lighter very well. Superb! - 10/10Overall: This show is amazing. I think it's a shame that during the time of writing this review, this show only have been scored by 457 users. If you love drama, sports and general fun, I believe you have to see this show! - 9/10 as one could think and many problems have to be tackled.

A year ago, a friend advised me to watch this animeThe story tells of Han Akagi, a rural young man who is fond of racing cars and his dream to reach Formula 1 and overcome the obstacles he will face in order to achieve this dream.The first observation I did not like this anime in the transformation of its level from serious to unrealThe story is okay, but the events of the story are the problem that did not make me enjoy as I shouldIs the author underestimating our minds?I don't know if...the anime is really bad or was I expecting something like Initial DThe story has not been replaced (after disappointing the unrealness of the events) with art or music like people.I felt like I wasted 31 episodes watching the anime disappointed me, thinking the next episode would be betterThe only flaw in the anime is the exaggeration of the unnecessary comedy in some moments inside the episodeCharacters: The character of the hero has not developed at all since the beginning of the anime, the other characters were neglected to the point of being forgotten and re-appeared.But although the work did not force me, I advise those who did not watch it to watch it, but do not expect much. the anime is really bad or was I expecting something like Initial DThe story has not been replaced (after disappointing the unrealness of the events) with art or music like people.I felt like I wasted 31 episodes watching the anime disappointed me, thinking the next episode would be betterThe only flaw in the anime is the exaggeration of the unnecessary comedy in some moments inside the episodeCharacters: The character of the hero has not developed at all since the beginning of the anime, the other characters were neglected to the point of being forgotten and re-appeared.But although the work did not force me, I advise those who did not watch it to watch it, but do not expect much."", 'This anime is a masterpiece!

Gate Keepers 21,https://myanimelist.net/anime/128/Gate_Keepers_21,"['It&rsquo;s a worthy follow-up to the series, but I still like the original series - mostly because I found Gate Keepers to be more serious than the original. This time around things got more morbid too &ndash; there was definitely more blood. It&rsquo;s not like I can&rsquo;t stand blood (gory I barely gave a chuckle while watching the OVA, whereas the original had me laughing all the time. Also, it&rsquo;s no longer a harem anime. It&rsquo;s more of a bishojo anime.The characters were less charismatic as well. Ayane and Miu were OK, they reminded me of Megumi and Reiko, but the only character I truly...liked was Satoka Tachikawa. She&rsquo;s just one cool chick and her gate power is really interesting. I also like how characters from the original series made an appearance. I won&rsquo;t be specific just to avoid giving out spoilers.And since some characters reappeared, Tomokazu Seki and Masami Suzuki came back to play their respective characters once more. Even Takahiro Sakurai made a cameo appearance. Once again, they impressed me with their voice acting.While it looks the same, Gate Keepers 21&rsquo;s animation improved a bit. First of, the invaders had an upgraded design. I think there were more invader types compared to the original. Things were gory visually too, since there were scenes that showed how humans transformed into invaders. Before they just put on shades and they would become invaders, right? It&rsquo;s a lot different this time. There were even scenes of limbs being disemboweled. Of course, the CG was still good as ever.As for the music, it was OK. The song &ldquo;Ima, Egao ga Areba&rdquo; sung by Sakura Nogawa was similar to the opening of the original Gate Keepers, &ldquo;Asu no Egao no Tameni&rdquo;. As for the other song, &ldquo;Haneoto&rdquo; by Junko Watanabe, it&rsquo;s not something I like. It was really gloomy and kinda boring. The same goes for the BGM &ndash; The BGM became more eerie and dark as well.I would give it a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; rating. It&rsquo;s not as good as the original series, but I&rsquo;m glad to have watched it anyway. It&rsquo;s definitely worth it, and it&rsquo;s a good way to end Gate Keepers. liked was Satoka Tachikawa.

There's a pack of (more or less) cool girls using superpowers, throwing about deadly cell phones & easily crushing those invaders like small bugs. Six episodes of this ahead.Is that all? Well, the short answer is: No.Seeing the genre-eviscerating Madoka★Magica shake the mahou shoujo fandom today makes me wonder even more as to why GK 21, being nine years older and attempting basically the same thing, went barely noticed. Perhaps because no one had expected that a follow-up to a light-hearted shounen/action/adventure/harem series would be a gloomy mahou shoujo deconstruction. Yet it's...exactly this. Enjoy.[Story]So, there are Invaders. And there are Gate Keepers. They do kick Invaders' asses using their cool superpowers and pavement-melting mobile phones. So simple… Wait, but why someone who possesses a superpower would need some extra gadgets?.. Pardon, these superpowers _what_?.. Sorry, _how many_ Gate Keepers?!.. And those Invaders are… WHAT??! Oh sh**.The first thing that strikes in GK 21 is the perfectly undefinable genre and tone. The ‘mood pendulum’ swings violently between horror and parody, the most cruel and disgusting scenes getting exaggerated to the point of ridiculous, pathetically bombastic action sequences being run over by dramatic introspections, gags and puns thrown in every now and then… However, the more facts about the setting are revealed, the less room for humour remains. This is a dark and serious genre deconstruction. Accept it and welcome the Apocalypse.As for the series' connection with its prequel… Are there any references to GK TV? Yes. Does one need to watch GK TV to enjoy GK 21? No. GK 21 is good enough as a standalone work, one can understand what's going on without knowing any facts from the prequel.[Animation]Gonzo did a great job. The series abounds in computer-generated imagery, yet it doesn't seem too ‘artificial’. The dark atmosphere to fit the plot is skillfully created by subdued colors and weird camera angles. And there are quite a few showy battle scenes. As for character design, it's quite typical for Gonzo. Some do like their style (me too), some don't (well, tastes differ).[Sound]Sound effects are really well thought-out and performed. Plane jets and car engines, big city noises and eerie distant sounds in abandoned streets — everything sounds very realistic. Background music, though hardly being something very special, fits the action quite well. The neo-classical opening song is fascinating, the upbeat ending theme is also not bad. As for voice acting, the whole cast did a good job, but Mamiko Noto (Ghost Girl) is the true star of the show, so believable as if being a crazy ghost were her full-time occupation.[Character]In the beginning, Gate Keepers look like a bunch of rather typical characters. Given the series' length and number of fighting scenes, one could assume that they would not change till the end. And that would be a mistake. Each of the Gate Keepers gets her share of character development, and relationship between the two main protagonists, Ayane and Miu, changes dramatically through the series. And on the other side there's Ghost Girl, the most convincing mad villain. So much human, her feelings quite understandable — and still totally mad and dangerous.[Enjoyment]I liked GK 21 the moment I've seen the trailer for the first time, and I still enjoy rewatching it years after. This short series is definitely worth giving it a try.Just one remark: use official subtitles, as fansubbers often tend to turn GK 21 into a total mess. And even with decent subs, google ‘Manyoshu’. Ancient Japanese poetry is important to the story, make sure that it makes sense. exactly this. Enjoy.[Story]So, there are Invaders. And there are Gate Keepers.

Fate/Grand Order: First Order,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34321/Fate_Grand_Order__First_Order,"[""*Minor spoilers*Civilization ends in December 2016? Well, would you look at that, it is the last day of December 2016 in my time, but January 1st 2017 in other places. Let us see what happens in the next few hours. *Shrugs*Have you ever watched the Fate/Series? Yes? Well, I would say not to keep your hopes up on this part of the franchise, and I'll tell you why.The start of the story is that Mash Kyrielight ponders into the distance, whilst sitting next to her companion, Fou. Fou is a familiar-like beast in which had befriended Mash. Fou suddenly sees a man on the floor,...fainted. That man was Ritsuka Fujimaru, the male protagonist of the series.  During their time, there was technology called the Rayshift, a technology that utilizes time travel. It is used to go back in time, and it is in the facility called Chaldeas. The use of time travel is meant for the sake of the future, as the people who have the potential to be masters only can go back in time. HOWEVER, this use of time travel has a serious plot hole, that being:How can they talk to people that are still in the future?Time travel is a very highly rated aspect in any piece of literature, and if very well done, many would love it. However, the way this part of the series tries to use time travel just seems so bland, and they did not go in depth upon the use of time travel. I will give them that the use of time travel in this series was a bit interesting, it just was not done in a proper manner at all.Every other part of this piece of literature seems extremely bland. There was not anything notable about the animation (except for some battle scenes), sound, and characters.For the animation, one part is that they tear off a statue's head after being stoned to death.. but the body spews out blood as if it were a live person. Some of the battle scenes were at least a little bit entertaining. They were able to have my eyes focus a bit more onto the screen, but nothing more.For the sound, it did not feel like those characters' voice actors fit to who they were trying to be. That being, it felt very out of place. The soundtrack was not anything I found particularly invigorating, either. The sound effects were not anything to point out, as well.The characters was about as bland as tofu mixed with a banana. The main characters were not anything special, and I did not have a fun time watching them except during the battle scenes. I did not feel any emotional investment to anyone.The Fate/Zero soundtrack was absolutely astonishing, as it kept me in vast concentration in every single battle. The animation was also out of this world in Fate/Zero, as it was very detailed in each of the scenes. The characters in Fate/Zero were absolutely lovely, and I enjoyed each one of their ideologies.I guess you could say that the difference between the two is the insane budget that Fate/Zero has, whilst it did not seem so much for Grand Order, the story especially. Fate/Zero has the clash of extreme ideologies. What is a king? What does it mean to be a leader? What is justice? What happened to justice? Those are all questions that Fate/Zero answers, in which had me in high expectation on Fate/Grand Order, as it was apparently meant as another part of the Fate/Series.Is this really another part of the Fate/Series?Yes, this is another part of the Fate/Series, but it feels as if it was not. They go back to what is the first Holy Grail war, but it was nowhere near as exciting as Fate/Zero. I could even say that Fate/Stay Night had me more interested than this piece of the series.I, for one, am going to consider this piece to be separate from the Fate/Series.Overall: 4.25It could be that since I watched Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero first, it led me to having an extremely hard time watching this. I could not enjoy myself very much while watching it. I guess I set my expectations way too high for this, only to become something that should be swept under the rug.Will it be good to you, though?Did you enjoy these parts of the Fate/Series: Zero and Stay Night? If so, I would not recommend watching this unless you have a large amount of time to spare.--------------------------------------------------Note: This anime is meant to be an advertisement for the game being Fate/Grand Order.

In recent years, we’ve seen ufotable adapt Unlimited Blade Works while Silver Link put their talent into Fate/kaleid. Where does Fate Grand Order fit in? To be honest, this can be watched although not exactly a good place to start if you’ve just took your first step into Fate universe.A lot of people often questions about what order to watch Fate series. Fate Grand Order draws references and alludes to Nasuverse quite frequently so at least a decent amount of understanding should be obtained before watching this special. As...an episode worth of over 70 minutes of content, this to me was less of a special and more of a mini-movie. In addition, Fate Grand Order’s story is canon so it isn’t some fairy tale story made up from fans. This brings back a familiar feeling you’ll probably be experiencing if you’ve heard about the sacred Holy Grail Wars.The special leaves little time for humor and instead jumps right into the meat of the story. It’s somewhat thrilling as the first few minutes introduces the main protagonists including Mash and Fujimaru. Following that, we get quite amount of info dumping about an organization known as “Chaldea”, humanity, and servants. This is where things gets interesting as Fujimaru gets involved with a mixture of complicated events. We are also told about the servants including one Fate fans will be very familiar with….Saber. However, what I’m most impressed in this special is Cu’s role including the fight that he gets involved with. The most prominent character from Chaldea is Olga and she also gets an unwelcoming surprise. However, a problem exists in this special about these characters. “Why should we care about them?” The simple answer is that you probably shouldn’t really put too much faith into the characterization. It’s hard to really characterize the cast in a mere 70+ minutes. In essence, the special is designed more as a way to attract fans to the game. There hasn’t been a full TV anime adaptation announced yet so this special serve more as an advertisement. Fate/Grand Order is a Japanese mobile game designed for iOS and Android although there hasn’t been an official English release yet.That being said, I’m rather underwhelmed by the main male protagonist. It just feels like he’s there after getting a better understanding the events and purpose of Chaldea. The character chemistry between Fujimaru and Mash was just generic and there’s hardly interesting about either character. To me, it felt like others overshadowed their roles in this special. Yes, I’m looking at you, Cu. Not only that, I can’t really feel a lot of emotions from this even after what Olga discovered later on in the episode. With that being said though, if you’re into an action fest of servants and powers clashes, then this will be a treat for you. The animation quality by Lay-duce was decent although not at the level of famed studios like ufotable. On most parts, they got the battle choreography down right along with character designs. The joy of seeing servants fighting again in Nasuverse brings back the fun experience of what Fate fans has been waiting for. The soundtrack also compliments with the action sequences to make this into an acceptable supernatural thriller. On the other hand, the voice acting felt rather mediocre. Again, it feels like Cu stole a good part of the special despite not even being the main character.So, should you watch Fate Grand Order? Honestly, for anyone familiar with the Fate franchise, I would say it’s a right choice to watch this. However, if you’ve never touched anything related to Fate or Nasuverse, then this will feel a lot more like some random movie on your PTW. Fate Grand Order is more or less advertised as a way to get viewers to try out the game. The anime, while offers base content, can’t be taken for granted for its main storytelling. There’s just a lot of potential that weren’t, and to be quite frank, impossible to unlock from this. And that’s a certain kind of disheartening. an episode worth of over 70 minutes of content, this to me was less of a special and more of a mini-movie.

This is a great special, but it definitely has plenty of areas that could be improved. Although this film is admittedly worse than the other Fate series like Kaleid, UBW and Zero, it\'s still worth a watch.Set in the year 2015, the final era of magic. Caldea is an organization established to observe the magical world and the world of science - as well as to prevent the final extinction of mankind. Humanity is guaranteed at least another 100 years, that is until the future...realm observed by Caldea vanishes into thin air. Caldea is now sure humanity won\'t live past 2017, due to events taking place in the Japanese city of Fuyuki in 2004. The organization issues a Grand Order for a ""Holy Grail Expedition"" to investigate, uncover, and perhaps destroy the singularity responsible for wiping out mankind.Right off the bat, the story looks very enticing... is an over exaggeration. The plot is honestly very linear and doesn\'t do much justice in terms of plot twists or suspense. The cast is pretty typical but those who watch will surely not take of complacent that the male protagonist is described and epitomized as ""human"". So you can expect the most cliche male protagonist possible.This is a very good looking series in terms of art and animation. But with every adaptation, there is always a limited emphasis on character design. If you have watched any of the fate series, you will immediately recognize that some of the characters have been reused. The animation will look different from the other fate adaptations since it\'s not TYPE-MOON producing the film but Lay-duce, which I\'ve never even heard of before. Again, this film may feel off if you\'ve watched any of the other fate series. However, if you\'re a newcomer than there shouldn\'t be any problems in terms of quality and art.This pacing of this film is undoubtedly fast being a 1 hour and 12 minute special. Although due to the amount of information and fast-pacing, it still feels somewhat maintainable. Without prior knowledge, the servants can be a bit one-sided. The thing you have to remember is that you\'re *supposed* to know the characters beforehand but that doesn\'t take away from the enjoyment. It shouldn\'t  matter anyway since there is literally zero character development for the servants.Sound is a non-sequitur. Nothing really stands out, nothing\'s really bad.Overall, I give this film a 7 / 10. The plot has so much potential if they expand the story even further into multiple parts. But for me right now, the plot is very mediocre and the characters are too typical. Definitely deserves a watch if you\'re bored and have free time though. realm observed by Caldea vanishes into thin air.

However, if you\'re a newcomer than there shouldn\'t be any problems in terms of quality and art.This pacing of this film is undoubtedly fast being a 1 hour and 12 minute special. Although due to the amount of information and fast-pacing, it still feels somewhat maintainable. Without prior knowledge, the servants can be a bit one-sided. The thing you have to remember is that you\'re *supposed* to know the characters beforehand but that doesn\'t take away from the enjoyment. It shouldn\'t  matter anyway since there is literally zero character development for the servants.Sound is a non-sequitur. Nothing really stands out, nothing\'s really bad.Overall, I give this film a 7 / 10. The plot has so much potential if they expand the story even further into multiple parts. But for me right now, the plot is very mediocre and the characters are too typical. Definitely deserves a watch if you\'re bored and have free time though.', 'This ""Special"" glorified advertisement has the most ironic anime name in history. A woeful way to cap off 2016. For anyone who saw this shortly after, what a horrible way to start off 2017.*SPOILERS FOR FATE/GRAND ORDER: FIRST ORDER AND ONE SPOILER FOR FATE/ZERO SECOND SEASON*Fate/Grand Order: First Order isn\'t grand in the slightest. The only thing ""grand"" about this special feature film is how much of a grand travesty it is. It simply doesn\'t GET how any of the intricacies of the Holy Grail War or the servants work. Instead, it opts to be generic and full of black holes (that\'s how gaping these...plot-holes are), and as a result, this glorified mobile game advertisement fails as an addition to the franchise, and is the literal worst place for a newcomer to start. Why, you may ask. What exactly makes it fail to grasp the fundamentals of Fate? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?Basically, this organization (Chaldea) sends people that can become masters, to the past in order to intervene in events that could damage the timeline as we know it (despite the fact that they intervene when the events happen rather than prevent it outright, so how the hell does that work?) SO, some generic MC (named Ritsuka) randomly ends up in Chaldea, unconscious, in which we don\'t know how he got there, and gets kicked out of an assignment (by the directer, Olga, for sleeping in the briefing) with 47 other members, and there is a sabotage. How did it get sabotaged, causing so many people to almost die? Why did the person who did it, do it? Well, hold on to those questions forever, for they are never answered! His new friend, Mash, gets trapped under a hot piece of wall, and when MC-Kun gets his hands burned, yet when he uses his uniform to help him, his hands and outfit aren\'t burned. This event causes the Chaldea crystals (or something like that) to leave, which will doom the human race if not fixed, and they fix it by going back in time. What even is this? These things are what make it possible for humanity to survive? How? We know literally nothing about these things aside from that, making the structure of this film a mess. Believe me, it gets even messier.Just as Mash is about to die, she forms a contact with a mysterious servant, and with this, a plethora of new questions appear. How did get get here? Why is he a silhouette? If a contract is never formed like this, why is one being formed like this? How does he fuze with Mash to make her a demi-servant? Are those even supposed to be possible in Fate/?  What is this shielder class? Are there any OTHER new classes that aren\'t a part of the main 7? Again, none of these are answered. So, they time travel into an event taking place in 2004 in Fuyuki (the same one that would get burned down at the end of Fate/Zero, and they can communicate with people in the future, and they are sent to stop this bad event from taking place by resolving it rather than stop it before it starts. Yes, that makes TWO gigantic plot-holes in how their time-travel works (since there ain\'t no multiverse theory here), and they are never patched up. Time travel is easy to screw up in a story, damaging it in the long run (which is why multiverse theory is a much more stable ground for time travel, which is why Dragon Ball Z gets this right), but linear time-frames are much harder to safely work with, as they are very fragile in what you can feasibly get away with without creating a big plot-hole. Guess which route they take, and guess what happens!So, Mash and her ""master"" Ritsuka get sent to stop a singularity that is not given an explanation as to why it will mess with time. Is it because there are servants but no masters? Maybe. They never tell us. Also, how can there be a Holy Grail War with no masters? I mean, servants physically cannot exist in this world without a master supplying mana, How come this was never recorded. You\'d think that the organization that is effectively meant to record everything in time itself (how else can they know when something could cause a time paradox at any given moment in history?) would\'ve been able to do this. For some reason, the director, Olga, is here for some reason. They later explain that she was right above the explosion of the sabotage, but we didn\'t even see where she was, so we can only take this shady, untrustworthy anime\'s word for it. So, after the duo saves Olga\'s life, she is informed by the doctor (Romani) that they are here to stop this one singularity and that the sabotage critically injured all of the other candidates. Then they run into Medusa (Lancer this time, usually she\'s rider class), and they get their asses handed to them before Cu Chulainn (Caster this time, usually he\'s lancer class) shows up, and together with Mash, they kill her. Turns out, somehow, Saber went Alter, she killed most of the other servants and somehow turned them into alter versions, with their personalities altered as well, but we only get to see two of them for some reason. Caster killed one of them (assassin), he says that Berserker won\'t bother them unless provoked (which is why he isn\'t even here), but we see silhouettes of Gilgamesh and Medusa (who is probably rider class by process of elimination) and neither of them show up at all, so what happened with them is unknown.We get our explanation as to how a Noble Phantasm works here: it is naturally triggered after a certain unexplainable feeling triggers it. This heavily clashes with how Noble Phantasms have worked in the rest of the franchise. They were simply a unique ace-in-the-hole trump card a servant had that could be activated at any time to really turn the tide of battle (like reviving yourself 12 times, summoning the wrath of Excalibur, ramming someone with a pegasus at extremely high speeds, or creating a reality marble to summon things or people in order to crush your trapped foe), but now, they can only be activated after discovering a random feeling?! NO! BULLSH*T!!! Well, they move on and then encounter Alter Archer, so Caster stalls while the rest of the group face off against Saber Alter (who is surprisingly much weaker than any anime incarnation of Saber thus far), and after two ok fights and plenty generic tropes and moments to truly sell this broken mess as trite, they finally defeat Saber Alter. Now, for one of the worst endings I have ever seen.I forgot that there was this one character named Lev Lainur. Then again, he only appeared in one scene and was introduced as the creator of this organization. Now, he\'s a villain. This heel-turn is extremely telegraphed and extremely horrible. And, surprise surprise, even less How the hell did he even get here. Why is he evil? Why did he sabotage his organization\'s major mission (he claims to be tasked with killing humanity, but by whom?)? Why did he wait so long (the organization was established an unknown yet probably long time ago) to do this? BAH! He kills Olga in a horribly mean-spirited and equally needless death scene (in which NOBODY DOES ANYTHING TO STOP THIS), and he somehow leaves. Everything collapses (for some reason), and they are sent back to the present just in time. Wait. Why didn\'t the guys in the present get them out of there in order to save their goddamn director?! A master has 3 command seals that he can use, and Ritsuka used one...despite it never being shown that he did so...ever! In fact, he literally does nothing for this entire movie. He is the most useless character in this goddamn film and he\'s the protagonist.fuck this endingSo, Mash and Ritsuka bond more, and now they have to save humanity by doing the same thing they\'ve been doing, but on a grander scale. So, we get to see glimpses of what will come in the future (for the characters, anyway) in a montage that is exactly like how a television commercial would play out, and this goddamn movie finally ends. Horrible writing, plot-holes up the ass, stuff that contradicts the very foundation of the franchise, and nothing of any value. As a Fate/ fan, I am borderline offended. Go f*ck yourself, movie! What\'s worse, we still got a long way to go! Yes, my sanity IS depleting!As stated before, Ritsuka is not only a bland and generic protagonist (complete with the generic hair and look), but he is absolutely useless as well. Aside from failing to help Mash, he literally does nothing throughout this entire film. He is a horrible protagonist, not for his bland personality, but for the fact that he adds literally NOTHING to any of the major events of this film! I don\'t even know how an anime accomplished that! It\'s astounding. Mash is also pretty generic, with her generic insular personality warming up to Ritsuka and that being all there is to her. Olga is made out to be this tough directer who takes no sh*t from anyone, but is just lame, borderline useless, and whiny. She puts up one shield, shoots some magic at some goons, yells at Ritsuka to man up in one scene, and that\'s it. She adds almost nothing here. Her death meant nothing, which is sickening given how unfair and cruel the death is. Romani is comic relief for one scene and takes over an even less involved role later, and yes, he adds little in both personality and plot impact.Cu Chilainn has always been a fun character in every incarnation in a Fate/ anime (excluding the Lancer in Zero, since he is a different person, Diarmund to be exact), and here, it\'s no exception. He\'s the only DECENT character in this movie, providing some witty lines against everyone and being a genuine badass (sad to think, this is the very first compliment I gave this film). He uses his Noble Phantasm (we can assume so, they never directly state it) a few times, as well as his wit to gain the upper hand against literally every foe. Yes, he is the one that kills every enemy servant, not any of the protagonists. Medusa here, thanks to the whole alter thing, is a completely different person than in any incarnation, and is just a generic sadistic villain for the sake of it, which is a crying shame for her heart-stoppingly beautiful self. Alter Archer is pretty bland here to thanks to the Alter. Saber Alter is basically a ""fight me"" villain, with no purpose besides being some final boss at the end without a personality to speak of. Lev is a horrendous villain. He shows up once and then is a cliche villain for the sake of it. He\'s exactly like Hans from Frozen in that regard, except he gets literally nothing done (except for horribly kill Olga), and the villains here were bad enough as it is. Talk about a horrendous cast. Only one good character out of like, eight...Thankfully there are some aspects of this special that are a little more decent. Studio Lay-duce is fairly new here, only really being known for animating the two Magi Sinbad no Byouken anime. I won\'t cut them any slack since outside of one or two good character designs, lackluster --if sparse-- CGI, the LN style, mediocre colors, and ok at best artwork are still damning aspects of the visuals here. Conversely, the fights are alright and decently animated and some of the effects like Saber Alter\'s Excalibur Morgan look downright badass. Regardless, the visuals aren\'t very engaging outside of the fight scenes, which are the only times this disasterpiece doesn\'t suck or rend my soul.There is no OP by the way...just putting it out there. The background OST here is beyond lacking, that at times, there wasn\'t any. Sure, the OST is unspeakably forgettable, but at least play the tracks more! As for the ED, Shikisai, by Maaya Sakamoto, it starts off interesting but becomes a meh theme overall. There really isn\'t much of anything to any of the songs here. Fitting for such a generic and boring pile of absurdity.This film is rather boring. It may be partially due to the robotic dialogue and how cliche everything feels, but the film is very un-engaging. Plus, the final 10 minutes are nigh-infuriating for how horrible the events are and how stupid and mean-spirited it all is. What\'s worse, the more I think about this movie, the more infuriated I became as I tried to process just how wrong the story was and how little it seemed to understand the Fate/ franchise in general. Being bored is one thing, but when you\'re bored and annoyed, or, God forbid, bored and angry, that simply makes for a torturous experience. A few chuckle-worthy mini-moments hardly make anything better either.What even was Fate/Grand Order: First Order? A horribly made and painfully long, glorified commercial. Some of you will try to argue that it\'s a prologue so it cannot be judged like a full-fledged series, but the writing here is so damn awful that most full-length series fail to match it. The characters (barring one) are generic at best an horrendous and/or useless at worst, and nothing about the story worked in any capacity. It actively contradicts the Fate/ franchise\'s rules sometimes and has an insanely stupid ending. I get that this was first and foremost, a prologue to advertise the Fate/Grand Order mobile game, but that is no excuse for how horrific the writing here is. If I saw this when it came out, I would\'ve immediately labeled this as one of the worst anime of 2016, but not only will I have to do that now in 2017, but I also have to name this the worst Fate/ anime in current existence, and I hope that no Fate/ series anime ever surpasses this. With all that said, I bid you adieu. plot-holes are), and as a result, this glorified mobile game advertisement fails as an addition to the franchise, and is the literal worst place for a newcomer to start.

With all that said, I bid you adieu.', 'Is Fate/Grand Order: First Order, another adaptation from the Type Moon universe? Yes it is. Is it a cannon worthy adaptation from studios like Ufotable and the studio that must not be named *cough* Studio Deen? Not entirely. Is it another money making “adaptation” to exploit the grand Fate Universe that studios such as Silver Link have done in the past? After knowing it is based off of the mobile game Fate/Grand Order, quite possibly.With that out of the way, is it worth watching this movie/special or should I watch the cannon works by other studio first? Well isn’t that why you are reading...this review? *(To save you from reading the entire review, watch the Ufotable arc first before watching this)*The major plot of the anime revolves around the organization called Chaldea, who carries out Holy Grail Expeditions to investigate and destroy any singularities that may cause the extinction of humanity. The director immediately throws the viewers into this chaotic world where the main characters are just as confused as the viewers are in trying to figure out what exactly is going on. Not to fret, they quickly summarize what the Holy Grail war is, who they are and their purpose. Although the story appears to be complex with all the “mankind is on the brink of extinction” bs, it really is simple. However, this Michael Bay style directed movie will leave viewers confused with the amount of forced comic reliefs and unnecessary explosions. They just want to make the viewers believe this organization matters. They try to inject elements like romance and ecchi to appeal to the viewers but it just wasn’t well done so it leaves an unsatisfying taste in your mouth. The story had too many plot holes and the whole concept of time travelling falls flat when people are able to communicate across timelines. The ending was really predictable and it made no sense why the villain needed to create the problem in the first place. It was too abrupt and if they are trying to coin this as a special not a movie, then more movies/specials in this series needs to be released.The movie introduces the major characters Fujimaru and Mash as the master and servant in this movie. However, the characters barely go through any growth or character change for the viewers to become attach to them. Even the servants introduced throughout the movie felt hollow. The ideology, the dialogues, the complexity of their psyche that Nasuverse had was barely visible. People were just fighting and dying after delivering their signature line. There is no motivation or purpose behind each of their decision making. The characters just felt flat. The most interesting character to come out of this special was the narrator, because by the end even he was questioning what in the fate world he was narrating.Despite the movie/special doing so poorly in the story and character department, they didn’t put much effort in making their art and sound stand out much. There was no epic OST like other Fate animes to get your blood pumping nor did this movie have quality animation like Ufotable had with their Unlimited Budget Works. Still, for a studio like Lay-Duce, who just wants to make a quick buck with this mobile game adaptation, the action scenes were still fun to watch. Who doesn’t love the nostalgic feel of seeing servants like Archer and Saber fight?Overall, viewers will find more enjoyment out of this movie if they have already watched the other cannon adaptations of the fate series that focused on the Holy Grail War. For those watching this for the first time, you will enjoy it more if you go in with really low expectations. Keep in mind this movie is a blend adaptation of the mobile game and a small arc in the Fate Universe. Although the fans of Fate Universe always appreciate seeing more movie/show adaptations, I’m sure viewers like me will forget this movie even existed. We would appreciate it more if studios stopped milking the Fate Franchise and actually presented a well-developed adaptation with meaningful memorable characters and crisp fighting choreography with great background scores. Nevertheless, give it watch if you have nothing better do. Even if you hate it, at least your love/appreciation for other Fate Universe adaptations will grow. this review? *(To save you from reading the entire review, watch the Ufotable arc first before watching this)*The major plot of the anime revolves around the organization called Chaldea, who carries out Holy Grail Expeditions to investigate and destroy any singularities that may cause the extinction of humanity.

Even if you hate it, at least your love/appreciation for other Fate Universe adaptations will grow.', '""Fate/Grand Order: First Order is a 1hour prologue to what looks to be an interesting game.""I\'ll make this brief.Aside from knowing who Mash is and discovering her glorious fanarts, there is nothing else I\'ve found enjoyable in this adaptation.The story does not directly spoil any events from the branches of Fate adaptations, though they do hint at some story elements and information that is not yet adapted into anime form.After watching, I\'m left with the curiosity to check out the actual game itself, not because this adaptation was great but because I believed the actual game must be so much better than this. ', 'Before I start with the review, I’d like to say a few things about its source, Fate/Grand Order, the mobile game. It started off as a fun entry in the Type-Moon franchise. So it\'s understandable if you think the story at the beginning isn\'t impressive. But after the release of a few chapters the players realized Fate/Grand Order is becoming like the a conduit for the whole Fate series, that includes Fate/stay night, Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha, Fate/Strange Fake, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya etc. Suddenly F/GO turns out like the most canon story out of the whole franchise, with rewriting certain canon parts of it. It even...is contributing towards the whole Nasuverse as well.With that being said, this special episode, titled ""Fate/Grand Order: First Order"" is based on the prologue chapter of the game. As a prologue, you should limit  your expectations and understand this is not even the beginning of the story. This is more like a setup episode, with certain parts of the game’s prologue rewritten by Nasu himself to make it more anime-friendly.As a setup for the story, about half of the episode includes exposition contents. What is going on around, how this is happening, what to do, things like these. It’s almost as if they are trying to hold your hand and give you a tour of a museum and forcing you to read the descriptions. A lot of viewers might not like it, and I can understand that. However, all these are because it was the tutorial part of the game. I’m not telling you to like it or hate it, but asking you to understand why this is happening.After most of the exposition is done, the 2nd half of the episode is solely based on the protagonist and his team’s first adventure in this world. A lot of anime original contents were added, which I believe was mostly necessary. See, the game at this point was only throwing waves after waves of enemies to teach you how to fight, none of them were worth mentioning. Only the final battle of the prologue (and may be one or two battles before that) was important. The anime version here featured some full length amazing battles between servants. The fights, for most of the part, were done greatly.Animation: If we talk about the animation, I’m pretty sure most of the Type-Moon fans will be disappointed. And why not!? Previous most of the Type-Moon anime adaptations (Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works TV series) were done by ufotable, a studio extremely well known for their brilliance in visual department. They are known as one of the best studios considering great animation and visual effects. Fate/Grand Order: First Order, on the other hand, is done by Lay-duce, a studio which is very little known since they are relatively new in the anime industry with the only notable names done by them are Magi: Sinbad no Bouken and Classroom Crisis. If the viewer compare their works with ufotable’s, they are certain to get disappointed. However, if you ignore that, the animation isn’t bad. It is good most of the time, with the quality dropping only a few times when the characters are zoomed out.Sound: The BGMs of this anime are probably its best part. Some freaking amazing OSTs, used beautifully with the events happening on the screen. The ending song is actually the opening song of the game, perhaps a bit of a remix version of the original, and I liked itCharacter: Characterization is done well, and considering this as a setup for what’s to come, the introductions were done good.Enjoyment: Before watching the series, I knew this was done by a lesser known studio, and the story is based on the weakest part of a mobile game. More precisely, it is just a prologue. That is why I limited my expectations. In that sense, they surpassed my expectations! 74 minutes of a prologue episode didn’t feel boring at all…… well, may be the first half an hour, but come on! Even the first episode of Fate/Zero was full of expositions one after another.Overall, I’d like the viewers to take it easily and enjoy it. It’s not a god tier special episode, and it doesn’t need to be one. I know the ending of the story (or at least up to what is revealed in the game) is damn good. So I can understand if a sequel TV series is declared, or may be other special episodes, the quality will only rise from here. is contributing towards the whole Nasuverse as well.With that being said, this special episode, titled ""Fate/Grand Order: First Order"" is based on the prologue chapter of the game.

They severely rushed the story line and filled it with plot holes and cliches. Not only that, the first 50 or so minutes were extremely boring. When drama is forced into the story just for the sake of moving the story along, you have to turn off your brain and accept it in order to try to enjoy the movie. If you think too much about it, you'll realize how bad the writing is. If you love the senpai/waifu dynamic, 10 minutes of random fighting with mediocre battle scenes, lackluster sci-fi...with plot holes, and characters with whom you have no emotional attachment to ....then you might like this story. The character design was cliche and has the standard anime tropes, you won't find anything new here. with plot holes, and characters with whom you have no emotional attachment to ....then you might like this story.

Ever since it\'s initial announcement, I was excited to watch the anime adaptation of Fate/Grand Order. Having played the game for a bit over a year, I was eager to learn the story and how this timeline was supposed to fit with the rest of the Nasuverse. Instead, I got a half baked story with a bunch of cliché characters and a confusing plot.Story: 5It\'s... an interesting concept I suppose? I\'m sure the game did a much better job with handling it, but the adaptation barfed so much dialogue and exposition at the beginning, I was very confused going into...it. The beginning also seemed very rushed, which didn\'t exactly help either. The rest of the story seems to be loosely connected plot points that hardly have any correlations with one another. Again, since I didn\'t follow the story in-game, I wasn\'t sure if this was the fault of the original or of the adaptation. Either way, the story was nothing special.Art: 4It may be because A1 pictures did all of F/GO\'s Promotional Videos or because Ufotable set the standard for Type-Moon anime, but I was highly disappointed with the production value. Everything, from the unremarkable directing to the clunky animation, screamed mediocre. The only reason I give it a score below ""mediocre"" is because it ruined a lot the immersion, especially during the fight scenes where it is most noticeable.Sound: 5The music wasn\'t that interesting, as nothing really stood out. I noticed they used some music from the game, which was fine, because they did not overuse it and instead used an original soundtrack (I think, anyways. Don\'t quote me on this.) I know some people were upset that Mashu\'s voice actor was changed, but I personally didn\'t have a problem with this. Overall, nothing to really mention here.Character: 5They\'re as cliché as they can get. Cute, timid girl who has a crush on the main character? Check. Tsundere? Check. Typical ""average guy"" protagonist? Check. Edgy and unsubtle villain? Check. Really, you have probably seen these characters done before - and done much better. The only good character is arguably Caster, and that\'s because he was Fate/Stay Night\'s Lancer. There are ""alter"" versions of Servants from Fate/Stay Night that make appearances, but unfortunately do not have much screen time due to its fast pace. Hopefully, they will continue to introduce other Servants from the game (as they teased at the end) and will have more satisfying characters.Enjoyment: 6I usually don\'t account for enjoyment in my overall score because my enjoyment stems from everything listed above. Although, I am a big fan of any work done by Type-Moon and I was glad to see that this was adapted. Even though it was not fit to my expectations, I still enjoyed seeing some of these characters on screen.Overall: 5I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone who casually watches anime, but to those who like the Fate franchise or has played Fate/Grand Order, I would recommend to at least give it a shot. it.

Maybe if it wasnt having to live up against the rest of the Fate franchise it would be an ok movie but you cant even begin to compare the two.The story is honestly just so... out of nowhere. I had absoultely NO idea what was going on half the time, and there is literally no character development in the entire move. They try to make emotional scenes but i just find myself unable to...care about any of the characters because i know NOTHING ABOUT THEM.As for the animation quality and fight scenes they just dont live up to the Fate standard. The animations are all missing that brilliant flair that made the series so well known for its fights. And speaking of the fights the choreography (i guess thats what you'd call it) is atrocious. One of the fights is the literal definition of bashing a rock against a wall. There was one fight in there that i feel captured a bit of the original series agression but as with most scenes it only lasted a few minutes.I feel like if they had took the time or effort to make this into a whole 20-some episode series it could have had some decent potential, even with the lackluster animation. But as it stands its a rushed, underwhelming movie that feels like it just stole the Fate name and characters and did NOTHING interesting with them. care about any of the characters because i know NOTHING ABOUT THEM.As for the animation quality and fight scenes they just dont live up to the Fate standard.

We\'re talking so bad I can\'t believe that the original makers of the FSN game or anime, or the very well done Unlimited Blade Works anime, could\'ve accepted to release that.Story: 2 : Forget any other Fates. This is a story with Servants and that\'s the only connection. The world is apparently in some ""unspecified deadly anime danger"" and some non-specific techno-device-thing exists that predicts whether humanity will survive or not. And...there is also some time/space travel. And techno things. And a surprise twist villain. And oh god that whole thing was so cliché and uninteresting I just can\'t even care. It was a bad surprise villain with an extremely poorly developped world, with some atrocious setups, with everything being just bad...I can\'t even be bothered to explain. This was too terrible to be worth an explanation, to be honest.Art: 3 : I tend to write often ""for a 201x anime it\'s fine"". Well let\'s reverse that. For a 2016 anime, this is TERRIBLE. It\'s under-animated, generally cheap, you get no feel for anything, the faces, frames, reactions, situations, everything that\'s supposed to seep from the art in an anime is utterly trite or plainly cliché.Sound: 3 : Was there music? I don\'t remember any music. I also don\'t remember anything worth mentioning with the sound or VA. Everything was just so freaking forgettable.Character : 1 : Ok this is by far the biggest offender. You see, a terrible story can still roll if you like the characters. BUT THERE WERE NO CHARACTERS. The main guy? The main girl? The main tsundere? All of them, they were a walking mass of cliches, every frame, every time they made a face, I could tell what they were going to do or say before they said it, it all felt rehashed, overdone, dead, so done to death it felt just bothersome, they had nothing past their tropes, they had no buildup, no personality, no depth, nothing at all! Literally the only thing that saved this from being a 1/10 overall is the characters from OTHER Fates. Seeing Cu Chulainn or Arturia again(they\'re not their usual roles in this, which might be the only semi-interesting twist in the story) meant that I could see characters that I knew and gave just a bit of a damn about.But for this anime\'s ""original cast""? It\'s literally 0. Not one of them deserves mention. Maybe the tsundere/commander\'s physical appearance is alright. That\'s it. I\'m grasping.Enjoyment: 2: Cliché, trite, boring, predictable, the only thing missing is outright offensive.Overall: 2 : Whoever commited this thing needs to be asked two simple questions:""What is the worst cancer of the anime industry?""and""What should be the first order of any new anime?""And if he answers ""Copying without creating"" and ""A creative basis"" then outright ask him if he was trying to kill the anime industry any further.For any other answer, just fire this guy...please, no more of this... there is also some time/space travel.

This being the only disappointment, let\'s see what First Order has for us.Characters:The Ritsuka (mc) feels a bit of a mix between Sieg and Shirou. He is not completely dump and slow but also not very helpful. Most of the time you could have omitted him as it feels that he plays no particular role or feels important.

A little odd ball who has great powers. But of course she has to try and develop it.

As a caster type and not yet corrupted, he thinks himself of a guide towards Mash and her team. As always he is a good guy with a fast end.Art:The special effects and animation is what you would expect from Type-Moon. It is good, fluent and vibrant. What actually was a bummer was the battle between Saber and Mash. There were just two battles, Lancer vs Caster and Archer vs Caster, so there is not much action going on.

While it may have its moments, this adaptation fails to capture the essence of what makes the franchise so beloved and ultimately falls short of expectations.One of the biggest drawbacks of Fate/Grand Order: First Order is its poorly executed storytelling. The plot feels rushed and lacks depth, leaving viewers confused and detached from the characters and their motivations. The pacing is uneven, making it difficult to fully invest in the narrative. The introduction of various Servants and their backstories feels haphazardly thrown...in, leading to a disjointed viewing experience.The characters themselves suffer from underdevelopment and lackluster characterization. Protagonist Ritsuka Fujimaru lacks the depth and agency that would make them a compelling lead. Instead, they come across as a generic and forgettable protagonist, failing to leave a lasting impression. The supporting cast, while filled with iconic Servants from the Fate franchise, is relegated to one-dimensional archetypes without much room for growth or exploration.The animation quality of Fate/Grand Order: First Order is serviceable at best. While the character designs are faithful to the source material, the animation lacks consistency and fluidity. The action sequences, which should be a highlight of any Fate adaptation, feel lackluster and fail to deliver the intensity and excitement expected from the franchise.Regarding the controversial scene involving Saber Alter, it is indeed one of the few enjoyable moments in the anime. However, it is marred by the inclusion of a gratuitous and unnecessary scene where a shirtless Caster locks her in a cage. This choice feels out of place and adds nothing of substance to the story. Furthermore, the eventual demise of Saber Alter is abrupt and unsatisfying, leaving viewers questioning its purpose and impact on the narrative.In conclusion, Fate/Grand Order: First Order is a disappointing adaptation that fails to capture the essence and depth of the Fate franchise. Its lackluster storytelling, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent animation make it difficult to recommend to both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. While the inclusion of Saber Alter adds a brief moment of enjoyment, it is not enough to salvage the overall quality of this anime. in, leading to a disjointed viewing experience.The characters themselves suffer from underdevelopment and lackluster characterization.

Fate/Grand Order: First Order. Is it worth your time?That depends. If you don\'t know anything about the Fate series, I\'d recommend you stay away from this for now. If you\'re not familiar with the Holy Grail War\'s rules, this movie will be nothing short...of an incomprehensible mess to you. You might say that makes it a bad movie, but I disagree - this is very clearly not aimed at newcomers to the Fate series, any more than I suspect the mobile game would be. It\'s expected that you know what you\'re getting into. There is no explanation of rules, no moment to understand the confusing world you\'ve been thrown into. Watch *at least* Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night:Unlimited Blade Works before watching this, and if all of the Heaven\'s Feel movies are out when you\'re reading this (as of the time of writing, none are out), watch those as well.How much do you like the Fate series? If you didn\'t like either Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works, then still stay far away from this. I don\'t mean to say it\'s a bad movie/special by saying that, but if you didn\'t like those, there\'s little to no chance you\'ll like this. It\'s still Fate, after all.If you\'re a huge Nasuverse fan, and you\'ve read the original VN and gone into the lore and whatnot, then sure, this is probably exactly what you wanted. Of course, if you\'re that much of a fan, you\'ve likely already experienced the story when you played Grand Order, but if you refuse to play a non-translated/non-localised game, then this is probably for you. You\'ll probably love it.What if you fall into none of the above categories? You liked Fate/Zero and UBW (and Heaven\'s Feel, if it\'s out), but the words ""Realta Nua"" mean nothing to you, and you\'re wondering if this is for you. The answer, unfortunately, is not clear cut, and depends on your taste in anime. I\'d say it\'s worth a single watch. That being said, I\'d warn you not to expect too much from it going in.The story here is weaker than in other Fate features, and far too predictable, at least when it\'s making sense. The art, while certainly not bad, is not the glorious Ufotable Unlimited Budget Works we saw last time. The old characters are back, and are played and portrayed very well, but the new characters are... nothing to make special note of. Despite being on screen for far less time than the ostensible leads, the familiar faces from Fate/Stay Night are far more memorable and practically steal the show. And this really isn\'t the fault of the voice actors - Takahashi Rie and Shimasaki Nobunaga, as well as the VAs for the other new characters (I\'m almost 100% sure Tomokazu Sugita was there, but his character isn\'t listed on MAL yet) do the best they can with what they\'re given. I\'m not entirely sure how much of this is a problem arising from it being an adaptation of a chapter of a mobile game, and how much of it is problems arising from the act of adapting itself (that is, how much of this was a problem with the source material vs just the adaptation), but I suspect a large fraction. I\'ve left the ""Character"" rating blank for this reason alone - the characters original to this story would probably earn 1 or a 2, maybe a 3, but the old characters really hold this up, and while it would only really buoy it up to a 5 or a 6, I\'m not sure if it\'s fair to give this a higher score for literally re-using characters from other parts of the franchise.TL;DR - In conclusion, IF you watched and liked both Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night UBW, this might be worth checking out. If you haven\'t watched them, watch those first. If you didn\'t like either or both, you probably won\'t enjoy this. No matter which of those categories you\'re in, though, if you choose to watch this, I\'d recommend not setting your expectations high, because if you do, you\'ll likely be disappointed. of an incomprehensible mess to you.

It’s a beautiful commercial, mind you, and I want more of it. But it doesn’t really have any depth on its own and relies solely on being a fan of the Fate Franchise to even understand the concepts beyond going to the past to save the future. The characters are  hamstrung from the moment of its creation because they can’t dedicate any depth to them and the only one who really stands out is Caster.If it had more episodes to build up, it could have been great. ', 'Felt mediocre in every aspect, I gave it a higher rating than 5 because I liked seeing familiar characters. It doesn\'t really go into depth with anything although it has an interesting premise involving ""Chaldeas"" which is a planetary replicate of earth using its soul allowing people to predict if there are going to be any devastating events in the future. Even with time travel into the past to correct the future it\'s not interesting which may be partly because there is little explanation. There is an interesting fight sequence but most of the fights are bland. And for the characters we\'re talking about a...diehard devoted waifu girl that takes a liking to MC at first sight and a super weak bland MC that wants to be of help but is useless much like Fate/Stay night Shirou. His personality is exactly the same but this time he is even more useless.Overall it\'s an average, mediocre, bland anime. It\'s an okay watch to pass time, but certainly could be better. diehard devoted waifu girl that takes a liking to MC at first sight and a super weak bland MC that wants to be of help but is useless much like Fate/Stay night Shirou.

It\'s an okay watch to pass time, but certainly could be better.', ""Fate/Grand Order: First Order is exactly what the title says it is. To put that into context for those that may not be aware, this anime is based off of the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. Specifically the introduction and the first chapter of the game. As someone who has been playing Fate/Grand Order for over a year now and has followed the story to it's recent conclusion, I want to disclose this fact now rather than at the end of the review.Story: 6/10Unfortunately the episode was entirely dedicated to setting the stage for what will happen later on within the story. And because it is...set in Fuyuki, it can feel like it is relying on Fate/Stay Night as a crutch to keep your attention. With the majority of Servants coming from F/SN with shuffled classes and mirrors to scenes from it.Art: 7/10I'm personally a fan of most Type-Moon art, and given how this is a Fate work I am a fan of it. While the protagonist's appearance is very dull, most of the other characters have interesting designs. With that alternate take of Cú Chulainn and the altered appearances of FS/N servants we have not seen before such as EMIYA and Medusa. For how it is all animated I would say that for the most part it is solid. Not the best but serviceable with a few high points.Sound: 5/10From what I can tell the majority of the soundtrack is ripped right from the game. This could be a hit or a miss depending on the scene. With one scene very early feeling forced just to have the main login music play. As if they need to strike that off the checkbox. If you liked the music from the game you'll have no issue. If you hated it than I'm sorry you'll have to put up with it throughout the episode.Characters: 7/10This is where I feel my biases will begin to show. Mashu is a character I have gotten fond of over the course of the game and recently Roman. So seeing these characters animated is certainly a treat for me. And seeing more of Cú Chulainn is never a bad thing for me. However, Ritsuka Fujimaru feels very boring. One of your run of the mill average joe turns hero type of character. The only reason I can think of for him being so stale is because he fulfills the role of the player character. So he's really just along for the ride and acts as a plot device.Enjoyment: 9/10As an active player of the game Fate/Grand Order, I have to say that I enjoyed the episode a lot despite it's flaws. It was great to see some of the characters in animations and to get some of the early story bits fleshed out a bit as early translations were very rough to non-existent. As this is the first chapter of a very long story I am very forgiving of what can be lack luster since I was looking ahead for what can happen if they decide to expand this with additional OVAs or even a series. So for a fan of Type-Moon works and a player of the game, I enjoyed this quite a bit. But for someone with very limited knowledge of the Fate universe or having zero knowledge of id, they may not be able to get into it very much.Overall: Solid 6/10While I did enjoy the OVA quite a bit, I can not say that I'll recommend it to someone who is just getting into Fate, or an average anime viewer. It was created for fans of the game and I feel it hit that mark pretty well. The story of specifically this episode is nothing really to praise but it can be fun to see play out. It's good for animations based on mobile games, but unlike something like say the Kancolle or Touken Ranbu anime (games I am not very familiar with but very loosely follow), I feel that those will be easier to get into since Fate/Grand Order: First Order does have a few barriers of entry if you do want to fully enjoy it. set in Fuyuki, it can feel like it is relying on Fate/Stay Night as a crutch to keep your attention.

Mash Kyrielight voiced by Rie Takahashi is Saber including the ""subtle"" romantic interest Emiya and Saber had in and she as a Demi-Servant she was pretty badass...even with a shield, however she is somewhat overshadowed by the bizarro Servants , Olga Marie is Rin Tohsaka without her tsundere wiles, but just a more confident vers. of her. What LA is saying is even if the character beats have similar traits to the original Fate stay night, but the difference in these characters makes them likable enough. LA\'s favourite character quite easily going to Mash.The animation done by Lay-duce was amazingly detailed similar to ufotable\'s animation though some subtle difference such as different ""shininess"" to it and bolded and more pronounced character outlines, nonetheless the animation is pretty well done and detailed to look at especially the detailed and bombastic battles.The only other strength LA saw was the meat of the story when the time traveling starts happening as well as fighting the bizarro Servants.Where the flaws comes in, is mostly in it\'s plot for LA, mainly the beginning long expositional world building, though LA likes world building, it went on ""just"" a bit too long and that comes in full force as the blatant hints to the major antagonist and obvious bad guy of this iteration of the Fate series because of how long the exposition and ""subtle"" in long quotation marks hints were given. Lastly the plot\'s major climax especially with Mash\'s fight against Saber Alter just ends with an interruption from someone and ends the battle just like that, LA doesn\'t know it could have shown Mash defeating Saber Alter herself with her new powers but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, then with that anti-climax of a fight comes in the obvious ""REAL villain\'s arrival"".....it was just predictable to say the least.For what  Fate/Grand Order: First Order is a mobile game adaptation of the same name, LA can see it\'s blatant advertising for both the game and the next installment to Fate EXTRA: Last Encore (if the final scenes are anything to go by), but for a one hour episode and given it\'s world building and plot structure, LA can forgive it for all this as it opens up many possibilities in connecting the various other Fate series (the original series,  Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA series that hinted at alternative worlds, Fate/Prototype and the recently announced Fate/Apocrypha) together with Fate/Grand Order: First Order being the glue to all this, heck it makes sense due to Mash and Ritsuka\'s time traveled to the aftermath alternative vers. of Fuyuki in Fate Zero!With all this Fate/Grand Order: First Order, with it\'s final scenes showing the upcoming  Fate/EXTRA: Last Encore. Fate/Grand Order: First Order isn\'t horrible per say, it has flaws in it\'s plot from it\'s predictability, expositional introductory (which is somewhat justified to get us into what is going on) to anti-climax fights and revealing us the obvious major antagonist, but this kinda balances it out with it\'s actually interesting characters and circumstances Fate/Grand Order: First Order setting of Masters going back in time to destroy abnormalities in time (see LA\'s preamble about it being a Bizarro Fate Zero meets Steins;Gate makes sense now doesn\'t it?) balances it out. Really if your gonna watch Fate/EXTRA: Last Encore, this might be the first teaser as to what\'s to come in that installment of the multi-work multimedia of the Fate franchise. But it\'s ""prologue"" to all this, it\'s only the beginning, yes potential even in this work could have better worked out, but ""wanting more when more is arriving in the form of other installments"" including more episodes of Fate/Grand Order, it\'s only the beginning... even with a shield, however she is somewhat overshadowed by the bizarro Servants , Olga Marie is Rin Tohsaka without her tsundere wiles, but just a more confident vers. of her.

The entire movie can be summarized within 2 sentences (or even less).

And for that reason only.', ""Well, here comes my first review.The guidelines ask to be objective (lol), so I guess I'll try to develop the arguments on my subjective experience to make it appear as something objective.TLDR : I don't recommend the movie, I think it's a waste of time.Okay, being a fan of the Fate franchise, I was hoping that this introduction to FGO would be at least enjoyable and would convince me to invest some time into this new franchise.I pretty much expected it just to be a glorified ad, and oh boy! What an awful ad it was.Story:...Well... Basically it's not great.Like... at all.You know what, I'll say it : It's bad.The story is clearly not focused as much on its setting as it is on simply driving the story to its next fight. No it's worse than that: the setting has never been about anything but giving us mindless servant fights, though I guess I should have expected this from a soulless mobile game. And what a waste of an interesting premise.It's like they forgot that Fate is not just about the fights themselves. Fate's biggest strengh is its buildup for the fights, where you get this rising tension until the servants clash. I'll admit that not every fight gets that much buildup in the franchise but they are great for most of them because they are tense.This movie throws all that expertise out the window and keeps feeding us with fights without proper buildup. And honestly it feels like this for pretty much for all the story. The story feels dull because of it.I was also surprised by the lack of exposition on the servant rules, meaning that they expect Fate fans as a public, which makes me wonder how they could look at this poor excuse of a story and think that people who enjoyed the rest of the Fate franchise could find this to be any good.Characters:Concerning the new cast, it's dull and uninteresting for the most part. The MC is your generic good guy, Olga-Marie is your mandatory tsundere, Mash is the cliché love interest kuudere, Lev's future role is spoiled by his lavish costume and Dr Roman is... just a lazy guy. Thats's pretty much all the characterization you'll get for them.As for the old cast, I think it would be cheating to take them into consideration while evaluating this category, since they seem to be here only for pure fan-service.Art:Overall, I find this part pretty poor. The character design and overall aritistic style was rather dullBut my main issue is that found the animation to be rather lackluster, especially during fights. The character animations themselves are not that bad, but I feel that the bad choregraphy completely ruins most of the fights. I guess this was to be expected since each servant only has 2 different ways to strike (dull strike and special attack :O) at most, and that the majority of the fights implicated good ol' Shielder Mash, where her ennemies just spend their time hitting her shield (a brilliant tactic I might add). I can understand that her fighting style was deliberatly designed to be passive, but I don't think it's a valid excuse (if anything, its bad chara design)Honestly, I expected something better coming from the Fate franchise, especially when you consider that this is a movie rather than a running TV series.Sound:Honestly, I have nothing to say there, positive or negative. It was overall forgetable.Enjoyment:Honestly, the only part that I found enjoying was the fan-service aspect, being a Fate fanboy and all. And having this as its only redeeming quality is a major flaw in itself. That's what you get for reminding me that I'm anime trashConclusion:This movie was dull and boring to a point that I decided to go out of my way to describe how big of pile of shit I thought it was.This is a Fate movie about appealing to the lowest common denominator and nothing else. And I makes me wonder where the franchise is going to go moving forward.(Well being the weeb I am, I'll probably check it out anyway because I seem to have masochistic tendencies when it comes to my favorite franchises)And remember, because I pretty much spent my entire time shitting on this show doesn't mean you are forbidden from enjoying it.

At once just as a peiece of media on its own it fails, but even more so as an adaptation.This is supoposed to be an adapatation of the tutorial level of the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. Just storywise, it does an ok job of retelling the story going on in that part, they kept most of the important things in there, so I will commend them for that. My main gripe is how the characters were handled, more specifically, Mash.Mash Kyrielight is one of my favourite characters of the game,...but if you were to judge her character based on this movie, you'd think she was just a bland piece of borderline mute wood, whereas in the game, she does a lot of talking, she has a lot personality. She'll even crack jokes, and just overall be a lot of fun, and ofc she can get serious when the situation calls for it.I think what happened here is that in order to try and give the main character a little bit of personality, they sacrificed all of Mash's, which I just feel was a really poor choice. Now ofc. I can't confirm that is what happened, but that's just my own little theory, and I think it makes a lot of sense.Honestly, if you want this story, just play the tutorial of the Mobile game. It's much better told, the characters are overall handled better, the animation quality in the movie doesn't justify watching it like that. Hell, you can probably find someone on YouTube who made a video compiling the story if you don't feel like playing the game. but if you were to judge her character based on this movie, you'd think she was just a bland piece of borderline mute wood, whereas in the game, she does a lot of talking, she has a lot personality. She'll even crack jokes, and just overall be a lot of fun, and ofc she can get serious when the situation calls for it.I think what happened here is that in order to try and give the main character a little bit of personality, they sacrificed all of Mash's, which I just feel was a really poor choice. Now ofc. I can't confirm that is what happened, but that's just my own little theory, and I think it makes a lot of sense.Honestly, if you want this story, just play the tutorial of the Mobile game.

Although the sequence of events in Grand Order are separate from the plots of the other Fate series, this adaptation assumes that you have either played the Grand Order mobile game or that you have been experienced to other Fate related content. It is helpful to understand the concepts of masters, servants, the holy grail, and a few other things before starting this movie.Fate and its characters could continue to be re-used and re-hashed many times over and I would probably not get tired of it. My love for Fate and the servants, however, must be separated from the components that go into making a successful anime: artwork, sound, the story, character development, and enjoyment. When we isolate and analyze these components, even the reputable Fate title must be subject to scrutiny.The art was nothing too special. Some of the fighting sequences were nice, but overall, the animation quality was subpar and it felt like a lot of the effects were re-used. For example, Caster's explosion effects and the sudden wide angle zoom out were used too often in succession. It would be nice to shake things up here and there. While we cannot expect every animation to match the quality of ufotable's Fate renditions, the quality of Grand Order is probably competing with Studio Deen's Fate/Stay Night release from 2006.The sound was alright. Nothing really stood out though and the soundtrack did not really heighten the experience or coordinate the audio with visuals in a skillful manner.Where the art and sound lacked, the character and story start to pick up. It is here where the potential for the rest of this adaptation lies. Although Ritsuka is the common timid main character who makes Shirou (from F/UBW) look way more confident in comparison, the dynamic between himself and Mash has the potential to develop into something really good. If future episodes can individually develop each character and strengthen their bond to each other, the series stands to improve on the whole.The story, as already stated, is a separate plot from Fate/Stay Night, Unlimited Bladeworks, Heaven's Feel, and Zero. It requires some prior understanding of the Nasuverse, or, some of the terminology and constructs that set the backstory for the other Fate stories. Without that understanding, I fear that this OVA would suffer greatly for the first time Fate-viewer. With an understanding of masters/servants and the holy grail, the story of First Order is fair. The pacing starts off slow and then suddenly jumps to full throttle. Be sure to pay attention, because by the time you get to the end it will have set the stage for future OVAs in the series (which is where the potential rests). Essentially, First Order was one long introduction.Though I was critical of the art and sound and am skeptical about the story and character development, I recognize the potential for something good to come out of this series if all the right pieces are are put in the right place. I enjoyed seeing some old characters from other Fate series and getting introduced to some new ones. The fighting scenes, while sometimes repetitive, were still relatively enjoyable.Overall, First Order was fair but has the potential to be great if it can capitalize on the story and character development it set the stage for.

Or that is pretty much what it is.First of all, since the anime is nothing but advertisement and a celebration/mourning of the death of doctor Roman, I will be talking spoilers for the game. If you are just going to watch the OVA, I gave it a 5, it is average,...some nice fight scenes (Okay, ONE good fight scene), overall, none nasuverse fans aren\'t going to understand anything. And regular watchers can stop now, as for all you other curious people who don\'t understand anything about what is happening and want to know, full spoiler train ahead.---------------SPOILER, ROMAN DIES, SPOILER-------------------------------------Fate Grand Order, is the combination of all fate series so far, apocrypha, extra, zero, sn, etc. it is the fate franchise version of the infinity crisis and the largest, LARGEST work yet, both in scope and storyline. Unfortunately some of the early writing was handled by Sakurai (WHO WE DON\'T SPEAK ABOUT!), so it leaves a bit to be desired, but most of the story is actually fine and far more grounded than zero and FSN (no more muh ideals)The story is, the Nasu parallel multiverse is ending, because ""someone"" or ""something"" destroyed the linchpins of human history (also called quantum time locks) and incinerated all of human history. The only organization left is Chaldea which is left drifting in a fractured uncertainty of history, the last of mankind, with around 20 people left. But have no fear, as Chaldea is a super organization established by Marisbilly Animusphere, the only human magus in the history of nasuverse who won the grail war of his timeline and actually made a wish that isn\'t stupid. (infinite money to build his super organization, my god, someone stop this man before common sense overflows nasuverse!)So with the infinite money he got, he bought magic and technology from all the different magus and science organizations around the world, salvaged the fuyuki summoning system into the FATE summoning system, inducted talented people of all fields together all with the intention of ensuring mankind future. Such amazing common sense and action, SEE, this is how you become the ally of justice Kiritsugu.So basically Chaldea is the fate version of the avengers, the storyline follows Chaldea\'s journey travelling into singularities in the past to fix history as they face off against unprecedented threats in the Nasuverse, along the way, many heroic spirits would be met and long story arcs with each servant would follow.Regular viewer: But wait why don\'t they just use time travel to make sure the bomb doesn\'t go off? (I am so much smarter than the author)Don\'t worry self inflated viewer, cause that doesn\'t work, I said messed up history remember? In the nasuverse you can\'t actually change the past, cause if you do it you just end up destroying the timeline and you all die anyway, which is what happened here, someone forcefully changed the past resulting in the destruction of the timeline and Chaldea is there to remove the source of the problem. So you can\'t actually change the past, so any time you feel like ""time travel would easily solve it"", you are adding to the problem.Overall, FGO is perhaps the most grounded storyline yet, why do Chaldea save the world, unless you want to cope inside the facility and play ping pong with Da Vinci for the rest of your life drifting in a sea of quantum uncertainty, you have to save the world. The characters have growth, steady growth from living and talking with people, no empty philosophy debate like in zero (king\'s banquet). Overall, it is fate living up to what its truly is at its root, it is a shounen, a slightly dark and occasionally pretentious one, but a shounen none the less. Most of all fun (Okay, not the Gacha, that thing is cancer).Overall, if this anime grabbed your interest, take a look at the game (Skip Sakurai\'s part) and the story, it is a good entry into the fate franchises and better than zero and SN in some parts. some nice fight scenes (Okay, ONE good fight scene), overall, none nasuverse fans aren\'t going to understand anything.

None of them were particularly complicated but they all had something about them that made their journey fun to watch and they had great chemistry among each other.Now the big problem with FGO is that it only has half of what made FSN good. We have plenty of characters from history and mythology, but no cast that one...can really get attached to. The protagonist is bland as can be, which only makes sense, considering this movie is adapted from a mobile game, but neither of the side-characters are charismatic enough to make up for it. The entire cast lacks personality and so there\'s no reason for anything that is going on in the story. I wouldn\'t even say that there\'s a ""story"" per se, but rather a plot, meaning a sequence of events.All of this leaves me wondering why Type Moon felt the need to adapt the prologue of a mobile game into a movie.

Unfortunately, this spinoff turned out to be garbage.There is no really interesting story to Grand Order. It really tries to align with the original Fate storyline, but it does a miserable job at doing so. For example, what happened to Emiya? And why is the original Lancer now a Caster? No explanation at all.If the story wasn’t bad enough, the movie is just poorly conducted and executed. The action scenes of OK, but the music, characters, flow of the entire thing,...and general animation are poor. Most of it is just too tacky.This was probably one of my worst reviews, but I honestly don’t feel like putting in any effort after I already wasted an hour and half watching that garbage. and general animation are poor.

Overall, I feel that Lay-Luce's work trails Silver Link's work in the Fate/Kaleid spin-off series.◧ Concept: an interesting take on a somewhat familiar scenario - humanity's future appears to be on very shaky grounds, thus...time-traveling may be the only way to put it back on track. This idea is combined with the Fate franchise's signature concept, which is the competition of powerful magicians who are able to summon, and bind unto themselves, some of recorded history's most celebrated warriors.◧ Plot (structural critique): fairly linear in progression, beginning with an introduction to our protagonists, which is followed by an introduction to the state of this fictional world, and finally, the protagonists' unplanned, yet very consequential, engagement with it. Towards the end of the movie, an antagonist seems to appear but without further clarification as to whether or not he is the primary one.◧ Soundtrack: throughout the film, whether we're referring to dramatic or action sequences, mostly orchestral pieces of music are played of various tempos and intensity depending on the circumstances.

Unfortunately, and even though its sequences appear sharper than its predecessor, Lay-Luce is not able to replicate Ufotable's visually astonishing results.◧ Character development: there's not much to speak of.

Not all that much can happen in 74 minutes anyway that's like 3 episodes.Is it worth watching? The fight scenes are pretty good (not as good as those in FZ and FSNUBW but better than those in FSN). The soundtrack's great. Anime soundtracks are usually great especially those for battle-themed anime like Fate/Grand Order: First Order. This anime does best, perhaps, in its title. Other than that, it has little redeeming value and is barely entertaining. Took me 2 sittings to watch.Not recommended if you've seen the three series mentioned...above.

However, most did not know of or mention the game that is supposed to accompany it.Fate Grand Order is a gatcha mobile game released in 2015, in which you summon servants and play with a turn-based battle system. The gameplay works alongside a visual novel-type story, as with games like Love Live! and Fire Emblem Heroes. ***This special is subtitled...""First Order"" because it is a straight, pure adaptation of the entire first block of story in the game.***I believe this entry takes place in the present day, but 2004 Singularity F specifically is during the aftermath of Fate Zero\'s Fourth Holy Grail War (please correct me if I\'m wrong), before the events of Fate Stay Night.All this being said, it serves as a great visual novel adaptation, taking care to keep certain backgrounds and original scores the same or similar as in the game. They brought back major voice actors from both the game and previous series like Fate Stay Night, and a studio other than Ufo Table easily maintained the quality of the combat scenes that the Fate series is known for, though not as high-quality in animation as Unlimited Budget Works.I won\'t speak much about the main character, as he is meant to be the player\'s avatar in the game and very much a blank slate. Mash (I headcanon that her name is supposed to be written as ""Matthew"") got a good amount of character development that I didn\'t see as much during the visual novel. The plot is also completely in line with the game\'s, which I consider very encouraging for the amount of time they had to tell it in.As a standalone entry, it probably wasn\'t too impressive. As an adaptation, I quite enjoyed it. Give it a try if you\'re interested in the mobile game, or if you just want to experience FGO on-screen with fully voiced, animated fight scenes!

This is my second romp into Fate and I really want to get into this series. Started Fate Zero and dropped it after 6 episodes. That wasn't because it was bad, that's because I'm a Japanese learner and it was my first Anime with no English subtitles. I simply couldn't keep up (but I will go back to it one of these days). This was lame. Don't expect much from this movie or whatever it is. I kinda just dinked around on my phone while it played in the background and thought that I could have used my time better. But...hey, I was able to turn subs off and understand what was going on, so that means I'm probably able to get back into Fate Zero! hey, I was able to turn subs off and understand what was going on, so that means I'm probably able to get back into Fate Zero!"", ""FGO First Order is a skippable part of the FGO anime only perspective.  I watched this after watching FGO Babylonia, and although I didn't mind watching this special, it added very little to the story that I missed by watching FGO out of order.  Since this only covers 1 singularity, there is no reason to force yourself to watch this.  To my knowledge, many of the singularities are game only parts of the franchise, making this special irrelevant.  The overall quality of this special is pretty mid for Fate.  That being said, it's not unwatchable, it's fast paced making it...easy to watch.Animation 7/10-  Rather simple, not terrible though, but definitely on the lower end of Fate quality.Sound 6/10-  The typical awesome SE are not really present here, just below the norm compared to most Fate I've seen.Story 5/10-  They cover the arrival of Fujimaru Ritsuka, and how Mash became his servant, and go to a singularity.

The servants we meet are pretty dry imo.Enjoyment 7/10-  Even with all its flaws, I didn't really hate it, it's just not up to par all around compared to other Fate stuff.I don't think anyone needs to watch this.

The art is terrible, the story is terrible, the characters make no sense, and I love it.  This is the best parody of those generic school yaoi/BL dramas that could ever be conceived.  Everyone looks like they were drawn by a not-artistically-gifted 6th grader that just got into anime.  The main character has no eyes and his 7 year old sister remembers playing with one of the MCs friends from 7 years ago.  They blow up like 3 buildings.  A guy dies and comes back to life.  In...the ending song the characters distort into oblivion in time to the music.  I felt like I was suffering some kind of trauma-induced shock while watching it.TLDR: Gakuen Handsome needs to be put in the art museum where it belongs. the ending song the characters distort into oblivion in time to the music.

Boiled down, it’s a parody anime about commonly used BL tropes. Imagine if someone in the anime industry decided to create an official abridged series, and then proceeded to air it on TV in hopes that someone out there would get the joke. Basically, you’ll be playing a game of ‘spot the trope’ with every episode. If all that sounds fun to you, this might just be worth checking out.Story:The school of Baramon High is where all attractive boys are collected and gender is irrelevant, all seemingly shepherded by their principal Jirou Natsume. Your literal no-faced self insert moved in not too long ago to unexpectedly find himself on a quest for a romantic partner, and is put through one scenario after another to showcase their rather generic quirks. This story is less about a plot, and more about how many tropes can fit into a five minute episode without spitting it in your face too hard. Here’s just a few you’ll encounter in the first few episodes: A ‘cast full of pretty boys’, ‘if it’s you, it’s okay’, ‘chins that can split the moon’, ‘long-haired pretty boy’ and ‘only has same sex admirers’. That’s just the ones I can remember off the top of my head, so keep hunting!Art:The art, while clearly an intentional move, is hideous. Simply slowly jiggling your characters while having a mouth flap move feels and looks like it’s a tutorial for learning how to change frames in Flash. Furthermore, these simplistic loops are used throughout with short breaks involving scenes that look like scribbles, focused upon for far too long in what is a five minute show. The saving grace of this is that this IS actually how it’s meant to be shown; most jokes stemming from this child-like style, resulting in the score of 3 above. If you don’t believe me, then feel free to look up the tween animation used in the ED that also looks like it was made by a seven year old messing around with features on Scratch. The OP isn’t much better with quick still frames and a running loop that’s used throughout the whole show so far. The saving grace of artistic talent is the end-of-show stills, but even they can’t save what is eternally and intrinsically broken.Sound:The music isn’t the worst, but don’t be holding your breath. The OP is the generic visual novel song with little to no creativity being closely followed by an ED that’s both out of place and hellish spawn in need of purging. The sound design of the actual show is surprisingly decent with atmospheric sounds and some character's themes not sounding quite as bad as you would (or should) expect. Chalk it up to trying to keep matching the clear satire this show is going for, I guess.Characters:Expect exactly what it says on the tin: Stereotypes and under-developed jokes of a cast. Our MC is Maeda, a character without much personality aside from being consistently confused at any man's advances. He's essentially designed for you to slip into his shoes with as little friction as possible. This is closely followed by one-dimensional, cliché bishounens who are all the boys we’ve seen so far, along with a headmaster to encourage his scandalous love life, as mentioned above.-- I don’t have enough details to fully flesh out this section yet. --Enjoyment:The situations thus far have been parodies of the generic scenarios shown in BL visuals with the intensity turned up to 11. They hit hard when you know the background behind them, but I fear it'll run dry fast. Anyway, while not having a wide range of jokes to fall back on as far, they’re usually held up their job of being funny. The merry band of hot men willing to die for the MC will hopefully hold up the ridiculousness of the non-existent plot long enough to keep this entertainment for a 12 episode season along with the up-and-coming OVA.

There are episodes about a man who can fly using the rotation powers of his spatulas, invitations to go romantically peeing together, fashionable wearing of sumo wrestler underwear (fundoshi), death by cat cafe and many other ridiculous things. Not much else to say but that each episode will leave you thinking both, ""wtf did i just watch"" and ""i need more"".~ Art (10) ~To me, aspects of an anime like art, music,...plot, etc. should be scored based on if they help the anime or not. That doesn\'t necessarily mean it has to be good quality. That\'s why, once again, I will say I\'m not joking or exaggerating when I give this a 10. The art is what makes the show for me. It\'s on the level of shitty drawings by a 10 year-old on Deviant Art. I\'m no artist but I\'m sure I could do better. But that\'s not what I care about. The art makes me laugh so hard, I cry. Every. Damn. Episode. I will never forget the iconic first forty seconds of the show when the main character walks into the classroom and his teacher turn around with a chin so long, it easily hangs to his nipples. I laughed for a good ten minutes, something anime has never done to me. Sure I\'ve had my fair share of comedy in plenty of anime, but this one really takes the cake.~ Sound (9) ~The first time I saw the OP, I thought I was watching something pretty weird but then I saw the ED and the OP seemed pretty tame after that. This category kinda speaks for itself. If you google the ED for this, you\'ll see what I mean (or you could just watching the show lol).  A hilarious ending to a hilarious show. They couldn\'t have picked a more perfect ED.~ Character (9) ~This is where the whole ""parody"" thing is most prominent, in my opinion. They have the uptight class president, the delinquent and team captain, the childhood friend and the serious guy with a soft spot. A lot of the characters represented tropes you\'d see in other shounen ai. It\'s healthy to watch a good parody once in a while and this one is perfect. I know this fits more into the ""art"" section, but the character designs were also pretty clever. They chose the most common cliche designs for male characters.~ Enjoyment (10) ~This is easily the funniest anime I\'ve ever seen. The enjoyment category is what really matters when you are watching a comedy and I give this one a 10. It keeps you entertained and just when it can\'t get any weirder, it finds a way in the most hilarious way possible.~ Overall (9) ~This anime tried something brave and unique I\'ve never seen in comedy/parody anime. I applaud the creators for that. The three and a half minute episodes were appropriate for a show that would certainly get tired out otherwise. They did not stick with the orthodox way of presenting humor and thought outside of the box. You could tell that they were having a lot of fun with this one and it made it feel more genuine and refreshing.*IMPORTANT: If you didn\'t already know or didn\'t read before, this is a PARODY and is not to be taken SERIOUSLY.

There are some shows that are liked by everyone, and if you dislike them people will unpolitely write you letters about your point of view (aka they will tell you to kill yourself), but I can honestly say that if you don\'t...enjoy this type of show, I assume you hate fun, allow me to explain:Art in general, specially video-centric mediums, is about your experience with the piece, how you feel about it. The charm of this show relies exclusively on that impact it has on you, which of course would be laughing at basically everything this show has to offer. The people that don\'t like this, and other shows that follow this trend, are the ones that say that current anime sucks and the best year was 1998 (although that year had like 3 or 4 good shows), that anime was a mistake and that the industry is dying. My response to that something doesn\'t have to be good in order to be entertaining, while it may sound kind of obvious, unfortunately there are people that can\'t wrap their heads around this idea.Needless to say, I think this show is hilarious, and shows how the simplest of things can be amusing...Either that or they wanted to be the anime community\'s meme of the year, in that case this whole thing is pointless.If you\'re watching this, I recommend doing it with some friends on a Friday night, with pizza and beer. enjoy this type of show, I assume you hate fun, allow me to explain:Art in general, specially video-centric mediums, is about your experience with the piece, how you feel about it.

Gakuen Handsome, or, Gakuen Handsome as the gringos say, is the sophomore effort of Team YokkyuFuman.I imagine Team YokkyuFuman\'s frame of mind when conjuring up the idea for this was one of both pragmatism and...a cheeky disregard for creativity. Gakuen Handsome is one of the most creatively bankrupt series I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I am utterly convinced that Team YokkyuFuman wrote this as a cheeky retaliation/statement against the higher-ups and...no amount of rationalizing or fanboying can change that perception for me. Gakuen Handsome is terrible, it\'s like the Yaoi equivalent of The Room except it gets away with convincing people that it\'s good. The only thing Gakuen Handsome is good at is highlighting how by-the-numbers this style of series can get.Briefly touching on the technicals of this series, the voice acting is god awful. Maeda\'s voice actor has one setting and one setting only, although that has been covered ad nauseam. He makes Junko Takeuchi\'s work as Naruto seem warm and inviting like Morgan Freeman. It is probably the only time watching a series that it actually elicited a physical reaction from me. Although, as a small caveat, if you attempt to watch this series from the perspective of someone knowing what they are signing up for, the subbed version adds an extra layer of grease to this disgustingly satisfying sandwich. I.e. if you want the genuine Gakuen Handsome experience, the voice acting is like icing on that cake.The animation is in a middling ground of both extremes. It can be bad when it wants to and it can also skimp on its budget when it needs to. I have conflicting feelings on the animation though. Had the material been in more capable hands like Bones or Madhouse, I feel that it could\'ve been leaning more towards ""beautiful spectacle"" territory as opposed to ""beautifully terrible"". So despite my compliments to the mediocre animation mostly serves to its benefit.Now that the technicals are out of the way, I feel I shouldn\'t even have to harp all that much on the story and characters. If you\'ve watched Junjou Romantica, if you\'ve watched Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, if you have even a basic knowledge of writing propensities when it comes to yaoi and comedy, you\'ve already gotten a taste of Gakuen Handsome. The story is bereft of shallow gimmicks and instead opts to stuff itself full of cliches and archetypes. The overarching storyline and subplots all have parallels to other works and the characters all have doppelgangers floating around in some other manga.So why the 10? Honestly, I\'m not even really sure myself. They say that there are certain series that require you to take a step back or a dumbed-down open mind to enjoy. I don\'t even really feel either of those things are required to watch and enjoy Gakuen Handsome. I\'ve seen what it looks like when it earnestly feels like Team YokkyuFuman is trying, and they have a lot of genuinely good qualities to the way they draw and write this anime. In fact, I have no doubt that this series has the potential to grow into something greater than the sum of its parts considering that it hasn\'t been given the axe at this stage. Gakuen Handsome was not a labor of love or a passion project, that is apparent to me. From my perspective, Gakuen Handsome is a frustrated and rebellious statement on the current status of yaoi and the politics that goes into publication. Because honestly, it takes a real genius to write something this stupid. Or perhaps I\'m just reading too much into it?Whatever the case may be, Gakuen Handsome is my ultimate guilty pleasure and I wave that 10 with pride. no amount of rationalizing or fanboying can change that perception for me.

It just took a bit of prodding from my cousin to remember that this anime is a piece of work that actually had money put into it to be created and also licensed to be shown on Crunchyroll.[Sound]I was pretty surprised that there were actually a few voice actors that I had known from previous works who played some of the characters in this show. It was fun hearing them have fun and also see that they weren\'t taking this seriously either. Although the art was kinda iffy for me, the sound quality made me laugh more than I expected to.[Enjoyment]Despite the fact that I called this a ""piece of trash"" throughout the whole time that I was watching this, I can\'t deny that I did have a lot of fun with this series. I won\'t call this a masterpiece that needs to be on everyone\'s watch list, but I will say that it won\'t hurt to check out if you have a bit of time on your hands. is supposed to be a huge jab at yaoi art styles, but it still bothered me a bit.

Like I mentioned earlier, this is my first time doing a review, so I will try to keep this spoiler-free.-Story: 2/10Your typical over-the-top cliche romance anime. No, this is not just over-the-top. This is over-the-top, the advanced version. MC-kun transferred to this prestigious school, meets different ""handsome"" guy that likes him for no freaking reason and their daily life in school. Nothing special.-Art/Animation: 2/10The...art can be described in one word. Crap. What about the animation? It is bullshit. The supposedly ""handsome"" guys have pointy chins and our MC-kun have a face that perfectly correspond with his personality. Bland. Bland as in not memorable and he doesn\'t have eyes. Why did I give this a \'2\' then if it\'s really bad? The MC-kun\'s sister is cute (the only character that have decent design) and there is this episode where our ""handsome"" guys transform into freaking bishies. There you go.-Sound: 6/10The opening and the ending theme...they are catchy, but VERY annoying.The voice actor did do a good job though.-Character: 2/10No character development. We have bland, generic MC-kun and his harem - your typical transferred student, delinquent, rich student council president, long time best friend/childhood friend, and the teacher. Not to forget, the sister and the meddling principal.-Overall: 8/10The story is bad, the art is crap, the sound is eh, the characters are bland, but this makes Gakuen Handsome enjoyable. Gakuen Handsome is meant to be a parody and all the flaws are meant to be like that. This anime is a total cringe-fest, yet it is humorous at how over-the-top each episode is.

Or at least I think its a parody. The show\'s animation style, which consists mainly of in-proportionate bodies with chiselled jaws sharper than that Dorito chip that cuts the inside of your mouth and sexy, super mesmerizing eyes, definitely makes it hard to not look at the screen. The plot follows a group of impossibly handsome (and sexy) high school boys as they navigate their way through daily life, often engaging in over-the-top shenanigans. While the show\'s humour may not be for people who have the humour of a hyena watching a slug slime away...from an ant on a Friday afternoon, in other words, people with no humour--those who appreciate it\'s absurdity and satire (again I think so) will surely find themselves laughing their souls out at the sheer ridiculousness on display.

Go! Princess Precure Movie: Go! Go!! Gouka 3-bondate!!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29868/Go_Princess_Precure_Movie__Go_Go_Gouka_3-bondate,"['Hm, it would have been much easier to give a score for if this wasn\'t - quite literally - 3 entirely separate parts. Oh well, might as well break them down.Part 1 is a 5 minute silent 3D animation. You know, the type you\'d see at the start of a Pixar movie. One that\'s clearly just meant to be an animation demonstration rather than trying to tell a story or anything. It\'s... well, it\'s certainly on par with big-budget 3D films, but there really isn\'t anything noteworthy about it.Part 2 - the main bulk of the film - is 50 minutes long, and it\'s basically...like a normal episode. ...No, it really is, up until the end (where things really started getting serious/flashy) it genuinely feels like it was just an extended normal episode, definitely not the kind of thing you\'d expect from a movie. It\'s also... not good? The animation and such were pretty standard, but the story itself felt more like an excuse to have the protagonists doing girly stuff (dancing, cat-walking, cooking) than an attempt to tell an actual story. It wasn\'t particularly interested in setting up this new setting (so it looks very generic) or telling an emotional story (so the side-characters barely do anything and the main characters feel like they\'re waiting for something interesting to happen). Oh, and the scenes themselves are pretty boring. The only actually interesting thing about it - other than the ending, which was good enough I guess - is the whole ""What has the bad guy got planned"", but even that was ordinary and uncreative. Basically, this is a long-winded way of saying that the whole Part 2 felt like a big missed opportunity.Part 3 is the actually worthwhile part though, and chances are, the only reason you\'re reading this review to begin with. It\'s a 20-minute 3D animation with a FANTASTIC style! I mean it genuinely might be the best I\'ve ever seen in a 3D film. ...Okay, so maybe personal tastes might vary on that, but at the very least, it\'s certainly unique. The stylised 3D shading/outlines allows the show to use much more \'anime-style\' shortcuts than regular 3D cartoons (which requires a lot of animation effort to look appealing) and doesn\'t have the same jarring effect that 3D-but-flat-so-it-looks-2D anime has. As in, it clearly DOESN\'T have the same effort put into the animations as big-budget films (and it clearly has points where it could have improved on), or Part 1 of it\'s own movie, yet it still looks amazing! ...Oh yeah, and as for the thing itself: unlike Part 2, this one doesn\'t have a story beyond ""We need to help this stranger beat up this bad guy"" - which is actually nice, because it means more time for sweet action scenes, which is what 3D anime absolutely excels at.I think you can see why I have trouble rating this. If it was just Part 3 alone, I would have given this a straight 9 out of 10, but Part 1 is nothing special and Part 2 felt like a big waste of time. Ho hum. like a normal episode. ...No, it really is, up until the end (where things really started getting serious/flashy) it genuinely feels like it was just an extended normal episode, definitely not the kind of thing you\'d expect from a movie.

Ho hum.', 'Perfectly fitting for the 31th of October (the day it started screening), the theme of this movie is pumpkins with a tone of... cute Halloween? As the title indicates, this movie is split into three parts, so let\'s get into each!The first is a short animation in CGI where a small version of Cure Flora plays with some ghosts who fake like if they were a reflection of her, up to what I watched of Precure so far I will say that this was the most ""fully kid oriented"" moment of the series, and... damn it was cute!The second part is the main bulk of...this movie, with the Precures suddenly being transported into Pumpkin Kingdom, a place that definitely lived up to its name. I would say that while definitely enjoyable, this part was pretty average in comparison to how great the main series is, the villain didn\'t get more detail than ""yes, he\'s bad"" and is definitely forgettable and didn\'t leave much of an impression, and the side characters weren\'t anything special either, but it delivered as usual when it comes to enjoying whatever the main cast does and in the action scenes, not to mention that some of the pumpkin fairies were pretty funny.Lastly, there is a part where the girls (once again) get transported to another place, but this time becoming CGI in the process, I will say that how this looks is pretty hit or miss depending on the viewer, but I personally got used to it from watching the 2nd ending of the series over and over of how good it is (and it\'s in this movie too!) so it ended up looking pretty nice. This part was funny (goofy Zetsuborgs being the MVPs) and the action with CGI animation looked pretty nice, the story was alright and tried to be a bit emotional which didn\'t work due to its short duration not giving time to feel attached to the situation.Overall I would say that this was an enjoyable movie but definitely nothing special when it comes to the story or the characters featured in them. If you like Cure Flora as much as I do I can\'t recommend it enough because she gets a lot of spotlight, if you liked the TV series of Princess Precure it\'s well worth a try, and if not or you only feel interest on it if it has a good story... definitely skippable honestly. this movie, with the Precures suddenly being transported into Pumpkin Kingdom, a place that definitely lived up to its name.

I can’t rate it any higher since it didn’t have that much to do with Flora or this season specifically, and could really be have been done with any children’s anime character, but it was still sweet.Story 2 (5/10) - Although taking up the majority of the screen time, this was definitely the weakest of the three, dragging down my overall...rating quite significantly. The villain was quite plain, none of the the Pumpkin royal family members really stood out beyond being plot devices, and the “Princess Competition” (which is a reused plot point from the main series) really felt shoehorned in, casuing most of the cures to act wildly out of character (do you really expect me to believe Scarlet noticed something was off but not the highly perceptive Mermaid, seriously?).Story 3 (7.5/10) - This is how I believe the entire movie should have been. If we had gotten more development on this particular plot line and its new characters, I feel as though I would have enjoyed the experience more overall. The animation was bold but not in a bad way, managing to add its own unique flare without making the characters unrecognisable like I’ve seen from some other 3D models.————Overall, this movie was a rather disappointing 6/10 in my opinion, an entire point lower than the series from which it originated. While it was good of them to try, I don’t think this multi-movie thing really works for Precure, especially since they also have to find a way to incorporate the already somewhat contrived Miracle Lights into a much shorter time span. The whole premise isn’t “bad” per se, but if you do want to check it out, I suggest watching Story 1 and Story 3 without wasting 50 minutes on what is essentially a filler GoPri episode but worse. rating quite significantly.

This is the worst of it. There's more coherency in a drunk dad solo song at a wedding than in this. You'll never know where you're at in the story until the last 3 eps and other than that it offers nothing new or exciting.Art-Good, not butt ugly, it's passable and the CG blades look nice. The problem is consistency. Last season the...characters looked 14 to 15. They look like 11 year olds here. There's just a lack of follow-through that hurts what could be a fun art style.Sound-Suffers from generic songs. The Japanese version has increasingly generic music that bores that they can put on for you to ignore while you watch a terrible show. Don't ask about the dub, it suffers from the Rap in anime plague.Characters-Let me get something straight. Beyblade has one of the better main character sets in anime; their main 5-6 I absolutely adore; however, I dock 4 points for this season specific characters. All the season 2 only characters here are badly designed, generic, annoying, and there's more of them than periods in War and Peace. Good luck keeping up with them.Enjoyment-Only if you're a sadist can you enjoy this. It's generic, you can't follow it, and you shouldn't try.Overall-I'm not giving it a 1 just because of the main characters, the fact that the art isn't in itself terrible and the sound isn't terrible.

If it didn't have the mains, this would be unwatchable."", ""The story was very good. It was exciting and attention grabbing. The concept was amazing. Being able to control ancient beasts using modern technology.In the first season, the art was very...rough and not good. The characters were ugly, to be frank.But as the second season and third season arrived, the art improved and the charcters became more good looking and clear.The sounds were very good. They were catchy and upbeat. There were mostly of rock genre.The character profiles were okay...Some characters were not clear and due to that were ignored.This is the show to watch if you're bored. Basically for those who have never seen...anime before. After watching this, you would want to watch more and different anime. It piques your interest. anime before. After watching this, you would want to watch more and different anime. It piques your interest."", ""The first season was quite enjoyable. After season 1 ended I was quite satisfied with an anime ending for once; no more was needed.At first, I was excited about a new season. For a few weeks I anxiously waited for a new season, hell I even got up early enough to check if I didn't miss the first episode. So in excitement, I waited.Finally, getting up early was worth it. The first episode aired sometime in July 2003-04 ish, correct me if I'm wrong. After watching the first episode I went all &quot;Well, it can't be THIS bad throughout the entire season, could it?&quot;...The answer is yes it can. My very first impression watching it was &quot;I thought people grew UP, not DOWN!&quot; In the first season, the BladeBreakers looked mature (and thank god they regained some of that maturity in GRev) but then they went all Chibi.With hopes of the show improving and having its classic feeling again, I watched the season all the way through. It's hardly memorable and easily forgotten because it's so horrible. All I do remember is for once getting annoyed with Tyson and friends.Story:I've read better fanfiction. Seriously, watching the paint dry is much more interesting then the story itself.Art:I actually like the old school style of Beyblade. Why the hell did they choose to make it chibi? In the first season, the character's faces actually varied. But when this new style came in, they all had the same freakin' face. The only designed I like was Dr. K's (was that her name? I forget) because she at least looked mature.Sound:Not bad, but mediocre.Character:My biggest pet peeve of this season was the characters. Tyson/Takao becomes a bigger brat then he was (and he isn't funny while doing it like he was in the first season) and it was hard to take him seriously. Kai is emoer then usual (does he have to angst at every chance he's got? Seriously.) and he became extremely annoying. Ray came off as a ditz most of the time. Max was just plain out annoying. You think that's bad?! There's more!So it seems that the animation studio decided to add in a cheerleader for the Bladebreakers because Yugi had a cheerleader (AKA Anzu Misaki). Yes, I am talking about Hilary/Hiromi. If I were to ask the BladeBreakers anything, it would be &quot;How did you put up with that bitch?&quot;. Honestly, just how did they put up with her?I was seriously hoping that Hilary was only going to be there breifly, but no, they had to make her a major character. She's basically only there to be the bitchy cheerleader who seems to enjoy hitting Tyson at every chance she gets. That's seriously all she does. She's more annoying then comic releif if you ask me.What was her purpose anyway other then cheerleader role? At least Anzu had a purpose in YuGiOh.Enjoyment:One word: Pathetic. This season is the shadow of its former glory. Compared to GRev and the first season, this one sticks out like a sore thumb.Overall:I personally did not like this season at all. Maybe someone who has not seen the original first season might enjoy it, but any fan of the first season is gonna hate it. The answer is yes it can.

Black Jack: Sora kara Kita Kodomo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6246/Black_Jack__Sora_kara_Kita_Kodomo,"[""I love watching any episode released for Black Jack. It gives me GTO vibes. I like this episode because it shows great resolve for their child. The fact a mother was willing to attach herself to her son was very wholesome. I thought it would look disgusting or some creepy alien but I was wrong. That scene was very beautiful. And the struggle of that kid's father to save his some by any means. It's the first time I've seen someone actually shooting closely at Dr Black Jack for his son to be cured. He punched the walls many times which caused bleeding. I could...share that pain somehow. The hopelessness to sacrifice and to top it off they defected from a country and dad had to also sacrifice himself for his family. He's not a man. He's The Man. It's also rare to see how Black Jack was very sad cuz of his inability to cure his patient after knowing that their family sacrificed everything. I was also surprised that he lost controlled and yelled at Pinoco which rarely happened at Black Jack TV. This ep is packed with everything to give you a good ride. share that pain somehow.

This is essentially the fanservice episode of the anime, and it doesn't even do that good a job of that. The bulk of the episode revolves around the girls essentially taking pictures of each other and running around an in-door pool and just dicking around in general, which isn't that bad if you actually like these characters. I wouldn't have minded some development on the sister's relationship here, but we really didn't even get that. Watch this only for full completion of the anime.

This special revolves around the main four characters in some fanservice episode, which happens to also be a pool episode, where the pool is indoors on a snowy winter day. The episode didn't have a lot of fanservice and it more so incited talks about memories reloving around the pool for particularly Kanade and Yukino. It was nothing special but it did its bit with Sakuya funny moments if you want that on the side.The audiovisuals are the same as usual, only not used to...their full extent as the main series because of length and what have you.I'd say watch it if you were a fan of the series, but don't expect too much out of this one.

Canvas 2: Nijiiro no Sketch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/694/Canvas_2__Nijiiro_no_Sketch,"['5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Surprisingly EntertainingI didn&rsquo;t really like harem anime series, but I actually liked Canvas 2. In fact, I think I looked forward to watching it. That&rsquo;s really surprising, because normally I would avoid series that had ero-game written all over it. It was really interesting to see how Hiroki, the main character, would interact with the girls in his life, a lot of them under-aged, I might add.Like your usual harem anime, Canvas 2 had ecchi scenes complete with unnecessary shower scenes and panty shots, and I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this but I didn&rsquo;t mind it at all. As a...conservative girl, I would detest any hint of fan service thrown my way, but truth be told, it wasn&rsquo;t that repulsive. I&rsquo;m not sure if ecchi fan boys will like or hate that.Anyway, as expected, girl characters dominated the cast. I liked all of them, except Elise. I found her to be really irritating and fickle. I know Kiri isn&rsquo;t charismatic enough to be Hiroki&rsquo;s girl friend, but I really didn&rsquo;t want Elise to end up with his cousin. You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d be used to cousin relationships after all the anime I&rsquo;ve seen this year alone, but I kept hoping that Hiroki wouldn&rsquo;t pick Elise. The fact that she kept calling him &ldquo;onii-chan&rdquo; made me think that Elise saw Hiroki as her older brother more than her boyfriend.I was surprised to find Aya Hirano in the cast list. I guess her role as Sumire Misaki is one of her lesser known roles. Usually when someone says Aya Hirano, you think of Haruhi Suzumiya or Misa from Death Note. I thought that the voice she had for Misaki was closer to her real voice. Takahiro Sakurai, one of my favorite male seiyus, is also in the cast list. He did a great job of portraying Hiroki.Animation wise, it was actually pretty good. It&rsquo;s simple, and when I say that I mean there&rsquo;s nothing that special about it. The art design is pretty similar to what everybody has seen in anime so far. I do love the wide variety of colors after all. It wouldn&rsquo;t be as good if it didn&rsquo;t have a whole spectrum of colors. It is an anime about art, after all.The music, as expected, is cutesy. I realized that the opening song, &quot;Plastic Smile (Niji-iro guitar version)&quot;, was sung by Honey Bee[YURIA]. I read somewhere that her work is used in a lot of adult video games, so I guess they picked the right woman to sing the opening song. I actually liked it, it was quite catchy. The same goes for the ending song, &ldquo;NA NA IRO&quot; by Sweets Tankentai. I learned both songs right away so I can sing with it when I watch Canvas 2.I guess I watched it mostly because I wanted to see who Hiroki will end up with (and I cheered for Kiri the whole way). It was really fun to see him go back and forth between the two girls that captured his heart, and even if I have harem series before, this is the first time that I was seriously concerned on who the main guy will pick.

If you've watched Da Capo, it resembles most of it. But the way the story is presented, and the story itself, has a unique touch to it.Even though it's harem (I don't like harem animes anyway) this is entertaining to the point that I really watched 11 episodes in one sitting and I never included this anime in my Dropped list. I gave the story a 9 because I enjoyed it so...much; even though others doesn't like its ending, I personally have nothing to say about its end.Art:The art is better than other harem animes, and it's just good. It may not be the best, but the art is great.Sound:I couldn't remember other music here, but the opening and ending songs are nice because it actually gives a very simple feeling to the anime.Character:The characters have different strengths and weaknesses and it was presented in the story in a way that the main guy character is always involved in them.Enjoyment:I enjoyed it so much that I loved it!Overall:This is one harem kind of anime you might want to watch... ^_^ much; even though others doesn't like its ending, I personally have nothing to say about its end.Art:The art is better than other harem animes, and it's just good.

Why it is called Canvas 2 is probably because it\'s based on Canvas ~Motif Of Sepia~ (an OVA which I suppose was originally planned to be hentai, but they were feeling extra original and didn\'t make a hentai, instead they made the masterpiece that is known as Canvas ~Motif Of Sepia~, do not be fooled, I was being sarcastic), but it\'s not really a sequel. I guess they thought it was witty to add the 2 even though it\'s not an actual sequel....I can\'t begin to stress how original and inventive it is that they added a 2 to their title ""Canvas"". It blows my mind.It\'s called Canvas with a 2 added because it\'s somehow about painters and a highschool that takes extra care of their art club... or something. There\'s this guy in this school who\'s something like a trainee teacher and takes care of the art club. For a school who specializes in art and suchlike they sure are lax with their art teacher. Ah well. Let me get to the point though, this anime is so bad I don\'t even know where to begin. BUT! It\'s actually so bad there\'s some qualities (bad ones of course) almost worth watching this anime for.Let\'s start with the screenplay; it is an abomination, I mean, I swear to you right now and right here that I, the one sitting infront of my computer typing up this review, could have done a much better job. I\'m not even joking. The thing is, the screenplay is overall of such poor quality that I can\'t really explain why it is bad, it\'s just that what the characters say, how they say it and why they say the things they say is just plain dumb. It\'s poorly timed, it\'s poorly written and for all I care they could just aswell have talked about planting sunflowers for the entirety of the series.Let us continue with the story. If I must take the story seriously for the first time since I started watching the anime, I would say it\'s very fleeting. It\'s unevenly paced and mostly it\'s about nothing at all. Two episodes were dedicated to make an omelet with rice. Yea that\'s right, two episodes. I\'m not joking. Canvas with a 2 added tries to be cute aswell, it tries to be moe, but the thing is, it fails at this in such epic proportions that it really becomes funny. But what I can say above all else is that this entire anime feels really, really ridiculous. The script, the story and every single character are ridiculous.Foreseeable is a good word, it\'s a word that fits in with almost every single harem ever produced. Canvas with a 2 added is one of the most foreseeable animes I have ever watched though. I knew exactly how 75% of the scenes in Canvas with a 2 added had to offer were going to play out, and that is not exaggerating.Now, in harem anime there\'s always several girls liking the same boy, since Canvas with a 2 added is a harem it is the same deal here. It\'s just that, you know, you usually expect to find out why people like other people, in Canvas with a 2 added it\'s a complete mystery and I mean that\'s cool... I suppose. But then you have the male lead who is one of the most stereotypical male leads in a harem or in any genre I\'ve ever seen and you just think to yourself; why?Now, let\'s end this on a high note. No, you know aswell as I do this is not going to end on a high note, the reason being; there are no high notes in this review nor are there any high notes in Canvas with a 2 added. The art and animation in Canvas with a 2 added is horrendous, really, reallly, really horrendous. That means it\'s bad. There are many stills in this anime, usually in anime you find that stills are fairly detailed with vivacious colours because stills (a non moving picture/frame) are cheap to make and doesn\'t even require animation if you really feel like saving some money, but in Canvas with a 2 added the stills are usually a school building, that I swear to Tom Cruise I could do better with some crayons on a white piece of paper, and then some green and blue for the grass and sky. You know, stuff you expect from 6 year old kids in first grade doodling during their first ever art class. (Did you catch the intentional dis I just dished out towards Canvas with a 2 added HAHA?) You might think I\'m being too harsh or disrespecting the key animatiors and painters, but no, I seriously am not.In conclusion; my review do this anime justice, Canvas with a 2 added truly is as bad as I\'m describing it to be.

It could have been set just as easily in New York or Chicago as it was in Tokyo and told its story. Having played the Bishoujo game that it was based on about a year or so before the series started in the fall of 2005, I was rather happy to see that the series was executed very well. That does not always happen with shows made from games(Think Shuffle!). Many people dismissed this series quickly as a harem show, but there were...only two female characters that really mattered, Elis and Kiri. It was nice to see a decent regular guy as the lead in this show. Hiroki was the best male in a show like this since the likes of To Heart or Comic Party. To those who would say that it was too long at 24 episodes, I would have to disagree, I felt it was just the right length.Much has, and will be said, about how the show ended. I really liked the show's ending and enjoyed the twist. Random Curiosity, an anime blog I visit on a regular basis, had its biggest response to a single episode of anime that it has ever seen when it aired and the discussion became very heated. It's one you will have to watch for yourself to appreciate. only two female characters that really mattered, Elis and Kiri. It was nice to see a decent regular guy as the lead in this show.

It's one you will have to watch for yourself to appreciate."", 'Canvas 2 was definitely an unexpected series. Despite what the other reviews say, this show doesn\'t feel like a harem whatsoever. In fact, it\'s more of a love triangle. Take note that just because a show involves a male character hanging out and talking with a fairly big group of girls, doesn\'t mean it\'s a harem.I have literally one issue with this series. What\'s the issue, you ask? Well, I\'ll tell you; The ending. I\'m a person who values the path along the way to the ending the most, but you can\'t disagree that an ending to a series can affect your view on...the series as a whole, despite the ride along the way being unexpectedly enjoyable. I don\'t know if this spoils anything, but I\'m just going to say that the path the main character was taking for the entire series was one I really agreed with, until the last episode he decides to change his mind and turn everything around.Story: 9The story is simple and sweet. Hiroki Kamikura is an artist... well, an ex-artist, who refuses to paint anything after a certain life event. (Which you learn about later on.) He lives with his little cousin; Elis, who lost her parents in a car crash when she was little. (Afterwards, Hiroki decided to take care of her.) Due to trauma, she refuses to use the color red in her paintings, or freaks out whenever she notices the color. (Again, you\'ll learn why, and it\'s a completely understandable reason as well, considering how trauma works and how old she was when said accident happens.)There are past events and other events that are important to the story, but all you need to know is it\'s about an awesome art student/student-teacher/teacher (Yes, the main character is a teacher, not a student) who gets trapped in a love triangle between his cousin and a childhood friend who ended up becoming a teacher at the same school. (Yes, there is incest to a certain degree. If you don\'t enjoy this sort of thing... you may not like this show. It\'s really not emphasized whatsoever due to the fact that the main character doesn\'t share his cousin\'s feelings, and doesn\'t even consider her a romantic interest. It\'s there, though, and it grows near the end.)Canvas 2 is a drama and a romance. The story is, as I said, simple and sweet. I myself enjoy drama, a lot, and found that the drama in this show is fairly deep and organized well. Some events and decisions are ridiculous, but nothing too severe. (Disregarding the ending...) Think of drama in shows like Golden Time, or Toradora... it\'s similar to that. If you like this sort of drama, you\'ll probably enjoy Canvas 2. If that\'s not enough, then I\'ll explain more of my feelings for this show continuing with...Art: 7I don\'t know if this rating is considered fair or not for a reason; The anime is from 2005, and, from what I can tell, the average cheaper visual novel adaptation. When it comes to animation, that is. Shows like Myself;Yourself or H2O: Footprints in the Sand are along the lines of what I mean. Though, at times, the animation is definitely great, though most of the time the animation is just plain old ""good"". Nothing more or nothing less. Though the kids in this show are great artists.Sound: 7Again, I don\'t know if this rating is fair due to it\'s age and budget. The soundtrack is simple, and below average. Despite this, there are a few soundtracks that really stood out to me, and it fit the feel of the show extremely well. It\'s not a soundtrack I would spend the time looking for, though, and it\'s definitely not ""great"" either. Again, the sound, just like the art, receives a plain old ""good"", as well as a ""Meh.""Character: 10This is where the show stands out, in my opinion. Aside the romance, my favorite thing about this series was the main character; Hiroki. I don\'t know how to describe him with certain adjectives, but what I can say is that one of the main reasons I really, really enjoyed this show is because of him. He has a certain feel to him that you just can\'t help but love him, or at least, like him. You can\'t dislike him. At least, I think so. He\'s never gotten stuck in a cliche moments, not once. He was called a pervert? Doesn\'t bother him. He takes it as a joke, doesn\'t try to pathetically and desperately defend himself, and walks away. Plus, throughout 23 of the 24 episodes, he made all the right decisions. (Again, I did not like what he did in the ending. Seriously. I\'m so mad about his choice in the end.) But despite the ending, he\'s seriously a great and funny character.Of course, the other characters are wonderful too. The only character I disliked to a certain extent is Elis, Hiroki\'s cousin. As much as I like yanderes, her obsession with him is more annoying than you\'d expect. It just... is.Hagino is also a character that really stood out for me. She\'s an author who goes to the school Hiroki works at. She\'s adorable and has a wonderful attitude that is actually fairly unique. There are other characters that aren\'t emphasized as much, but you can tell what kind of person they are after a few episodes. Character development is outstanding.Enjoyment: 9My explanation for this rating is simple; I would have given it a ten... if it wasn\'t for the damn ending! Arrrgh! Either way, this show was surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch. The romance had me cheering throughout 23 of the 24 episodes, and I had a good time watching it. I laughed at a certain character I actually hated (Who I didn\'t mention in the character section) whenever he became sad.This series was definitely a fun ride, and sadly, I\'m going to be feeling a bit down due to the path the ending took... but despite that, it\'s a great series nonetheless, definitely underrated and even fairly unpredictable. plus, it\'s got good comedy to fill in the spaces between the romance! Now to try to find another VN adaption that lives up to something as great as Canvas 2. the series as a whole, despite the ride along the way being unexpectedly enjoyable. I don\'t know if this spoils anything, but I\'m just going to say that the path the main character was taking for the entire series was one I really agreed with, until the last episode he decides to change his mind and turn everything around.Story: 9The story is simple and sweet. Hiroki Kamikura is an artist... well, an ex-artist, who refuses to paint anything after a certain life event. (Which you learn about later on.) He lives with his little cousin; Elis, who lost her parents in a car crash when she was little. (Afterwards, Hiroki decided to take care of her.) Due to trauma, she refuses to use the color red in her paintings, or freaks out whenever she notices the color. (Again, you\'ll learn why, and it\'s a completely understandable reason as well, considering how trauma works and how old she was when said accident happens.)There are past events and other events that are important to the story, but all you need to know is it\'s about an awesome art student/student-teacher/teacher (Yes, the main character is a teacher, not a student) who gets trapped in a love triangle between his cousin and a childhood friend who ended up becoming a teacher at the same school. (Yes, there is incest to a certain degree. If you don\'t enjoy this sort of thing... you may not like this show. It\'s really not emphasized whatsoever due to the fact that the main character doesn\'t share his cousin\'s feelings, and doesn\'t even consider her a romantic interest. It\'s there, though, and it grows near the end.)Canvas 2 is a drama and a romance. The story is, as I said, simple and sweet. I myself enjoy drama, a lot, and found that the drama in this show is fairly deep and organized well. Some events and decisions are ridiculous, but nothing too severe. (Disregarding the ending...) Think of drama in shows like Golden Time, or Toradora... it\'s similar to that. If you like this sort of drama, you\'ll probably enjoy Canvas 2. If that\'s not enough, then I\'ll explain more of my feelings for this show continuing with...Art: 7I don\'t know if this rating is considered fair or not for a reason; The anime is from 2005, and, from what I can tell, the average cheaper visual novel adaptation. When it comes to animation, that is. Shows like Myself;Yourself or H2O: Footprints in the Sand are along the lines of what I mean. Though, at times, the animation is definitely great, though most of the time the animation is just plain old ""good"". Nothing more or nothing less.

Later, the manga-drawer (Kana, I think), makes references to the goings-on in the series at that point in time through questions and statements directed towards each character in regards to the current book she\'s writing; it brings a nice touch to the entire anime.Referring back to the harem burger... let me be a little bit more concise: the story starts off at a brisk pace for a 24-episode anime. Too brisk, in fact, and it showed. The middle episodes really were dull. Very, very dull. Then, it got its second-wind and picked it up for the the few remaining episodes. That really is the only legitimate gripe with the series, others can be made about silly little problems that are meant to be thought of as serious, but in the end you\'re just laughing at it, like, ""Are you serious?""Art: 8Well, it is called ""CANVAS"" 2, so I had a pretty high bar set for this anime and it was mostly good.

It has good story material, serious drama, and good humour. Canvas 2 is unexpectedly enjoyable.The story, unlike what you would expect from the cover and the OP, is not about a harem.

It has serious dramatic nature, slice of life and some comedy which made it interesting to watch. It starts okay, continues well, but was unfortunately decided to conclude in a way that majority would not approve of.The art is not bad. The character designs are fine, most of the drama and comedy were delivered well, and overall, the animation is plain and simple. Negatively, it has lame, unnecessary service scenes and the OP+ED makes it look like an ecchi/harem show.As for sounds, the OP and ED songs are just okay, it has a soundtrack that fits the scenes very well and I believe that it has good voice acting for all characters.The characters are mostly cliched, a lot of them were very unnecessary, and most of them did not have a clear background. It's not well casted, the supporting characters make the holes and question marks on the storyboard, but the important thing is that the main cast makes up the good story.The series kind of ended up as a fail, because of the conclusion, but still, I enjoyed watching it, specially the funny segments after the ED song.

I saw this show about a month ago, and it left a mark. This is my first review for any anime so you can guess it left a pretty big impression on me, enough to do this.To me and I think a lot of people who has seen this will agree. The ending of the show determines whether this is a masterpiece of a fail. I don't think it has a middle ground, not after the ending that it chose. It could have gone like...every other harem show and went with the safe ending but it chose otherwise.And choosing otherwise isn't bad, it makes the viewers think...but the way that Canvas 2 chose there ending was very extremely illogical. From the first episode, you know who Hiroki is in love with. He always blushes when he sees Kiri and vice versa. He regrets not accepting her love back in their high school days.She seemed like the obvious choice.But in the spur of the moment, in a moment of insanity I would like to say, he goes the opposite route of what the whole entire show has been about and he goes with his blood relative.At first, I was utterly disgusted..I almost gave the show a very low score because of the ending, and a lot of people out there felt the same way...but after a month..I've started to feel differently about Hiroki choosing Elise. I was content with it. Sure, it was more logical for the story line if he had stayed with Kiri, and i really do feel bad for her. At the same time, though, I realized that this is the author's story, if he wants Hiroki to be with Elise, there's nothing to say about that. And I also came to a big realization...THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT HIROKI IN THE FIRST PLACE..nobody really cared ab out how hiroki felt, the show really never focused on his feeling..it was always between Kiri and Elise..it was a competition..it doesn't matter that Hiroki chose his cousin because Hiroki doesn't matter at all..he's just a trophy, with this Elise has won, and Kiri has lost. Looking at the ending like that changed my perception a little bit. I still hate the ending but it's not as disgusting as it once was.Music:Great, I love the soundtrack.Character:Watchable, a few memorable characters.Enjoyment:I really enjoyed the show, the whole ride was awesome. There wasn't any epiosde that I was bored with, it didn't keep me at the edge of my feet but it was enjoyable nonetheless. This show would have had a way better score from me, if it wasn't for the ending. Maybe even a 10.Overall:If you had asked me a month ago about this show, I would have told you that it's the worst thing since school days, don't bother watching this crap, and if you do only watch up till episode 23.But now, I realize how much this show was enjoyable and the ending shouldn't really take that much away from it. I didn't hate Elise, I do want her to be happy, I just think the way they went about it was irrational. But isn't life sometime irrational, I see people do irrational things all the time. It's part of human nature, Hiroki made a mistake..he let Kiri go but that was his choice. Whatever!! It doesn't take anything away from the overall show.I would recommend this to anyone. And please after you see the ending please give it time to sink in before you make judgements about the whole show. every other harem show and went with the safe ending but it chose otherwise.And choosing otherwise isn't bad, it makes the viewers think...but the way that Canvas 2 chose there ending was very extremely illogical. From the first episode, you know who Hiroki is in love with. He always blushes when he sees Kiri and vice versa. He regrets not accepting her love back in their high school days.She seemed like the obvious choice.But in the spur of the moment, in a moment of insanity I would like to say, he goes the opposite route of what the whole entire show has been about and he goes with his blood relative.At first, I was utterly disgusted..I almost gave the show a very low score because of the ending, and a lot of people out there felt the same way...but after a month..I've started to feel differently about Hiroki choosing Elise. I was content with it. Sure, it was more logical for the story line if he had stayed with Kiri, and i really do feel bad for her. At the same time, though, I realized that this is the author's story, if he wants Hiroki to be with Elise, there's nothing to say about that. And I also came to a big realization...THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT HIROKI IN THE FIRST PLACE..nobody really cared ab out how hiroki felt, the show really never focused on his feeling..it was always between Kiri and Elise..it was a competition..it doesn't matter that Hiroki chose his cousin because Hiroki doesn't matter at all..he's just a trophy, with this Elise has won, and Kiri has lost. Looking at the ending like that changed my perception a little bit. I still hate the ending but it's not as disgusting as it once was.Music:Great, I love the soundtrack.Character:Watchable, a few memorable characters.Enjoyment:I really enjoyed the show, the whole ride was awesome. There wasn't any epiosde that I was bored with, it didn't keep me at the edge of my feet but it was enjoyable nonetheless. This show would have had a way better score from me, if it wasn't for the ending. Maybe even a 10.Overall:If you had asked me a month ago about this show, I would have told you that it's the worst thing since school days, don't bother watching this crap, and if you do only watch up till episode 23.But now, I realize how much this show was enjoyable and the ending shouldn't really take that much away from it. I didn't hate Elise, I do want her to be happy, I just think the way they went about it was irrational. But isn't life sometime irrational, I see people do irrational things all the time. It's part of human nature, Hiroki made a mistake..he let Kiri go but that was his choice. Whatever!! It doesn't take anything away from the overall show.I would recommend this to anyone. And please after you see the ending please give it time to sink in before you make judgements about the whole show."", ""First and foremost, this is my very first review of an anime, I'm looking forward to opinions and such.Story: 7/10The story in it's own is really good, but at some moments it gave me a WTF feeling. But it does have a unique story up until the the end where it goes completely cliché.I am a big fan of harem, and as some people know, harem usually doesn't have very plot.  I gave this an 8 at first, but as the story went on, It went down for me.Art: 7/10The art is nice, but it looks more common around now a days.Sound: 6/10I can't...recall much on the music, but I liked the Ending and the song Sumire-senpai sings.  Very nice.  Other than that, I don't think much of the music.Character: 9/10Now, the characters will decide if you like the show or not really.  I, personally, loved the childhood friend character and I'll just say, Hiroki disappointed me.  All of the characters have an arc in the series that makes them unique.  But they did introduce a character out of the blue and that got me off guard.  Hiroki is like me, oblivious, too nice for his own good, and they comes back to bite him.Enjoyment: 7/10I enjoyed the series so much.  But the ending, and this is for those who like a certain character, will not enjoy it as much OR enjoy it to their hearts content.Overall: 8/10Overall, I really liked the series and this is something you will want to watch. recall much on the music, but I liked the Ending and the song Sumire-senpai sings.

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48488/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Sotsu,"['Full Sotsu Review from the perspective of a longtime When they cry fan.Where do I start?*Warning* Heavy spoilers ahead!Story 1/10The biggest disappointment to my parents since me. Everything was handled poorly and with sub par quality....Higurashi is a story about friendship. Cringy as it may be that\'s what Higurashi always has been. I will go into methodical and surgical detail dissecting why Higurashi SotsuGou is the worst iteration of its series, a horrible sequel and a horrible stand alone.The first Arc of Sotsu is Onikaashi. Focusing on our favourite girl Rena Ryuugu. You know what else focuses on Rena? That\'s right, Tsumiboroshi. Onikaashi is nothing but a poor man\'s Recap of Tsumiboroshi, without any of the good stuff included. We already know who Rena is, we already know how she works, Onikaashi adds nothing to the character. These 3 episodes can be skipped without any consequence. Let\'s not forget to mention the fact that most of this is made out of recaps. The experienced WTC fan gets no information of any worth from this.Second Arc is Watakashi. Focusing on Mion. This is a poor man\'s version of Meakashi. Hands down. None of Mions character is expounded on. It just makes her a another version of Shion. The possibilities for L5 Mion were endless, none of that was made use of. What we did get was Rika getting shoved down a toilet (the funniest scene of this show NGL) and more recaps. It\'s also worth noting the inconsistent nature of L5 in Sotsu here, because in the Original Series the drug Takano had, would drive you into a L5 induced death in a few hours, not days. It\'s a weird retcon, that I\'m not sure should exist within the series, since it causes contradictions in previous arcs. Food for thought.Tatarikashi, More Recaps baby! You get a recap, and you get a recap! Everybody take this recap and shove it up your - alright alright, I\'ll calm down. Honestly though, you should have some questions when the show redeems a child abuser (and a possible rapist) and then goes one step further and has a child faking abuse for the lols. Satoko manipulates Keichii hard in this ep. She has zero empathy for her friends. Funnily enough, Satoko starts feeling regret when she kills Teppei, why she didn\'t feel any guilt when she injects her friends is beyond me, so don\'t ask me. Either way she bashes K1. Then it reveals that the Teppei Hallucination thing we saw in Gou never happened (This was the only part we couldn\'t answer after Gou) I STRONGLY believe that this scene only exists to throw people off and make people think that a deeper mystery exists where it doesn\'t. It actively comes off as an underhanded and manipulative.Then everything goes to hell. Alright alright get this. Rika remembers that Satoko was the big bad BECAUSE - She has someone else\'s memories! How? WHY? Who knows, it never happens before and it doesn\'t happen since. Its a Deus ex machina. The plot literally came to Rika. If this is not bad enough. The big suspenseful moment from the end of Gou - the Gun scene. Ends with Satoko shooting Rika - it sucks. The major buildup from Gou, the perrenial Cliffhanger ended just like that, once again this feels like underhanded storytelling.Cue the next ep. Rika and Satoko go supah Seiyan! (This is not a witch Battle btw, to read Umineko if you want to see how that really looks like.)PS - It\'s nothing like this. Mainly because Witches don\'t ever fight up close. Never. Not even Lambda and Bern.They fight some more across different Fragments. Then finally Rika and Satoko end up in a bridge. With the McGuffin Sword in Rikas hands. Rika throws it into the river. Hanyuu gets it. Cracks Eua\'s horns, turns her into a Loli, sends her back to whence she came (a black cloud, probably Lambdadelta)Rika and Satoko come to an agreement. Rika leaves to St Lucia. Everybody is happy. Satoshi wakes up. They play dear you just to give you the middle finger one last time before you go and it\'s over.Don\'t wonder how Satoshi got up when he was in a medically induced coma, the series doesn\'t respect its own rules anymore.This is pathetic storytelling. Much of the story revolved around a McGuffin Sword that literally turned into a Deus ex Machina at the end. Let\'s not forget that Satoko gets her neck cut with the McGuffin Shard and nothing happens! The story doesn\'t respect its own rules, why should we? If we can\'t trust the story to pay respect to the rules that it itself laid down, how can someone trust the story to be consistent. The 5 loop until death proclamation that Rika did, and Satoko ending up in a world without Rika, were unfortunately badly planned attempts by Passione to up the stakes. To create tension and excitement.The mirror world references Passione put in are the same, poor attempts to create excitement within a shallow story.If that wasnt enough insults, Higurashi Mei, Higuashis Gacha game, explains some of the finer details in the Gacha game of all things.Hopefully by now you can understand how bad SotsuGou\'s story is . However I only scratched the tip of the iceberg. The sins of SotsuGou\'s story are so terrible that I can write a book about it, and still have a lot left to say. However for our sanity, it\'s best we move on.Artstyle  6/10Whether you prefer the rounded Artstyle that this shares with Mei is fully up to you. I won\'t go into detail here because this is based on taste and nothing else. Although personally I would have preferred Alchemist\'s Character designs to appear. Since they maintain a good balance between Ryuukishis original designs and traditional anime character standards.Music 3/10The DEEN Higurashi Anime is well known for its stellar use of music. Using a combination of VIsual Novel and Original tracks, it handles this perfectly.Sotsu on the other hand, has no good music to call it\'s own. Much of the OST becomes background noise. I can\'t name one price of the OST that I like. It\'s really unfortunate.Dear You is a song that is supposed to represent the bonds between the cast, in the context of SotsuGou however it comes off an insult when its the send off to a story that featured little of Mion, Keichii and Rena, along with the fact that Satoko actively kills and harms them.Dear You ~ SotsuGou ~ is the last sad moans of this Anime. Doing it\'s best to hang in to relevance.Animation 4/10This is another place where SotsuGou struggles in. DEEN used dynamic camera angles, positioning to deliver a more fluid animation experience. Sotsu on the other hand mostly used shot -reverse shots which get boring. The actual character animation also leaves a lot to be desired. Character Animation was something DEEN struggled with sometimes as well, but unlike what DEEN, Sotsu can not fall back on its dark backgrounds as a clutch.For their credit Passione used some of the budget for the big DBZ and Naruto crossover scenes at the end. So that\'s commendable at least. Good job Passione, give yourself a pat on the back.Characters 1/10Rika FurudeYou know that this is bad when Rikas VA is confused about what\'s going on. In the original VN. Rika was the one who was emotionally dependant on Satoko. Not here however, because in SotsuGou \'le tables have turned on ye\'. Satoko for some reason can\'t live without Rika. Why? How did this happen? Who knows? Don\'t get me wrong, Rika and Satoko were always close but Rika is the one who has a panic attack when she doesn\'t get Satoko, not the other way around.Let\'s not forget that Rika ignores everything that happened in Matsuri. Her lesson there was;\'Waiting for things to go her was pointless. If she wanted to win, she had to roll up her sleeves and actually work for the future she wanted\'In SotsuGou she proceeds to ignore everything going on and gives random cryptic advice to K1. What happened to Rika? Eua must have taken some of her brain cells because nothing else can explain this. HECK, the idiot waits until Nekodamashi to check on Takano, ON TAKANO, the person that\'s supposedly gonna kill her and everybody she loves.In the original one of Rikas goals was a world with EVERYONE she cared about all her friends and didn\'t want a world without them. Rika here decides to screw everybody else and stay with Satoko.This is peak character butchering. Rika was only passive when she had given up, however in SotsuGou she\'s like that from the very beginning.Satoko HoujouThe biggest tragedy (or comedy) of Sotsu. Satoko is a character with a fairly good understanding of others and someone who is capable of empathizing with even the worst of people. Here however she\'s turned into a one note evil girl with zero redemption (they didn\'t even try)Let\'s look at what SotsuGou tells us about Satoko;- Has no problem with killing her friends, not only Rika.- Can forgive Teppei for abusing and hurting her and Satoshi but cant forgive Rika for some reason.- Knows about all of Rikas loops but cant sympathise with why Rika might want to leave Hinamaizawa.- Only felt Regret qhen killing Teppei (lol) but not her friends.- Has no qualms about injecting innoncents like Akasaka and old man Kimiyoshi.- Tricks K1 and screws him over in Tatari.- Injects Mion, the most neutral and stable person in the group. For no reason than the lols.- Rolls around in the ground laughing like an idiot.- Falls victim to Euas goading.- Kills her own regrets in Tatarikashi.- Dodges sword strikes with the speed of a ninja? how? Who knows?- Has no trauma for Teppei or Takano but somehow is traumatised by a BOX. Bloody hell if a box punch is all it takes, why is she not kneeling over for Rena. Who packs a meaner punch?- Undergoes zero redemption or development.- Gets forgiven by Rika with zero consequences.The Eagled eyed reader might have noticed something interesting.""Hey Coulomb, why doesn\'t Satoko or Rika have any character development?""Because they don\'t. The show didn\'t give them any.What\'s really tragic is, that Miotsukushi, an alternative ending arc did more for Satoko in two screens than Sotsu did in two seasons!Hopefully overall you can realise how bad Satoko\'s characterisation is.The WORST part about Satoko and and Rika is that they never resolved their conflict by themselves, the club basically stepped into force them back together. It\'s poor writing.Overall 3/10Not worth your time. Read the Manga for a better experience, but avoid the anime. If you are a new fan watch the 2007 Original + Kai, I gurantee my life, that it will be magnitudes more satisfying than this.  That is all.In Retrospect ......""When they cry, I laugh."" - The Messiah, Ryuukishi 07. (I\'m not sure if he actually said this I just think it\'s relevant)Higurashi and even Umineko had a theme of protecting children. Preserving childhood. However SotsuGou completely turned this message on its head , and gave us something else. Doesn\'t this entire thing make Ryuukishi 07 a bit of a hypocrite? I can accept many things - but when you start redeeming child abusers and rapists that\'s where I draw the line. In many ways I think death of the author is applicable here.BT, bless his soul.

There\'s also Ciconia. However since it\'s reception has been poor even among WTc fans, I wonder where thing will go next.Higurashi is 07th expansions most popular series.

She didnt even CONSIDER it.If your ever needed proof to show that Satoko is a one note caraceture of a half assed Yandere whose entire universe revolves around Rika and ONLY Rika this is it.', '- This Review contains spoilers -Talking about Sotsu is really hard...Going back in time, in 2020 we had the first part of the New Project of the franchise, which at the same time connected events of the original story, serving as a sequel for the anime, promoted a new experience, different from what was already presented.It was confirmed that from the beginning Gou was a contradictory season for the show, as it involved a conflict within the very functionality and purpose of what was Higurashi until the end of the canonical arcs adapted from the Visual Novels. What marked the franchise for almost 20 years...was set aside in favor of building a new story. An ambitious move, no? It is hard to think that a story already finished had anything more to tell, but honestly the feeling that Sotsu caused in the end was sadness.The first three arcs (Oniakashi, Wataakashi and Tatariakashi), Sotsu oscillated quite a bit. The project really delivered a good start, where the conclusion of the arc in which Rena starred brought great anticipation for what would come next. Wataakashi was different... It was not the same feeling. The perception I had was that the staff had invested their time to start the show, but did not take good care in concluding this whole new phase. During this arc, it was interesting to see Mion being the real culprit in this little mystery. Of course, we can\'t forget that in the end the real culprit was always Satoko. When the show gives its plot twist still in Gou, it was expected that Satoko would be put on a pedestal as a villain. Well, that happened. If that\'s what the anime wanted, it got it. This idea whereby the show sustained itself injected added scenes with the perspective of Satoko having these ""two faces"". However, from here, it has a problem. Possibly the problem that destroyed much of the potential that New Project had.From the third arc on (Tatariakashi), I could already see that the show was going to decline. I remember talking to some people about the status of the show during the release of the episodes and I knew that this projection of 15 episodes done the way it was would not be enough. Lack of time? Honestly, no. With 15 episodes it is possible to build a story that would conclude Higurashi, for sure. What prevented that was the time used during each of the parts that solved the mysteries separately. The show did this at the time with the second season. It was a formatting that worked and concluded the series in a positive way. Passione has consistently tried to repeat this, but has not succeeded. Tatariakashi was already a stage where you had both Satoko at her peak of madness, and moments where you didn\'t know what she really wanted.Moving on, the franchise took steps backwards when it came to identifying the characters. The final conflict caused a sincerely silly fight between St. Lucia and Hinamizawa. Again, the selfishness that possessed Satoko exceeded her understanding with what she herself wanted. Episodes 10 and 11 demonstrate this, where there is a struggle unconsciously within her mind. A person who is already consumed by hatred against someone who still wants to have her life in peace. I didn\'t understand what actually occurred with this scene. It was just intriguing and would be a great way to cause Satoko\'s own redemption about what she did. But as the following episodes went on, that moment really didn\'t do much good. And even if Tatariakashi\'s conclusion had been good, the execution of the arc didn\'t please.Remember what motivated her to do all this? Not wanting to lose her friendship with Rika was a huge desperation inside the character\'s heart. And now, she tries to fix it, even if she has to go through several loops and deaths to find the ""ideal universe"". Selfish, isn\'t it? This possession awakened a parallel personality that would cause more focus on the supernatural part of the series. Eua and Hanyuu were already characters that had this objective of serving as support to make the show\'s conclusions easier to reach. It turns out that with Hanyuu, in the original story, the explanations and dramas inserted were answered in a way that caused the interest of those watching. Yes, it\'s still a pretty boring way to think about it, but it was a lazy idea. Ryukishi could have brought this story turn around with a little more aptitude.With Eua, same thing... It\'s really hard to define how far Ryukishi got involved in this original story, but the existence of Eua in the Higurashi universe sparked a problem that would be responsible for the very downfall of the show in the future. This was something that I predicted even in Gou. When there is the addition of an important character to the series, there needs to be a plausible way to contextualize the audience about what is happening.""Who is Eua?"", ""Why did she help Satoko, being that it would apparently be of no benefit to her?"", ""What is the purpose of her existing in the franchise?""; honestly, I\'m wondering that even now. Of course, it has the famous connections between Umineko and Higurashi, but I prefer to keep my feet on the ground about that. One cannot ignorantly state that assumption that connects the two worlds. Anyone who likes and understands the When They Cry franchise knows that this is a way to bring a more solid connection to culminate in this great universe, but while it\'s a good idea, it has displaced the goal of this show.Speaking of purpose, what was ""Kagurashi""? Four episodes made to conclude the series were not enough. Hanyuu reappearing in the astral world to Eua, Rika discovering that it was Satoko who was to blame for everything, and even the existence of the artifact that has the ability to kill those who live in loops... These issues are good at first glance, but insufficient to bring a conclusion. Since Gou I felt that what limited Hanyuu was already irrationalized. It already happened that she said ""this time is our last chance"" to Rika. That happened in Matsuribayashi (Kai), for example. The show tried to circumvent that and made Hanyuu have an ability and powers without much realistic explanation. It was not enjoyable, it was not captivating, it was not fun to witness after so many episodes the current fragments happen just ""because they did"".Episode 14? Well, I don\'t think the problem with the show was that episode. In fact, it was more intense and was a nice way to bring a conclusion that needed to happen a long time ago. The build up to that stage was creative and I really appreciate the way the show tries to insert the abysmal powers. It was the famous ""Dragon Ball"" of Higurashi. A compilation of moments that disappointed most, as it was definitely no longer the ""Higurashi"" that everyone knew. Satoko and Rika awakening a power in a divine way was not really a good choice.About the production, it was a factor that hurt the entire show. The amount of scenes brought entirely from Gou became more and more apparent as time went on and made Sotsu a definitive recap, rather than a conclusion. Passione experienced problems in writing a narrative that yielded well for the audience, but did not bring something new. Even with more than a cour of episodes left, it\'s still a sense of expectation to have something that was actually enjoyable to watch. Gou\'s phase was so interesting. The moments gave a utopian and cathartic awakening for it to have a good execution in the second half of the story. But I feel betrayed. In fact, I feel anguished. Anguished that I have absorbed a franchise that is so important to me and that even though I defended the show\'s more negative phases, I couldn\'t really like New Project the way I wanted to. The ""miracle"" that Hanyuu cites so much in the story is not for Rika, but for the project itself. Concluding the story in a good way was like a miracle, and it didn\'t happen this time.Finally, Higurashi is still a franchise that I love, regardless of their criticisms. But Gou/Sotsu was indigestion. It\'s like you eat a whole cake. You\'ll be drawn to the temptation and think it\'s a good idea, but it won\'t be good for your stomach. As much as Sotsu didn\'t appeal to me, I can see some quality in it. I don\'t view this sequel as totally wasted, but I can\'t give it any more enthusiasm and say that it was a good experience. was set aside in favor of building a new story. An ambitious move, no? It is hard to think that a story already finished had anything more to tell, but honestly the feeling that Sotsu caused in the end was sadness.The first three arcs (Oniakashi, Wataakashi and Tatariakashi), Sotsu oscillated quite a bit. The project really delivered a good start, where the conclusion of the arc in which Rena starred brought great anticipation for what would come next. Wataakashi was different... It was not the same feeling. The perception I had was that the staff had invested their time to start the show, but did not take good care in concluding this whole new phase. During this arc, it was interesting to see Mion being the real culprit in this little mystery. Of course, we can\'t forget that in the end the real culprit was always Satoko. When the show gives its plot twist still in Gou, it was expected that Satoko would be put on a pedestal as a villain. Well, that happened. If that\'s what the anime wanted, it got it. This idea whereby the show sustained itself injected added scenes with the perspective of Satoko having these ""two faces"". However, from here, it has a problem. Possibly the problem that destroyed much of the potential that New Project had.From the third arc on (Tatariakashi), I could already see that the show was going to decline. I remember talking to some people about the status of the show during the release of the episodes and I knew that this projection of 15 episodes done the way it was would not be enough. Lack of time? Honestly, no. With 15 episodes it is possible to build a story that would conclude Higurashi, for sure. What prevented that was the time used during each of the parts that solved the mysteries separately. The show did this at the time with the second season. It was a formatting that worked and concluded the series in a positive way. Passione has consistently tried to repeat this, but has not succeeded.

After having a bait and switch with Gou, and resulting in a mixed bag of reactions throughout the entirety of its run: Sotsu had a big role to fill in terms of story, characters and engagement. It had to managed to bring in and lure those fans that didn't seem to really enjoy Gou, while also satisfying fans that loved it but are hoping for...deeper, meaningful connections with other 7th Expansion properties (Umineko and Ciconia). It also had to make the series make more sense for those that watched the series under the impression it was a remake.We are currently 4 episodes into Sotsu, so has it managed to deliver so far?Not... really.I am personally a very big fan of Higurashi and Umineko, and I absolutely loved Gou. Making a series that is both a remake and a sequel is absolutely genius, and equated to a very fun ride. We had so many new reveals for the mystery that seemed to be unfolding, as well major plot twists in its last arc such as Satoko being the reason for the new loops. Eua, who is a carbon copy of Featherine, was a massive twist that no one expected. The season was an absolute blast, and I currently have Gou sitting at a strong 9.However, Sotsu, so far, has managed to be a bit of a disappointment.Its first answer arc in Oniakashi we already knew a fair bit amount from the trailers and stuff hinted in Gou's last arc (Satokowashi-hen), but there was still room for some new introductions and story beats. Instead, it was filled with a lot of recap scenes, some instances of plot convenience, and ambiguity that an answer arc shouldn't be giving us. Satoko ends up using H173 to inject Rena, but the way that this is set up is incredibly odd.Rena has a moment where she gazes off, but then suddenly decides to leave the club early and go to the nurses office. This makes sense, and a lot of viewers expected a confrontation between Satoko and Rena. Instead, we are met with a scene where Rena is asleep in the nurses office, and Satoko injects her with H173. This is... ridiculously convenient, and feels like bad writing in all honesty. The dominos set themselves up too perfectly for this to happen, and without Rena waking up at that.The next major instance is Rena reacting differently to the injections than Tomitake did. Tomitake clawed his throat out a few hours after being injected from the disease, but Rena manages to survive almost an entire week. Sure, H173 could function differently depending on the host, but it is a strange writing choice to take something that has two to three seasons worth of foundation and suddenly change it.Oniakashi is then topped off with the biggest question of that entire arc (Rena vs Keiichi) not having a complete answer. We don't know if Keiichi hallucinated, we don't know how Keiichi survived a bunch of stab wounds AND didn't bleed out, and we don't know how Rena died from getting hit in the head by an alarm clock. We don't really know how any of this resolved.The entire first arc of Sotsu was just set up in a way that was both unsatisfying and very frustrating for quite a bit of fans of the series, as there are many things that didn't feel like Higurashi in it. Of course it did bring some benefits, such as a Rina redemption and more background on Rena's family. Which these were indeed nice additions and helped flesh out the arc a bit more, but it does not make up for its shortcomings.Today we started the answer arc Wataakashi-hen, which is the answers for probably the biggest question arc in Gou which was Watadamashi-hen. The first 3/4's of the episode were phenomenal. We found out something massive regarding Hanyuu, Eua and the fragment world, and we got some extremely important scenes for Satoko. But then... once again, we got back to recaps. I understand that the recaps are there to fill in the audience as to what is happening, but Sotsu only has a 15 episode run time - showing recaps means things will likely be very rushed towards the ending. However, this wasn't really my issue with this episode.My issue was Satoko injecting Mion. I personally believe Mion getting level 5 of the Syndrome would've been a very cool thing to see indeed, but the way that it happened was extremely unsatisfying. We see Mion at a vending machine, bent over, and Satoko holding the injection. Then it cuts away, and we see the group together but the syringe on the ground empty. This scene coupled with the ending scene of Watadamashi (with Mion having scratch marks) means Mion was indeed injected, which is honestly extremely ridiculous.How on Earth did Satoko manage to inject Mion, without Mion noticing. Rena was asleep when she got injected, and she still winced when the needle went into her - while she was ASLEEP. Mion is fully awake, there is no way in the world she would not notice a syringe going into her body and pumping fluids in her. I know some people are trying to suggest that maybe Satoko spiked her drink, but this makes even less sense. Why would Mion pass her drink to Satoko and then take it back, and when in like the span ofa few minutes would Satoko pour the stuff into Mion's drink. There is so much grey area here that if this doesn't get elaborated on, this is going to be a major plot hole. I originally thought it was due to the influence of Eua on the world, and that maybe she was manipulating things but that seems to not be the case due to comments made by Ryu.This whole review might come off as nitpicking, but these are really important moments - these injection scenes are the entire reason these arcs happen. The fact that they are happening in really overly convenient ways is ridiculous. Higurashi is a series known for tight-nit writing and its thoroughly thought out story telling, and nothing about these scenes feels tight-nit or thought out. And these scenes are only the worst offenders from this season, there are plenty more issues.Could Sotsu turn around, explain all of these things and get better? Yeah. Has Sotsu still been enjoyable besides a lot of the things I pointed out? Yeah. Its just there currently are a lot of small things, that if you think more about will snowball into bigger things.TL;DRSotsu so far has been underwhelming. There are many instances of things that are very convenient and feel like cop-outs, many instances of already existing footage being reused, and wacky inconsistencies with past knowledge of other seasons. The series has still managed to be at least enjoyable for majority of the time, but there are really some underlying things that could make the later part of this season suffer.Higurashi Sotsu is currently schedule for 15 episodes, which means we have 11 left. Wata is supposed to be 3, Tata is supposed to be 5, and the ending arc is supposed to be 4. Realistically, this is not enough time to wrap up the story that they currently have laid out. If they continue to not explain things and hold recaps in, I am genuinely afraid for the rest of this series as a major fan of Higurashi. deeper, meaningful connections with other 7th Expansion properties (Umineko and Ciconia).

Everyone thought he was over and done with, considering the original Higurashi spanned 8 visual novels, nearly 40 manga volumes and 50 anime episodes, and that’s before you factor in the spinoffs. Running at 39 episodes long, the new anime is more substantial than a typical 1 to 2 cour series. For the purpose of this review, my thoughts refer to both Gou and Sotsu.Unlike the earlier anime adaptations, this one was co-written by Ryukishi himself. Character designs were by Akio Watanabe, best known for his work on the Monogatari anime...franchise. And returning composer Kenji Kawai has once again come to lend his talents to the music score. The music is not the best, but it’s not the worse either, especially at the end. The visuals are not the best ever, but at the very least, this new anime from Passione looks better than the Deen anime productions of old.Speaking of technical aspects, the Japanese voice cast is still ace after all these years. Rika is still my favorite Yukari Tamura performance after all this time. Also of note is that Funimation did an English dub. Uncontroversial opinion: the English dub is as good as the original Japanese. How ironic. The first Higurashi anime’s English dub is quite possibly the worst dub that’s not by 4Kids or Sentai Filmworks in existence. Higurashi Rei and Sotsu? Everyone, even the moe girls, sound just as good as their originals. Michelle Rojas sounds EXACTLY like how Mion sounds in my head when I read the manga, for example. This is a show I can watch in either format and enjoy.As such, if you’ve seen the score I’ve given, you’ve no doubt formed some thoughts about me. Conversely, I have some thoughts on how the one time an anime sequel is good, everyone shits all over it. Sure, it has 4.5/5 stars on Funimation, but all I hear, from both casual viewers and longtime fans alike, is that Gou and Sotsu sure did suck alright. They just plain sucked! People have seen anime that sucked before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!Before I continue this apologetic, let me quality myself. Since my last review here was way back in December of 2015, Higurashi has gone up in my personal ranking. It is equal to Ryukishi’s own Umineko in my eyes now.I should also mention the following: Higurashi and Umineko changed my life. They are only two of three works of fiction to have ever changed me on a fundamental level. (The third being that Star Wars had a huge impact on me as a child.) Ryukishi is also my favorite living author of narrative fiction. And let it be known that Higurashi and Umineko are my favorite works of fiction. (If you thought my review of Castle in the Sky was glowing, well, I’ve seen The Sun shine.) I say all of this now because if any of you think I’m too biased to properly review Gou and Sotsu, you may leave. If you think my merely liking Gou and Sotsu makes you want to PM me and call me a million variations of The R Word, that is your right. My purpose is to convince those who love Higurashi but avoided this new anime project because of the constant complaints from Real Fans™ about it that they should reconsider. Think of this review as a spoiler free reason to return to Hinamizawa.It's hard to talk about the plot of Gou and Sotsu without spoiling anything. Suffice to say, a new mystery has arisen, and bloodied bodies are piling up once more. Things seem to be the same as before, yet they’re not. How could this be? Why must tragedy play out once more?Here is the one flaw I found: Gou and Sotsu did not change my life. This could just be that I’m at a point in my life where I can no longer learn anything significant from a work of narrative fiction, but Gou and Sotsu didn’t have the life-altering messages that Tsumihoroboshi-hen, Minagoroshi-hen, and Matsuribayashi-hen did. Gou and Sotsu are “only” as good as Meakashi-hen was for me, which, by any measurable standard, is phenomenal. Still, if failing to live up to an impossibly high standard makes Gou and Sotsu the shittiest shit that was ever shat out of a butt, then fine, the constant criticisms make sense in that regard.However, let me print a quote from Ryukishi’s own Umineko, “Without love, it cannot be seen.” Many of the Real Fans™ I see bashing Gou and Sotsu are, like me, familiar with Umineko. I wonder if we even saw the same show. I saw an intense character study, one full of pathos, a story where people grow older and move on to new things. Sometimes, that creates friction, even amongst those with the strongest of bonds. Sometimes, people drift apart not because of things like politics or a change of careers, but just…time. People you knew as kids might not be good friends of yours anymore. People you respect as an adult probably would’ve gotten on your nerves as a kid. People you idolize might have selfish desires, desires that go against your own wishes. This is life. This is reality. Sure, Higurashi presents this in the form of a story where little girls with huge eyes get massacred in brutal fashion, but Higurashi does something very, VERY few works of Japanese popular culture do: reflect reality.

And returning composer Kenji Kawai has once again come to lend his talents to the music score. The music is not the best, but it’s not the worse either, especially at the end. The visuals are not the best ever, but at the very least, this new anime from Passione looks better than the Deen anime productions of old.Speaking of technical aspects, the Japanese voice cast is still ace after all these years. Rika is still my favorite Yukari Tamura performance after all this time. Also of note is that Funimation did an English dub. Uncontroversial opinion: the English dub is as good as the original Japanese. How ironic. The first Higurashi anime’s English dub is quite possibly the worst dub that’s not by 4Kids or Sentai Filmworks in existence. Higurashi Rei and Sotsu? Everyone, even the moe girls, sound just as good as their originals. Michelle Rojas sounds EXACTLY like how Mion sounds in my head when I read the manga, for example. This is a show I can watch in either format and enjoy.As such, if you’ve seen the score I’ve given, you’ve no doubt formed some thoughts about me. Conversely, I have some thoughts on how the one time an anime sequel is good, everyone shits all over it. Sure, it has 4.5/5 stars on Funimation, but all I hear, from both casual viewers and longtime fans alike, is that Gou and Sotsu sure did suck alright. They just plain sucked! People have seen anime that sucked before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!Before I continue this apologetic, let me quality myself. Since my last review here was way back in December of 2015, Higurashi has gone up in my personal ranking. It is equal to Ryukishi’s own Umineko in my eyes now.I should also mention the following: Higurashi and Umineko changed my life. They are only two of three works of fiction to have ever changed me on a fundamental level. (The third being that Star Wars had a huge impact on me as a child.) Ryukishi is also my favorite living author of narrative fiction. And let it be known that Higurashi and Umineko are my favorite works of fiction. (If you thought my review of Castle in the Sky was glowing, well, I’ve seen The Sun shine.) I say all of this now because if any of you think I’m too biased to properly review Gou and Sotsu, you may leave. If you think my merely liking Gou and Sotsu makes you want to PM me and call me a million variations of The R Word, that is your right. My purpose is to convince those who love Higurashi but avoided this new anime project because of the constant complaints from Real Fans™ about it that they should reconsider. Think of this review as a spoiler free reason to return to Hinamizawa.It's hard to talk about the plot of Gou and Sotsu without spoiling anything. Suffice to say, a new mystery has arisen, and bloodied bodies are piling up once more. Things seem to be the same as before, yet they’re not. How could this be? Why must tragedy play out once more?Here is the one flaw I found: Gou and Sotsu did not change my life. This could just be that I’m at a point in my life where I can no longer learn anything significant from a work of narrative fiction, but Gou and Sotsu didn’t have the life-altering messages that Tsumihoroboshi-hen, Minagoroshi-hen, and Matsuribayashi-hen did. Gou and Sotsu are “only” as good as Meakashi-hen was for me, which, by any measurable standard, is phenomenal. Still, if failing to live up to an impossibly high standard makes Gou and Sotsu the shittiest shit that was ever shat out of a butt, then fine, the constant criticisms make sense in that regard.However, let me print a quote from Ryukishi’s own Umineko, “Without love, it cannot be seen.” Many of the Real Fans™ I see bashing Gou and Sotsu are, like me, familiar with Umineko. I wonder if we even saw the same show. I saw an intense character study, one full of pathos, a story where people grow older and move on to new things. Sometimes, that creates friction, even amongst those with the strongest of bonds. Sometimes, people drift apart not because of things like politics or a change of careers, but just…time. People you knew as kids might not be good friends of yours anymore. People you respect as an adult probably would’ve gotten on your nerves as a kid. People you idolize might have selfish desires, desires that go against your own wishes. This is life. This is reality. Sure, Higurashi presents this in the form of a story where little girls with huge eyes get massacred in brutal fashion, but Higurashi does something very, VERY few works of Japanese popular culture do: reflect reality. This is humanity. It’s not always pleasant. Many victims of abuse grow up to become abusers themselves. Those cute girls you look up to might not stay that way forever because that’s life. And, if I’ve learned anything from talking to people on the internet, it’s that whenever anything reminds people of something that makes them uncomfortable, their first instinct is to attack it. That, too, is reality.Viewers these days are too literal. There is a difference between what a person literally says versus the actual meaning of what is being said.

Have a pleasant day."", 'Without love, it cannot be seen.Massive spoilers for Higurashi to follow after the next paragraph. If you want my advice, whether you like the series or not, go watch the new one.I love this show to the bits. I despise this show to the bone of my soul. Higurashi Sotsu is both the best and the worst anime I have seen in 2021 (and 2020 counting Gou). It is both utterly brilliant and completely insulting, both paying great respect and developing the characters 20 years on in nuanced and intricate ways as well as shitting on them from a great height. It loves the...audience and hates them. It is both incredibly frustrating and incredibly gratifying on a weekly basis. It is both these things at the same time. However, because of this there is no good way to reflect this in my score; simply taking the average and giving a 5 is disingenuous and implies the show is mediocre (when it really isn\'t). Thus, I will apply the same method Ryukishi07 used in Umineko : To misuse Schrodinger\'s Cat and to construct a Cat Box.There is one thing you can\'t deny going into Gou/Sotsu. In that it is a complete wild ride from start to finish. While the original VN (and Umineko and Ciconia) were works that are to be taken seriously, I cannot see Gou/Sotsu as anything but a black comedy. They hired a comedy director for goodness sake. And from the interviews, the deliberate grindhouse aesthetic chosen for the violent scenes do support this view. It\'s moments like the club members playing in a river as Satoko violently stabs Rika in the throat with a blunt fork, or Keiichi and Rena playing knifey-clocky, or that beautiful beautiful Gilligan Cut with Akasaka and Rika, that make me laugh uncontrollably. Unironically, Higurashi has been the best comedy of the whole year, unintentional or not, but I\'m willing to give some credit in this department. Just some.Gou/Sotsu (Sotsu especially) is what I\'d call the accumulation or the perfection of the art of schlock. It is complete madness from a creator who may or may not have genuine distaste for his work, and who takes the chance to laugh at both himself and the audience for going through in this mess. For that, I respect R07 for going through with this vision. Even if he may completely mock me for enjoying Gou/Sotsu.To begin dissecting why I think this show deserves both a 1/10 and a 10/10 score at the same time, let\'s look at characters. Or less charitably, character assassination. Before moving on, I want to stress that I like Satoko\'s new change in character. Her new personality makes sense and is a natural progression of how her character would evolve after the events of Saikoroshi, and tying her to Lambdadelta or Vier from Umineko/Ciconia respectively makes sense on both a design and plot front. Likewise with Rika. Rika has always been a terrible person even in the VNs, so her stubbornness and selfishness are likewise, natural progressions of her character arc from the end of Saikoroshi, and a bridge to her later alter ego as the cynical and cruel Frederica Bernkastel. No, character assassination refers to everyone else (apart from Teppei). Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Shion, even dear Mr Delicious and some of the adults. That is something I can\'t easily forgive R07 for. Shion (the one without the tattoo) got the worst of it though. Just her overall patheticness in Watakaashi genuinely made me angry. I just can\'t fathom why the previously craziest Yandere of the entire series is reduced to a crying mess in front of a slow moving non-threathening Mion. Teppei on the other hand is the (third) biggest winner in terms of character growth though. I can\'t believe R07 made me actually feel sympathy for him 20 years on. Though in hindsight he pulled the same stunt back with Rosa too, but Teppei here seems genuinely remorseful and because of that, you do end up pitying him.Now to tackle the plot. Oh boy. While I did like Higurashi as a VN for its atmospheric mystery horror, I will freely admit it eventually relied on a Deus Ex Machina to resolve its plot. Nothing relating to the main themes of trusting your friends ever helped Rika find out the identity of her killer. If we\'re going with the Eua is Ryukishi07 analogy, we can see one of the first and clearest deviations is that the sheer concept of a Deus Ex Machina is mocked in its entirety for Gou/Sotsu. And that includes Hanyuu of course, which can also be seen as a stand-in for R07 in his earlier days.  As a writer, I personally find his longer works (Higurashi, Umineko, Rose Gun Days, and to some extent Higanbana) to be excellent, but at the same time his shorter works or his manga ventures are just terrible (I don\'t wanna mention Iwaihime ever again, or Loopers). So how does Sotsu fall in this regard?For an author who once championed the philosophy of actively trying to solve a mystery even if you\'re off the mark, and who deliberately didn\'t give explicit solutions to Umineko in Episodes 7 and 8, preferring the viewer to come up with the solutions on their own, it is incredibly disheartening to have most of Sotsu be repetitive recaps of Gou with the most obvious solutions shown in excruciating and unnecessary detail to the viewer. It is tiring and the absolute lowest point in the series for me. It is dead obvious as to the Who, How, and Why of Oni/Wata/Tata, but we really didn\'t need to see Satoko slowly stalk her victims and inject them and then once more following the victims as they cause havok. It is so dull and so much of the footage from Gou is recycled. At least when Haruhi did it they reanimated many of the scenes. Here though? By my estimate only 40% of Sotsu is new material, and that includes the final 2 episodes which are past the recap point. And yes, it took 8 whole months for the story to continue. And yet, in spite of this flagrant reuse of content, I ended up going through the same motions at Eua, laughing heartily at every single scene Satoko does her spooky red eyes in. It\'s awful but in the best possible way. Or maybe that\'s the Stockholm Syndrome kicking in. It is instances like these where I wonder if R07 has contempt for his fans, just stringing us along on this seemingly neverending year-long journey where you do get to feel like Rika being stuck in her endless loops.It is also through Higurashi that I have to come to a hard realization, that the original VN\'s plot isn\'t that good. It is entertaining and I was emotionally moved, yes. But in doing so I had to ignore plot holes and the Deus Ex Machina that completely destroys the whole story in order to provide a happy ending. At the tail end of Matsuribayashi, R07 asks the viewer a graduation question, which to paraphrase is ""Is there a way for there to be a happy ending for everyone?"". Gou/Sotsu on the surface seems to try to answer that, but in doing so it establishes connections, that weren\'t there in the first place, to the greater WTC series, Umineko and the still-yet-unfinished Ciconia, with Satoko being the lynchpin that holds this House of Cards together. While this does turn Satoko from my most disliked character into my most loved, the consequence of this is that I have put greater importance on the meta-narrative stringing these series together rather than the individual stories themselves. And in retrospect I can\'t enjoy the original Higurashi on its own without connecting it to the greater meta-narrative. How it all comes down is still in the air, since the final (?) part of the puzzle is still unreleased.Much like with Satoko and her conflicting love and hatred for Rika, I too am in a similar position with Sotsu. The ending to Sotsu reinforces my love AND hate for what has become of Higurashi as a new version of you plays in a beautiful scene as everyone gets a happy ending at last...and yet it also reinforces how R07 refuses to provide an explicit connection to his other works. I mean, if you\'re gonna establish a ""cinematic universe"" of sorts, why not just go all the way and spare us this grief.To conclude, there is no easy way to judge Higurashi Sotsu on its own merits. One mustn’t forget that even the original Higurashi has been rereleased several times with several different new arcs penned by different authors and Ryukishi himself, all of varying quality, none matching the original 8 arcs in quality, so in that sense, Gou/Sotsu excel marvelously on that merit alone. BUT, as I had stressed so many times before, it comes at a cost of diluting the original message and spirit of Higurashi in line with connecting it to the greater WTC Series, of which includes an unfinished product. It is both incredibly frustrating and charming at the same time. A myriad of oxymorons in a sealed box. You will never know what you’re gonna get, and the truth is always concealed. All inside a cold uncaring catbox.Now everyone, join me in praying for Ryukishi to stop giving excuses and continue writing the rest of Ciconia.1/10The one represents DAIICHI NO COURSE. audience and hates them.

I love Higurashi, but admittedly the original adaptation has aged poorly. I always wanted to see one of my favorite stories remade. And now that it finally has gotten a reboot, I wish it hadn\'t been.Over a decade after the original anime aired, they have resurrected the franchise for no reason other than profit. Gou was purposefully mismarketed as a remake to attract curious new viewers—then it rebranded itself as a sequel to get the old fandom\'s attention. Occasionally it had scary moments, but it never...proved why it should exist. Sotsu is supposedly the ""answer arcs"" but it is 90% reused footage with slight alterations.These reboots focus specifically on Rika and Satoko. Rika wants to leave Hinamizawa and go to a prestigious high school. Satoko dreams of staying in Hinamizawa forever, but she will not let Rika leave. What ensues is endless torture porn. With the help of an enigmatic spirit, Satoko gains the same looping ability as Rika. Every time they enter a new loop, a comically evil version of Satoko makes Rika suffer as much as possible. The end goal is for her to give up her dreams of escaping. That\'s it. That\'s your 39 episodes in a nutshell. I could end the review here, but we need to discuss what turned this from a lukewarm spin-off to the worst thing that has ever happened to When They Cry.Higurashi\'s first two seasons were a nicely completed story. There\'s no reason to watch Gou. I only finished it because I wanted to see what would happen to my favorite characters. Sotsu had the same problem, and it failed to justify its existence. Supposedly, these anime are the bridge between this series and Umineko, but it would be less exhausting to read a Wikipedia summary. There\'s a common argument that this show can\'t possibly be crap because Ryukishi07, the original visual novel author, co-wrote the show\'s script! That\'s a pretty awful excuse; I shouldn\'t have to explain why, but I will. Writers mess up from time to time. Sometimes they lose their spark altogether. Have you ever heard of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? George Lucas co-wrote the script, and it ended up being the worst received film in the franchise.There\'s nothing new here; Keichi, Rena, Mion, and Shion have the same character arcs, except their personalities are stripped to outlines of their former selves. In terms of character development, do you remember Satoko\'s abusive uncle? Well, they gave him a redemption arc! Great work, guys. The only thing that distinguishes this as a sequel is Satoko\'s intervention. She injects various friendly faces with Hinamizawa Syndrome, the virus that causes psychosis. There\'s no deeper meaning for why the loveable cast of maniacs loses their grip on reality—wacky old Satoko pulls the strings. Water down themes from the original to act as set dressing; cycles of abuse, cultural preservation, evil government, harmful traditions, etcetera. The new theme is a shallow \'good versus bad\' conflict. No nuance, Rika is the good guy because she wants to save everyone. Satoko is the big bad because she will kill anyone to keep Rika from escaping. Satoko turns from an abuse victim to faking getting abused to manipulate her friends. This sharp turn into foul territory makes me question the sincerity of the anti-child abuse messages in the original. Even with a stellar presentation, this would\'ve still been an unengaging turd, but that\'s not good either.The directing deserves its fair share of criticism too. Higurashi has always used tonal shifts to its advantage; half of the show is upbeat slice-of-life with family-friendly comedy. At the drop of a hat, it could turn sinister—Rena curses Keichi under her breath, then returns to her happy-go-lucky self. The reboots utilize this same technique to build tension, except WAY too much. It\'s cool to see Satoko go berserk after two whole seasons of her being the sane one. But we get it. She\'s bloodthirsty, evil, and manipulative. You don\'t need to beat us over the head with it every two seconds. At least Satoko\'s voice actress is trying, and that\'s all I\'ll say. I don\'t object to using violence in a horror anime. In Gou and Sotsu, I frequently wondered why the gore was there, just as I questioned why the rest of the show was there. Why use so much violence when Higurashi\'s strength was creating tension and shock without it? Sure, it has always had its fair share of violence, but they used it sparingly. Gou and Sotsu are filled to the brim with serial killers, stranglings, bloody knives, shootings, and immolations. In Gou, they censored it. Sotsu uncensored much of the carnage. I\'d say it\'s better to watch it as a slasher thriller, but it gets trite quickly. You can only watch so many crazy people go on murderous rampages before it gets mind-numbingly banal.I love Higurashi because no matter how many times I watch it, I notice new details. It foreshadows its twists; you can predict they\'re coming, but rewatching it will feel all the more rewarding. Sotsu and Gou are not like this. Their narratives are a means to get to shocking scenes. They never considered if the twists would linger with the audience. The most foreshadowing in both seasons is in the opening credits. Both seasons have dubstep theme songs that do not fit the show at all. The new art style doesn\'t work either. Sure, Studio Deen\'s adaptation left a lot to be desired, but it was an artistic representation of the mundane cute slice of life contrasted with violence for shock factor. They could\'ve achieved the same effect with an art style similar to the visual novel remakes. Instead, they went with something generic. The use of visual effects, like CGI flames, was distractingly cheap.Higurashi Sotsu could\'ve been a two-hour movie—cut out the recaps, all that\'s left is Satoko screaming and people going crazy. It is a grossly mismarketed and unwatchable sequel. Unless you have seen every season of Higurashi (16+ hours) and read the Umineko no Naku Koro ni novels (110+ hours), do not bother watching these. The final arc of Gou set up an intriguing premise, but Sotsu never had a payoff. Even diehard When They Cry fans will be disappointed with the direction it takes. If you must see how it ends, start from episode 14 of Sotsu. It becomes Dragon Ball, equipped with neon color battles, super strength, and fighting that\'d better suit a kids cartoon if you removed all the blood splatters.Gou and Sotsu regurgitate as much of the imagery we expect from Higurashi as possible. It successfully drew the attention of long-time fans, only to waste our time on an absolutely meaningless sequel. The few effectively staged gory scares provide passing entertainment, but the rest is bland and tedious. The brief burst of spontaneous insanity in the final episode of Sotsu serves as the last gasp of air for this decaying, mutilated corpse of a franchise. Yet I doubt we\'ve seen the last of When They Cry. proved why it should exist. Sotsu is supposedly the ""answer arcs"" but it is 90% reused footage with slight alterations.These reboots focus specifically on Rika and Satoko. Rika wants to leave Hinamizawa and go to a prestigious high school. Satoko dreams of staying in Hinamizawa forever, but she will not let Rika leave. What ensues is endless torture porn. With the help of an enigmatic spirit, Satoko gains the same looping ability as Rika. Every time they enter a new loop, a comically evil version of Satoko makes Rika suffer as much as possible. The end goal is for her to give up her dreams of escaping. That\'s it. That\'s your 39 episodes in a nutshell. I could end the review here, but we need to discuss what turned this from a lukewarm spin-off to the worst thing that has ever happened to When They Cry.Higurashi\'s first two seasons were a nicely completed story. There\'s no reason to watch Gou. I only finished it because I wanted to see what would happen to my favorite characters. Sotsu had the same problem, and it failed to justify its existence. Supposedly, these anime are the bridge between this series and Umineko, but it would be less exhausting to read a Wikipedia summary. There\'s a common argument that this show can\'t possibly be crap because Ryukishi07, the original visual novel author, co-wrote the show\'s script! That\'s a pretty awful excuse; I shouldn\'t have to explain why, but I will. Writers mess up from time to time. Sometimes they lose their spark altogether. Have you ever heard of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? George Lucas co-wrote the script, and it ended up being the worst received film in the franchise.There\'s nothing new here; Keichi, Rena, Mion, and Shion have the same character arcs, except their personalities are stripped to outlines of their former selves. In terms of character development, do you remember Satoko\'s abusive uncle? Well, they gave him a redemption arc! Great work, guys. The only thing that distinguishes this as a sequel is Satoko\'s intervention. She injects various friendly faces with Hinamizawa Syndrome, the virus that causes psychosis. There\'s no deeper meaning for why the loveable cast of maniacs loses their grip on reality—wacky old Satoko pulls the strings. Water down themes from the original to act as set dressing; cycles of abuse, cultural preservation, evil government, harmful traditions, etcetera. The new theme is a shallow \'good versus bad\' conflict. No nuance, Rika is the good guy because she wants to save everyone. Satoko is the big bad because she will kill anyone to keep Rika from escaping. Satoko turns from an abuse victim to faking getting abused to manipulate her friends. This sharp turn into foul territory makes me question the sincerity of the anti-child abuse messages in the original. Even with a stellar presentation, this would\'ve still been an unengaging turd, but that\'s not good either.The directing deserves its fair share of criticism too. Higurashi has always used tonal shifts to its advantage; half of the show is upbeat slice-of-life with family-friendly comedy. At the drop of a hat, it could turn sinister—Rena curses Keichi under her breath, then returns to her happy-go-lucky self. The reboots utilize this same technique to build tension, except WAY too much. It\'s cool to see Satoko go berserk after two whole seasons of her being the sane one. But we get it.

Yet I doubt we\'ve seen the last of When They Cry.', '*Just in case but this review contains spoilers for Higurashi Gou*I have watched a lot of terrible anime, tv shows, and movies in my life, and I can confidently say that Higurashi SotsuGou is not just the worst written time travel series, but the worst written story overall that I have ever seen. It is not because it\'s the most boring anime out there, it\'s not because it\'s just some generic unoriginal copycat, but because of how many layers of fuck ups there are. This show feels like a parody of terrible fanfictions written by authors who have zero understanding of the original works with...how consistently it messes up every single aspect of the story, and I wouldn\'t have believed that the script for this show was written by the original author had he not say it himself in various interviews.Story:Like the original Higurashi series, the new Higurashi series is separated into Question Arcs and Answer Arcs. However, unlike the original Higurashi and the author\'s other visual novel series, it seems that this time around he completely forgot the purpose of this unique narrative structure and how it is supposed to be used. As the Answer Arc to Gou, Sotsu spent 13 out of 15 episodes recapping the majority of Gou that answers nothing that we don\'t already know in Gou. In the first place, there were no mysteries set up in Gou to be answered and Sotsu ends up being a meandering chore that has no reason to exist at all.SotsuGou completely misses the main theme and message of its original series. Old viewers might remember but ""Miracle"" is a prominent concept in the original series that is supposed to be something that you have to achieve for yourself. Remember when the main lesson that Rika learned in the original century-long loops is that you can\'t just wait forever for a miracle to happen and you have to seize the miracle yourself? Don\'t feel bad if you don\'t because Rika certainly doesn\'t and neither does the writer. Miracle is now something that comes to you even if you do nothing and Rika is rewarded for giving up after doing absolutely nothing. Remember when Rika created the miracle that allowed her to escape the loops by learning to trust and rely on her friends? Said friends are now reduced to pointless incompetence that only exists to hinder Rika and turned into mindless murder puppets from the virus which, like everything else, works completely differently than how it did in the original.The writer mentioned that he wrote this series so both new and old viewers can enjoy and experience the story but the end product is an abomination that makes no sense to new viewers and is an insult to old viewers. SotsuGou tries to be a pseudo-remake by repeating the same arcs and key moments in the original and changing the ending of each arc, perhaps to mind blow and surprise old viewers while letting new viewers experience them. Except no one is surprised anymore after the first arc and what new viewers experience is a cheap knockoff of the original that completely misses what makes them good. Not to mention that there are seemingly important plot points that are actually just pointless references to the author\'s other series and it doesn\'t actually go anywhere. Also, the entire story bends backward to recreate the original arcs but it makes zero sense under the new context and characters often act nonsensically to recreate specific scenes.I am not going to spoil it but the ending of Sotsu managed to surpass even my lowest of low expectations and they actually ended it the worst way possible.Character:Pretty much every single character gets butchered and gets turned parodies of themselves and they never act in character. Like I mentioned in the Story section, Rika completely forgets her main lesson and most of what she learned in the original series. She does the absolute minimum to escape her predicament then gets surprised when nothing changes. I can confidently make the claim that she is the most incompetent looper in existence and no one else even comes close.As seen in Gou, Satoko remains to be the most baffling villain whose motive and plan make absolutely no sense. She seemingly suddenly stops caring about all her other friends and her beloved brother (yes she has a brother) and is completely nonchalant about their deaths and suffering. She chose to experience a century of deaths and suffering rather than studying Algebra 1 (yes she is dumber than a high schooler as a 100-year-old) even before they try to cop out and make her seem less of a sociopath. The best part is, her plans got ruined because she gets a panic attack from a completely harmless prank. To her, getting paint on her face is more traumatic than 100 years of watching her friends get mutilated and killed over and over again.Outside of the regular character assassinations that everyone gets, Mion gets a special mention for having her decimation be acknowledged directly in the show. The author clearly knows that he fucked up the character and it wasn\'t something that he just forgot. He went ahead anyway because no one is safe in Sotsu.Art:I personally like the art style but the animation is pretty lacking. The choreography is some of the worst I have seen in anime (outside of the first episode of Higurashi Gou) but it\'s passable for the most part.Sound:Props to the voice actors for being able to sound almost exactly the same as they did a decade ago and the soundtracks are actually pretty decent.Enjoyment:As terrible as this series has been, I can\'t say that it hasn\'t been enjoyable in the slightest. I do believe that this series is one of a kind and there is enjoyment in seeing just how incoherent and baffling bad the writing is. how consistently it messes up every single aspect of the story, and I wouldn\'t have believed that the script for this show was written by the original author had he not say it himself in various interviews.Story:Like the original Higurashi series, the new Higurashi series is separated into Question Arcs and Answer Arcs.

I\'ll write a review for Gou shortly after writing this one, but I will say, when I finished Higurashi Gou, I at least felt that there were...some very interesting ideas at play. I\'m sorry to say that I felt the complete opposite as I watched through Sotsu.First of all, the animation this season was less than subpar. Much of it was reused, and any of it that wasn\'t reused was fairly ugly and far too saturated to look at. Many animation choices were questionable as well, namely the incredulous amounts of blood during kill scenes. Normally this wouldn\'t be a big deal, especially for action shows with shounen pacing, like Jojo, but here it\'s just a hindrance. Blood gets spattered to such a degree that rather than being grossed out, scared, or horrified by a scene, I end up laughing in disbelief. In other words, this anime no longer classifies as part of the ""horror"" genre in my book.Second, this anime is just downright boring. In Gou, the first half of the season consisted of a ""retelling"" of the arcs that happened in the first season of the original Deen series, but with a good number of changes to create a new mystery. In Sotsu however, we actually have to sit through the same exact arcs AGAIN, but through a different character\'s perspective. Unfortunately, the amount of changes we see in these 13 long episodes could\'ve been summed up in only 2 short episodes. Believe me when I say, sitting through these episodes is more tedious than sitting through Haruhi Suzumiya\'s ""Endless Eight"". And let me remind you that this season was only 15 episodes. If you want to watch this season, be prepared for 13 episodes of waiting for a change of pace. Furthermore, the payoff that you get from the last 2 episodes is miniscule in comparison to the conclusion of the original series.The last two episodes, without spoiling anything, could be summed up pretty easily. If I could describe it in one sentence, it would be along the lines of, ""Two children have a badly animated shounen battle while two other children fight over who\'s going to give up first"". Figuring out which pair of children is which will be the hard part if you\'re watching this for the first time, but I promise you that it\'s one of the most boring conclusions I\'ve ever seen for a long running series like Higurashi.Anyway, after sitting through this dumpster fire, I can avidly say that it was a waste of my time. I think I\'m going to give up on any future ""When They Cry"" adaptations and just start reading the VNs. I hear they\'re pretty good. some very interesting ideas at play. I\'m sorry to say that I felt the complete opposite as I watched through Sotsu.First of all, the animation this season was less than subpar.

I think I\'m going to give up on any future ""When They Cry"" adaptations and just start reading the VNs. I hear they\'re pretty good.', 'I loved the original Higurashi anime and VN, so I was extremely excited when they announced a new anime in the franchise. I didn\'t care if it was a remake of the original or a new story arc like Higurashi Outbreak. I would have even been fine with a lighthearted comedy spinoff similar to episodes 1 and 5 of Higurashi Rei. Instead what we got was a ""sequel"" that straight-up mocks the original story and performs a complete character assassination on many of its beloved characters.I\'ll give a spoiler warning here, but since this anime is so irredeemably bad that nobody should watch it, I...don\'t think it\'ll matter.What baffles me is that Higurashi Sotsu points out its own story flaws through character dialogue. When Hanyuu cries, ""Please stop! Why are you making Satoko do these awful things?"", that is the exact thing that goes through the audience\'s mind while watching this show. Satoko is one of the most sympathetic characters from the original Higurashi. She\'s a victim of domestic abuse and bullying. Her brother has disappeared and she has panic attacks. But despite all that she puts on a brave face most of the time and plays with her friends like nothing\'s wrong. It\'s hard to make a character as selfless and mistreated as her the bad guy, but that\'s exactly what the idiots behind this anime decided to do. Meanwhile her uncle Teppei, the objectively most despicable character from the original gets a redemption arc that nobody asked for. It\'s sickening how they try to make us sympathize with a literal child abuser while making his victim the bad guy. Talk about tasteless and contrived.Another thing that sucks about this show is how boring and repetitive it is. After you find out Satoko is the villain, which on its own is likely the single dumbest Shyamalan-esque plot twist I\'ve seen in any media, there is no mystery or suspense. They just replay clips of Rika and her friends getting murdered over and over again that we already saw during the first season. Only this time it cuts to Satoko with an evil smile. Speaking of which, here\'s a fun drinking game: take a shot every time Satoko pretends to be sad or upset in front of the other characters, and then five seconds later flashing a psychotic smile to the camera. It gets really obnoxious really fast. We get it, she\'s the bad guy. Rubbing it in our faces doesn\'t make it any less dumb.Really the only new information we get in this season is how exactly Satoko got access to a gun, the virus and the knowledge how to mess with Rika. But since it\'s still so hard to accept the level of stupidity required to make Satoko the villain, all of these scenes are just boring and meaningless. We cannot relate to her motivations at all, so watching her elaborate planning is just tedious.I mentioned earlier how the characters themselves point out how stupid the story and character motivations are. The most insulting example of this comes in the last couple episodes where nothing happens except for Rika and Satoko fighting non-stop. Rika points out that it\'s crazy how Satoko\'s whole motivation behind killing her friends over and over again is basically that ""she hates studying"". And yeah, that\'s very much what it all boils down to. 39 episodes of senseless murder and betrayal, and it\'s all because Satoko didn\'t like studying and wanted to stop Rika from going into a prestigious school where Satoko herself couldn\'t keep up.So yeah, Satoko wants to stop Rika from going to a different school and basically uses timelooping in order to bully her into staying in Hinamizawa. This is the main problem that sums up why nothing about this anime is even remotely enjoyable. The villain is a previously likable character who turned evil for the pettiest reason. How is it entertaining or interesting to watch a character kill her own friends she loved and cherished, just because she has attachment issues? Also, whatever happened to Satoko seeing Keiichi as her surrogate older brother? Or how about Shion as her protective older sister? Those relationships are barely even touched as Satoko is just uncharacteristically obsessed with Rika now. I get that they\'re best friends, but best friends don\'t treat each other this way.Furthermore, it\'s also weird how Rika wants to leave Hinamizawa so bad. You\'d think that she\'d want to stay with her trusted friends who helped her defeat Takano. In the original series, Rika is constantly referring to worlds without Keiichi ""hopeless"", so it\'s out of character for her to just leave and forget about him.Anyway, Satoko tries to justify her actions by pointing out that Rika didn\'t do enough to support her when she struggled at the prestigious school. Not only is this still a petty reason to hold a grudge, it\'s also objectively false. There were many moments when Rika offered help, but Satoko simply refused it and kept insisting that she\'ll always suck at studying. You\'d think that Satoko would use her timelooping skills to overcome her educational obstacles instead of planning how to creatively murder her friends, but I digress.And to be fair, Rika very uncharacteristically just forgot about Satoko soon enough and just started hanging out with her new snobby friends. That\'s more evidence of character-assassination on her part. She would never just leave her struggling friend alone that easily.Speaking of leaving friends alone, it\'s weird how Keiichi, Rena and Mion get basically forgotten when Rika and Satoko went to the school. You\'d think that they would stay in touch more after all they\'ve been through together. But they\'re like ""oh, you\'re going to a different school? Cool, I guess I\'ll see you around"". No teary farewells or anything. And when the gang does reunite it doesn\'t have any kind of emotionally satisfying payoff. It\'s like ""hey remember when our friendship and teamwork ended a 100-year timeloop of constant death? That was cool"". All the relationships in this anime are so soulless.The new Higurashi is not scary, interesting or even ""so bad it\'s good"". It\'s not a good mystery because the biggest twist is complete nonsense. It\'s not a good drama because the characters are awful for no good reason. It\'s not for newcomers, because it expects you to have seen the original. It\'s not for fans because it ruins previously lovable characters (namely Satoko and Rika), redeems the worst possible character (Teppei), and sidelines other fan favorites (Rena, Mion, Keiichi). It\'s annoying and frustrating to watch characters we\'ve seen pull through impossible odds together being so cold to each other for no good reason. Avoid this terrible show at all costs. don\'t think it\'ll matter.What baffles me is that Higurashi Sotsu points out its own story flaws through character dialogue. When Hanyuu cries, ""Please stop!

This is the main problem that sums up why nothing about this anime is even remotely enjoyable. The villain is a previously likable character who turned evil for the pettiest reason. How is it entertaining or interesting to watch a character kill her own friends she loved and cherished, just because she has attachment issues? Also, whatever happened to Satoko seeing Keiichi as her surrogate older brother? Or how about Shion as her protective older sister? Those relationships are barely even touched as Satoko is just uncharacteristically obsessed with Rika now. I get that they\'re best friends, but best friends don\'t treat each other this way.Furthermore, it\'s also weird how Rika wants to leave Hinamizawa so bad. You\'d think that she\'d want to stay with her trusted friends who helped her defeat Takano. In the original series, Rika is constantly referring to worlds without Keiichi ""hopeless"", so it\'s out of character for her to just leave and forget about him.Anyway, Satoko tries to justify her actions by pointing out that Rika didn\'t do enough to support her when she struggled at the prestigious school. Not only is this still a petty reason to hold a grudge, it\'s also objectively false. There were many moments when Rika offered help, but Satoko simply refused it and kept insisting that she\'ll always suck at studying. You\'d think that Satoko would use her timelooping skills to overcome her educational obstacles instead of planning how to creatively murder her friends, but I digress.And to be fair, Rika very uncharacteristically just forgot about Satoko soon enough and just started hanging out with her new snobby friends. That\'s more evidence of character-assassination on her part. She would never just leave her struggling friend alone that easily.Speaking of leaving friends alone, it\'s weird how Keiichi, Rena and Mion get basically forgotten when Rika and Satoko went to the school. You\'d think that they would stay in touch more after all they\'ve been through together. But they\'re like ""oh, you\'re going to a different school? Cool, I guess I\'ll see you around"". No teary farewells or anything. And when the gang does reunite it doesn\'t have any kind of emotionally satisfying payoff. It\'s like ""hey remember when our friendship and teamwork ended a 100-year timeloop of constant death? That was cool"". All the relationships in this anime are so soulless.The new Higurashi is not scary, interesting or even ""so bad it\'s good"". It\'s not a good mystery because the biggest twist is complete nonsense. It\'s not a good drama because the characters are awful for no good reason. It\'s not for newcomers, because it expects you to have seen the original. It\'s not for fans because it ruins previously lovable characters (namely Satoko and Rika), redeems the worst possible character (Teppei), and sidelines other fan favorites (Rena, Mion, Keiichi). It\'s annoying and frustrating to watch characters we\'ve seen pull through impossible odds together being so cold to each other for no good reason. Avoid this terrible show at all costs.', 'I tend not to write reviews, and yet here I am again writing a review for the second season of the Higurashi reboot. I don\'t even know where to begin anymore. At first I was just frustrated at many components of Gou and Sotsu, but now I\'m just utterly defeated. I haven\'t even seen the final episode yet as of this review, but seeing as how completely and thoroughly Sotsu has destroyed the legacy of Higurashi, I don\'t feel like waiting another week only to voice the same opinions. Before this review turns into an incoherent rant, let me attempt to try and bring some...order to my thoughts.Im only gonna cover the characters and mix in criticisms of parts of the story, otherwise there will just be far too much to say. The only conclusion I have is that Higurashi Sotsu is an excellent character assassination of figures from both Higurashi and Umineko, almost as if it was intentional. I\'ll try to briefly cover the biggest offenses below:Featherine (or Eua or whatever her name was in the anime) is The Witch of Theatergoing, Drama and Spectating. Out of the countless stories she has witnessed and manipulated, for whatever reason she acts like Satoko\'s little cat and mouse game is some sort of high art and among the best of them all, which really shatters her image as a refined and cultured being who has seen all of history yet still looks for new entertainment. To add to the destruction of her image, she laughs patronizingly nearly every time she is on screen, in a way she would likely chide her servants for doing. The writers use her to explain the concepts that might be a little too complex to the viewer instead of letting the not so subtle themes be shown rather than told to the viewer, and in doing so they dumb her down as well.Anyway, next is Satoko. Satoko...Yeah. 13 of the 15 episodes of this season are essentially recap episodes of the Gou season before it ever actually returns to the cliffhanger they left off with. The only difference is that they are instead told from Satoko\'s perspective, except instead of teaching the viewer anything, it is overexplaining a plot element that was never strong enough to carry the show. Satoko\'s role in all the new crimes is not news to the viewer by this season. So instead of revealing any new information like the typical Answer arc of an 07th work would do, Sotsu shows us the completely unsympathetic efforts of Satoko as she crafts plans and carries out cruel torture of her closest friends, all because, and I\'m quoting Satoko herself here, ""I hate studying"". If you got to this season you know the whole Saint Lucia\'s ordeal, but yeah, she is willing to destroy the lives of her friends and does so sadistically because Satoko is now the cute little fanservice loli yandere workhorse that is supposed to justify this anime existing and carry the plot.The last character I\'ll bother discussing is Rika. Perhaps this criticism is too harsh, but given that she is someone who has hundreds of years of life experience and sagely wisdom, and has solved countless crimes in Hinamizawa (although she rarely lived through them), it takes her two seasons to figure out who the killer is, and even then its not through her own deduction but because of a poorly written plot convenience. This is part of the biggest problem I would say this season had; the complete lack of any payoff.There\'s absolutely no sense of triumph or excitement when Rika reaches the truth, as there is when the protagonist of any mystery work finally solves the mystery. Nothing new happens until the 14th episode of the season, and there\'s only 15 in total. But rather than redeeming any of the problems or issues, episode 14 is the murder weapon that finally kills the Higurashi franchise. Even among the people who have been enjoying this season, I have been hearing wtfs and comments about dissatisfaction. It doesn\'t even feel like Higurashi anymore. Without spoiling anything, all the tropes of a shounen anime are thrown in, and a dragon ball style battle ensues spanning multiple quickly cut fragments with tons of determined anime screaming, unnecessary loli gore porn,  flying through the sky and battling with nonsensical energy auras... I don\'t even know what to say. The final fight makes no sense anyway, as the anime has previously said that if Satoko dies before Rika it basically nullifies her power, but now they act as if the only way to kill a looper is with the specific weapon Rika was told about. The anime is clearly aware of both of these statements, as Satoko is always careful to die after Rika, and both of them battle over control over the weapon, but it somehow overlooks the fact that Rika doesn\'t even need the weapon to kill Satoko, not to mention the fact that Satoko doesnt want to kill Rika permanently but still tries to kill her with the looper killing weapon anyway.Sotsu has done everything wrong, both as a Higurashi successor and as a story in general. It feels the need to show every single detail of Satoko\'s plots, rather than trust the audience to understand that she is masterminding the plots. The motivation of the main antagonist, who is the main focus of the season, is not only remarkably shallow, but completely unsympathetic and really takes you out of the story, as it is in no way believable. The constant debriefing sessions Satoko has with Featherine are also just another way of padding runtime, recycling plots, and giving exposition or explaining how characters are feeling instead of actually having any feeling at all.Higurashi Sotsu is not horror, its not mystery, its not suspenseful. It isn\'t really Higurashi at all, and if you watch this season I\'m sure you\'ll agree by the end too. But even if you stop comparing Sotsu to the original Higurashi, you\'re left with nothing really. The show takes too many leniencies with explanations that can only come from the original to be considered a standalone. But if we ignore this and consider only the substance in front of us, the story Sotsu tries to tell is still just a long, drawn out attempt to make a lackluster story and unremarkable writing into something that resembles a coherent one, and sacrifices everything that could otherwise make it enjoyable along the way.Why have you done this to us Ryukishi? order to my thoughts.Im only gonna cover the characters and mix in criticisms of parts of the story, otherwise there will just be far too much to say.

This comes from a anime enthusiast that has held the first two seasons, released in 2006 and 2007, as their favorite anime of all time.If in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou, Satoko character development and motifs have been butchered when compared with the first two seasons, in terms of ""gore"", in the first episodes, it could be somewhat compared to the first season: Various stories independent from each other, that end up on someone going mad.Now, what brings Higurashi no Naku Koro ni...Sotsu to be so bad? Well, even though it was entertaining in terms of ""slashing"" the story is significant worse when compared with the somewhat similar 2nd season, regarding the first episodes. However, the story only catches up to the plot twist stablished on the previous season in the last 2 episodes...and oh boy it is nonsensical.Without going into major spoilers, the anime turns into Dragon Ball-esque fights, with people flying around and jumping through time without any explanation behind of how this is happening...it completely disregards the nonsensical laws of the world that have been stablished in Gou and Sotsu.In conclusion, should you watch Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu? Has a fan of Higurashi, absolutely not. As someone who just wants to watch a slasher and make fun of an anime that has an awful story, reaching the likes of ""Ousama Game The Animation"", absolutely yes Sotsu to be so bad?

Just some scenes about Satoko and how she got a gun. We also get tiny information about Eua\'s character, but nothing really relevant.13 episodes after comes...to the resolution of the main conflict in just 2 episodes and were the biggest disappointment. Higurashi was an anime about mystery and thriller, but the ""final battle"" is a ""shounen final battle"". 15 episodes for nothing. they just can put the last 2 episodes in Gou and we got almost the same anime and save money.I was expecting some mind games between Rika and Satoko. Ultimate disappoint.In other topics, the animation and sound are decent, but even the most outstanding production can\'t save this trash. to the resolution of the main conflict in just 2 episodes and were the biggest disappointment.

Ultimate disappoint.In other topics, the animation and sound are decent, but even the most outstanding production can\'t save this trash.', 'There were two things that made the original Higurashi so good: Mystery and Despair. The constant confusion and anxiety formed by each loop were strangely delightful to experience and it constantly kept you engaged, wondering how is this connected to this, why is this happening, etc. The second part is the despair, the violence, the suffering, the dark stuff some of us enjoy a lot. It wasn\'t only the gruesome gore and deaths themselves, some of the events that aren\'t bloody are terrifying as well, like one of the arcs where satoko is the last one alive in Hinamizawa after the ""gas"" eruption, who is...forced to deal with that reality right after watching a murderous Keichi fall to his death. It\'s so horrifying and it\'s so good. Yet Higurashi isn\'t just a gorefest or a sadist\'s generic entertainment, because throughout it\'s entire runtime you are under the impression that these horrible things are happening for a reason and the mystery of it all gives the story its substance.Now let\'s look at the new Higurashi, I think it\'s fair to judge both Gou and Sotsu together since they\'re like two parts of the same story. As much as my score doesn\'t imply the following: I found Gou to be entertaining enough. Granted it wasn\'t as good as the original but the same sense of mystery and despair was there, and I didn\'t mind the big twist at the end and Rika\'s and Satoko\'s story in the academy. Yet unlike the original Higurashi, the more episodes that passed the harder and harder it was to go along with the nonsensical clusterfuck this show had become.Granted, the original Higurashi also had some hard to believe elements like the virus, Rika being a carrier, demons from the past, the looping mechanic itself and the sea of fragments. Yet all of these are tastefully implemented in the story and they just barely manage to pass your bullshit radar. Gou is fine as well but shit gets too nonsensical with Sotsu.Suddenly there\'s another deity, both deities have powers which are unexplained, Satoko has special looping abilities, there is a looper killing swords, satoko fights herself in the sea of fragments and kills herself, you have no idea if this is metaphorical to her killing her old personality or literally she killed another version of herself. The grand finale of episode 14 which made me drop the show has satoko and Rika going Goku and flying around, fighting each other.What made Higurashi so horrifying was that mostly everything that happened made sense, there were substantive reasons for the horrific things the characters are going through. Yet the main reason in Gou and Sotsu is that there\'s a new deity and she\'s bored so she just makes Satoko torture Rika. Not only does this make everything seem pointless and arbitrary, it\'s also boring because the mystery is gone. Right from the moment Satoko pulls out her gun on Rika the mystery pretty much dies down. Sotsu is just a recap that we didn\'t need that barely adds anything to the story. We just sit and watch everything we already know happened play out, it\'s boring and a lazy way to fill runtime. Yet we sit through it because we want to know how it\'s gonna play out, what will Rika do when she figures it out, and well she just goes DBZ super power mode and fights Satoko like I\'m watching a parody of Higurashi.The suffering is pointless, the recap is pointless, this new Higurashi is pointless and it taints the original story so much that it\'s insulting. Whether you\'re a new or an old fan, stay away from this one. forced to deal with that reality right after watching a murderous Keichi fall to his death. It\'s so horrifying and it\'s so good.

I guess ruining higurashi was worth it then. Jesus christ.Do not ever watch this. It's up there with Mayoiga as one of the worst anime I've ever watched.

It started out good, altough a little repetitive since it was mostly scenes from Gou from another perspective, but the ending was nonsensical and I couldn\'t care less.Art: 7/10The art is great, but just not scary. A big reason why I like the original 2 2006-seasons of Higurashi so much is because of the creepyness the art & animation gives. While the art in the original series were grim & uncanny, Gou & Sotsu\'s art is vivid & colorful. It feels more like a seasonal harem-romcom than a horror/mystery show.But it all looks good. The...animation is nice and everything looks clean, just a shame the creepy vibes are gone.Sound: 10/10Great opening (altough I had to get used to it), great music, great ambience and great voice acting. Stabbing sounds feel like a sharp blade is getting forced into juicy meat repeatidly, screams are bone-chilling and Satoko\'s laugh is still as annoying as we remember. Couldn\'t be better!Character: 6/10This was initially an 8, but the final episode made me drop it by 2 points. Higurashi is a hard show to give personalities a score, since... you know... every loop introduces big impactful personality changes.The reason I dropped it by two points is by how the season ended. Some things happen relationshipwise that doesn\'t make any sense knowing the circumstances.Enjoyment: 6.5/10I had too much fun with the gore but was too bored with the repetitiveness that I\'m juggling between a 6 or a 7 for this. This season is brutal with some kills, and I loved it. But due to the biggest part of the season being scenes and happenings from previous season, it feels a bit like a waste of time.We\'ve already seen the protest against Teppei twice now, no need to show it a third time. This is not how you do an answers arc. The very first season did this much better (looking at you, Yandere-Shion-arc. It was the same timeline in different arcs but 95% of those arcs were different scenes).Overall: 5/10My first review complained about how unnecessary this season is. We already know the answer to previous season\'s mystery: Satoko is behind everything. We got told about that in the very last episode of Gou. This season just breaks down everything Satoko did in a very non-interesting way. Some big-brain moments give you this ""Aha!""-feeling, but it\'s not mind-blowingly ""WTF??!!""-like the original seasons gave.What really annoyed me these last 2 episodes were the introduction of these out-of-nowhere Dragon Ball Z-fights. What the actual fuck?! This is supposed to be a horror-mystery. animation is nice and everything looks clean, just a shame the creepy vibes are gone.Sound: 10/10Great opening (altough I had to get used to it), great music, great ambience and great voice acting.

It makes me sad that anyone who gets into the higurashi storyline watches these two abominations prior to actually seeing what higurashi is really about. You don\'t get a sense of dread and terror from these remakes, despite them literally recreating every single bit from the original with slightly better art, if you could call it that.They also hardly explored the 2nd seasons Arc with Takano, whom was...the main villain all along. The very reason Rika had to suffer so much, but Satako was somehow able to watch 100 years worth of her best friends suffering and we\'re supposed to pretend it was this evil ""witch"" Satako based on how they ended the series, not the real Satako, whom made those heartless decisions. I think the art style delivered in the original gave Higurashi its notoriety. The same studio that did Konosuba as far as I can recall, who also did the original Higurashi, did the series justice. I think they were a perfect fit for the original series. The saddest thing to me was watching the final episode look like a Naruto wannabe remake with Sasuke and Naruto punching each other until their feelings reached one another. We spent the entire series watching remakes of what we already knew for basically this episode alone, episode 15. I still cried at the end because I love these characters and everything that drew me to Higurashi in the first place. I really hated it when Satoko snapped her fingers as if to return to her original self because that in itself broke my heart. I don\'t understand why they took the direction they did with this story, why the main cast (Keichii, Mion, Rena, Shion) cut out of so much of this series just for such pointless recreation and melodrama. If you\'re watching the remakes for the first time maybe it makes sense to you, but for somebody who grew up on the original Higurashi story and fell in love with it, it\'s really hard to say anything positive about the finale of this series. I highly suggest everyone to to watch the original two series and get a real feel for what Higurashi No Naku Koro No is about. the main villain all along.

I highly suggest everyone to to watch the original two series and get a real feel for what Higurashi No Naku Koro No is about.', ""Updated Review:Well, the story is over… I won't update the score of Sotsu because one episode doesn't make one entire season, the flaws remain there. The ending I'm just neutral about, it didn't make me hate it but it didn't blow me away whatsoever. I certainly rather think that the ending of the original series is the real ending, without all the clingy Satoko nonsense. The plot twists were good but then it just became too stupid for my taste. That's just how it is.Original Review:I'm sorry but I'm not even gonna wait until Sotsu is over to complain about this already. I might change...my rating later on the show depending on the ending, but I can already tell you I'm not giving it more than a 5 with the way they are treating viewers as if we have amnesia or something, literally giving us a recap EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of things we already know or have seen. We don't forget these moments, we pay attention to a story where you have to pay attention to details, and if someone forgets, they can rewatch episodes, we don't need the show to give us endless recaps over and over again. Whoever did Gou and Sotsu have to be different people, at least on the matter of pacing. I understand wanting to milk Higurashi, but this is beyond milking, this is STALLING the plot. Literally only like 5 minutes per episode matter only anymore, the rest is just recap of scenes you already saw, as if they are treating the viewers asif they suffer of amnesia or something.Notice how I repeated myself in this review? that's how it feels to be currently watching Sotsu. MY GOD. lolI love Higurashi, but I swear, just like Naruto has a list of filler episodes so people can skip, I BET that fans will edit these Sotsu episodes with only the portions of scenes that are new, and the season will be probably half as long, just with the stuff that matters if you have been paying attention to the story. If no one thought about doing that, then here you go, now that idea has to be done with Sotsu as soon as it's over, so rewatching the show (or people waiting for the show to be over before binge watching it) isn't a pain in the literal arse. my rating later on the show depending on the ending, but I can already tell you I'm not giving it more than a 5 with the way they are treating viewers as if we have amnesia or something, literally giving us a recap EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of things we already know or have seen.

But it’s a “classic” story setting for a mystery anime, as opposed to one that’s “overused.” Higurashi is also impressive when you consider how it blends perfectly a bunch of genres that don’t usually go together. It’s a harem/ horror/ mystery/ drama/ comedy/ psychological anime that even has some slice-of-life. The detail and originality of the Higurashi story is splendid, with puzzling mysteries, exploration of the “curse,” and the way the world resets with each arc. I’d say more, but...I’m avoiding spoilers.Now let’s take a look at the content and how it’s presented in Higurashi. I don’t know of any other anime that does such a good job of combining stories of lighthearted fun and comedy with stories of disturbing violence and suspense. When things are peaceful, I feel like I’m right there with the characters having fun with them. The cute, funny, and weird quirks, reactions, and interactions are highly entertaining. The humor will at least bring a smile to your face. Higurashi‘s presentation of suspense and creepiness is right on-point. The violence is just as horrifying as it should be (and believe me, it’s not over-the-top compared to some of the graphically violent anime out there.) Also, the show knows how to deliver good, interesting drama.In Higurashi‘s first season, thought-provoking themes and motifs are not immediately obvious because of all the gore and insanity. Some are there, though, and they’re fairly powerful. (Still, the second season does better with incorporating meaningful messages and themes.) These include friendship and faith in friends, betrayal, atonement, misunderstandings, cause and effect, young love, obsession, character psychology, and determination.It would be a great understatement to say the seiyuu cast is great; they are basically perfect in this show. I’ll mention some here. Soichiro Hoshi voices male lead Keiichi, and I’m surprised he doesn’t have more roles since his acting was all-around on-point. He played the MC of Gundam Seed, and I know him best as Gino from Code Geass. Satsuki Yunkino plays Mion and Shion Sonozaki; she is probably best known for voicing Kagome in InuYasha and Otae in Gintama. The range of Yukino’s voice from sweet to scary is impressive, as is the volume and power she can put into shouts and laughs. She’s a veteran voice-actress who really gets into her characters.Rena Ryuuguu’s seiyuu is Mai Nakahara, another bright talent, and exceptionally great with playing characters that have a menacing side. She’s been in many anime I haven’t seen, but I know her Luvia in Fairy Tale, Nagisa in Clannad, Watashi in Humanity Has Declined, Mai in Mai-Hime, Yukinoshita’s older sis from Oregairu, and Nanami Yasuri in Katanagatari. The seiyuu of Rika Furude is Yukari Tamura, whose voice is usually adorable and high, but has a great range of pitch/ tone etc. She’s most famous for voicing Suzuha in Steins;Gate and Nanoha in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Other fantastic VAs include Yuu Kobayashi (as Satoshi), Miki Itou (as Miyo Takano), and Hirotaka Shimazawa (as Detective Ooishi).In my opinion, the characters in Higurashi deserve another full 10/10, but many other people consider them difficult to relate to because of the insanity most of them suffer at one point or another. As well, it’s difficult to gather a detailed picture of the characters’ personalities from just one watch of the series; to understand them and love them as much as I do requires re-watching many times and analyzing many behaviors and lines spoken. Because of these potential difficulties, I gave the characters category a 9/10 rather than 10/10.Other than anything mentioned above, the characters in Higurashi are presented and expanded on perfectly. The development and growth of characters is well-paced, spread throughout the episodes. It’s great how you learn a little more about each of the characters in each arc. There is adequate character growth/ maturation within the arcs, but of course, it doesn’t really carry over to the next world. Even if you can’t relate to them too well, I believe you’ll find that Mion, Shion, Satoko, Rika, Keiichi, and all the others are engaging and entertaining characters.It’s getting very difficult to resist writing tons of text about the characters I love, why I love them, and their stories. Anything like that would include spoilers. So I must stop myself nowOh, this isn’t fair. I want to give you examples of so many things I love. Things like favorite character, favorite arc, a quote I like, an enjoyable funny moment or joke, a sad moment that spoke to me, or my favorite scenes of characters going crazy. But almost all of that involves spoilers. Well, maybe not. Let’s see. My favorite character is Shion Sonozaki, and second-favorite is Rika Furude. My favorite arc in season one is “Meakashi-hen,” or “Eye-Opening Chapter.” It runs from episode 16 to 21. Something funny I love is Satoko’s villainous ojou-sama laugh. It’s perfect.The sad, powerful, and crazy moments I want to talk about all give spoilers, though. I did have a quote in mind, but it won’t make any sense to you unless I explain the situation (would mean giving spoilers) or unless you’ve already seen the show/scene. Well, I’ll leave it here anyway. I like this quote because reveals a lot abut Shion’s personality and motivations.

This show must\'ve been either really good or really terrible for this review to exist, wonder which one of those is it? is it?!Bad jokes aside, Higurashi Gou was entertaining, flawed but at least passable. This review is mostly addressed for its 2nd season: -Sotsu- the sequel that ultimately turns this entire franchise into a laughing stock full of nonsense that should never be considered canon.The 2006 version had the infamous Studio DEEN at...the helm, this one has Passione (Interspecies Reviewers). Amazing. For the most part they get the job done if we look past the weirdly revamped character designs and comically bad bloodbath splattering scenes. What\'s not acceptable is blatantly REUSING scenes from the first season that aired earlier this year. This happens constantly throughout Sotsu, and while I understand that not every studio can pull off a Kyoani\'s endless eight, being this cheap is never a good look for obvious reasons.The voice actors are back for their respective roles and they pull them off perfectly even 15 years later. The OPs and EDs (for both seasons) are decent with the ED stills being particularly beautiful. No complaints on that front except for some minor foreshadowing.Now, onto the real juicy part of the review. The characters, their development, the story and the overall reason for this sequel to exist.Let it be known that the Higurashi franchise did not need a sequel. The original 2006 anime was adapted well enough and had a very adequate conclusion with a proper payoff at the end. Yes, the story was completely finished, an HD remake was not all that necessary (as originally advertised) much less a completely new sequel that disregards and trivializes the ordeal that the main cast had to endure in the original.Yes, these whole 24+15 episodes were supposed to be just a remake but I guess that word has a difference meaning for Japan. What we got instead is a completely new sequel that spoils major plot points of the 2006 version by the very 2nd episode of Gou and not happy with that, promises to bridge Higurashi with Umineko, the other \'When They Cry\' series. A very ambitious goal that even if misguiding and seemingly unnecessary at first, still managed to spark curiosity. Just how do they plan to do this? Will the finale be as good as the OG? Does Ryukishi07 (the series\' creator, who also co-wrote the 2021 ver. script) still have it in him?Unfortunately, the answer is no. The following section comprises most of my review and will include heavy spoilers for both the original, and the 2021 version.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The \'When they Cry\' series are visual novels. They come with \'Question\' and \'Answer\' arcs. This is evident in both 2006 and 2021 adaptions with their respective seasons: original / Kai for the former and Gou / Sotsu for the latter.If we think about the original, we have a plot that starts as a nonsensical murder mystery and slowly develops into an amazing story by gradually delivering bits of information to the viewer and ""answering"" all the confusing parts soundly by the end of it. A story centered around an endless cycle of tragedy, mystery, and with a side of gore. Well fleshed characters, excellent villains and a nearly perfect conclusion.For this 2021 version it\'s sadly not the same. It\'s a cheaply made attempt at a sequel that screams cash grab. The story is reduced to a torture porn gorefest with a one note altercation that could be easily resolved, and the way the mystery works is already obvious for old viewers while still proving unsatisfying and extremely confusing for new ones. It really begs the question, especially as you draw near the final episodes: Why does this exist? Not only did it not need to exist because, as previously mentioned, the original had a proper ending, but also because the entire reasoning for the resurgence of this old franchise boils down to one plot conflict:Satoko hates studying.In the original, it took everyone\'s strength to overcome the fate that Rika, the secret main character, was cursed with. In this 2021 version we throw that out of the window and once again return to the year of 1983 in the story. Back to the murders, torture and gore just because Satoko fucking hates studying.In the original, we have a thrilling story of mystery, conflict of interests, legacy, friendship, some comedy, a bit of sci-fi and an overbearing eerie atmosphere surrounding the Hinamizawa village that will keep you guessing until the answers show themselves. Here, Satoko wants Rika for herself (no yuri undertones at least) and will sabotage, torture, kill everything and everyone, friend or foe, to achieve that.That\'s it. The entire conclusion and epilogue of the 2006 story where Rika can finally go to a city academy to study is overturned because in this sequel Satoko (who also joined Rika in that academy, persuaded by her) couldn\'t keep up with her studies and grew jealous of Rika, while also somehow being physically unable to ask Rika for help. Yes, that\'s the main plot point, the crucial problem that caused the massacres to return to Hinamizawa. No conspiracies, no scientist pride, no secret organizations, no myths or nothing. Just good ol\' little Satoko who felt slighted by her best friend, doing what she thinks is the best choice to bring that friend back: Torturing, gouging, mutilating her across several time repeats until Rika finally gets the message across. Not even her own group of friends were safe.I don\'t want to start rambling but at this point things are so stupid that there should be nothing left to say to kick this show down even further, but there is a lot left still. A LOT.So then, let\'s start with the overly abundant gore. In the original, violence only reached extreme levels when the plot called for it, in the climax of each of the multiple mini-arcs. Here, a lot of the mini-arcs aka time loops are compressed. While they would normally last 3 to 4 anime episodes, in some instances in Gou / Sotsu they\'re shortened to fit multiple different time loop conclusions in the span of ONE episode. This means that across one episode we see our lovable cast of main characters, including poor Rika (who in case you are a random reader, has the physical appearance of a 10 year old girl) violently beaten to death, stabbed, having her guts spilled, shot, drowned, etc. MULTIPLE TIMES for NO reason. This is why people say this is fucking torture porn. It\'s too much, it\'s senseless. It doesn\'t affect me but it just serves no purpose.Understandably some arcs needed to be compacted because they only wanted to show how many more times Rika was willing to tolerate her harsh fate, but that is in itself a failure. The beauty of Higurashi was reaching the bloody climax in each arc and learning something in the process each time. A couple more details that allowed you to figure out the who\'s and why\'s. The fact that at some point, 2021 version arcs are mashed together and only her fateful end is shown means that there was NOTHING to show. There was NOTHING we could\'ve learned as the viewer because everything was already known and the loop only had a symbolic purpose.A new entity is also introduced, a plot device called Eua, a Goddess who shares a resemblance with a major Umineko character. She appeared, gave a teenager Satoko time looping powers and conveniently explained to her (and the audience) how everything worked. Satoko then proceeded to literally spend over a hundred years inspecting time fragments to learn every little thing about Rika in order to torture her better back at the village. Hanyuu happened to lose her powers for some reason and randomly reappears in the fragment space whenever the plot calls for it too.The rest of the main cast that isn\'t Rika or Satoko become side characters. They really don\'t do anything. This is a Rika and Satoko anime (who also bear a striking resemblance to two major umineko characters).What\'s left is a story devoid of mystery, full of senseless murders, a childish main villain and absurd superpowers.""Wait... superpowers?"" you may ask - ""did you misspell something?""No, I did not.I never really asked myself if there were sharks in the river where the wataganashi takes place, but there are, and boy trust me that they have been JUMPED. On episode 14th all logic was forsaken and Rika / Satoko decided to fly in the sky while shooting each other with laser beams. These are regular elementary / middle schoolers. There are literally no superpowers they possess outside of endlessly returning to life in case they perish. So why the fuck are they flying in the sky in the real world and tossing fridges and junkyard waste at each other while Satoko screams at the top of her lungs ""I HATE STUDYIIIIINNGGGGG""?You can\'t make this up. This isn\'t even ""it\'s so bad it\'s good"". It\'s legit trash. It\'s one of the worst conclusions to a show I\'ve ever seen.Fast forward to a couple mins later, Rika is punching Satoko with all of her strength for at least 20 times (did not get knocked out) while shouting that she (Rika) will not give up on her (Satoko). They didn\'t really make up but kind of agreed to stay distant. Bitch, she killed you in cold blood for so many loops, is this the best you\'re going to come up with? You STILL want to bring her along to the academy and stay near her? She can kill you whenever she feels bored you better hire some bodyguards or something.Of course, there\'s also Satoko in the middle of all of this. A lovable character equally chased by misfortune and tragedy in the original series reduced to a basic evil Yandere type bitch who no longer acts her age for this stupid sequel. No point delving deeper into this at all. They ruined her character and made her murder her best friend for a pathetic reason.There are many more instances that have a severe lack of logic like:- Satoko not using part of those 100 years to study or cheat in tests and learn all the answers to keep up with Rika, instead deciding to use that time to look for injectable drugs, guns, how to shoot a gun, creative ways to get others to kill Rika, etc.- On the topic of injectable drugs (Lv.5 Hinamizawa syndrome), there\'s no way you can inject Mion while she\'s standing up and she won\'t notice it. Come on show, at least TRY to make sense.- The very convenient arbitrary rules of: Rika not remembering who kills her in the loops (except when she eventually does), or Satoko being able to jump to the same time fragment with Rika ONLY if Rika dies first in the previous fragment (Satoko never died first apparently despite brawling with Rika on episode 14/15 for over 15+ times).- Satoko getting sliced in the neck by the sacred sword and not dying right then and there. It wasn\'t even referenced anymore in the subsequent battles. It didn\'t even matter.- \'Evil\' Satoko personality taking over and then peacing out at the end to leave original Satoko in her default body.- Anything related to Eua / Featherine.- Takano being reduced to a very minimal character, with her character conflict reduced to a non-factor even though Hanyuu is no longer in the mix.and of course last but not least, Satoko never taking the chance to have a serious conversation with Rika at the academy and TALK like a proper human about the dumb problems she had going on. Nah, that\'s cringe. Let\'s just repeatedly kill her and her friends instead.End of spoilers------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, this show failed catastrophically in most aspects. The only thing that is free of criticism is the VA work and most of the OPs / EDs. This will forever be seen as a joke series that failed to bridge Higurashi with Umineko and while it was nice to see the old crew animated again, I wouldn\'t say it was at all worth it.Let Higurashi rest in peace already. Ryukishi07 you HACK. the helm, this one has Passione (Interspecies Reviewers). Amazing. For the most part they get the job done if we look past the weirdly revamped character designs and comically bad bloodbath splattering scenes.

On episode 14th all logic was forsaken and Rika / Satoko decided to fly in the sky while shooting each other with laser beams. These are regular elementary / middle schoolers. There are literally no superpowers they possess outside of endlessly returning to life in case they perish. So why the fuck are they flying in the sky in the real world and tossing fridges and junkyard waste at each other while Satoko screams at the top of her lungs ""I HATE STUDYIIIIINNGGGGG""?You can\'t make this up. This isn\'t even ""it\'s so bad it\'s good"". It\'s legit trash. It\'s one of the worst conclusions to a show I\'ve ever seen.Fast forward to a couple mins later, Rika is punching Satoko with all of her strength for at least 20 times (did not get knocked out) while shouting that she (Rika) will not give up on her (Satoko). They didn\'t really make up but kind of agreed to stay distant. Bitch, she killed you in cold blood for so many loops, is this the best you\'re going to come up with? You STILL want to bring her along to the academy and stay near her? She can kill you whenever she feels bored you better hire some bodyguards or something.Of course, there\'s also Satoko in the middle of all of this. A lovable character equally chased by misfortune and tragedy in the original series reduced to a basic evil Yandere type bitch who no longer acts her age for this stupid sequel. No point delving deeper into this at all. They ruined her character and made her murder her best friend for a pathetic reason.There are many more instances that have a severe lack of logic like:- Satoko not using part of those 100 years to study or cheat in tests and learn all the answers to keep up with Rika, instead deciding to use that time to look for injectable drugs, guns, how to shoot a gun, creative ways to get others to kill Rika, etc.- On the topic of injectable drugs (Lv.5 Hinamizawa syndrome), there\'s no way you can inject Mion while she\'s standing up and she won\'t notice it. Come on show, at least TRY to make sense.- The very convenient arbitrary rules of: Rika not remembering who kills her in the loops (except when she eventually does), or Satoko being able to jump to the same time fragment with Rika ONLY if Rika dies first in the previous fragment (Satoko never died first apparently despite brawling with Rika on episode 14/15 for over 15+ times).- Satoko getting sliced in the neck by the sacred sword and not dying right then and there. It wasn\'t even referenced anymore in the subsequent battles. It didn\'t even matter.- \'Evil\' Satoko personality taking over and then peacing out at the end to leave original Satoko in her default body.- Anything related to Eua / Featherine.- Takano being reduced to a very minimal character, with her character conflict reduced to a non-factor even though Hanyuu is no longer in the mix.and of course last but not least, Satoko never taking the chance to have a serious conversation with Rika at the academy and TALK like a proper human about the dumb problems she had going on. Nah, that\'s cringe. Let\'s just repeatedly kill her and her friends instead.End of spoilers------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, this show failed catastrophically in most aspects. The only thing that is free of criticism is the VA work and most of the OPs / EDs. This will forever be seen as a joke series that failed to bridge Higurashi with Umineko and while it was nice to see the old crew animated again, I wouldn\'t say it was at all worth it.Let Higurashi rest in peace already. Ryukishi07 you HACK.', 'I watched Gou and Sotsu back to back. I enjoyed Gou, so I was excited to see where things would go in Sotsu. But wow, was I ever disappointed.This was not like a typical Higurashi series. It didn\'t evoke those same emotions and overall vibes of the first season. Even though most of Sotsu was a dumpster fire- like mess, I was hoping that by the final episode of Sotsu that things would get a bit better and that we would have a solid ending to this mediocre season. What I got instead was a bunch of unnecessary ""but why tho"" moments which I won\'t...dive into for the sake of spoilers.Would I recommend that you watch this? No. If you\'re looking to get into the Higurashi series, just watch the first season and Kai and call it a day - those two are the best, and Kai ends off on a good note. dive into for the sake of spoilers.Would I recommend that you watch this? No. If you\'re looking to get into the Higurashi series, just watch the first season and Kai and call it a day - those two are the best, and Kai ends off on a good note.', 'So let me start with most obvious point episodes that were relevant\\connected to the ending:Gou Satokowashi till Satoko got to Saiguden, Sotsu\'s 15 after Hanyu defeated Eua. EVERYTHING ELSE was completely pointless(maybe except for explanation about memory leak, that explains why Teppei and Rina are suddenly good). That\'s all, everything else was irrelevant and pointless.Remember Eua saying things like ""You\'ll end up in the world with no Rika"", ""Everyone might get the memories and you\'ll be fucked""(which is even was hinted by Ryukishi a few times)? Remember Satoko killing her ""good"" side(that some people claimed to be ""Just a metaphor for her killing her own...regrets"")? Remember that Takano ratted out Tokyo?Well, forget it all. All what Eua said was just for ""Up the stakes"" reason, it wasn\'t Chehov\'s gun. Satoko didn\'t get any consequences, she\'s just forgiven. There was nothing about her missing that ""good side"". Takano freely walking(just like Okonogi), she\'s not in jail(mass murdering? What is this?), she\'s not dead(she betrayed\\failed Tokyo, remind you).Satoko ended up completely forgiven for all bullshit she\'s done. Yeah, definitely a good choice to wrap 37(24) episodes\' events in just 2 episodes with the most shounen cliche that\'s possible. Doesn\'t feel rushed at all. She didn\'t get any punishment or consequences for all what she\'s done, even more she got rewarded(Satoshi woken up and Teppei is good now). Does it mean that the whole message of SotsuGou is ""Killing and torturing your friends is okay, being dick is okay and you even got your happiness. But fighting back and wanting to live happily is NOT okay, because you\'ll get punished""? DunnoRemember Satoshi and Shion? Yeah lol, me neither, they were irrelevant and got as less screentime as possible, despite them being the dearest\\crucial persons to Satoko. Shion was cutted out just because Rika and Satoko would never go to St. Lucia if she was around(remember that she was studying there? Also if you think it\'s not that bad type of place, just check Utsutsukowashi manga. Or read Umineko and check how it was for Ange). They never bothered explaining why there\'s so little Shion, but it\'s the only explanation I could come up with. Because you know, Ryukishi is never got full idea from the start, so he often evading giving explanation. Like with ""Why doesn\'t Hanyu helped Rika?""(yeah, Hanyu is bad\\selfish, or Hanyu just wanted Rika to be more independent) but there\'s still ""Why Rika never tried to follow TomiTakano herself?""(she could, and she\'ll likely get succeded on one of her tries, or just understood everything after few deaths) which he NEVER explained. There were no hints towards it in VN. Not to mention that he\'s got easily affected by a lot of ideas, and he was planning to really add aliems in Tsumihoroboshi afaik. Also most of you should known how controversial Umineko got after episode 4 iirc. I\'m really scared of what Ciconia will turn intoOriginal ""good"" ending was butchered just for a few vague references to Umineko\\Ciconia and then finished it by Narutotherapy that\'s overly stupid. Was ""PERFECT"" ending worth it? No way. ""Perfect is the enemy of good"". While the original ending was kinda weird in some way, it wasn\'t that stupid. Hanyu is gone, Takano still got punishment(it was implied at least) as well as Okonogi(at least he was arrested), and there was hope for Satoshi to wake up eventually. It was more of a bittersweet type of ending(in some ways Miotsukushi is better).Here we got ""yeah forget all that hope and friendship just for us to stick it in your throat but worse and more bluntly"". Like for real, THIS is the ending you came up with? At least not make it that rushed, you spent a whole 13 episodes for a fucking recaps(mostly. At best it was 60%, at worst around 80%) but you don\'t give a fuck about ending. They were out of ideas and clearly wasn\'t aiming for atmosphere, tension and drama. Yeah, I remember Kawaguchi saying ""We turned it into b-grade splatter where the more gore the funnier"" but them having purpose for doing it in such a shitty way doesn\'t excuse them doing it in shitty wayThe ending was mostly anticlimatic. Satoshi have woken up... What are you waiting for, that\'s all there\'s no interaction, no Shion or Satoko even learning about it. Everyone is happy even bad guys. Oh and here another Umineko\\Ciconia reference with no relevance to plot.Oh, and Featherine got defeated by Hanyu because of FRIENDSHIP POWER!!!! lmao, you couldn\'t do Featherine more dirty than this. Imagine being META creature that unparalleled in everything, yet you got defeated by ""weak fake"" because of friendship power. What a disgrace. Though some Umifans could use ""Aragorn trousers"" type of argument. Like ""We never were told in red that Hanyu is weaker, so her winning against Eua totally make sense, despite Eua just freely doing whatever the fuck she wants for the whole Sotsu and Hanyu doing nothing for the whole SotsuGou""The only good parts were seiyus(VAs), OST and finally good action(last 2 eps of Sotsu) after very cringe and stupid action in any previous episodes. Yeah it was very NOT Higurashi like because of all Naruto\\DBZ style, but it was good action nonetheless. Though I must say, that if you forgot that it\'s Higurashi, the last 2 episodes are very good shounen lolFeels very anti Higurashi. It\'s just ode to abusive relationship, praising evil acts as well as ""you should forgive EVERYONE, and if you\'re sorry you won\'t get ANY punishment"". Yeah, good job R07\\Passione.I would NEVER check anything that Ryukishi have worked on after this(I still like OG Higurashi\\Umineko. He was good writer at some point, but now... not so sure)Oh how could I forget, Higurashi is now a cash cow.

What a greedy assholes', ""After the massive cliffhanger that Higurashi Gou left off on, fans were incredibly anxious to get things resolved in Sotsu. Sadly, Sotsu took 3 months to wrap up something that should have been an extra 4 episodes at most.While I did really like a lot of Sotsu like Satoko’s perspective, so much of it could have been condensed. 70 percent of the content we got during this season was just rehashed from Gou. If you can suffer through the reused footage, Higu Sotsu has some of the best moments of the entire series in my opinion. Episodes 12 and 15 are probably my two...favourite episodes of the entire franchise. Watching Satoko’s gradual descent into darkness and the lengths she’s willing to go to in order to break Rika’s spirit was simultaneously horrifying, yet amazing. I enjoyed seeing Eua and the divine aspects of the Higu series front and centre for once as well. The first few seasons focus heavily on the humans and the virus portion of the lore, but Sotsu gives a lot of time to the mystical and magical elements of Higurashi lore.I think Sotsu has everything that makes Higurashi great. Mystery, dread, pain, magic, murderous lolis, etc., but it just feels inconsistent. There’s episodes that have mainly new content(last 3) and are a blast to watch, and then there’s ones that feel like a chore to sit through because I’ve already seen everything. Then there's episodes like the finale which kind of feel like a slap in the face to OG Higu fans because of the majority of time and money going to a loli fist fight and other plot conveniences. The final episode feels like it just came out of nowhere and left myself and others disappointed.I honestly struggle to understand why they made a full 15 episode season of this instead of just making Gou longer and or just doing what MagiReco season 2 did and making a really short second season. The only explanation I can come up with is BD sales, for which higher episode counts equate to more volumes and profits. It looks like the production committee were having just as hard a time as the fans with saying goodbye to the beloved horror series. Sadly, they didn't leave it on the best note.Because of the repetitiveness of everything, it’s really hard for me to rate Higu Sotsu. On one hand, I did really enjoy watching it and when we got new content it was on par with or better than anything we’d seen before, the DBZ style fight with Satoko and Rika in episode 15 will forever be immortalised. It just happened far too little and far too late in the 15 episodes for me to really rate Sotsu as high as I’d like to. For better or worse, the show does feel like a final conclusion to Higurashi and if you're a fan of the series you should watch it. I could see other Higurashi else-world stories being created later on whether in anime or VN form, but I’d like to think this concludes Rika, Keichi, Shion and crew’s long journey.Higurashi Sotsu gets 7 out of 10. favourite episodes of the entire franchise.

I'm a long time fan of Higurashi since 2006 so my expectations for this story are extremely high. Yet somehow this show not only delivered but surpassed all my realistic expectations and just blew me away. Never before has an anime story had such great buildup and payoff in the end.I was excited getting into Gou with it going down a neat new story direction and expanding upon the Higurashi universe further. Sotsu is a continuation of the saga that Gou set up and revisits a lot of the murders from the previous season from a fresh...new perspective. Even though we have seen these events in some form from the previous season, Sotsu puts fresh new twists and shocking reveals so there is never once a dull moment. And it all feels so gloriously rewarding with the payoff we get in the climax. As a fan over the whole scope of Ryukishi07's works and not just in isolation to Higurashi, this work is near masterful..My only complaint about this anime is that the art an animation are just average and don't do anything that amazing. Still, when the only complaint about the art and animation is that it is standard, I'm really trying to reach when coming up with aspects this anime actually did wrong.The sound and characters are all up to WTC's traditionally high standards for such. The OP and ED were amazing performances and always got me hyped for the show. The music used during the final conflict was chilling and gave me goosebumps.Overall this anime is a rare masterpiece. It has far exceeded all my expectations. 10/10 will watch again. new perspective.

I know MAL and it's marketing makes it SEEM like a reboot to the Higurashi anime but to keep this short THIS IS NOT A REBOOT. It is a continuation of the higurashi Visual Novel and some post content from there and also a prequel to the Umineko visual novel that comes after Higurashi in the When They Cry series. So in short do NOT watch SotsuGou if you have not completed the Higurashi visual novel and imo if you have not read the Umineko visual novel as that helps with...understanding these shows. understanding these shows."", ""EDIT:I decided I'd edit this review since the series was finished. Originally I had dropped it at ep. 8 because it started to suck. I decided I'd restart the series and watched every Higurashi entry before it, as well as reread the visual novels. Higurashi Sotsu is quite possibly the worst Higurashi anime we've ever gotten, not counting Higurashi Kira. This series has fallen off insanely. Ryukishi needs to stop milking Higurashi.OLD REVIEW:Higurashi Sotsu is a big step up from Gou, which is a sequel to the Umineko visual novels. If you haven't seen Gou or read any of the visual novels, rip you're...probably very confused lol.Anyway, Sotsu is surprisingly good for the sequel to Gou. Gou was a MASSIVE disappointment in my opinion, everything about it was terrible, it did have it's upsides but overall it was a very bad season. Sotsu though, is actually really good. The storyline is more clear (so far) and it's more enjoyable, character development is better compared to Gou (even though this is not saying much since the Higurashi visual novels also had some great character development).If you couldn't tell, I'm being sort of vague, mostly because there's only 5 episode. I'll probably update this review once it finishes like I did with Gou (which I gave a very low score). So far so good though.Also if you are a Higurashi anime only, damn that's actually...Kinda sad. probably very confused lol.Anyway, Sotsu is surprisingly good for the sequel to Gou.

If you haven\'t seen the original Higurashi anime, I highly recommend it if you like mysteries. It\'s very well written and it kept me on my toes. I can\'t, in good faith, recommend Gou or Sotsu.Now that I\'ve finished the show, I can safely say that while it didn\'t get markedly worse from episodes 1-13, it hasn\'t gotten any better, either.There is so much reused animation that this entire show feels like a clipshow, and not a very good...one. The pacing here is God awful, shocking because the original Higurashi had wonderful pacing and Gou, at the very least, had decent pacing. Everything moves incredibly slowly and we\'re shown scenes we\'ve already seen throughout Gou. If I had to guess, I\'d say an entire third of the animation in this show has been reused. That\'s to say nothing about the story, which is just ""here\'s this event, but there\'s also a scene here that adds almost nothing."" Want to see how Keiichi got to L5 in Gou? Too bad, here\'s a scene after where it ended showing the police tackle him - oh, and Satoko does more evil shit or something. Want to see how Mion is injected with the syringe? Go fuck yourself! It happened when she and Satoko went for a drink or something. Want to see how badly Satoko treated Rena? Oh wait, they actually did a pretty good job with that one - more on that later.I\'ve seen a lot of people respond to the complaint that there\'s a lot of reused animation with ""well, the original Higurashi did the same thing."" I disagree with this. Firstly, the original Higurashi was made on a tight budget, which is why it looks so rough around the edges. Secondly, the original Higurashi revealed genuinely important secrets throughout the second season. It wasn\'t obvious that Mion was actually Shion, or that Keiichi had hallucinated Mion and Rena trying to kill him.Speaking of Shion, she\'s in this season for about 10 seconds. I\'m not exaggerating, she\'s here for one scene. Forget about Satoshi. Oh wait, Satoshi makes a little appearance at the end, just to say fuck you for thinking that we\'ll do anything with his character.Going back to Mion, why don\'t we destroy one of the things that made her completely and utterly unique? We have an opportunity to give Satoko a roadblock, let\'s waste it! I\'m sure you already know where this is going.Mion was incredibly unique in the original series. She\'s the only one in the friend group who is immune to the deadly syndrome that plagued the original series. While the anime cut a lot of her character out, in the original visual novel, she served as the ""rock"" of the group, helping inspire Rika to keep pushing on along with Keiichi. Sotsu turned her into a yandere, almost exactly the same as Shion - just replace Satoshi with Keiichi. It changes almost the entire formula of the show. It took her a little bit longer, but she succumbed to the disease nonetheless, which has never happened in the Higurashi universe. I can\'t explain how disappointing this is.Going back to Satoko, there is little to nothing stopping her. She is a God, or rather a demon. There\'s a scene where she finds out that Rika has to die before her or else it won\'t be the ""same"" Rika, but that does basically nothing....And they gave Satoko a way out. No no, you see, that wasn\'t the REAL Satoko, it\'s a demon/split personality that was created by this deity when the power was given to her. This makes little to no sense; the original Higurashi was about redemption, how people can grow and get better. On top of that, most of the actions in the original series, including Takano\'s, were due to the syndrome. This show explicitly states that Satoko was cured of Hinamizawa syndrome, along with the rest of the village - except for Satoshi, who\'s in a coma until the end of the series.""Evil"" Satoko has got to be one of the least likable villains in anime. Even Takano was somehow more likable. She\'s callous and cruel and comes off as horrifically abusive to Rika. Also, we get it, you don\'t need to show her eyes turning red every single time - she\'s evil.Going back to the parts that I enjoyed, it was nice to see the first chapter from Rena\'s perspective. They did a really good job showing her descent into madness. Obviously, there was no twist, we saw Rena stab Keiichi - the clock meant nothing, as had originally been theorized by a lot of the fanbase. We also saw Satoko inject Rena with the disease and laugh when Rena started to go insane. It serves only to make me dislike Satoko even more, but apparently people like to see the ""crazy"" girl do evil things. I do love the scenes where Rena interacts with Rina, it\'s not as gory as Gou was and it felt a lot more like the original Higurashi. Rena\'s story also made sense and was believable, and the animation being recycled wasn\'t as obvious at this point.If I had to rank the stories so far, it would be Rena\'s > Ooishi\'s > Mion\'s. Rena\'s story was great, Ooishi\'s story was kind of interesting, Mion\'s was horrible.Just like Shion, Satoko\'s feelings towards Rika seem to have been put on the backburner. I wasn\'t a fan of this, the ""psycho lover"" story has been done to death and it feels incredibly harmful to make the only lesbian character a psychopathic killer and abuser. With all that being said, it comes off as queerbating in a medium that has more than enough of it.There are some other good parts, including learning about Eua and seeing a bit more Hanyuu. However, it\'s not worth the obnoxious Satoko story and definitely not worth the reused footage. Also, this is an incredibly minor complaint, but Passione decided to add a weird fanservice scene involving Hanyuu - in one of the only dramatic moments that has been believable so far. It\'s also weird seeing it in Higurashi of all places, a show that has (thankfully) avoided fanservice thus far, aside from a widely disliked OVA.Overall, while Sotsu is slightly more enjoyable than Gou, there is far too much reused footage, and the weaknesses from Gou are even more pronounced. I would not recommend watching this show unless you\'re desperate to finish Higurashi as a whole - though I\'m slightly convinced that there\'s another season worth of reused footage in the works.Sotsu feels like a bad fanfiction. The ending shows that very clearly. The original ending to Higurashi was, unfortunately, firmly stuck in the ""friendship overpowers all!"" dynamic; however, because the characters were so well written, it overcame the odds and concluded with a satisfying final episode. None of the characters in Sotsu matter at all aside from Rika, Satoko, Hanyuu (who\'s barely there) and Eua (who mostly laughs maniacally.) They tried to do the ""friendship overpowers all"" ending again... and ended up justifying abuse. Rika and Satoko decide ""well, we don\'t need to be together all the time! Let\'s be friends."" Friends, after being tortured, mentally and physically.Mind you, Rika grew up, originally. She made new friends. She got slightly more distant from Satoko. She became an average high schooler. And Satoko responded by trying to mentally torture her ""friend"" so that she would stay in a village that Satoko knew Rika would hate. This ""friendship"" ending is such bullshit because Satoko, at this point, does not deserve the kinship of any of the people she\'s continuously tortured. There wasn\'t even a redemption arc trying to justify her, it\'s just ""well, both sides were bad, so Rika deserved to be tortured I guess."" Even with Teppei, his ""redemption arc"" comes down to ""Satoko killed him and made him think it\'s a dream, so it\'s okay now."" Gou and Sotsu seem to have a real problem showing that abusers are wrong in their actions, something the original Higurashi didn\'t struggle with.Also, remember all the queer undertones from Gou? How a lot of the fanbase insisted that it wasn\'t queerbating, and that Satoko\'s romantic love for Rika would play a role in the story? Nope, they\'re just really really good friends. Satoko just doesn\'t want to lose her friend. How much clearer can we make it that they\'re just FRIENDS? Never mind all the implications that we\'ve thrown out there from the beginning, Satoko harbors no romantic feelings towards Rika and vice versa. Satoko went on a killing spree because she didn\'t want to lose her totally platonic friend.Overall, this show has been incredibly disappointing, and every criticism I\'ve had has always been met with ""No, Higurashi wouldn\'t do that, there\'s gonna be an episode where they explain it/it\'s a fake out."" (aside from Satoko\'s character being drastically different, which I supposedly imagined and somehow was unable to see the ""clear signs"" that didn\'t exist.) And yet, we\'re at the end. They haven\'t fixed anything, and the story is just as unsatisfying at it has been from the beginning.I would rate this a 3 out of 10. That score is for Gou as well as Sotsu. They\'re basically the same trainwreck. one. The pacing here is God awful, shocking because the original Higurashi had wonderful pacing and Gou, at the very least, had decent pacing. Everything moves incredibly slowly and we\'re shown scenes we\'ve already seen throughout Gou. If I had to guess, I\'d say an entire third of the animation in this show has been reused. That\'s to say nothing about the story, which is just ""here\'s this event, but there\'s also a scene here that adds almost nothing."" Want to see how Keiichi got to L5 in Gou? Too bad, here\'s a scene after where it ended showing the police tackle him - oh, and Satoko does more evil shit or something. Want to see how Mion is injected with the syringe? Go fuck yourself! It happened when she and Satoko went for a drink or something. Want to see how badly Satoko treated Rena? Oh wait, they actually did a pretty good job with that one - more on that later.I\'ve seen a lot of people respond to the complaint that there\'s a lot of reused animation with ""well, the original Higurashi did the same thing."" I disagree with this. Firstly, the original Higurashi was made on a tight budget, which is why it looks so rough around the edges. Secondly, the original Higurashi revealed genuinely important secrets throughout the second season. It wasn\'t obvious that Mion was actually Shion, or that Keiichi had hallucinated Mion and Rena trying to kill him.Speaking of Shion, she\'s in this season for about 10 seconds. I\'m not exaggerating, she\'s here for one scene. Forget about Satoshi. Oh wait, Satoshi makes a little appearance at the end, just to say fuck you for thinking that we\'ll do anything with his character.Going back to Mion, why don\'t we destroy one of the things that made her completely and utterly unique? We have an opportunity to give Satoko a roadblock, let\'s waste it! I\'m sure you already know where this is going.Mion was incredibly unique in the original series. She\'s the only one in the friend group who is immune to the deadly syndrome that plagued the original series. While the anime cut a lot of her character out, in the original visual novel, she served as the ""rock"" of the group, helping inspire Rika to keep pushing on along with Keiichi. Sotsu turned her into a yandere, almost exactly the same as Shion - just replace Satoshi with Keiichi. It changes almost the entire formula of the show. It took her a little bit longer, but she succumbed to the disease nonetheless, which has never happened in the Higurashi universe. I can\'t explain how disappointing this is.Going back to Satoko, there is little to nothing stopping her. She is a God, or rather a demon. There\'s a scene where she finds out that Rika has to die before her or else it won\'t be the ""same"" Rika, but that does basically nothing....And they gave Satoko a way out. No no, you see, that wasn\'t the REAL Satoko, it\'s a demon/split personality that was created by this deity when the power was given to her. This makes little to no sense; the original Higurashi was about redemption, how people can grow and get better. On top of that, most of the actions in the original series, including Takano\'s, were due to the syndrome. This show explicitly states that Satoko was cured of Hinamizawa syndrome, along with the rest of the village - except for Satoshi, who\'s in a coma until the end of the series.""Evil"" Satoko has got to be one of the least likable villains in anime. Even Takano was somehow more likable. She\'s callous and cruel and comes off as horrifically abusive to Rika. Also, we get it, you don\'t need to show her eyes turning red every single time - she\'s evil.Going back to the parts that I enjoyed, it was nice to see the first chapter from Rena\'s perspective. They did a really good job showing her descent into madness. Obviously, there was no twist, we saw Rena stab Keiichi - the clock meant nothing, as had originally been theorized by a lot of the fanbase. We also saw Satoko inject Rena with the disease and laugh when Rena started to go insane. It serves only to make me dislike Satoko even more, but apparently people like to see the ""crazy"" girl do evil things. I do love the scenes where Rena interacts with Rina, it\'s not as gory as Gou was and it felt a lot more like the original Higurashi. Rena\'s story also made sense and was believable, and the animation being recycled wasn\'t as obvious at this point.If I had to rank the stories so far, it would be Rena\'s > Ooishi\'s > Mion\'s. Rena\'s story was great, Ooishi\'s story was kind of interesting, Mion\'s was horrible.Just like Shion, Satoko\'s feelings towards Rika seem to have been put on the backburner. I wasn\'t a fan of this, the ""psycho lover"" story has been done to death and it feels incredibly harmful to make the only lesbian character a psychopathic killer and abuser. With all that being said, it comes off as queerbating in a medium that has more than enough of it.There are some other good parts, including learning about Eua and seeing a bit more Hanyuu. However, it\'s not worth the obnoxious Satoko story and definitely not worth the reused footage. Also, this is an incredibly minor complaint, but Passione decided to add a weird fanservice scene involving Hanyuu - in one of the only dramatic moments that has been believable so far. It\'s also weird seeing it in Higurashi of all places, a show that has (thankfully) avoided fanservice thus far, aside from a widely disliked OVA.Overall, while Sotsu is slightly more enjoyable than Gou, there is far too much reused footage, and the weaknesses from Gou are even more pronounced.

From the very first season to Gou I found incredible joy, shock, horror, and thrilling mystery around every corner of this delightful anime series, so much so I can confidently say that up until watching this season this series stands in my top 3 anime favourites. However, after finishing Gou I was faced with one more season left, “when the cicadas cry Satou”, a season that has been recognized as an absolute flop by the fanbase with bad reviews after bad reviews to boot. To say the least, I was very hesitant to watch...this season, after all, I've experienced the painful disappointment of falling in love with a spectacular anime only for it to be ruined in its later seasons, making me wish I simply never watched its downfall. But, as wise men say, “gots to see it through my boi”, so with expecting the absolute worst I began Satou, waiting for it to fumble. I waited, and waited, episode after episode for the anime to fall on its face, even going into the final episode I was waiting. But to my surprise, the downturn never came, and I remained invested and quite happy with the story right until the credits. This leaves me with quite an unpopular opinion, Satou wasn't as bad as people say. Moreover, it was actually quite good.I know, quite a hot take.So why, why does the fanbase hate this season with a burning passion as if it were the most appalling thing ever aired on TV? To be honest, I'm not sure if I can answer that in its entirety but I will try to give my own interpretation on the areas of supposed failure. I feel this might serve this review better as delving too deep might lead to spoilers which I absolutely want to enjoy, When the cicadas cry is better enjoyed knowing absolutely nothing about it beforehand in my opinion.First off, while it'll be difficult not to spoil, I quite enjoyed the new mystery that was put forward in Gou and solved by Satou. I felt the anime handled it well and the outcome of it felt fulfilling to the story. I do understand complaints about the anime reusing scenes from Gou however this wasn't really the case. In early arcs we’d see repeated scenes when they were being viewed by another character, giving the same scene from another perspective helped lay out what was actually going on in the mysteries Gou put forward. Later arcs however we’d see a lot more repeated scenes however I felt they were necessary as they were used to lay out a timeline of exactly when the events were happening, as the later arcs show events that happen connected, but completely outside of what we saw in Gou. While slightly irritating I will admit it helped me figure out each point of deception and lies corresponding with the events we saw in Gou.Secondly, the action and final battle, yes there is a final battle in this anime which ill admit was very odd at first and a little out of place but still quite good and almost nostalgic as characters fight through the different settings and events we saw in all seasons of the anime as we reach our conclusion. Plus I thought the witch battle was just cool.Lastly was the ending, which many didn't like, however, I believed it very well wrapped up the series as a whole very comfortably and even leads some speculation and opening for theories as the show chooses to end not in 1987, which was the farthest Rika ever managed to get to so far, but Rika departing out into the world in 1986, conveniently a few months before the story of  “When the Seagulls cry” begins. I thought this was a very nice nod to what would end up being the next events to play out in the universe of when they cry, one which mind you involves a small Japanese girl who looks identical to Rika which a near-identical name, however, I don't wish to get too much into theories despite this animes greatness in wanting viewers to theorize about it. In basic terms, I felt the ending really tied the entire franchise together which was nice to see.Moreover, the decent into insanity plotline this season went for was highly enjoyable, leading to many tense moments which give that good old When the Cicadas Cry feel. The conflict was handled well, the plot was explained in a way that made sense, so for me, there wasn't much to complain about.All in all, I loved When the cIcadas cry from beginning to end, this includes Satou. Maybe my love of the new seasons comes from me being new to this fanbase, only beginning this series a few months ago, so for me, I have not had time to idealize the show and have it become a nostalgic memory like many long time fans. Perhaps if I was in the same boat as others and watched the new seasons almost a decade after watching the original id hate it as much as the rest, but who knows.My only complaint about Satou is teasing a scene where we would see Satoshi reunite with Satoko, or maybe even Shion and then not follow through with it. Felt like a kick in the dick to me and was heavily disappointing.So my verdict is that Satou isn't bad, it's great, however, I do understand if long-time fans were left disappointed after a build-up of a decade worth of nostalgia.Thank you Ryuukishi07 for making such a fantastic rollercoaster of a story, one which I will always hold as a favourite. this season, after all, I've experienced the painful disappointment of falling in love with a spectacular anime only for it to be ruined in its later seasons, making me wish I simply never watched its downfall.

Even though I agree that the hate is quite well deserved as it ruined the original ending [which was so beautiful in its own right], I thoroughly enjoyed this experience so much, especially the new ending. This would have been a fantastic anime if only it didn\'t ruin the original.Story: 7A story with just two of the beloved 6/7 characters wouldn\'t ever have really worked in my opinion, no matter the execution. However, the bits without Satoko and Rika were cool such as the first four episodes.

The original art too had its charm, but this wasn\'t any worse.Sound: 10I love Higurashi\'s music throughout, and again, the ending song was beautiful.

The general concept of it was not something new to me, however the way it was processed was definetely marvelous and brilliant.

After I finished watching season 2, I thought like ""Well I think this is a great ending for the...series, why there are 2 (actually 3 with Rei) more seasons?"" and well I guess it was to fuck everything up. So yeah, to anyone who is planning to watch Higurashi, just stop watching after finishing Kai.

After the fantastic hook of Gou, promising a new overarching story, Sotsu disappointingly just continues off of Gou\'s formula, retreading the original story arcs of Higurashi but with a slightly new added twist.Fans of the original Higurashi, be it the original anime, the manga adaptation, or the original visual novel, will feel incredibly bored by just how similar the otherwise slightly changed arcs are. It was a neat novelty at first in Gou but now it just feels dragged...on.

I don't want to spoil much, but I will say that the competition between two essentially immortal beings is gripping."", ""A long journey came to an end. Thinking there'd be no more seasons.Now I always loved this series from the start, since when deen was taking care of it. But this gou and sotsu just penetrated that affection.So first of all what is sotsu. It means graduation, now what is graduating here, us from this series or the characters of the series from their traumas and suffering. Now this gou and sotsu is a kind off spinoff of the original series. Talking about sotsu alone would be a off as it didn't work out the way I expected. Now for me personally...I expected a lot from the ending but this season was just a great disappointment for the whole higurashi series and the fans. If you want to enjoy the higurashi just watch the 2 seasons that is enough. This gousotsu is just a humiliation of the original one.Now in sotsu,what they had? The answer arcs offcourse at first I was liking it as everything was opening up and things were getting really good. But 13 episode for just the answer arcs its way too long. All u need is just 1 ep per arc and that also would have played great. But a 15 ep season with 13 ep of recap just gets boring at one point. And even I somehow watched it. Waiting for the ending hoping it would be something great. But the ending was even a great disappointment. It was like the writer didn't gave it a second of thought like this much of torture and this much of rivalry ended that easily. Rika was like ohh you tormented a hell out of me until the point I *really* wanted to die and you didn't even let me die? Ok no problem let's move on. Just like that and even the villian eua, hanyuu just told her to leave and she was like ok now I'll leave. I mean how much more you can make us disappointed. The ending was a torture for us fans. Like the torture of some 40 eps got solved like it was nothing. And yeah the other characters what about them. They just made reina keichi mion a side-side character. And yeah what about the love story of keichi and mion. And just like that everyone turned into a good guy. Satoshi came back to life somehow. And now everyone is happy. Dude that's just a great insult for a great show.Adding some good points too thatSo first of all answer arcs were too long yeah, but they were important as to tell the story of satoko turning more and more evil and all. And how with each one of the worlds rika losing hope. So 13 eps would have been fine if they have given sotsu some 26 episodes but with low budget and higurashi not getting much of attention and all. They wrapped all up in 15 eps now when u take 13 eps in a recap then what can u even achieve in 2 episode.Now another thing is their focus on rika and satoko, yeah it was a little disappointing seeing other characters useless like some npcs but this gousotsu was mainly focused on rika and satoko's bond as how they are close friends. Don't want to get separated so one tries to drag another with her and other tries to make her stay with her. And this whole gousotsu was for their bond.Now are their any chances of umineko sequel? As far as I know that birth of bernkestel can lead them there. So now seeing the ending their isn't much chances of that too.Another plus point was the insert song at the last that was just epicNow even the art style, well it was goods but not fitting for the anime. Well I thought it even before that this art style gonna set the anime and the creepiness a little off and the censorship made it worse it was good in gou as there weren't much censorship but in sotsu it's just worse. Now the sounds well no complaint there. The op and ed were good as always. But except that everything was just trash. Even if you'd taken one more season to complete it I wouldn't be this much disappointed. But ending like this is not acceptable. Some 40 eps trauma ended in some loli fights which ended in everyone turning good without and mf strong point. So I'll keep it short and will just say. That just stop at kai don't go above it it's just disappointment ahead. I expected a lot from the ending but this season was just a great disappointment for the whole higurashi series and the fans. If you want to enjoy the higurashi just watch the 2 seasons that is enough. This gousotsu is just a humiliation of the original one.Now in sotsu,what they had?

Just like that and even the villian eua, hanyuu just told her to leave and she was like ok now I'll leave. I mean how much more you can make us disappointed. The ending was a torture for us fans. Like the torture of some 40 eps got solved like it was nothing. And yeah the other characters what about them. They just made reina keichi mion a side-side character. And yeah what about the love story of keichi and mion. And just like that everyone turned into a good guy. Satoshi came back to life somehow. And now everyone is happy. Dude that's just a great insult for a great show.Adding some good points too thatSo first of all answer arcs were too long yeah, but they were important as to tell the story of satoko turning more and more evil and all. And how with each one of the worlds rika losing hope. So 13 eps would have been fine if they have given sotsu some 26 episodes but with low budget and higurashi not getting much of attention and all. They wrapped all up in 15 eps now when u take 13 eps in a recap then what can u even achieve in 2 episode.Now another thing is their focus on rika and satoko, yeah it was a little disappointing seeing other characters useless like some npcs but this gousotsu was mainly focused on rika and satoko's bond as how they are close friends. Don't want to get separated so one tries to drag another with her and other tries to make her stay with her. And this whole gousotsu was for their bond.Now are their any chances of umineko sequel? As far as I know that birth of bernkestel can lead them there. So now seeing the ending their isn't much chances of that too.Another plus point was the insert song at the last that was just epicNow even the art style, well it was goods but not fitting for the anime. Well I thought it even before that this art style gonna set the anime and the creepiness a little off and the censorship made it worse it was good in gou as there weren't much censorship but in sotsu it's just worse. Now the sounds well no complaint there. The op and ed were good as always. But except that everything was just trash. Even if you'd taken one more season to complete it I wouldn't be this much disappointed. But ending like this is not acceptable. Some 40 eps trauma ended in some loli fights which ended in everyone turning good without and mf strong point. So I'll keep it short and will just say. That just stop at kai don't go above it it's just disappointment ahead."", ""I will tell like everyone. I don't recommend you to watch Higurashi Sotsu. Higurashi will have manga Jun as another timeline of Gou. I prefer you to wait for Jun.Story - 1/10Ending is very good but along the way is very bad because it's just only recap from Gou ep1-13 and it's just because Rika and Satoko is fighting because of HATE STUDY. In the end, they know that they should separate their way and will meet again in the future. That is too easy for predict and I am sure that everyone know how to fix the problem between them already.Higurashi has a action...scene like Dragonball Z, it's not Higurashi at all. Umineko is start with Mystery, Action, Fantasy, Psychological, etc. But Higurashi is start with Mystery, Horror, Psychological, Dementia not Acrion. If Higurashi gradually step into Action, it's ok but this is too fast. But actually, don't make Higurashi into Action like Dragonball Z but action like Higurashi.SotsuGou is like a bridge between Higurashi and Umineko. SotsuGou has many conversation that link to Umineko and I like it but as a bridge, they can do better than this.Art - 6/10I hate this art style. I like art style in Higurashi manga (not Gou and Jun). It's too cute and big eyes and it's not match with Higurashi. But I accept that animation is good. But I still hate this Art style.Sound - 7/10Sound is OK especially ep15Character - 1/10Only Rika and Satoko fighting each other because of hate study and when they use punch, they can think The End.But I love Rika very much Chu~. I like Tamura, Yukari very much.Enjoyment - 3/10I still enjoy but when I know that recap is too long, I am very disappointed. And ep14 is just only fighting with stupid reason. ep15 Hanyuu can defeat against Eua too easy...Overall - 4/10As a bridge between Higurashi and Umineko, it's still Ok because of conversation. Ending is very good but along the way is very bad, idea that we get form Sotsu has only one that everyone knows that is separate their way and meet again. 24+15 get only one idea.Higurashi use many conversation and action from Umineko to link them but I don't agree with it. They can adapt better than Sotsu. So, I hope Jun can link them perfectly and give the end as Higurashi.Thank You scene like Dragonball Z, it's not Higurashi at all.

But I think it falls short of the originals. A bit of a shame, considering the original 2 seasons are some of my favorite animes of all time. I\'m kind of disappointed that this is likely the last we\'ll see of the series, and that I\'ll never get to experience something like the originals...for the first time again.So what are the pitfalls Sotsu falls into? First of all it suffers from a similar problem as Gou in that it re-uses a lot of content, but with one major distinction. In Gou seeing scenes from the original Higurashi was novel and cool, we got to see the old show reimagined with a fresh new art style, which really made it feel less repetitive as a whole. Sotsu doesn\'t have the same luxury as Gou in being ""new."" So when the majority of the content is explanations and retellings of the arcs in Gou, it was kind of boring at points. Not to say that it was super boring and lame, it did divulge new information to the viewer and explore just exactly how things went down, which was interesting in its own right, its just that it wasn\'t really what I wanted. The original Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai was quite the opposite, delivering a bunch of new information through entirely different scenes and flashbacks which fleshed out the characters, villains, and the world. It also used everything built up over the two seasons for a great and rewarding climax. I wasn\'t necessarily hoping for Higurashi Kai #2, but I was hoping for something like it in terms of scale and quality. What we got was much less. Instead most of our new information pertains specifically to the arcs we\'ve already watched, and the climax was much less impactful, although still pretty good in my opinion. So while the arcs in Sotsu weren\'t necessarily boring, they were really a let down for me.This problem is compounded by how much time they spent on them, when I found out that only the last 3 episodes would be for the final conflict, I was pretty damn annoyed, especially when some of the earlier arcs were pretty boring in Sotsu, and really didn\'t deserve 3 episodes. Not all of them are like that though, Tatariakashi-hen (the one with Houjou Teppei) was great and something I enjoyed the whole way through. But other than that, the rest of the answer arcs end up feeling like expanded recaps of a show that was basically just the original Higurashi series but in italics.[Spoilers Start]Secondly, I felt that it took time away from some of the characters I liked the most. Don\'t get me wrong, I like Satoko and Rika, its just that I also like Keichi and Rena, and Mion, and Shion, and even some of the minor characters as well. But none of these other characters really get much screen time unless they are being killed or have succumbed to Hinamizawa Syndrome and are trying to kill other people, therefore making them no longer the character I liked. It just sort of sucked that I didn\'t get to see as much of them as I wanted, especially their older selves. I thought that we\'d see a decent amount of them in Sotsu, but it turns out that it was just the second half of the last episode.[Spoilers End]Another thing I want to touch on is the ending. I think it was a mixed bag, the second half of the last episode was good as a whole, with some great scenes in there. It also was able to give a pretty conclusive end to the series with a fairly happy ending. But on the other hand the majority of the ending arc up to that point was underwhelming compared to Kai. It had a decent fight scene or two, but could have been better as a whole. And the conclusion ended up feeling rushed, with 2 plot elements that were not even brought up in Gou or Sotsu are solved immediately. I\'m pretty sure I have an explanation for why those 2 things happened, but regardless it was sort of weird to just see those problems solved like that.Other than that I don\'t have much to say, I do think I talked it down a bit too much in my review. I would like to mention that it still has some clever puzzles like the original, and I still think is worth watching if you like the series. It\'s just that at the end of the day it ends up being a recap of a reboot of a show from 2007 with some  extra stuff added. Overall pretty disappointing, but I guess I\'ll take what I can get. for the first time again.So what are the pitfalls Sotsu falls into?

At first, I thought it would be a great season because of the trailer but the content was so awful that I almost skipped the episodes. This season and Gou destroyed the Higurashi franchiseStory:The story followed the beginning of the events of Gou. Actually... there\'s no story at all because most of the episodes are just recaps from Gou in Satoko and her victims\' perspective. Ryu07 wasted...13 episodes of the series for some pointless recaps. The gore and the thriller were still there but some gore parts are censored but not in Gou. The only interesting happened was in Episode 14 but it turned out to be a mainstream shounen because of the fight scenes. Episode 15 was one of the disaster endings I\'ve ever seen because of the power of friendship, destroyed yet saved them. Some shounen tropes like the power of friendship and punching each other faces while shouting each other\'s side are so freaking hilarious in this anime. The fight scene where Rika and Satoko punched each other was like the scene in the final battle between Naruto and Sasuke in Naruto Shippuden.Art and Sound:The art was solid and kudos to Passione for animating the ""shounen"" fight scenes. The lips of every main characters were so creepy as heck but I like the OG designs more than Passione. The soundtrack is still fine. The OP sequence is also a banger but not a creepy one, just like the old OP in OG series. The ED is also amazing, especially the piano part at the beginning.Characters:They are the same as ever, nothing new for all the characters in the Higurashi franchise. Satoko\'s point of view is also good but they should stick for the new story about Satoko. Other main characters like Keichii, Shion, Mion, Rena, and the others were like side characters now in this season and they didn\'t have enough screentime for them. It feels like Rika and Satoko are the main protagonist of the whole Higurashi franchise, not Keichii. Overall, it is still good.Enjoyment and Last words:Do you think this season is worth watching? I recommend watching the second half of Gou and start Sotsu from the beginning. It can help you save time from watching this garbage anime. Ryu07 shouldn\'t milk the series in the first place because the ending of Kai was satisfying. Higurashi was famous for being a horror thriller gore anime, right? Why the heck this season became a slice of life drama with some awesome fight scenes? The first two seasons of Higurashi were better but all the hate was shoved in Gou and Sotsu. Sotsu had the potential to be a great season if the pointless recaps are removed. It\'s a pain in the neck to say this but one word will describe this entire season and Gou, DISAPPOINTING! 13 episodes of the series for some pointless recaps. The gore and the thriller were still there but some gore parts are censored but not in Gou. The only interesting happened was in Episode 14 but it turned out to be a mainstream shounen because of the fight scenes.

In terms of horror, I didn\'t get a scary impression in watching the ""sotsu"" series because of the many scenes of slaughter/murder that were cut or on the black screen so that the impression of horror...when I saw the murder scene in the higurashi series was less than the previous higurashi series.in terms of art model 7:I think I have followed the previous series although the character creation has changed in terms of coloring with brighter colors but it doesn\'t really affect how the character is described so it\'s fine.in terms of character 7:furude rikastruggling to be able to maintain his desire to stay in school at saint lucia but because he doesn\'t realize that he is forcing his own desires on his best friend which instead makes his best friend Satoko tormented because to realize Rika\'s desire to stay together studying at saint lucia school.Honjou SatokoBecause of Furude Rika\'s desire to study together, that\'s what caused the tragedy in Hanezawa that was carried out by Satoko who got the power like Furude Rika to repeat to the past to get back her happiness with Furude Rika in Hanezawa.in terms of music 6:I won\'t say much about the music in the anime but I will say I didn\'t catch that this anime was shot in a rural setting with a lot of horn sounds during the summer due to the lack of sound compared to the previous higurashi anime.in terms of animation 6:studio deen in shooting angles is good, it\'s just that in the appearance of the story there are some parts that are cut or deliberately omitted from the story of higurashi sotsu.overall 6:it\'s like Houjou Satoko shouldn\'t expect to find her own happiness to stay with Furude rika beside him. For Furude Rika will feel lonely because she is not with her best friend who is understanding with her.

You basically re-watch all the scenes you had seen prior from a different perspective and get to understand why certain events occur. Sadly without much variation or extra interesting scenes I found myself incredibly disinterested. It was a bad decision to end GOU on a cliffhanger and then take 13 (out of 15!) episodes in SOTSU to reach the same point in the story. The last two episodes, basically the only new content, felt incredibly rushed and the final resolution felt especially contrived and unsatisfying.As stated by many...other reviewers the story was butchered and character motivations/reasoning are about as bad as they could have been. Rena, Keiichi, Shion, and Mion are all pushed to the sidelines and basically forgotten about in of the latter half of the season. Additionally, if you want to read about the complete destruction of Satoko and Rena's characters there are many reviews that cover it that I suggest you read if you are hesitant about watching this.Another point of note was the extreme censorship on a lot of the gore scenes which  I found odd because GOU also had some gore scenes and they were not censored. I believe the Blu-Ray release of SOTSU will be uncensored (if you are willing to somehow put yourself through the story) so this complaint is targeted at the regular release.The only positives I have for this season was the art and sound. Passione did a great job with the animation.To sum it up, I would rather get stabbed one hundred times by Rena then ever watch this again, which is disheartening because I thoroughly enjoyed GOU and the original series (both the manga and the animation). other reviewers the story was butchered and character motivations/reasoning are about as bad as they could have been.

And so too is my opinion very much the same for Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Sotsu.But there are things about Sotsu that I feel make it sit above being just simply ""bad"" as I feel there are things about Sotsu that are good, but the good is so weighed down by the bad that it just narrows out to be mediocre.Story: 6/10. This is probably where a lot of my conflict lies because Sotsu does have things that work and has so much else that...could\'ve worked to the degree of being one of the best shows of 2021, but it flounders so much of it away that while what we get is serviceable and to a decent amount of people of Sotsu actually ""great"" it to me instead just feels like the perfect final that should have us moving to tears with every episode is instead just throwing it out like laundry.I\'m not saying that Sotsu\'s tale has no value whatsoever like some reviews here, but I don\'t think that much of an impact was felt when it feels like I should have a hole in my heart crying about how this should be one of the greatest animes of all-time.Art: 7/10. Now I think art is not the be all end all of any production, the original 06 Higurashi has gotten much criticism for its art in recent years (which to me I feel it boasts more charm than a majority of anime this day and age) but none the less I understand it\'s an important part of the animation that people do want to be good.And really Higurashi Sotsu\'s animation is good, it\'s decent and while I sometimes do think characters are ""shiny"" I still think that a lot of it fits within the story, while also in some ways resembling the original designs in small details where I could actually confuse it for still being apart of the DEEN anime. Which to me is a good thing.Sound: 7/10. I mean there is nothing wrong with this sound wise I feel. Its music still is great, the voice actors are still showing why they are every bit the characters as they were since 06 and there is just a lot of good sound effects here.I\'m also very much looking forward to hearing the ending song again, which also was sung by a familiar artist of the original anime. It honestly had me in tears, fair play Passione.Character: 5/10. Here\'s the thing they don\'t outright butcher characters as much as I feel they don\'t hone in them, Higurashi\'s cast to me has always been some of the most in-depth of all-time rivaling that of Evangelion and Berserk.And what Sotsu is presenting is not out of bounds but just so caught in first gear it never picks up beyond that and to me, it\'s not so much that the anime is bad for it, but that it\'s frustrating because the meat of these characters is held back with repeated lines, rushed or dragging pacing or just overall trying so hard to showcase a side of the characters (Like Mion) that have never been seen before only to narrow it down to one point and stick to it.This to me is just head shaking because there are so many instances where the characters look to be going into a direction that blows my mind, but for the most part, it\'s just by the books.Although I do give points for how they handle 2 particular supporting cast characters that I honestly feel enhanced the story of Sotsu to the point I was rather moved, those who have seen the show I\'m sure you know the two I\'m talking about.Enjoyment: 5/10. 15 Episodes and basically 60% of it is new content while a good 30% is just recapped content, that doesn\'t sound good and it\'s not good and frankly for something like Higurashi it should not be the case.Overall I personally give it a 6 out of 10 but with a big amount of disappointment to go with it that could easily drag it down to a 5 out of 10 in spirit and I get where most reviews and fans are coming at with this edition of Higurashi and how it in many ways is just very flawed.But I also understand why some could in fact see this as a great show as while I think the recaps drag this show down the most, it hits the beats that one who is watching this anime does, not amazing, but not to the point of declaring it\'s worthless.And I respect anyone who enjoys this season and found themselves emotional with it as at the end of the day Higurashi I think should always be designed to make you come away with some emotional message. could\'ve worked to the degree of being one of the best shows of 2021, but it flounders so much of it away that while what we get is serviceable and to a decent amount of people of Sotsu actually ""great"" it to me instead just feels like the perfect final that should have us moving to tears with every episode is instead just throwing it out like laundry.I\'m not saying that Sotsu\'s tale has no value whatsoever like some reviews here, but I don\'t think that much of an impact was felt when it feels like I should have a hole in my heart crying about how this should be one of the greatest animes of all-time.Art: 7/10.

Here\'s the thing they don\'t outright butcher characters as much as I feel they don\'t hone in them, Higurashi\'s cast to me has always been some of the most in-depth of all-time rivaling that of Evangelion and Berserk.And what Sotsu is presenting is not out of bounds but just so caught in first gear it never picks up beyond that and to me, it\'s not so much that the anime is bad for it, but that it\'s frustrating because the meat of these characters is held back with repeated lines, rushed or dragging pacing or just overall trying so hard to showcase a side of the characters (Like Mion) that have never been seen before only to narrow it down to one point and stick to it.This to me is just head shaking because there are so many instances where the characters look to be going into a direction that blows my mind, but for the most part, it\'s just by the books.Although I do give points for how they handle 2 particular supporting cast characters that I honestly feel enhanced the story of Sotsu to the point I was rather moved, those who have seen the show I\'m sure you know the two I\'m talking about.Enjoyment: 5/10. 15 Episodes and basically 60% of it is new content while a good 30% is just recapped content, that doesn\'t sound good and it\'s not good and frankly for something like Higurashi it should not be the case.Overall I personally give it a 6 out of 10 but with a big amount of disappointment to go with it that could easily drag it down to a 5 out of 10 in spirit and I get where most reviews and fans are coming at with this edition of Higurashi and how it in many ways is just very flawed.But I also understand why some could in fact see this as a great show as while I think the recaps drag this show down the most, it hits the beats that one who is watching this anime does, not amazing, but not to the point of declaring it\'s worthless.And I respect anyone who enjoys this season and found themselves emotional with it as at the end of the day Higurashi I think should always be designed to make you come away with some emotional message.', ""Higurashi Sotsu is such a weird work to me simply because the last thing 07th expansion did before the new question and answer arc for higurashi was a single ciconia arc which has been made clear wont have question or answer arcs. As far as the overall 07th expansion story goes, the biggest thing this told us was that ciconia has a much deeper role than was expected with Vier and her works being mentioned even though that should theoretically happen at the end of the story chronologically; telling us the order is now Ciconia -> Higurashi -> Umineko. As far as the birth of...Bernskatel goes or why Rika is lambdadelta's cat, we're still completely at a loss which is exactly what I wanted to be addressed but instead we got how Frederika reached enlightenment and that Takano's witch, Lambdadelta can possess other people's bodies, in this case being Satoko. We got some Ushiromiya family references in Higurashi Gou but if your still looking for some deeper answers from the Umineko story this wont tell you except for maybe this is how Rika learned about Erika.Now outside of Sotsu's role in the entire story, I want to be clear that personally the series ending feels wrong. Maybe its because Higurashi has never had a happy ending or maybe it's because we know Rika is supposed to be bitter at the end of Higurashi, which is what causes her to be the way she is in Umineko, but there's just to many questions regarding Rika that are never addressed in the story. I wouldn't be surprised if their was a ova with an unhappy ending again but until than you're left with a series that has leitmotifs and other directions leading to a different ending than whats given. Afterall, the witch of miracles is supposed to undergo tragedy for a thousand years and we're only halfway in. I wouldn't be surprised if we're missing something but until than we will just be stuck feeling like we're out of the loop.

The original two seasons of Higurashi weren\'t perfect for sure, but they told a complete story with a mostly satisfying end. If the new Higurashi was going to have 2 seasons of content, then it better be for a good reason.After watching 39 episodes of the new show, I\'m still having trouble understanding what the point of this show is, so I\'m going to analyze a few theories of mine I...have regarding this question.- It\'s an advertisement for the gacha:When I started watching the first season, I wasn\'t aware that there was a Higurashi gacha game, but looking back at the way the show is structured, it made sense. We know how these things work, Gacha games are very profitable nowadays, and making it so the franchise stays on people\'s minds is important. I believe this is why the pacing of the show is so incredibly incompetent.The arcs feel very very long, and basically nothing happens in them. The first half of Sotsu has arcs which are rethreads of old arcs in the original Higurashi, except this time they have slightly different endings! Now, seeing how this is a sequel, I expect most people who watch this series to have already seen the first series or read the original VN. If people are already familiar with the story then there is no mystery in these arcs; The reason why these arcs worked in the first Higurashi was that you didn\'t know what was actually happening, and the story revealed itself slowly. So what is the point of having essentially the same arcs with the same pacing if there is basically no mystery? The only possible question the audience might have is why Rika is trapped in the loops again, but nothing that happens in this first half helps you at all to solve that. Everything just feels like a way to make the show artificially longer; and I haven\'t even mentioned the second season.During 13 out of 15 episodes of Gou, almost nothing of importance happens. The ""answer"" arcs do nothing to actually advance the story, they are just vehicles to one, show some more violence/gore; and two, make this series even more unnecessarily slow. I suppose now that you have all these arcs in the actual show, they can put more content related to it in the gacha, and simply looking at the gacha\'s Twitter account seems to support this theory.- It\'s a scam:Now, this is just my personal opinion, but a feeling I got when watching both of these seasons was that of being scammed. This feeling comes, not only from me not liking the story, but from many small things that usually would amount to nitpicks, but together make the show feel ""cheaper"".Firstly, it\'s an unnecesary sequel. The original had a perfectly conclusive ending, and it definitely didn\'t need a continuation. Just the fact that it\'s another part that adds almost nothing new to an existing series starts to give the sensation of being creatively bankrupt, of just occurring to get more money off of an existing IP\'s fans.Additionally, the visuals are a bit off at times. I mostly like the character designs by Akio Watanabe, but sometimes the characters can look a bit plasticky because of either the coloring or them going off model. Speaking of animation, aside from some very specific episodes that are more action-oriented, it\'s nothing to write home about, and at times it can be underwhelming. The old Studio Deen adaptation usually got flak for not being so great visually, but their style fit the tone of the story better in my opinion.Finally, the biggest way Sotsu/Gou are lazy are with just how much content is recycled during Sotsu. There are episodes where almost 15 minutes amount to nothing but recycled animation or recaps. There is no justification for making the answer arcs as long as the arcs they are recontextualizing, when the information they add to them is both minimal and inconsequential to the overall story. The one scene that is very well animated during the first 37 episodes of the show (Rika\'s dance) is repeated completely or partially several times during both seasons to the point it became a joke. I\'d say if you took a shot every time Satoko looked with red eyes at the camera and smiled evilly, or Eua started laughing for no real reason, you\'d be dead very quickly, but the show is so protracted that the alcohol would probably wear off before you could get drunk at all. Being generous, this show has about 20 episodes of real content stretched to 39; in fact, this story could probably be told in a single movie or OVA series.The real kicker is that the entire plot of these three cours of anime happened because of an extremely mundane problem that two teenage girls could have solved by talking to eachother; and in fact they do exactly that in the very final episode, making everything that happened up to that point seem pointless.- It\'s the author(s) messing with the audience:""Ryukishi07 is trolling you, it will all be worth it at the end"" and similar takes were arguments I saw people make online when discussing how dull both seasons had been. I thought if an author makes something that is this bad on purpose then they must seriously hate their audience, and dismissed this opinion. Even though there was some trolling when the show was first announced when it was advertised as a remake, but turned out to be a sequel I thought it was only that, and nothing else. However, I hadn\'t watched episode 13 of Sotsu.Kagurashi-hen part 3 is most likely the funniest thing I\'ve watched in quite a while out of an anime series, and that is including comedy series. After some of the most boring 13 episodes I\'ve had to endure of any anime, the show finally caught up with a cliffhanger at the end of Gou. I was honestly not expecting anything to happen, and them to include a recap of everything that had happened up to that point or something similarly infuriating. Yet, the episode was an absolutely comical display of cartoonish slapstick violence, hilarious dialogue, and ridiculous developments that culminated in a Dragon Ball Z style fight scene.There are many times during this episode where so many things that were clearly intended to be comedic happened, and the whole thing even felt very cathartic after such a long stretch of nothing; I just didn\'t sense that this episode could be this entertaining and amusing by accident. I believe this has to be the author saying ""fuck it"" and just shitting all over the show in the most spectacular way possible. This episode cares so little about what the show has been until then, that it even breaks the internal logic of the story and introduces some plotholes that I could honestly sit here and describe all day long (e.g. the looper killing sword), but I think I\'ve made my point clear enough. At least the final 2 episodes of the whole thing appear like the author is just messing with you.- It\'s a loving continuation of the original series:No.Maybe the only thing I could see was a nice addition to the original series was Satoko\'s uncle\'s redemption arc. Yes, it happened during a horribly protracted arc, but during the original series I got the impression that it could be considered a loose end; so, I welcomed it. Aside from this, I don\'t think there\'s anything that could be considered as a worthy continuation of the first series.So in the end, what was the point of Higurashi Sotsu/Gou? Was it money? Was it the author trolling everyone? Was it a sincere attempt at making a sequel? I will let you decide. But I do know that Higurashi Sotsu/Gou was one thing, a waste of time for everyone involved in it.3/10Thank you for reading. have regarding this question.- It\'s an advertisement for the gacha:When I started watching the first season, I wasn\'t aware that there was a Higurashi gacha game, but looking back at the way the show is structured, it made sense.

I got about two thirds through and the story didn\'t seem to be reaching any sound conclusion, so I put it on hold for months. Now I\'ve finally finished it, and oh boy it feels like Higurashi has been completely massacred.The final message of Gou/Sotsu is actually very nice, and it matches the tone and quality of the overarching morals of the original eight chapters/two seasons. Unfortunately, where Kai\'s ending felt satisfying because of all the character\'s past failures, Sotsu\'s ending just feels... unfulfilling. I rather liked Gou when it aired,...but looking back on the new course of 39 episodes between Gou and Sotsu, much of it is simply repeated events (Not different events across June 1983 like before, but rather the exact same events already portrayed earlier in Gou or Sotsu from a different angle) and incessant gore. Essentially, what people mistake Higurashi for before they experience the whole of the original story that concluded with Higurashi Kai.In the original story, I still stand by my belief that the gore is heavy, but is ultimately rarely shown and is never front and centre during the show at any point. In Sotsu, it is absolutely front and centre. Every episode is just death after death, culminating in a tone-deaf ""final battle"" that feels more like a 90s shounen series than it does the culmination of a long-running psychological anime. Again, the message is great, but the means of getting there really aren\'t at all. Honestly, looking back on it, I\'d rather have never gotten Gou/Sotsu at all, and been left with what I view as an already perfect ending between Kai and Rei. Rika and Satoko no longer feel like themselves, and honestly regardless of the whole witch plot thread and the ties to Umineko no Naku Koro Ni, Satoko\'s actions across these two seasons are inexcusable, and it just feels like the show immediately forgives her once the final episode has run its course. There was so much room to do something, anything, with the clash between these two characters, but ultimately it\'s just too little, too late.On a final note, I can\'t in good conscience recommend you watch Gou or Sotsu unless you consider yourself to be a die-hard fan of either the Higurashi Visual Novels or the original 2006-2009 anime adaptations of the series. Sotsu especially feels like a massive step down, both thematically and structurally, from what came before, and honestly, despite some sweet fanservice scenes at the end, I\'ve reached the conclusion of this reboot of one of my beloved series with a bitter taste in my mouth. but looking back on the new course of 39 episodes between Gou and Sotsu, much of it is simply repeated events (Not different events across June 1983 like before, but rather the exact same events already portrayed earlier in Gou or Sotsu from a different angle) and incessant gore.

While the original Higurashi was a masterpiece in my opinion, this installment ends up being good overall, but disappointing in some ways. They really nailed it with Gou, but Sotsu definitely fell short at times. Despite all that, I\'m still satisfied with the conclusion, and don\'t have a problem accepting this as part of the Higurashi canon. I will go through the overarching things I think this series did well and poorly. First off though, the sound and animation are both phenomenal in my opinion and...don\'t really require much addressing.The Bad;Plot holes and very weak loose ends. Ryukishi is normally fantastic about this sort of thing, but here there are a couple glaring examples that break the immersion a bit. I strongly suspect that there was some meddling from Passione here. Some of these loose ends include the several times where Satoko injecting a totally conscious person with the L5 syringe was not shown, how the random fragment and time switching of the last two episodes was happening, how Satoko recovered from being slashed in the neck with the Onigari no Ryuou fragment so quickly, how said fragment materialized in Rika\'s hands in the first place and the details of Hanyuu disappearing from the real world. These are loose ends that feel like laziness, and are definitely immersion breaking. Contrast this to another type of loose end, the relationship between Hanyuu and Eua, which feels more organic and intentional, giving the fandom something to theorize about that has implications for the overarching When They Cry canon. In terms of plotholes, there was apparently a scene in Watadamashi that showed the sword missing from the statue before Satoko took it, but I never confirmed this for myself.Character motivations, namely Satoko\'s. While I do think Satoko\'s turn to darkness and actions are overall believable given all we know about her, they could have done a much better job explaining her extremism without justifying it. Does she really just not notice Rika\'s suffering at all? Did she just completely forget about Satoshi? How does her precarious Hinamizawa syndrome status as a child affect her behavior?  Did she ever figure out that she Literally killed her own parents and that Satoshi killed their aunt?  Satoko is basically the villain protagonist of this anime, so you\'d think we\'d see her perspective more.Underuse of certain characters. This is a common criticism I think, but really I\'m not talking about Keiichi, Rena, or even Shion (although they could have given the latter a bit more screentime). Those characters have already had solid character arcs and don\'t really need alot more developing. I would have liked to see more from characters like Mion and Satoshi. With Mion, Wataakashi is pretty weak for being our first Mion- centric arc. Aside from Satoko, Mion was probably the most neglected of the original 5 main characters and that doesn\'t really feels like it has changed alot. But at least Mion got some great moments (her finally confessing to Keiichi, being able to resist Hinamizawa syndrome even when it is artificially induced), Satoshi is in two scenes in this anime. He is Satoko\'s brother, he should have been a much bigger part of this. While I am super happy Ryukishi decided to wake him up, they should have really shown his reunion with Satoko. Having them meet up in the end would have bumped this review up from a 8 to a 9 right off the bat.The reused scenes. I\'m not as much opposed to this as most- it works ok with Oniakashi and Wataakashi, but it really starts to feel a bit more dragged out in the later arcs.The Good;The connections to the greater WTC franchise. There were a Very vocal group of Umineko stans that thought this was going to be a concrete Umineko tie in, and a backstory for Lamb and/or Bern. I\'m super relieved that this was only implied, and done so in a pretty believable way, but without stating anything outright. Nothing with Umineko should ever be confirmed absolutely, that misses the point of that series, and I feel like Higurashi should stay its own thing at the end of the day. I liked the potential for theory building with the Umineko connections, like how it\'s implied Hanyuu is the one who broke Featherine\'s horn (as Eua), and how it\'s implied Satoko is Lamb, without outright confirming that.  As for the Ciconia tie-ins, I freaking LOVE Ciconia and I am happy with any reference to that whatsoever, even if I have no idea what the references imply exactly in regards to Ciconia\'s story.Fleshing out certain characters that were neglected in the original story. This includes side characters like Oishi and Akane, who we got to learn a little more about. Formerly unambiguously vile characters like Rina and Teppei became alot more likeable, and I actually think the latter\'s character arc is done fabulously. Teppei serves as a great foil to Satoko, in that while she allows herself to be corrupted by the looping and acts selfishly, Teppei uses the effects of looping to improve and become a better person.    However the best example of fleshing out a character more in my opinion is Satoko. Yes, they did not handle her character perfectly, as I indicated before.  I also think that Satoko by the end is a completely evil, totally unsympathetic character. But at the same time.... she became VERY entertaining. In the original Higurashi, Satoko was my least favorite of the main quintet. She is sympathetic sure, but her entire character basically boiled down to ""Being abused and suffering as much as possible."" She felt like a living plot device more often than not. And I\'m not the only one who wasn\'t a huge fan of Satoko\'s original character, she pretty consistently was the least popular of the original main characters in popularity polls. While SotsuGou\'s take on her turns her into a horrible person, she absolutely is 100% more of an interesting and cool character than she ever was before, and I honestly do like her alot more now. Plus finding out about her betrayal hit me right in the feels, it felt like I was being stabbed in the back too after loving the series so long, and I appreciate the drama of that feeling, doubt it will ever be replicated with any other work of fiction in the future.Being willing to take risks and go in a new direction. This anime was a big step. It voided the happy ending of a quite old and beloved series. However I\'d much rather find out the ugly reality after that happy end than just leave it as an unopened cat box. Maybe I didn\'t learn anything from Umineko. But seeing the characters go in new directions, change, grow, and become adults was satisfying for me.Finally, one of my favorite aspects... really, this was basically a happy ending. For everyone but one person. The original ending pretty much shat on a couple major characters, namely Satoko, Satoshi, and Takano. Obviously the latter kind of deserved it, but Satoshi was still in a coma by the end, and Satoko was still in a constant state of Hinamizawa syndrome and an orphan with no living family other than her abusive uncle. This ending finally shows Satoshi waking up and being given his life back. Takano returns to the Irie clinic with Tomitake, presumably to begin a much more stable life and more ethical pursuit of science and medicine. Many other characters like Rina, Teppei, and possibly even Ooishi now have better lives as a result of Satoko\'s looping. On the other hand the one character that didn\'t get a happy ending and basically got unambiguously screwed over wasn\'t Satoko... it was Rika. Satoko may not have Rika to herself now (and boo-hoo cry me a river) but she is cured of her advanced Hinamizawa syndrome and has a loving family again in the form of a now-reformed Uncle Teppei and her older brother. She is also immortal and unlike Rika loves having her looping super-power. She doesn\'t even need to study super hard to keep up with St. Lucia\'s curriculum, god forbid she do that. On the other hand poor Rika has been dragged into an exceptionally brutal repeat of her horrific ordeal, has a now-twisted sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend who she no longer even has around, presumably doesn\'t even have Hanyuu anymore, and let\'s not forget is still an orphan with no living family. Rika totally deserved better, a million times better. Hopefully her future will be brighter somehow.So at the end of the day, I did really enjoy this series and am thankful it happened. It was messy at times yes, poorly executed at times, yes, but it was a hell of a ride and I had a lot of fun. The ending wasn\'t perfect but it was good enough to accept and mostly make sense, unlike some other VN to Anime sequels. (I\'m looking at you Danganronpa 3). don\'t really require much addressing.The Bad;Plot holes and very weak loose ends. Ryukishi is normally fantastic about this sort of thing, but here there are a couple glaring examples that break the immersion a bit. I strongly suspect that there was some meddling from Passione here. Some of these loose ends include the several times where Satoko injecting a totally conscious person with the L5 syringe was not shown, how the random fragment and time switching of the last two episodes was happening, how Satoko recovered from being slashed in the neck with the Onigari no Ryuou fragment so quickly, how said fragment materialized in Rika\'s hands in the first place and the details of Hanyuu disappearing from the real world. These are loose ends that feel like laziness, and are definitely immersion breaking. Contrast this to another type of loose end, the relationship between Hanyuu and Eua, which feels more organic and intentional, giving the fandom something to theorize about that has implications for the overarching When They Cry canon. In terms of plotholes, there was apparently a scene in Watadamashi that showed the sword missing from the statue before Satoko took it, but I never confirmed this for myself.Character motivations, namely Satoko\'s. While I do think Satoko\'s turn to darkness and actions are overall believable given all we know about her, they could have done a much better job explaining her extremism without justifying it. Does she really just not notice Rika\'s suffering at all? Did she just completely forget about Satoshi? How does her precarious Hinamizawa syndrome status as a child affect her behavior?  Did she ever figure out that she Literally killed her own parents and that Satoshi killed their aunt?  Satoko is basically the villain protagonist of this anime, so you\'d think we\'d see her perspective more.Underuse of certain characters. This is a common criticism I think, but really I\'m not talking about Keiichi, Rena, or even Shion (although they could have given the latter a bit more screentime). Those characters have already had solid character arcs and don\'t really need alot more developing. I would have liked to see more from characters like Mion and Satoshi. With Mion, Wataakashi is pretty weak for being our first Mion- centric arc. Aside from Satoko, Mion was probably the most neglected of the original 5 main characters and that doesn\'t really feels like it has changed alot. But at least Mion got some great moments (her finally confessing to Keiichi, being able to resist Hinamizawa syndrome even when it is artificially induced), Satoshi is in two scenes in this anime. He is Satoko\'s brother, he should have been a much bigger part of this. While I am super happy Ryukishi decided to wake him up, they should have really shown his reunion with Satoko. Having them meet up in the end would have bumped this review up from a 8 to a 9 right off the bat.The reused scenes. I\'m not as much opposed to this as most- it works ok with Oniakashi and Wataakashi, but it really starts to feel a bit more dragged out in the later arcs.The Good;The connections to the greater WTC franchise. There were a Very vocal group of Umineko stans that thought this was going to be a concrete Umineko tie in, and a backstory for Lamb and/or Bern. I\'m super relieved that this was only implied, and done so in a pretty believable way, but without stating anything outright. Nothing with Umineko should ever be confirmed absolutely, that misses the point of that series, and I feel like Higurashi should stay its own thing at the end of the day. I liked the potential for theory building with the Umineko connections, like how it\'s implied Hanyuu is the one who broke Featherine\'s horn (as Eua), and how it\'s implied Satoko is Lamb, without outright confirming that.  As for the Ciconia tie-ins, I freaking LOVE Ciconia and I am happy with any reference to that whatsoever, even if I have no idea what the references imply exactly in regards to Ciconia\'s story.Fleshing out certain characters that were neglected in the original story. This includes side characters like Oishi and Akane, who we got to learn a little more about. Formerly unambiguously vile characters like Rina and Teppei became alot more likeable, and I actually think the latter\'s character arc is done fabulously. Teppei serves as a great foil to Satoko, in that while she allows herself to be corrupted by the looping and acts selfishly, Teppei uses the effects of looping to improve and become a better person.    However the best example of fleshing out a character more in my opinion is Satoko. Yes, they did not handle her character perfectly, as I indicated before.  I also think that Satoko by the end is a completely evil, totally unsympathetic character. But at the same time.... she became VERY entertaining. In the original Higurashi, Satoko was my least favorite of the main quintet. She is sympathetic sure, but her entire character basically boiled down to ""Being abused and suffering as much as possible."" She felt like a living plot device more often than not. And I\'m not the only one who wasn\'t a huge fan of Satoko\'s original character, she pretty consistently was the least popular of the original main characters in popularity polls. While SotsuGou\'s take on her turns her into a horrible person, she absolutely is 100% more of an interesting and cool character than she ever was before, and I honestly do like her alot more now. Plus finding out about her betrayal hit me right in the feels, it felt like I was being stabbed in the back too after loving the series so long, and I appreciate the drama of that feeling, doubt it will ever be replicated with any other work of fiction in the future.Being willing to take risks and go in a new direction. This anime was a big step. It voided the happy ending of a quite old and beloved series. However I\'d much rather find out the ugly reality after that happy end than just leave it as an unopened cat box. Maybe I didn\'t learn anything from Umineko. But seeing the characters go in new directions, change, grow, and become adults was satisfying for me.Finally, one of my favorite aspects... really, this was basically a happy ending. For everyone but one person. The original ending pretty much shat on a couple major characters, namely Satoko, Satoshi, and Takano. Obviously the latter kind of deserved it, but Satoshi was still in a coma by the end, and Satoko was still in a constant state of Hinamizawa syndrome and an orphan with no living family other than her abusive uncle. This ending finally shows Satoshi waking up and being given his life back. Takano returns to the Irie clinic with Tomitake, presumably to begin a much more stable life and more ethical pursuit of science and medicine. Many other characters like Rina, Teppei, and possibly even Ooishi now have better lives as a result of Satoko\'s looping. On the other hand the one character that didn\'t get a happy ending and basically got unambiguously screwed over wasn\'t Satoko... it was Rika. Satoko may not have Rika to herself now (and boo-hoo cry me a river) but she is cured of her advanced Hinamizawa syndrome and has a loving family again in the form of a now-reformed Uncle Teppei and her older brother. She is also immortal and unlike Rika loves having her looping super-power. She doesn\'t even need to study super hard to keep up with St. Lucia\'s curriculum, god forbid she do that. On the other hand poor Rika has been dragged into an exceptionally brutal repeat of her horrific ordeal, has a now-twisted sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend who she no longer even has around, presumably doesn\'t even have Hanyuu anymore, and let\'s not forget is still an orphan with no living family. Rika totally deserved better, a million times better. Hopefully her future will be brighter somehow.So at the end of the day, I did really enjoy this series and am thankful it happened. It was messy at times yes, poorly executed at times, yes, but it was a hell of a ride and I had a lot of fun. The ending wasn\'t perfect but it was good enough to accept and mostly make sense, unlike some other VN to Anime sequels. (I\'m looking at you Danganronpa 3).', ""okay, this one was an absolute disappointment tho having some gore-ish moments. Wasn't handled properly and felt rushed. As a fan of Higurashi overall, this one wasn't the best.The story was disappointing no depth much, the ARTSYLE is really pretty I absolutely loved it! But it's the fact that the story felt boring and poor. Some might enjoy it since Satoko plays as the well spoilers ahead more like the main lead on this season which was yeah enjoyable though was predictable if you have seen the Gou one. If you have seen the other seasons of Higurashi and if you compare it with this...one, this one isn't the best.

Started watching this before I read the VN, but seriously, try to read the last hour of Matsuribayashi and tell me that this is not a total disgrace and repudiation of everything Rika & friends learned in the OG Higurashi. Higurashi should not have been touched as a horror-story beyond the resolution of the OG. If they wanted to make this a slice of life comedy afterstory with more ryukishi SoL skits that would have FAR exceeded whatever the F this is.Could not help to watch the last four episodes, but I know it ended with dragon ball z fight and...some lame umineko references.

Of course, it should be pretty clear that these 2 seasons are just yet another attempt of milking the Higurashi IP but quite honestly speaking, in the oversaturated market of remasters and remakes this one has at least some soul to it. What I mean by this is that it knows where the original Higurashi could be worked on and which characters to primarily focus on.Ryukishi07 for instance (the Original Creator) said in a few...interviews that he regrets writing characters that are mainly on either part of the ""black/white"" spectrum, which obviously refers to characters like Teppei Hojo who in the original ""Tatarigoroshi"" chapter was just a complete piece of shit, with whom you could not really sympathize in the slightest unlike Miyo for example.This time around, tho, we get a twist in that he actually turns out to be a nice and caring uncle for Satoko. This again is pretty smart considering the events that we learn throughout the Story, and here is also where we see how much it pays respect to the original source material. The ""loopers"" being Rika and Satoko have the ability to affect people around them, specifically some that are really close to them. First off this is a pretty neat explanation as to why the main-cast could remember things from other Fragments in the Original, secondly this is also really cool because this gives a reasonable explanation for the change of heart in Teppei\'s case.This then leads to a ""what-if"" scenario that is so twisted it feels like holding up a ""negative"" in front of what happened in the ""Minagoroshi"" chapter in the Original. As you might be able to tell I did quite enjoy that and in fact, this part of the Story was easily my favorite. It also makes a great effort to explain how the Universe of Higurashi and Umineko is connected, which was a lot of fun to see as not only the dots between these two were connected but also was filled with a ton of references to the ""When They Cry"" series as a whole.Unfortunately, this is mostly everything positive I can mention. The advertising campaign for the show was really a mess, and therefore it was also pretty weird to see a lot of well... ""recycled"" content. It was new but also not.

If you're planning on watching Higurashi Sotsu, just don't. I really enjoyed Gou and was pretty excited for this, but this is absolute garbage. You're better off just watching Gou. Also I'll give a warning when I'm about to give a spoiler.To start off, Sotsu if boring as shit. The first like 10 episodes is just what happened in Gou, but through Satako's perspective. It's literally Gou but squished in 10 episodes with some explanations we didn't need. They could've easily fit this in one episode, but they decided to make it 70%...OF THE WHOLE SERIES. Most of it was just reusing old clips from Gou and sticking it into Sotsu. It was so hard to get through and I don't even know why I kept watching.Another thing I hate is the antagonists. I really like the idea of Satako being the antagonist of the series, but the execution was terrible. She feels so out of character and the things she does makes no sense. However, she's not the only antagonist. The other is this random character they threw in that is super uninteresting and forgettable. She is the one that gave Satako the looping power thing and exists for basically just that purpose and giving the one horn purple hair girl (I forgot her name 💀) an antagonist.A small thing I didn't like about it was not seeing the character's do stuff together. The character's relationships is a big thing I love about Higurashi, but it's basically absent in Sotsu. All of Sotsu is just Satako trying to make Rika suffer, and you don't get to see any new interactions between all the characters. This isn't a big deal though, just a nitpick.The last thing I hate is the ending (SPOILERS). The ending is just a big dragon ball fight between Satako and Rika that lasts for like 30 minutes. I was really into it for like the first 2 minutes, but after that it's just really boring. Then the fight ends, the other characters come to pick them up, Rika goes to the new school without Satako, and neither of them win.

There\'s not much in the way of progression throughout the bulk of the series.

"", 'Higurashi Sotsu. Where do I even start with this one? There is just so much that is done wrong that I can’t explain well at all, so I’ll just give up and try to keep my criticisms relatively short. Basically, Sotsu is supposed to serve as the answer arcs to Higurashi Gou, bundling the two of them as some sort of “new” Higurashi series. If you haven’t watched the Higurashi series, don’t worry, because you’ll be just as confused watching Sotsu as people who are caught up with the series.Firstly, I gotta say that I’m not a huge fan of the updated visuals in both...Gou and Sotsu. The original, while somewhat imperfect and dated now, was a lot more gritty and fitting for something in the horror genre. Meanwhile, we have bright colours that radiate from the screen and make you feel like you’re watching some magical girl show. I also can’t say that much of the music was memorable to me in Sotsu, if there was any. Either it was reused tracks, which I don’t mind, or some atmospheric track that was turned way the fuck down. Other than those minor gripes, I’d say that the overall atmosphere created by Sotsu was not that bad.All right, now for the story. Continuing off from the very straight-forward explanation given to us at the end of Higurashi Gou, we are shown the arcs of Gou in a different light this time. Apparently, they’re supposed to be from Satoko’s POV now in order to really hammer into our heads that she can loop now and she did all of the bad things in Gou. What can I say about the answer arcs other than…they exist? Seriously, nothing about these arcs “answer” anything because Gou didn’t leave anything ambiguous. There was nothing to answer because we already knew that Satoko was a time-looper. She did it; end of story. To summarise it cleanly: If you’ve watched Higurashi Gou, you’ve watched the first 12 or so episodes of Sotsu. I wish that was an exaggeration.It doesn’t get much better outside of the entire season’s worth of recaps. The creators realised midway that they can’t just make an entire season that’s just the previous season condensed and that they actually have to add the bare minimum that qualifies as substance to the show. Thus, attempts at a resolution are made with conflicts between Rika and Satoko as well as Eua and Hanyuu. However, some of this resolution feels so out of place that I think that this show’s tags need to be redefined. Both of their motives during the conflict are also really dumb and eventually boil down into a resolution that seems to be trying to escaping from looking at those motives. Although the season started very much not ambiguous, by the end I was left utterly disappointed by the sheer amount of questions that either remained unanswered or were shoe-horned in the end along with such a dumb resolution.The characters could also use some work. Nothing about any of the normal Higurashi cast except Rika and Satoko are compelling in this season. They’re really just pawns for the two of them to play around with. Shion, for one, is basically nowhere to be found in this entire season. Satoshi as a character as well as his overall significance is just gone as well. As mentioned before, a good portion of Sotsu is just recaps of the previous season, so it is hardly surprising that not many characters are very compelling or interesting.Although I really wanted to see more Higurashi content following the original series and Gou, I could have done without Sotsu. The lack of new content, good motives for the characters, ambiguity, and the sheer stupidity make this quite an unpleasant experience to watch. If you really want a resolution to Gou, I’d place my bets on that manga series coming out that’s making different “answer arcs.” The bottom line is, whether you’re a huge fan or could not care less about Higurashi, you had best not waste your time on Sotsu.

A bad way to revive the series, with the only positive being the true ending and seeing the original characters interact with modern quality, otherwise it is a waste of time to watch this, unless you are a die hard fan that wants to consume every single when they cry work (it may be a worse experience for you) the box for this one, a bit unecessary as it was already finished in the previous anime, but as a viewer it was good to watch.

Higurashi has been a huge part of my life since I discovered in back in 2011; the first two seasons were phenomenal with Rei being and Kira... so when the reboot was announced, I was hype. It was soon revealed to be a new series called ""Gou"". I\'m mixed on this deception, as Ryukishi07 is known for his tricking of the viewer. After a mix bag of Gou, Sotsu was released and it was... god awful.Everyone gives Endless Eight from Haruhi shit for showing the same scenario eight times in a row. Well, Sotsu goes that for 13 episodes...straight with little changes that add nothing to the story. The only good part of the arcs is the first one, Onidamashi, which has new scenes. It goes downhill from episode 4 till the end. Each week I was hoping for something new, only for the same scenes from Gou.Satoko has gone full villain here, without any remorse on using and killing her friends. A hero gone bad is one of favorite tropes, but here it\'s just bad. Satoko gets away with literally everything she does, no matter how impossible. When she decides to make Mion her target to inject a syringe, it is shown off screen without any explanation. They are both outside, in public, broad daylight, and Satoko is able to do it without any suspicion. Mion was fully awake and only her back to Satoko; how in the hell did she not notice an injection of a needle. Ryukishi is known for his attention to detail, with one hidden thing revealing the whole twist so this is just lazy. Sotsu just shows Satoko unfairly winning every loop without a problem and OH MY GOD THE GODDAMM EYES! Every. Other. Scene. Her eyes will go red, as if the viewer forgot she was evil and lying. If you did a drinking game, you would die in five seconds. She only shows remorse when she plans to kill Teppei, her abusive uncle that is responsible for some of the worse loops in the show. It\'s bizarre this is the character she hesitates.Gou setup that Satoko became a looper due to her abandonment issues from Rika. Sotsu says ""Fuck that; it\'s because she doesn\'t wanna study!"" No joke, Rika and Satoko\'s ""Dragon Ball Z SSJ4"" battle is all due to studying; none of the other issues are brought up and it makes Satoko seem like an even worse person. At the end of Nekodamashi, Satoko is revealed to be the culprit and we are left on a cliffhanger with her holding Rika at gunpoint. It is not shown what happens next until over a year, and all of Sotsu just shown the same damm scenes leading up to it. The results? Satoko shooting Rika than herself in five seconds, completely destroying the hype. Rika didn\'t even outsmart her to get to this point; she got lucky.Rika herself honestly is godawful in Gou and Sotsu. Whatever lessons she learned from those 100 years of looping goes out the window. She returns to her ""oh woe is me"" mindset. In these new loops, she could experiment a little bit: ask Takano for help, Ooishi, Irie, literally anyone in the show would help her, but she stands in the sidelines and just lets the same events happen. The original ending of Kai showed Rika that her friends can help her and overcome the trap of fate.The ending of Sotsu is atrocious; Rika and Satoko go out of nowhere shounen and fight for the McGuffin that could end either of them; after a whole episode, Rika abandons it, where Hanyuu (another waste of a character) uses it to end Satoko\'s loop with benefits, Not Featherine From Umineko. In the end, Keiichi, Mion, and Rena (remember them?) give Rika and Satoko a forced speech about how friends don\'t have to be together all the time; Rika suddenly forgives Satoko for everything and goes separate ways. It\'s so bad... Satoko got away with everything she did with no repercussions.The link between Higurashi and Umineko goes absolutely nowhere. It is heavily implied that Rika and Satoko are Witches from Umineko, major players in the story. And whatever MILF Hanyuu was is Featherine, the most powerful Witch in the series. Ryukishi actively toys with the audience in a way that comes off as lazy; as a big Umineko fan, it is downright annoying he refused to make a connection aside from a forced speech at the end.Overall, Sotsu is garbage that insults the original tale of Hinamizawa 1983; I\'m gonna pretend it isn\'t canon, and no, not because Rika and Satoko are lovers. It\'s fine if they do, but honestly they are a completely toxic relationship. There are way better lesbian relationships in anime, hell, Ange and Mammon from Umineko is much better.

Please do not watch Sotsu, only listen to the amazing opening.', 'It\'s inevitable - friendships are going to change over time. Your best friend from your childhood may move to a different city and have a family there. Or they may lose interest in the things you shared and connected over. You have to let these things go sometimes, or at least allow them to change with the time in order for it to become something new. Because trust me, if you cling to all you\'ve known and refuse to let new stuff in, you may just end up like Satoko in this godforsaken ""sequelboot"" of a show.The premise going into this one was actually an...idea with a lot of potential - two friends with polar opposite views of how their future together should look like. Rika wants to go to a prestigious all-girls-school to experience high society in contrast to the rural life in Hinamizawa, whereas Satoko can\'t seem to fit in at the school at all and feels abandoned by her friend. She wants them to just live together in the small town of Hinamizawa forever. A bored god ends up passing on to her the same ability Rika possesses and hijinks ensue. Well, I say hijinks, but most people would probably call it tasteless degenerate torture porn for 12 straight episodes. Sotsu aims to provide the ""answer arcs"" to the ""question arcs"" posed by Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou, its direct predecessor, trying to recreate the structure the original Higurashi had, with just one major flaw... there is no intrigue, and no answers required. It\'s downright parodic.In the original show, there was actually a huge plot involving a conspiracy in the background of it all, and each question arc indeed provided some answers to the overall picture, as well as what the protagonists actually needed to do to overcome their fate and make way for a good future for everyone. In Sotsu however, the ""answer"" is always the same: Satoko can infect people with Hinamizawa Syndrome now, and she has a gun. That\'s it. Her aim is always to crush Rika with the most devastating plots she can come up with, you know, the girl who\'s supposed to be her best friend and whom she loves so much that she wants to never be apart from her. I am not going to comment further on how marvelous it is to make the most tortured, saddest, abused character from the original show into a psychopath abusor who cackles delighted upon seeing her best friend and everyone around her suffer because trust me... I\'d just fly into a pathetic sad rage. Instead, I am just gonna look at what it does to the show overall.Higurashi has always felt a little dissociative, and that was by design. You had the kids in the close-knit town of Hinamizawa just hang out and have fun, and the flipside to that was all the violent murders that could happen depending on who caught the devastating illness this time around. Though the core of the outbreak could always be found in human sentiment. Jealousy, anger, alienation, distrust - these kinds of emotions were always there and with just a little viral influence spiraled out of control and into a tragedy. Sure, it may have not gotten that far if it wasn\'t for the paranonid delusions the virus caused, but it still told a lot about its main cast of six and their burdens. In this one however... it throws all that out of the window and instead goes for ""bad person makes bad things happen because they find delight in it"". I am absolutely ready to accept the reading I\'ve seen of this show as a parody. But even if that was the intention, that doesn\'t change anything about the fact that unless you\'re super into torture porn - which I am not - I just don\'t think there\'s a whole lot to enjoy about this one.There is a lot of reused content from Gou, not unlike a certain season of a show called Haruhi Suzumiya, that just reuses the same scenes with slight alterations or little moments of a different perspective inbetween. It\'s ungodly boring because you see know exactly where everything is going, yet it will still take 3 episodes to retread the same ground. You see good people suffering. Except there is no rhyme or reason to it, because you know exactly that the whole point is just to make Rika sad. You know, the person who spent a hundred years reliving the same couple days and dying horribly each and every time. Then there is sort of an ""interlude"" of two goddesses who are basically having a fight over... what exactly now? One feels empathy for the fate of Rika and Satoko while the other just sits back and enjoys the torture porn. Not to kinkshame, but... thats just not cool.In the end, there is only one saving grace in this show, and that is the conclusion. Mind you, it\'s not a saving grace in the sense of ""this was totally worth sitting through 12 episodes of torture porn, yes sirree"". It\'s merely a final episode that moves on from the torture porn and instead just lets two childhood friends have a good ol fight over where their future is heading. What starts off with a supernatural battle flicking the girls through time and space eventually culminates in a fist fight between two twelve year olds, at the end of which they come to reaffirm their feelings for each other and arrive at the conclusion that it\'s okay if they just separate for a while and each do their own thing. If you disregard the fact that they both accepted the risk of killing each other for good with a magical sword, that conclusion is indeed much in the spirit of the original Higurashi. I may have even considered it worth the experience if it didn\'t involve sitting through so much bullshit beforehand.In the end, I can\'t say that I regret watching the Higurashi Sequelboot in its entirety. Seeing all these characters in their pretty modern designs and just having some of the original Higurashi recreated was fun. Listening to all these voice actors reprise their roles from back when was fun. The atmosphere was tense and well-built - in Gou at least - which was also fun. And ultimately, the idea that Rika now has an eternal human companion is also to some degree comforting. And while Higurashi is one of the few shows that could actually benefit from a modern recreation, seeing this show just do its own thing was also interesting in its own right. I don\'t think I can recommend it overall - though if you\'re curious, it\'s more than enough to just watch the first and the two, maybe three final episodes for this one. Or better yet, just rewatch the original show and appreciate it with all your knowledge going in. This show definitely reminded me of my affection for the original, and while there are better means to that end, I sure think this one at least merits a closer look. idea with a lot of potential - two friends with polar opposite views of how their future together should look like.

It\'s disappointment after disappointment, with a sprinkle of missed opportunities, loopholes and lack of common sense. It is an insult to the Hirashi series. This and Gou shouldn\'t exist.  I find zero redeeming qualities on these two new seasons.The animation is lazy, but I would maybe forgive that if it weren\'t for how bad the story is...The motivations of the characters, the reasons behind their actions are a complete lack of common sense. It is infuriating and boring to watch.While the original seasons of Higurashi ""repeated"" a lot of the same stories, they all came with new information, riveting...misteries and excitment. The repeated stories in Gou offer nothing, since at the beginning of the season you are told exactly why the tragedies happen: Satoko injects people. So what\'s the point? You learn nothing.To add insult to injury, they add Satoshi waking up on his own (????) right at the end, and do nothing with it! Nothing!What is the purpose of this, who greenlit this, what were they thinking! That is a far more interesting mistery than whatever this anime tried to give us.Avoid. misteries and excitment.

Don\'t come for me if I spoil you.Let\'s just be quick with this, Gou was kind of messy in spots but had moments that stuck with me.But Sotsu is just a mess story wise. So much so that it makes Gou seem like a fluke.STORYSotsu is the prime example of an anime that doesn\'t know how to use it\'s time well at all. This is a 15 episode anime with about five episodes worth of content. Calling it a sequel is such a stretch..Sotsu is...a gloried recap of the first season. But this time, it fills in the gaps for why the events in Gou transpired. Sadly though, these explanations start to screw up the pacing and it feels like the writer is stalling for time.Not only that, but the anime fully replays scenes from Gou like the audience all has short term memory loss and that messes up the pacing so much.Wanna know what\'s great about it though? The arc i enjoyed the least in Gou, had the most time dedicated to it in this season. And it\'s totally not boring, predictable,and a slap in the face of what I liked in the previous season. Not.At.AllI will admitt the first couple of episodes were really good, it put a bit of a spin on Rena\'s arc that I thought made it more realistic and more brutal with the implications.The rest of this season takes away more and more tension.There are other aspects that do continue the story, but they make no sense with the context of Gou.And finally when the"" sequel"" part kicks in at the last two episodes, it was so stupid that it felt like a prank on fans of higurashi.I\'m not kidding.The ending was just nuttier than a squirrels\' used condom.And not in a good way.It almost impressed me how the finale was so over the top and contradicts the entire tone that made higurashi iconic in the first place.i can\'t even describe it.Just imagine The Shining,but at the end of the movie it turns into Avengers Endgame,Did you imagine it? Good, because it\'s even dumber when you see it in this anime.i enjoyed it a lot though, because it was just so silly and over the top, I had a dumbass smile on my face the whole time.It had references to the original and played as just a long round of Smash Bros with Higurashi locations.i could see an episode like that working better in an anime that wasn\'t…. y\'know Higurashi Naku Koro Ni,Did it make up for the other 13 episodes though? Lol no.Jokes aside,Its legitimately the worst feeling in the world to like something,get hyped for it,defend it,and then watch it turn to shit and feel so dumb for even liking it in the first place. I swear to Mother Mary that I don\'t hate everything, I just hate disappointmentART AND OTHER TECHNICAL CRAP. -_-Funny enough, the technical aspects of Sotsu are basically the same as what I said in my Gou review.(probably because this season is half recap) but I digress.The voice acting is still strong at least.the op was catchy...Thats all i got for ya. You want criticism?. Everytime the detective was smoking, the cgi smoke looked weird,but that doesnt matter, ppl are literally dying.CHARACTER ""s""For Characters,I honestly didnt get too much more development for them outside of Gou. Most of them are just going crazy,then Satoko’s like “pew-pew” and the arc is over. The tension is just not there so when they try to replicate the brutal scenes from the original, it just doesn\'t have much effect outside of “ouch thats gotta hurt”.Point is, if you care about Rena, Keiichi, or Mion/Shion, just watch the og, it gives them more screen time.  90% of the scenes involving Rikka are just replayed scenes from Gou so no worries there. Lets talk about the true MVP, the deadliest sharp shooting sniper with over 2k confirmed no-scopes, Satoko Houjo.My favorite thing about Gou was the absolutely devastating relationship with her uncle, who ended up becoming redeemed after multiple time loops.While trying to make himself a better person, he tries to make amends with Satoko,but she couldn\'t fully bond with him after all of the trauma she has experience in the past loops.That episode in Gou destroyed me emotionally, i was on the verge of tears. But in this season, those tears were shed for nothing because Satoko straight up goes into full sociopath mode. Manipulating and gaslighting not only her uncle.but the entire village of Hinamizawa, and fucking with basically everyone.She doesnt even seem to grow close to her uncle, she sees him as just a pawn mostly to do what she needs to.I couldnt even enjoy them actually acting like a family,because the whole time i’m like “Satoko is lowkey manipulating you right now.”What truly frustrates me though, is that the actions she does almost contradicts her goal from Gou. Her end game basically was to live in a loop where her and Rikka can stay together forever , but this season,her actions just look like she is just causing trouble just for the sake of it.Her actions cause Rikka’s death many times,bringing her more and more trauma,and she legit says at one point that she\'s doing all of this to just make her suffer.There was this part in Sotsu that tries to explain the numerous time jumps is why she is acting so maliciously but when it happens, it doesn\'t make sense, isn\'t foreshadowed, and just doesn\'t get explained.Go figure.Even if i do go into detail, it just wouldn\'t make sense, its that messy.Its just a ripple of mess that makes me so confused, that i tone out.ENJOYMENTIdk if I have said this before, probably have, but I think the worst thing you can do to an audience is bore them. I stand by that. I think the score I\'m giving to this is a technicality. Its the heavy lack of tension or intrigue that really did it for me. Right now, I\'m struggling to find that much i enjoyed outside of episode 14/15.I don’t hate this anime, like others do. It\'s not deeply disappointing like TPN s2, nor was it so bad it made me hate-watch it like GOH or Kaifuckyou.I was just bored through a large majority of this show. The violence or whatever didnt really affect me since the story was messy,sure there\'s fanservice to the ones who liked OG higurashi,but the only moments that gave me any emotions were just scenes from Gou that were replayed.The ending was enjoyable to watch but for all of the wrong reasons, instead of praise for ep 14, people are straight up memeing on it. So I don\'t know man. I\'m disappointed ofc, but Sotsu made me too exhausted to even be disappointed.Guess that\'s the anime community in a nutshell:memes, exhaustion, and disappointment.Overall-4/10Seriously tho, if Satoko gets put in smash, I will rate this 10/10 a gloried recap of the first season. But this time, it fills in the gaps for why the events in Gou transpired.

Most of them are just going crazy,then Satoko’s like “pew-pew” and the arc is over. The tension is just not there so when they try to replicate the brutal scenes from the original, it just doesn\'t have much effect outside of “ouch thats gotta hurt”.Point is, if you care about Rena, Keiichi, or Mion/Shion, just watch the og, it gives them more screen time.  90% of the scenes involving Rikka are just replayed scenes from Gou so no worries there. Lets talk about the true MVP, the deadliest sharp shooting sniper with over 2k confirmed no-scopes, Satoko Houjo.My favorite thing about Gou was the absolutely devastating relationship with her uncle, who ended up becoming redeemed after multiple time loops.While trying to make himself a better person, he tries to make amends with Satoko,but she couldn\'t fully bond with him after all of the trauma she has experience in the past loops.That episode in Gou destroyed me emotionally, i was on the verge of tears. But in this season, those tears were shed for nothing because Satoko straight up goes into full sociopath mode. Manipulating and gaslighting not only her uncle.but the entire village of Hinamizawa, and fucking with basically everyone.She doesnt even seem to grow close to her uncle, she sees him as just a pawn mostly to do what she needs to.I couldnt even enjoy them actually acting like a family,because the whole time i’m like “Satoko is lowkey manipulating you right now.”What truly frustrates me though, is that the actions she does almost contradicts her goal from Gou. Her end game basically was to live in a loop where her and Rikka can stay together forever , but this season,her actions just look like she is just causing trouble just for the sake of it.Her actions cause Rikka’s death many times,bringing her more and more trauma,and she legit says at one point that she\'s doing all of this to just make her suffer.There was this part in Sotsu that tries to explain the numerous time jumps is why she is acting so maliciously but when it happens, it doesn\'t make sense, isn\'t foreshadowed, and just doesn\'t get explained.Go figure.Even if i do go into detail, it just wouldn\'t make sense, its that messy.Its just a ripple of mess that makes me so confused, that i tone out.ENJOYMENTIdk if I have said this before, probably have, but I think the worst thing you can do to an audience is bore them. I stand by that. I think the score I\'m giving to this is a technicality. Its the heavy lack of tension or intrigue that really did it for me. Right now, I\'m struggling to find that much i enjoyed outside of episode 14/15.I don’t hate this anime, like others do. It\'s not deeply disappointing like TPN s2, nor was it so bad it made me hate-watch it like GOH or Kaifuckyou.I was just bored through a large majority of this show. The violence or whatever didnt really affect me since the story was messy,sure there\'s fanservice to the ones who liked OG higurashi,but the only moments that gave me any emotions were just scenes from Gou that were replayed.The ending was enjoyable to watch but for all of the wrong reasons, instead of praise for ep 14, people are straight up memeing on it. So I don\'t know man. I\'m disappointed ofc, but Sotsu made me too exhausted to even be disappointed.Guess that\'s the anime community in a nutshell:memes, exhaustion, and disappointment.Overall-4/10Seriously tho, if Satoko gets put in smash, I will rate this 10/10', '*SCRATCHES NECK**Puts aside the criticism*""NAANIi...!?""STORY :(""Naaze Kamisama?!"")This season made me feel so stupid... lol!

This reviews spoils Gou and Sotsu in their entirety!!As a long time fan of the when they cry universe I have to say that Sotsu is such a polarising/conflicting story/anime for me. I watched the original anime and I've read a few of the vn chapters (Still going through them, but I've seen most of all of them on youtube, so I do know all of them and a lot of the differences between them and the anime.) I've also read Umineko in it's entirety.I watched Higurashi Gou and when I found out it was a sequel I was so hyped to see...a new story with my favorite characters of all time. I was also cautious but my hype/hope was way bigger than my fear. And I loved Gou so much. from beginning to end I loved it so much,a nd when Sotsu was announced I was so hyped. I was really intrigued by Satoko as a villain and was so curious with their plans with her.I watched Sotsu every week as a new episode was released and loved a lot of them. Especially the first arc Oniakashji-hen is still one of my favorite of all the anime arc's combiend from all anime seasons (Not from the vn though, none of the arsc from the anime can even hold a candle to a single one of the vn arcs, omg)Maybe it's copium or hopium but after rewatching oniakashi-hen, I can still say that  episode 3 from sotsu (Oniakashi-hen chapter 3) is still my favorite anime episode of all of Higurashi probably. I loved that we finally got to see Rika's reaction to a tragedy and I loved the irony of this arc with all of the things that normally add to keichi-s paranoia now fuleing Rena's fear that Keichi is on to hear. And that Rika scene outside of Keichi-house is such a darkly comedic scene and it hurts so much.The recaps where another really frustrating and annoying thing in Sotsu. The first two arcs were fine in that regard in my opinion because all of them were viewed through a new lens and with a new buildup to them. But near the end of tatariakashi-hen and especially in Kagurashi-hen they became so unbearable. And I think another big reason for that is that the episodes where released weekly. I think they should've tried to figure something else out Like a movie/ or movies or something. Or just release each arc in one go so we don't have to wait and wait and be dissapointed.And the worst part about sotsu for me is the final arc Kagurashi-hena and Tatariakashi-hen part 4 (Sotsu episode 10). Lets's start with Tatariakashi-hen part 4. They did that scne with Satoko being split in two and the 'good' satoko being killed. I think this was that they intended to be the reason for the akashi arcs existence and their pay off. I don't have any evidence for this, it's my one interpretation but I think this is what the akashi arcs were building to, the moment that Satoko regained her humanity and she finally broke. The tollof all her previous loops finally breaking her. The thing is this scene was pretty poory handled in my opniion. They didn;t really explain what we were seeing and who this 'good' satoko even was. Was she theer all along? Was it just piece Satoko or human satoko takign control? We don't know. They also never erally went back to this scene until the final 5 minutes in teh final episode in like 10 second.I think this is what ruined Sotsu. Because this scene wasn't handled the right way., all teh akashi-arcs lost their payoff and in that also list their worth. This made Sotsu feel even more like only recaps and just like a dissapointment.The second worse thing about Sotsu was Kagurashi-hen. This arc had the most recaps even though it was meant to be the conculsion. After Satokowashi we knew how all of the Nekodamashi loops happened. You didn't have to waste time on showing a 10 second clip of Satoko being evil after a bunch of recaps. This was Sotsu's second biggest mistake.The third were the final two episodes. The way they ended was really rushed in my opinion. If only they either wasted less epiosdes on recaps or just gave us one more arc a lot of the feeling of being rushed would have been being made less. It would have still ben rushed but atleast it would eb a lor less frustrating. The last arc didn't even need to be an epic showdown between rika and satoko or evryone against Eua, no. We literally just needed an epilogue of like 3/4 episodes to see how the bond between Rika and Satoko ended up, to see how the club members were holding up, and especially and I mean especially to see satoko's mental state. Like we really needed a Saikoroshi-hen for Satoko or something. I'm really hoping they'll still do that in the form of an ova or something.This whole season rested no Satoko's shoulders, and yet Satoko was the one character with the least amount of development. Just one more arc all centered about her coming to terms with the looping and with what she had done like saikoroshi0hen would have fixed so many issues in my opinion.To conclude, after rewatchign it recently I have to say I don't sotsu as much as I did, I even want to love it. It just makes me really sad and dissapointed. All the promise that Gou and the first arc of sotsu had was just thrown away and just bot used in a good way. I hope that the Meguri manga will be better. I do recommend watchign Sotsu if you're a fan, but I recommend reading the Higurashi Gou and Meguri manga way more, since they seem to be doing things differently. I have hope that the manga will be better, now that they got feedback from sotsu and they can improve. a new story with my favorite characters of all time.

As both a sequel and a jumping on point, I thought it’s balancing of the original mystery and this new mystery was poor. It’s pacing was also not as good as previously and the new mystery itself wasn’t as enticing as the original mystery. But despite that though, I was still looking forward to this new season because with all of the problems that Gou had, they were more targeted specifically at Gou so we can see for what...Sotsu is meant to be, a follow up to Gou. Remove all of the baggage from previous seasons and just focus on what we have now. Besides, Gou did end on a high note at least and it wasn’t the most disappointing horror sequel I watched lately, AM I RIGHT THE PROMISED NEVERLAND?So did I find Higurashi Sotsu an improvement over Gou? Well if were to ask me at the beginning of Sotsu, I would have said yes but after watching it, I would probably say no.I think one of the main points as to me liking Sotsu a bit more at the beginning is the direction when it comes to the show’s horror. The arcs definently had a better horror feel to it than Gou as the horror aspects were better in Sotsu than they were in Gou. Take the first arc, “Oniakashi-hen,”of Sotsu. It acts as a retelling of Gou’s first arc but from Rena’s perspective instead of Keiichi. The horror is more effective because it’s better paced as well as better directed as we see Rena’s mind slowly warp and her morality changes as the situation continues. Despite we knew what was going to happen at the end, it was all about the how and the why, which echoes how the original Higurashi handled its story arcs. But despite the direction being better, there is still problems with Sotsu’s story. But before that, there is one crucial element to Sotsu I need to talk about first.So Satoko being the big bad villain of these new entries of Higurashi is still kind of weird. Mainly because we’re all used to how Satoko was before, but to see her now kind of warps your opinion as to how you feel about Satoko as a character. Now, Gou left plenty of hints that there was more to Satoko than meets the eye. While we do see the reason for her actions in Gou, Sotsu is where she takes centre stage as we find out what she had been doing behind the scenes in these arcs. It has been somewhat engaging seeing her slowly become more and more of a sociopath and the lengths she makes just to break Rika and never leave Satoko’s side. While you will see no reason to route for her or relate to her as her reason is basically petty obsession combined with most likely the Hinamiazawa Syndrome, she does make a good foil for Rika as someone who she will least suspect and does a good job as to keep her intentions hidden. But while she acts as a good foil for Rika, I wouldn’t say she is a great antagonist in Gou and Sotsu. You see, Takano, for all her killings and obsessions to get what she wants, was at least sympathetic as shown in her backstory and just wanted to prove that she and her guardian parent, were correct after everyone shot down their research. Satoko’s motivation is more petty and self desired so it makes her hard to sympathise.Back to the story, pretty much the entirety of Sotsu is explaining how Satoko affected each arc in Gou and here lies one of my main problems with Sotsu. It spends far too long simply showing how Satoko affected each arc. Now, Higurashi arcs have existed like this before where we see the same arc from a different perspective, the answer arcs as they are called. But they were used mainly to help establish some answers to the overall mystery or simply explain it when the time was right. Here, the mystery was already explained in Gou, so Sotsu is basically just showing us how it went down. But there lies the issue, it spends too much time showing how these arcs went down behind the scenes instead of getting to where everyone wanted to be which was what happens next after the cliffhanger in episode 18 of Higurashi Gou? The pacing slows to a crawl and by the time we get to it, there isn’t enough time for Sotsu to really get into the inevitable showdown between Rika and Satoko. The 15 episode season length does not help Sotsu because you are spending so much time explaining what happened, you aren’t giving enough time as what happens next. So despite the better direction and the a better horror pacing, the story does not pace itself better. And don’t get me started as to how Rika found out Satoko was acting Sus this entire time.I also haven’t mentioned the newest character yet. Well sort of new because I bet Umineko fans were creaming when she got officially revealed. Despite looking like Featherine from Umineko No Naku Koro Ni, she actually is called Eua in Higurashi. Her role in this feels like that she has a bigger role in the grand scheme of things but it never seems to be the case. She is mainly used as a plot device to give Satoko the ability to go to different world fragments and to laugh at people’s misfortune. She doesn’t really do anything else since this is mainly focused on Satoko and her goal to break Rika into submission. In fact, it’s not really just Eua that feels useless in Sotsu. Keiichi, Rena, Mion and Shion don’t feel nowhere near as relevant as they should be. Like, isn’t Shion meant to act like a big sister to Satoko due to her promise to Satoshi? That fact doesn’t play into this at all in Sotsu. That fact could have had a significant impact on Satoko’s morality. In fact, all of them could have played a significant role. But no, they act more as plot devices to show how far Satoko has fallen and how she treats them just to help break Rika. They have little impact to the overall plot and are used for the show’s more violent scenes. It never felt like that in Higurashi Kai, even when Rika was the central protagonist. Why does it feel like that now?As for the animation and soundtrack, it remains pretty much the same but at this point, the blood animation is getting too ridiculous. It felt like there was more blood than there should be actually spilled and just drenching the place. It’s just so unnecessary and silly that there is this much blood spilled.As for the new OP and ED, they’re both great. ""Analogy"" by Ayane is good at setting an atmosphere  and all of the symbolism and hints as to how the narrative will play out. For example, as soon as Rika closes her eye and looks away, Satoko opens her eye as if she is ready to strike. It’s little things like that that make it one of the better openings. But if you ask me, the ED is better. ""Missing Promise"" by Konomi Suzuki continues that great art style from Gou’s ED and uses it again here and it looks just as good. The way it also shows how Satoko and Rika are kind of joined from the hip and the friendship they developed over the years (until their inevitable clash). The song goes well with the visuals and they’re both good at timing to one another as well. A really good ED that would probably be my second or third favourite ED this season; with Vanitas clearly number one and a fight with Dragon Maid’s ED for the second.Might as well talk a positive because this last bit certainly won’t be. As I watched Sotsu and I saw what was unfolding on screen, the more I didn’t like this new season of Higurashi. With the mystery essentially solved in Gou, it was mostly just re-watching Gou again but from Satoko’s perspective, only really getting interesting by the end of the third arc, which was around episode eleven. The seasons improved horror kept me engaged at least. But what got me to hate Sotsu was finding out what happened next after the cliffhanger. Which feels like utter bulls**t. Something like this wouldn’t feel out of place in Umineko, but since this is Higurashi, it feels so out of place. At that point as well, it was the Rika and Satoko show and the rest of the main cast are just afterthoughts. Just there to be shocked. I will say it again, it never felt that way in Kai, why does it feel like that now? Instead, it’s a shounen battle to the death because that’s what Higurashi is all about right?So if it ain’t clear right now, I didn’t like Sotsu, in fact, I would say I hated it. Despite having some positive feelings towards it in the beginning, it fell off fast. There is no well told, well connected storyline that doesn’t use its excellent cast of characters well that kind of bottles it towards the end and I just feel hollow inside because I ended up hating an entry of my favourite anime series. I ended up liking this less than f**king Higurashi Kira for f**k sake. How did you do that?Looking back at when this new series of Higurashi was first marketed as a remake, I ask you, would have it been better off as just a remake? It wouldn’t confuse new viewers for starters but it wouldn’t be a bad idea as Higurashi could have done with a facelift and be given a series with better animation. As the OVAs proved, continuing Higurashi’s story was never going to be easy as the original story was wrapped up nicely. Could Gou and Sotsu succeeded in continuing the story?  Of course, anything could happen. But in execution, it didn’t really work did it? There were glimpses of something that could have been successful, but it didn’t work out broadly and what we are left with, both Gou and Sotsu, is a poorly thought out anime which breaks what did not need fixing. To see Higurashi and The Promised Neverland just f**k it up in the same year is deflating as a horror anime fan. To use and overused quote“My disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.”Story: 3/10Characters: 3/10Animation: 4/10Sound: 9/10My Personal Enjoyment: 3/10Overall Score: 4.4/10Recommendation: Don’t Bother Sotsu is meant to be, a follow up to Gou.

The pacing slows to a crawl and by the time we get to it, there isn’t enough time for Sotsu to really get into the inevitable showdown between Rika and Satoko. The 15 episode season length does not help Sotsu because you are spending so much time explaining what happened, you aren’t giving enough time as what happens next. So despite the better direction and the a better horror pacing, the story does not pace itself better. And don’t get me started as to how Rika found out Satoko was acting Sus this entire time.I also haven’t mentioned the newest character yet. Well sort of new because I bet Umineko fans were creaming when she got officially revealed. Despite looking like Featherine from Umineko No Naku Koro Ni, she actually is called Eua in Higurashi. Her role in this feels like that she has a bigger role in the grand scheme of things but it never seems to be the case. She is mainly used as a plot device to give Satoko the ability to go to different world fragments and to laugh at people’s misfortune. She doesn’t really do anything else since this is mainly focused on Satoko and her goal to break Rika into submission. In fact, it’s not really just Eua that feels useless in Sotsu. Keiichi, Rena, Mion and Shion don’t feel nowhere near as relevant as they should be. Like, isn’t Shion meant to act like a big sister to Satoko due to her promise to Satoshi? That fact doesn’t play into this at all in Sotsu. That fact could have had a significant impact on Satoko’s morality. In fact, all of them could have played a significant role. But no, they act more as plot devices to show how far Satoko has fallen and how she treats them just to help break Rika. They have little impact to the overall plot and are used for the show’s more violent scenes. It never felt like that in Higurashi Kai, even when Rika was the central protagonist. Why does it feel like that now?As for the animation and soundtrack, it remains pretty much the same but at this point, the blood animation is getting too ridiculous. It felt like there was more blood than there should be actually spilled and just drenching the place. It’s just so unnecessary and silly that there is this much blood spilled.As for the new OP and ED, they’re both great. ""Analogy"" by Ayane is good at setting an atmosphere  and all of the symbolism and hints as to how the narrative will play out. For example, as soon as Rika closes her eye and looks away, Satoko opens her eye as if she is ready to strike. It’s little things like that that make it one of the better openings. But if you ask me, the ED is better. ""Missing Promise"" by Konomi Suzuki continues that great art style from Gou’s ED and uses it again here and it looks just as good. The way it also shows how Satoko and Rika are kind of joined from the hip and the friendship they developed over the years (until their inevitable clash). The song goes well with the visuals and they’re both good at timing to one another as well. A really good ED that would probably be my second or third favourite ED this season; with Vanitas clearly number one and a fight with Dragon Maid’s ED for the second.Might as well talk a positive because this last bit certainly won’t be. As I watched Sotsu and I saw what was unfolding on screen, the more I didn’t like this new season of Higurashi. With the mystery essentially solved in Gou, it was mostly just re-watching Gou again but from Satoko’s perspective, only really getting interesting by the end of the third arc, which was around episode eleven. The seasons improved horror kept me engaged at least. But what got me to hate Sotsu was finding out what happened next after the cliffhanger. Which feels like utter bulls**t. Something like this wouldn’t feel out of place in Umineko, but since this is Higurashi, it feels so out of place. At that point as well, it was the Rika and Satoko show and the rest of the main cast are just afterthoughts. Just there to be shocked. I will say it again, it never felt that way in Kai, why does it feel like that now? Instead, it’s a shounen battle to the death because that’s what Higurashi is all about right?So if it ain’t clear right now, I didn’t like Sotsu, in fact, I would say I hated it. Despite having some positive feelings towards it in the beginning, it fell off fast. There is no well told, well connected storyline that doesn’t use its excellent cast of characters well that kind of bottles it towards the end and I just feel hollow inside because I ended up hating an entry of my favourite anime series. I ended up liking this less than f**king Higurashi Kira for f**k sake. How did you do that?Looking back at when this new series of Higurashi was first marketed as a remake, I ask you, would have it been better off as just a remake? It wouldn’t confuse new viewers for starters but it wouldn’t be a bad idea as Higurashi could have done with a facelift and be given a series with better animation. As the OVAs proved, continuing Higurashi’s story was never going to be easy as the original story was wrapped up nicely. Could Gou and Sotsu succeeded in continuing the story?  Of course, anything could happen. But in execution, it didn’t really work did it? There were glimpses of something that could have been successful, but it didn’t work out broadly and what we are left with, both Gou and Sotsu, is a poorly thought out anime which breaks what did not need fixing. To see Higurashi and The Promised Neverland just f**k it up in the same year is deflating as a horror anime fan. To use and overused quote“My disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.”Story: 3/10Characters: 3/10Animation: 4/10Sound: 9/10My Personal Enjoyment: 3/10Overall Score: 4.4/10Recommendation: Don’t Bother', 'Do Not Watch This Before Higurashi: When They Cry Starting in 2006,this Anime was mistaken as a Remake for it but has then cleared about to be a Sequel to the series. You Will Enjoy it even More if you read the Manga Umineko: When They Cry or played the Visual Novel of it.The Original Sources are in Fact of both Series from Visual Novels!Story ( 7- Good) :This Story would say, many newcomers would barely see any difference from the 2006 in this one, hence it is definetly not the Same. Higurashi always has been a Chessboard of Looping Characters between different Paralell Universes...to achieve the goal that they wish for.In this one a new Opponent appears compared to the 2006 one is why this series also goes into a complete different directions of events and also ends completly different.I would say, You can definetly watch this series without having seen the Prequel or Umineko BUT everything will be new ,surprising and also confusing for you. That\'s also the case of the prequel, but they you are already covered up and do not have to be massively confused of what is going on. Everything is already cleares up, the only thing that changed are the events and being it a sequel.It always has been in Ryukishi\'s work that the viewer is supposed to solve the mysteries, you will be confronted with mysteries. We call it the Answer and the Question Arcs.In this case I must say, these mysterys have been much more less difficult and interesting compared to his prequel. The story feels a bit blant and doesn\'t go very deep.I am a huge fan of the series, but yet still disappointed how it lost all of its Character starting from alone the atmosphere.The Ending Was Okay but i wish for an OVA or some sort, they made it really nice but left me a bit feeling uncompleted.But Since i am A Fan i Would say i am very happy they came up with an anime-sequel, even after so many years. And it was surely entertaining and captivating to watchArt (5 -Mediocre) :The Art is Okay. There are negative and positives about it for me.When I first saw the art i was impressed and thought it looks really nice, i like the more defined proportions.But, I really do not like how Plastic they look, which makes them seem less alive and characteristic, the art went into a completly different directions which also made the Horror seems kinda ""artifical"" and not really creepening.Together with other stuff i sometime even felt a bit cringe when they tried to make Characters seem kinda scary like the ladder scene with mion.So I am in a rift between good and bad, sometimes i liked how they made their stuff, i really liekd their opening for example, the world definetly i would say looks also some bit more defined.The Animation felt pretty lacking though, except of course some Sakuga, but even those were kinda ""cheaply"" made and in a weird way.I enjoyed gory scenes, i was pretty sad when they decided to censore it in this season though. Why are they censoring it even? It is in the horror genre god damn it! If you can\'t go with Gore, do Not watch Horror!Sound (7 - Good) :I definetly could notice the difference between the old and new characters in voice, but i was absolutely okay with that and the characters seemed to have a very good voice fitting to their characters and i did appreciate the hard work of how well they could copy it.I also really liked the Opening and Outro\'s, they definetly have a completly different charm than the Prequel one\'s. Even if I liked the old much more in a sense of having their most uniquely and also kinda charm and songs and sounds, they had really good one\'s.Although I would say I also liked the Opening and Intro of this One in All-Together (gou\'s and sotsus) .

I feel liek they just totally ignored what this season was about. It is absolutely in the right that the Characters especially Rika and Satoko changed and you will see why. (again, if you are not common with hnkn2006 or umineko, i strongly recommend it)I feel a bit bad that they did try hard to copypaste the characters, yet it feels very half-hearted and blant. I wish they could done have a bit more into that ,since the whole village and expecially the mains rena,mion,rika usw still play important role\'s in this Anime and Season. I missed here kinda a lot. I think they focused too much on SatokoEnjoyment (7 - Good) :I did really enjoy this series, it gave me nostalgia and i also had to rewatch hnkn again started rereading Umineko again. It was a wise choice LolAs an old fan the series surely captivated me once again and i watch every single episodes when it just came out. Higurashi is probably my Nr.1 Horror Anime. Especially if you are into Gore and supernaturals and maybe are into mystery-solving.Overall (7 - Good) :It was for me a pretty enjoyable series,  I really wished they did put more heart into it though so it leaves me a bit unsatisfying,a a lot felt pretty blant and the series feels a little unfinished what makes me hope for a special,ova or anything else to it. I am sure many fans are probably gonna complain, and i can totally understand. Though, I do not think it deserves to be seen as too bad. It is not super good either nor is it really bad. It is a series though which captivated me, but mainly because i was a fan and i have a lot of interest into the works of ryukishi as i find them in their concepts alone highly enjoyable. Which is also why my Score would be 7 as Good.I must say this Show is very hard rate and definetly for individual tastebuds, the series itself also almost continuesly changed in quality and enjoyment for me.

This season was really interesting in terms of premise, with Satoko turning out to also be able to loop due to jealousy and Rika having to put the pieces together being pretty unique. The whole god fight scene at the end was kinda weird, but the actual ending was pretty bittersweet. Feels like a really good sendoff to the series, but it did get a bit complicated.

It didn't really work out that way though, the mystery is pretty much gone and very little in terms of suspense compared to the original. I liked the art style personally for the most part, just a bit too much kitty mouth, it made the characters look strange, especially Oishi and Keichi (apologies if I misspelled their names).The story for me is a contentious point because at first when Gou was released I really wanted to like it and I kind of did but felt something big was missing, the suspense. But I gave it a chance and there where some moments but definitely not enough for me, as it went on. Sotsu was weird, I kind of liked the ending, it felt nice to see Satoko and Rika come to terms but I think a lot of what leaded up to the ending wasn't really needed, it was almost like filler that we've seen before in Gou. Again I get what they where going with, with the whole question/answer arcs but it felt strangely unnecessary. The ending left me feeling somewhat whelmed, knowing that there's no more (so far). I almost wish for the series to get some insane revival and do well but I can't see that happening, nor do I really want them to try because it would be run into the ground. An added note I hated that Rena, Keichi and crew got barely any character development, we got a bit for my girl Rena in Gou if I'm remembering correctly, but nothing aside from that.But I can't think of much more to add to this so I give this series a 5/10.It's average in my opinion and makes me rather sad that we didn't get a better Higurashi sequel series. But it won't tarnish my love for the original and the VN. A little advice to anyone that's not watched the original or read the VN, do it, do it now.

At that point the dialogue becomes too cheesy, even more than the normal Higurashi dialogue, and it just becomes too ridiculous of a story to actually enjoy.The entire last arc only makes sense if you know about Umineko. Not having read Umineko will probably lead to confusion.I'd either wait for a fan edit or skip to episode 13. This season was a mistake. "", 'Overall its ok-ish but doesnt compare to the original or the prequel.the entire first 11 episodes were just a ""redo"" of the prequel\'s entire storyline with the plot twist from the end of the prequel shown occassionally for like 3-4 scenes per episode. episodes 12-13 it gets really good.then the end is subjective to your opinion. personally i wanted to see much, much more consequences involved. and much more of the things changing in the world after the.. conflict(dont wanna spoil too much) ""ended""it takes a heavy madoka turn which is not really fitting with the show imo and you can see by the rankings...other people probably didnt really like it either.i really hoped to see some sort of ""all the past worlds youve been passing do exist and the people there have to suffer your actions"" but no mention for that sadly :\\overall i dont really recommend unless you really enjoyed the previous season and then go for it but you can like.. skip a lot. dont think like ""oh its the same but there might be something new ill keep watching"", just skip if you see a repeat of a scene from the previous season, nothing new there until late in the show, episodes 7-11, and even then only slightly.imo you can skip to episode 11 altogether if you are fine with no context whatsoever other people probably didnt really like it either.i really hoped to see some sort of ""all the past worlds youve been passing do exist and the people there have to suffer your actions"" but no mention for that sadly :\\overall i dont really recommend unless you really enjoyed the previous season and then go for it but you can like.. skip a lot. dont think like ""oh its the same but there might be something new ill keep watching"", just skip if you see a repeat of a scene from the previous season, nothing new there until late in the show, episodes 7-11, and even then only slightly.imo you can skip to episode 11 altogether if you are fine with no context whatsoever', ""Well, well, well...the show I've been watching since summer finally ended and I gotta say...for this being the first anime I watched since I moved to my new place (that is now the place I truly feel at home at and am no longer homesick for), I couldn't have picked a...lamer show to start with. Let's get into it. [OBVIOUSLY GONNA TALK ABOUT SPOILERS!]:Story 2/10:Look, I'm gonna come and say right now that I haven't read the original VN yet, I own them and Umineko, but I just ain't got the time or will right now to do that (he says as he tries to...100% the DMC games and tries to play all the Megaten games he can), not after basically begrudgingly finishing Danganronpa V3 because I just wanted to get it over with, point is, I don't know how to compare any of the animes I've watched to it. So...the plot is...all over the place. Basically, Satoko got the same looping powers Rika had in the original series and Gou and completely abuses them to get her 'Oh so dear lover' Rika to be with her forever...and then the show devolves from there! Characters constantly dying over and over once again with NO proper reason given other than the fact that 'we need to show how evil Satoko' or rather 'Evil Satoko' or whatever possessed her is. There's the subplot about Hanyuu and Eua that's interesting because now Hanyuu has a fold that counters her and has the same level of power as her, but ultimately, Eua is so flat, generic, and boring of a character, with her whole character being that she wants to be 'entertained' that it's just....stupid. At first, I thought since they were going into Rena a bit in the first few episodes AND the fact that she was prominently shown in the trailers that she would play a big part of this show buuuuut, NOPE, she's a side character like all of the other 'main' characters are. This show just focuses on Rika and Satoko, which isn't bad in concept since they have a GREAT dynamic in the show, but the execution and the way their friendship devolves by the end just had me more bored than Eua was with Hanyuu. Also, why the heck are there like six or seven scenes reused from Gou? Some originally would've been nice, guys, we saw the same stuff you're showing us only a year ago! I don't like the plot of this show just like I did with Gou, if you couldn't tell already, it was only 'good' at the end when everything came to a 'climatic close', which I say in quotations because....the fight itself and all of the Shounen stuff that followed is COMPLETELY out of place for something like Higurashi and belongs in something more like the oh so disease-ridden anime, MHA, leave that stuff out of my Higurashi. It's all just...total garbage, enough said.Art 6/10:I have the same complaints that I had with Higurashi Gou, the weird style that...sort of and sort of doesn't match with the VN. The :3 faces are back full force and they're bugging the [pardon me for using the bad bad guidelines don't like these words for the first time in all of my reviews, find you] ABSOLUTE CRAP outta me. I just don't like how it looks a lot of the time, it just looks kinda...samey and all too colorful and bright for it to be Higurashi and ONCE AGAIN when people are killing each other like they're supposed to be, they used that stupid freaking film filter on it. There are better ways of making horror work in an anime folks....and it was all done in the DEEN anime years ago for crying out loud. It just all looks only slightly better than Gou, still not a fan of the style though. Also, the gore is just absurdly too much, like the scene with Satoko beating her uncle to death with the bat is just plain ridiculous, she was bathing in his blood like she just chainsawed him or something, it's over the top and silly to the point where I can't take it seriously.Sound 8/10:Probably the only good thing about this show. All of the original actors/actresses are back once again, which is nice, they all do a good job of doing their voices, Eua is obnoxious cause she laughs WAAAY too much, like okay Light Yagami Kinnie, you keep laughing at literally nothing. Anyways, the music is...fine, the climactic battle music was pretty good actually, and the ending music being 'You' from the VN was a nice touch and it sounds nice as well and made that seen a little more powerful, I suppose. Overall, competent stuff, nothing really bad to say, acting or music-wise. Good job, Sotsu, you did one thing right....except for the fact I heard some lines being repeated from Gou, so minus some brownie points there, you frogs.Characters 3/10:Good god, I've NEVER hated Satoko more in my life, she's such an absolute prick in this show it ain't even funny. The rest of the cast are mostly themselves (though we don't see any of them enough other than Rika so I can't say they were better or worse than their DEEN or VN counterparts.) I already talked about Eua and how she's generic and lame, existing only to give Satoko her powers so she can be all evil and do bad stuff and have her be the fold to Hanyuu. Nothing genuinely offensive here other than Satoko being a brat, Eua having about as much character as Arius from DMC2...aka. absolutely none other than some comic-book character 'muahahaha I'm evil' type rubbish. This show's characters are either inoffensive because they NEVER show up or if they're a major character on screen...literally just Rika, Satoko, Eua, and Hanyuu, then they're either fine or absolute doggy doo.Overall 4/10:Well, to be fair, I didn't have much faith in this series once I saw it around Episode 5, and in my mind back when the trailers and few first few episodes started airing I had a feeling it was going to get worse as time went on...and boy was I right! Look, if this show had some more time put into it instead of A LITERAL YEAR or however long they had to make this between Gou and the deadline to start airing the episodes, it could've been marginally better, but as it is...this just isn't a great series for anyone. Much like Gou, Sotsu suffers from failing to give new viewers to the series an idea of what's going on (though I'd hope those people would've at the very least have watched Gou before watching this, as it's a direct sequel to it) and it makes fans old and new question what the hell was going on with the people behind this anime when it was being made. I don't recommend this series, it almost ruined Satoko for me and now I'm feeling hopeless for any future Higurashi anime because this....is not a good sign at all. Eua, this is your darling failure, and you're a part of it.Nyo's Nonsensical Updates (gave this section an official name finally, I know this is just rambling but I like to give you guys an idea of how I'm doing because I don't like using forums and adding randos on Discord just to chat, I use VRChat for that stuff and that game is a trainwreck nowadays, anyway):Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to 100%'ing Devil May Cry 1 (I 100%'ed 2 as well, help me) and then getting back to reading the Persona 1 Manga along with getting into No More Heros AND juggling a job and college at the same time! My life is a loop of work and tiredness...call me Rika, cause I'm feeling tired. I'm pretty sure the next anime review will be Texhnolyze, gonna try and push for it, anyways because watching anything above 13+ episodes is kind of a pain for me, especially if it's not ongoing like this was...seriously, I couldn't be more annoyed rn in my life. 100% the DMC games and tries to play all the Megaten games he can), not after basically begrudgingly finishing Danganronpa V3 because I just wanted to get it over with, point is, I don't know how to compare any of the animes I've watched to it.

This show just focuses on Rika and Satoko, which isn't bad in concept since they have a GREAT dynamic in the show, but the execution and the way their friendship devolves by the end just had me more bored than Eua was with Hanyuu. Also, why the heck are there like six or seven scenes reused from Gou? Some originally would've been nice, guys, we saw the same stuff you're showing us only a year ago! I don't like the plot of this show just like I did with Gou, if you couldn't tell already, it was only 'good' at the end when everything came to a 'climatic close', which I say in quotations because....the fight itself and all of the Shounen stuff that followed is COMPLETELY out of place for something like Higurashi and belongs in something more like the oh so disease-ridden anime, MHA, leave that stuff out of my Higurashi. It's all just...total garbage, enough said.Art 6/10:I have the same complaints that I had with Higurashi Gou, the weird style that...sort of and sort of doesn't match with the VN. The :3 faces are back full force and they're bugging the [pardon me for using the bad bad guidelines don't like these words for the first time in all of my reviews, find you] ABSOLUTE CRAP outta me. I just don't like how it looks a lot of the time, it just looks kinda...samey and all too colorful and bright for it to be Higurashi and ONCE AGAIN when people are killing each other like they're supposed to be, they used that stupid freaking film filter on it. There are better ways of making horror work in an anime folks....and it was all done in the DEEN anime years ago for crying out loud. It just all looks only slightly better than Gou, still not a fan of the style though. Also, the gore is just absurdly too much, like the scene with Satoko beating her uncle to death with the bat is just plain ridiculous, she was bathing in his blood like she just chainsawed him or something, it's over the top and silly to the point where I can't take it seriously.Sound 8/10:Probably the only good thing about this show. All of the original actors/actresses are back once again, which is nice, they all do a good job of doing their voices, Eua is obnoxious cause she laughs WAAAY too much, like okay Light Yagami Kinnie, you keep laughing at literally nothing. Anyways, the music is...fine, the climactic battle music was pretty good actually, and the ending music being 'You' from the VN was a nice touch and it sounds nice as well and made that seen a little more powerful, I suppose. Overall, competent stuff, nothing really bad to say, acting or music-wise. Good job, Sotsu, you did one thing right....except for the fact I heard some lines being repeated from Gou, so minus some brownie points there, you frogs.Characters 3/10:Good god, I've NEVER hated Satoko more in my life, she's such an absolute prick in this show it ain't even funny. The rest of the cast are mostly themselves (though we don't see any of them enough other than Rika so I can't say they were better or worse than their DEEN or VN counterparts.) I already talked about Eua and how she's generic and lame, existing only to give Satoko her powers so she can be all evil and do bad stuff and have her be the fold to Hanyuu. Nothing genuinely offensive here other than Satoko being a brat, Eua having about as much character as Arius from DMC2...aka. absolutely none other than some comic-book character 'muahahaha I'm evil' type rubbish. This show's characters are either inoffensive because they NEVER show up or if they're a major character on screen...literally just Rika, Satoko, Eua, and Hanyuu, then they're either fine or absolute doggy doo.Overall 4/10:Well, to be fair, I didn't have much faith in this series once I saw it around Episode 5, and in my mind back when the trailers and few first few episodes started airing I had a feeling it was going to get worse as time went on...and boy was I right! Look, if this show had some more time put into it instead of A LITERAL YEAR or however long they had to make this between Gou and the deadline to start airing the episodes, it could've been marginally better, but as it is...this just isn't a great series for anyone. Much like Gou, Sotsu suffers from failing to give new viewers to the series an idea of what's going on (though I'd hope those people would've at the very least have watched Gou before watching this, as it's a direct sequel to it) and it makes fans old and new question what the hell was going on with the people behind this anime when it was being made. I don't recommend this series, it almost ruined Satoko for me and now I'm feeling hopeless for any future Higurashi anime because this....is not a good sign at all. Eua, this is your darling failure, and you're a part of it.Nyo's Nonsensical Updates (gave this section an official name finally, I know this is just rambling but I like to give you guys an idea of how I'm doing because I don't like using forums and adding randos on Discord just to chat, I use VRChat for that stuff and that game is a trainwreck nowadays, anyway):Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to 100%'ing Devil May Cry 1 (I 100%'ed 2 as well, help me) and then getting back to reading the Persona 1 Manga along with getting into No More Heros AND juggling a job and college at the same time! My life is a loop of work and tiredness...call me Rika, cause I'm feeling tired. I'm pretty sure the next anime review will be Texhnolyze, gonna try and push for it, anyways because watching anything above 13+ episodes is kind of a pain for me, especially if it's not ongoing like this was...seriously, I couldn't be more annoyed rn in my life."", ""I get that a lot of people don't like gou and sotsu, but I personally like them the most out of all the higurashi seasons that I've watched.I like the focus on satoko and rika, especially since before gou I thought that satoko was a pretty boring character. I also love how they ended sotsu, though it was definitely the safest route they could have taken, and perhaps they could have made a stronger connection to umineko.Lastly, I am REALLY upset that the ending of sotsu tried its darnest t to keep things between rika and satoko platonic, even though in the opening...they're almost kissing. But that's homophobia I guess :/ Like, you can't tell me that if one of them was a boy, there wouldn't have been romance involved. Imagine if there was a bittersweet moment (maybe a kiss) on the train station. But a girl can only dream I guess T^T they're almost kissing.

We had been left on an exciting cliffhanger, and I figured the Satoko and Rika battle was imminent. I was looking forward to seeing their conflicts with each other come to fruition.I waited. And waited. And waited. And then when the last 2 episodes of Sotsu aired, I got a mediocre telling of the events following the infamous ""Satoko pulling out a gun"" scene.What was the point of this season? One could argue it was an ""answer arc,"" but the story was not as masterfully told as Kai by any means....In fact, I felt like I was just anxiously sitting through all of Gou again, waiting to get to where the story had left off. The beginning arcs were at least interesting, probably because they aligned with the more interesting arcs in Gou and because there was extra original content to splice in. But then as the season progressed it just felt like I was watching episodes of Gou again with 25% original Satoko content thrown in. That was extremely disappointing.Finally, after what felt like forever, we finally returned to the ""Satoko pulling out a gun"" scene, but I was less than satisfied with what followed. I was not a fan of the shounen-like battle scenes thrown in near the end. I enjoy this series for the mystery and suspense, not because I want to see the same shounen battle that I repeatedly see every anime season. The supernatural elements were really heightened in this sequel series too, and I\'m not really sure I was a fan of that either.I was extremely disappointed with the confrontation between Satoko and Rika. With the way their character arcs and the main conflict had been built up, I was upset to see their battle reduced to a shounen-style scene rather than a battle of wits which you\'d always see in the original Higurashi.In my last review I commented that I thought this was an excellent idea for a sequel, but now I\'m leaning on the side of others that this does feel more like a cash grab. It\'s so disappointing to think that. I still think the set-up for Gou was spectacular, that it made sense to have Satoko become the villain after Rika leaves Hinamizawa. I still enjoy Gou tremendously. I just don\'t know how a masterful answer arc like what we saw in Kai could not carry over in Sotsu.That being said, I do think the ending was appropriate. Having Rika and Satoko separate was what I thought would be the best resolution, and as lonely as the ending felt, there was a bittersweet nature to it which I felt was appropriate. I do think at least that the character arcs were still well done, especially since prior to Gou and Sotsu, I never even cared much for Satoko as a character prior to Gou, but now she is one of my favorites. This series had me rooting for both Rika and Satoko simultaneously, and I often switched sides on who I wanted to ""win."" As much as I\'d love to continue sharing my disappointments with Sotsu, I have to admit, that\'s good character writing. (So why was the plot written so shittily?)It\'s been about a year now since I became entangled in the Higurashi series. I do not regret it for the world, but I was disappointed to see how this sequel series turned out in the end. For a story that set up its characters, plot, and mystery so well in Gou, it was a shame to see it all go to waste in Sotsu, especially when I know what Higurashi is capable of from the original story. I wish we had been given a more satisfying ending to this story and these characters, but that\'s what I get for falling into a sequel series.In conclusion, I don\'t hate Gou and Sotsu. I can see myself rewatching them in the future, but I think after watching these two series, it very much confirms for me that the original Higurashi will always be a step above these sequels (and maybe also that Takano is a better villain). If you\'re looking for a great story, then yes, original Higurashi is the way to go, but if you want maybe some more fun content for spooky season, then turn on Gou and Sotsu.

Higurashi Kai is and most likely always will be my favorite anime, however after this season I\'m beginning to question myself. The only way I kept even remotely sane after this season was convincing myself it wasn\'t canon (both this and Gou). The first three arcs in Gou were decent, they subverted my expectations, however my two major problems with this show can be summed up in three words. Rika and Satoko. Rika did a back peddle from her original personality in Higurashi Kai and is now back to being a...cynical character who is just annoying to watch. Satoko was completely ruined, I feel so bad honestly as even Dear You-Kind (Satoko\'s version of Dear You) feels empty now. She is the worst part of Sotsu for me because she literally does nothing noteworthy except grin at the camera and say ""all according to plan"". It\'s atrocious, easily the worst anime I\'ve seen simply because Higurashi as a series is so amazing and life changing for me. Seriously, if you\'ve only watched Gou and Sotsu (yes there are people out there like that) you are doing yourself a disservice. Please go watch the first two seasons, I guarantee it will be better than this, they even had the audacity to play dear you at the end of the season, my jaw literally dropped. I could talk about this failure of a season for hours. Please don\'t watch this, you\'re doing yourself a disservice. cynical character who is just annoying to watch.

The original Kai, outside of Meakashi-hen never told literally the other side of the question arcs, but created new arcs with similar problems but different development to keep things fresh.Sotsu, because of the nature of the series, has to be the back side of what happened in the original Gou arcs, which means that there is a lot of stuff that just gets repeated.Also...since the arcs are way smaller than the original novel\'s arcs, probably to be more apt for the TV, it means that there is even less to really delve into this series, and it also feels like the budget for the sequel was way smaller than Gou, with way less episodes and with many episodes being mostly old animation intertwined with a new scenes, some time repeating for a long time scenes that do not need to be repeated (like the scene of Rika dancing).The second problem, and this is a big one is, the order of the series is just off.The culprit was revealed at the end of Nekodamashi-hen, which is OK, specially if you want to focus the rest of the series on this character, but going with Satokowashi-hen after this, which explains not only the Whydunit but also the Howdunit, kills a lot of the enjoyment of Sotsu, since if you just think a little bit ""how did it happened"" with all the information from Satokowashi-hen, you will probably get it right like 90% of the time, which means that almost everything that happens in Sotsu is expected.I don\'t know if it was a production thing the positioning of Satokowashi-hen, specially since Ryukishi07 (The original author) said that this arc was equivalent to the first part of Matsuribayashi-hen, which was the last arc of the original novels. It just doesn\'t seem right, also the Manga seems to agree with this, going straight to the Answer arcs after Nekodamashi-hen.So I believe that the right way of watching this series is, watch Sotsu after Nekodamashi-hen up to the end of Tatariakashi-hen, then go back and watch Satokowashi-hen, and then watch Kagurashi-hen.And the 3rd problem that Sotsu has is that not only Kagurashi-hen for the most part only provides any new information in the last 2 episodes to conclude the series (which is probably too little), but it is very difficult to follow if you are not a hardcore 07th Expansion fan.For most people, I think, these 2 last episodes made little sense, and it just felt like something completely different to the usual Higurashi tone.The conclusion feels rushed, and it tries to connect with many other properties of the ""Naku koro ni"" expanded universe, which is ok, but I feel to much effort was put on that point, and less on making the conclusion feel right, especially for Higurashi-only fans.That being said, as a 07th Expansion hardcore fan, I just loved this series. It expanded the universe of the ""Naku koro ni series"", and provided many answers to some of the mysteries of Umineko no naku koro ni.Having read Umineko and other properties from this universe, the ending does makes sense, but it does feel like they could have explained it a little bit more for newcomers, but I do think it was rushed.It makes me question if a whole different season was really necessary for this, and I would have preferred they used more time to develop the ending, that going back into things we already saw in Gou.But I did like this series, so there is that. since the arcs are way smaller than the original novel\'s arcs, probably to be more apt for the TV, it means that there is even less to really delve into this series, and it also feels like the budget for the sequel was way smaller than Gou, with way less episodes and with many episodes being mostly old animation intertwined with a new scenes, some time repeating for a long time scenes that do not need to be repeated (like the scene of Rika dancing).The second problem, and this is a big one is, the order of the series is just off.The culprit was revealed at the end of Nekodamashi-hen, which is OK, specially if you want to focus the rest of the series on this character, but going with Satokowashi-hen after this, which explains not only the Whydunit but also the Howdunit, kills a lot of the enjoyment of Sotsu, since if you just think a little bit ""how did it happened"" with all the information from Satokowashi-hen, you will probably get it right like 90% of the time, which means that almost everything that happens in Sotsu is expected.I don\'t know if it was a production thing the positioning of Satokowashi-hen, specially since Ryukishi07 (The original author) said that this arc was equivalent to the first part of Matsuribayashi-hen, which was the last arc of the original novels.

I liked the reimagining of the Keiichi arc in Gou and this is a solid addendum to that. No complaints at all.Mion's arc was very dull. Satoko remarks that Mion never once suffered stage five in the original loop and that it would be fun to see what happens. The events are no different to Shion's original arc, the same people are killed...in a more condensed time period, and Mion's motivation is far weaker than Shion's was. Suffers from a lack of mystery. The fingernail scene with the mayor was a weak homage.Satoko's question arc was one of Gou's many high points. The answer arc was strong in its own way and made me sympathise for Teppei Hojo of all people. Definitely a bit slow paced though.The rest is unfortunately unremarkable, apart from a decent happy ending.My biggest gripe with Gou and Sotsu as a whole is Satoko's motivation for doing something so cruel. We see Satoko show remarkably patience and determination in putting plans together, including learning multiple skills over the course of decades. We see her use her powers to win a lot of money, and she somehow doesn't consider looping to cheat on an exam or two? We're told that she tried and failed to study, but we're never shown it. It's so frustrating because it shouldn't be a factor. Just say that Satoko can't retain academic knowledge on account of Eua's gift. For her birthday Keiichi gives her a book about vegetables, a running joke is she can't tell the difference between brocoli and cauliflour, it would fit and it'd be a fun little thing for viewer's to notice as they watch along. I am fine if Satoko feels spurred by Rika, that makes sense to me and I can see a teenage girl lashing out violently because of it, but the time traveller being too lazy to study and deciding endlessly killing her friends and family is better than that annoys me.The battle between Rika and Satoko at the end, while visually quite fun to watch, stops making sense once you realise Satoko always needs to die after Rika for the battle to continue, so whenever Rika has the upper hand it's plainly unbelievable. The sword as a plot element makes little sense, because Satoko always needs to find it first and it always needs to break. I feel that the rules of this loop aren't explained well. Why couldn't you just say that Satoko wakes up two or three days before Rika does and that's how she manages all this crazy stuff.Worst of all is that Keiichi, Rena, Mion and Shion are background ornaments in this series. Everything boils down to Rika and Satoko. I was certain that Rika had figured Satoko out and she'd gotten everyone else on her side ready to stage an intervention, but that didn't happen. There was no version of these characters who had any idea what the hell was happening, and it makes me sad to think about.Now having said all of that, I did really enjoy the new Higurashi. The entirety of Gou was a great watch, and adult characters are a lot more sympathetic. The happy ending with Teppei, Satoko and Shion made me smile. I look forward to future expansions of the universe, hopefully with a stronger villain and more involvement from other club members. in a more condensed time period, and Mion's motivation is far weaker than Shion's was. Suffers from a lack of mystery. The fingernail scene with the mayor was a weak homage.Satoko's question arc was one of Gou's many high points. The answer arc was strong in its own way and made me sympathise for Teppei Hojo of all people. Definitely a bit slow paced though.The rest is unfortunately unremarkable, apart from a decent happy ending.My biggest gripe with Gou and Sotsu as a whole is Satoko's motivation for doing something so cruel. We see Satoko show remarkably patience and determination in putting plans together, including learning multiple skills over the course of decades. We see her use her powers to win a lot of money, and she somehow doesn't consider looping to cheat on an exam or two? We're told that she tried and failed to study, but we're never shown it. It's so frustrating because it shouldn't be a factor. Just say that Satoko can't retain academic knowledge on account of Eua's gift. For her birthday Keiichi gives her a book about vegetables, a running joke is she can't tell the difference between brocoli and cauliflour, it would fit and it'd be a fun little thing for viewer's to notice as they watch along. I am fine if Satoko feels spurred by Rika, that makes sense to me and I can see a teenage girl lashing out violently because of it, but the time traveller being too lazy to study and deciding endlessly killing her friends and family is better than that annoys me.The battle between Rika and Satoko at the end, while visually quite fun to watch, stops making sense once you realise Satoko always needs to die after Rika for the battle to continue, so whenever Rika has the upper hand it's plainly unbelievable. The sword as a plot element makes little sense, because Satoko always needs to find it first and it always needs to break. I feel that the rules of this loop aren't explained well. Why couldn't you just say that Satoko wakes up two or three days before Rika does and that's how she manages all this crazy stuff.Worst of all is that Keiichi, Rena, Mion and Shion are background ornaments in this series. Everything boils down to Rika and Satoko. I was certain that Rika had figured Satoko out and she'd gotten everyone else on her side ready to stage an intervention, but that didn't happen. There was no version of these characters who had any idea what the hell was happening, and it makes me sad to think about.Now having said all of that, I did really enjoy the new Higurashi. The entirety of Gou was a great watch, and adult characters are a lot more sympathetic. The happy ending with Teppei, Satoko and Shion made me smile. I look forward to future expansions of the universe, hopefully with a stronger villain and more involvement from other club members."", ""Before we start this review, I'd like to let you know I have not played the Visual Novel and have only consumed Higurashi content in anime form, so my perspective will differ from those who have read the Visual Novel.It's also important to understand that both Gou and Sotsu are regarded as blasphemy by many Higurashi fans. I definitely can see why, but that doesn't mean the anime outside of a Higurashi perspective is bad or deserves to be rated a one, as the anime itself isn't that bad; it's heavily flawed and poorly executed, and its premise is quite interesting.Requirements before watching:Please watch...the Original Higurashi series for context because it's absurdly good. Additionally, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou, despite being a hot dumpster fire for 18 episodes, will also need to be watched to understand the characters and the situation they find themselves in, as Sotsu takes place after Gou and, from my understanding, is a ''sequel'' to the original series.Story:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu is fundamentally a Machiavellian story. It mainly revolves around the trials and tribulations of Hōjō Satoko and her desire to stop Furude Rika from leaving her side by moving away to the academy we saw in Gou.The story mostly takes perspectives from the original Higurashi series and flips them on their head, allowing us to see the story from a new angle, which sounds good in concept but is poorly executed, which is a huge shame.Mainly because it felt like a poorly done repetition of the main series with some slight deviations; naturally, this led to a poor reception from long-time Higurashi fans for multiple reasons, and one of those biggest reasons is that the mystery behind the story and its twists feel considerably more absent, which differs from what Higurarshi as a series is generally about. It's not bad per se, but it doesn't feel like Higurashi, and that doesn't sit well with many viewers. However, it gets more interesting towards the end of the anime around episode 11, where things get spicy really fast, so I'd hold out until then.This is something to note and take to heart before you watch this anime.Characters/Cast:If you're expecting significant character development from the main cast of Maebara Keiichi, Ryūgū Rena, Sonozaki Mion and Sonozaki Shion like the original Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, then I wouldn't recommend this anime to you.As it's mainly about Hōjō Satoko and Furude Rika's battle of wills. As a result, both of them have a considerable amount of screen time but understand that the focus is primarily on Hōjō Satoko, who goes through a lot of character development for better and worse, depending on the individual watching this. I, for one, enjoyed her story and found it quite fascinating despite its predictable nature.Animation:I'm going to be extremely blunt. Passione's animation and design do not look good and still look just as bad as they did in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou. If you disliked how it looked before, you wouldn't like it now either, although I can't be too negative as they did fix Rika's hair; that gets a few points in my books. Everyone else, though, minus Hōjō Satoko, looks pretty awful.Aside from the design, despite looking rough, the animations did improve from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou and got better towards the end of the series. The last two episodes are the exception to the rule and look very good.Music:The opening theme is a banger! As is the closing theme, but other than that, the rest of the soundtrack is entirely forgettable.Closing Statement:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Sotsu is a lousy anime for classic Higurashi fans, and I can understand why it has such a low score.However, that isn't to say all those low votes are justifiable because they're not. The anime does have some bite, and there are some genuinely shocking moments and revelations toward the end.I do absolutely think this anime is worth it despite all its faults.It's very entertaining and has a good core philosophy regarding friendship and how we should let each other grow instead of suffocating each other with our own selfish desires. Also, Hōjō Satoko is very well written, so much so that people hate her. That should say a lot.Final Scores:If you're an original Higurashi fan and want a story full of mystery, intrigue and twists, it's a 3/10.However, if you can look past the differences between both stories and enjoy the anime for what it is instead of what it can be, I'd rate it as a 6/10. the Original Higurashi series for context because it's absurdly good.

Things like the aparition of Federica its way more subtle and It is not completely anticlimactic with the...history that was previously established...I don´t even like the artstyle... This is a more personal opinion tho, but i don´t get why the colors are that vibrant now, maybe for the contrast with the history..?

And even though it surely feels strange for a serious mystery-horror-anime like Higurashi to feature such a ""shonen-like"" climax battle, it positively added to the experience in my opinion.

And even though it surely feels strange for a serious mystery-horror-anime like Higurashi to feature such a ""shonen-like"" climax battle, it positively added to the experience in my opinion.', 'Sotsu took risks.Sotsu took some creative risks and I believe that it succeeded in creating a very entertaining show while continuing familiar concepts and story elements. Although I do not like to compare the original and Kai to the sequel, I think it is important to do so in artistic aspects: sound, art, and animation.Fortunately, the sound design isn\'t bad but isn\'t much better or distinguishable from the first series or horror anime in general. Sounds that do standout are in scenes where Keiichi talks to Rena or Mion about what happened with the dam. In those scenes, it goes from a very cheerful...and innocent sound to silence and sometimes the sound of cicadas. It\'s very dramatic and is more impactful than the original. In some of the gore scenes you will hear things like skulls being cracked or organs being moved with much more clarity and depth than the original. This all being said, I wouldn\'t put the sound design on a pedestal. It\'s slightly above average for the horror genre.The art in the show compliments what it needs to, but I prefer the original. In the original, the art was very simplistic and made the children (besides Keiichi) look much younger and innocent. This complimented the gore of the original very well and gave the show its identity of being cutesy and horrifying. In this new series, especially Sotsu, you\'re going to see a lot more action and animation than the original. The art style of the new compliments the action much better than the original would have been able to do. That being said, I do prefer the original style for any gore scenes.Animation has never been a huge part of the Higurashi series. A lot of the show is people just walking or talking to each other. In Gou and Sotsu, you will see a lot more action and heavily animated parts that were most of the time absent in the original, except for a few arcs such as when Rena is on the rooftop with Keiichi. So when looking at the animation we would need to see how fluid it is during the action scenes. It does a fine job but there are scenes where characters will be fighting and then abruptly stopping to talk. It takes away from the action but this isn\'t uncommon to see in horror anime or a lot of anime in general.Character development is much more focused on Rika and Satoko. All the other characters take a back seat and aren\'t developed very much. This is especially true for Keiichi, Mion, and Shion. It would have been nice to get a little more development of the family dynamics of Mion and Shion and some more background of Keiichi. So if you\'re a fan of those three characters, don\'t expect too much development.Addressing some of the criticisms of Sotsu and the new series as a whole. I believe that a majority of the criticisms of this show stem from expectations and selfishness. A lot of people seem to have wanted just more arcs that stuck to the same formula and came together similarly to the original. That\'s not the case with Sotsu. Sotsu sticks to the main formula (mostly), but takes risks. In Sotsu you\'re going to see a lot more action with more mystical/fantastical elements like in Umineko. Some people don\'t like this, but I find that the creativity brings some freshness to the show that Gou lacked in some respects.So which did I prefer watching, the first series or the new? It\'s hard to say. What made the original so good was figuring out what was happening and the concept of looping. The new show expects that the audience is already familiar with that concept. So the concept of looping is developed, but I don\'t think it has as much impact on the audience as the original. Sotsu has shock value and also gives you an ""aha"" moment, but I think the original, because of how unique it stands out from the rest of the horror genre, would be my preferred watch.If I were to watch the series again, I would probably just watch the end of Kai, the arcs of Gou I enjoyed, and then all of Sotsu. and innocent sound to silence and sometimes the sound of cicadas.

I\'ll try to be as spoiler free as possible. You have been warned, but it should be obvious. No complaining.Sotsu holds the answers to the previous arcs in Gou and follows the perspective of Satoko the main culprit behind the changes to the show\'s previous timelines. This is not a new story structure for the series however, with only 15 episodes to the season and 13 of those episodes dedicated to semi-recapping events its pacing suffers greatly. This series is more suitable to binge-watch than to watch weekly....It has taken me some time to fully digest and reflect on the anime after it ended. With only two episodes for its finale, the conclusion, unfortunately, felt rushed, but that doesn\'t mean that I didn\'t enjoy it. I think the story\'s conclusion was appropriate for where it was heading and gives a more bitter-sweet tone in contrast to the original ending of Studio Deen\'s 2006 anime. The inclusion of a genre-inappropriate yet, un-ironically brilliant Shonen Battle akin to that of the final Naruto vs Sasuke battle was jarring but appreciated. Very anime.Eua is by far the weakest link in the series. As a god, there\'s no real motivation behind her actions other than to relieve her boredom. After she had successfully manipulated Satoko to go on her Rika rampage through time in Gou her character boils down to ""Look how indifferent I am to human suffering! HA HA HA HA"", and her screen time actively ruins some of the best scenes at times. Hanyuu\'s final battle with her is... well let\'s just say it ends conveniently and it\'s a low point of the finale.Those were the main criticisms I had of the show. Don\'t let that fool you, I thoroughly enjoyed the at times upsetting journey. I could write an entire essay on Satoko and why she\'s one of the best villains I\'ve seen in a long time and I can\'t quite believe that Higurashi managed to make me like her uncle Teppi, an irredeemable child abuser which certainly made me feel weird, but it did.When the show gore wasn\'t being censored seemly at random it was satisfying to watch if not at times a little over the top. There are some phenomenally composed and disturbing scenes too. I can\'t stop thinking about the card game or the Satoko ""roll"" or the frying pan scene... God, there\'s a lot I want to talk about, but I don\'t want to spoil anything.Higurashi uses its original concept of fear and paranoia to tell a coming-of-age story. A story that many have felt and grown up experiencing is the fear of being left behind and growing apart from the people you love. I don\'t think it\'s perfect, but damn is it a good watch. Now let\'s hope we don\'t have to wait another 13 years to get something Higurashi-related.8/10 Great It has taken me some time to fully digest and reflect on the anime after it ended.

Sometimes it’s so ridiculous I want to rate it lower, while other times it’s so ridiculous I want to rate it higher. It doesn’t get to the point where it’s straight out bad, but it has its questionable moments. Gou was already controversial (although I personally really liked it), but Sotsu manages to divide the already divided fanbase even more.So, what’s the deal with Sotsu? Keep in mind that what could be considered spoilers is mentioned further, though nothing too major. Nothing too major for Sotsu that is, you shouldn’t read further if you haven’t seen Gou...yet.Sotsu is the answer arc for Gou. It shows the events of the previous season through Satoko’s eyes and shows to the audience how the previously mysterious situations came to be. Fairly usual structure for a Ryukishi work. Yet this is already one of the most criticized aspects. Supposedly it’s “just a recap” and “doesn’t move the plot forward”. This is of course untrue, as while it technically covers the same events, the new viewpoint and additional information are the new content and it is moving the plot forward. Admittedly, it could have been done faster and some scenes could be considered an unnecessary repetition, but I still prefer that to rushing through Satoko’s view, and given the theme of looping I’d say the event repetition ads to the atmosphere rather than being a detriment.That is 13 out of the 15 episodes. No way the story would be able to finish at this pace, right? Well 14th episode is where shit hits the fan and the pace changes rapidly. And it’s here when I got really conflicted about the series. It’s fun, sure, but sometimes the suspend of disbelief is getting way too close to getting broken, and rule of cool is being used as a device too much. Rule of cool can be, well, cool, but for Higurashi where the plot is supposed to be logically explainable it’s not something to swing around too much. The rapid scene transition from the loop makes for a really cool fight scene, but if you think about it, you remember that Satoko cannot in any of those jumps die as the first one. It seems likely that at this speed and with Rika knowing she needs to defend herself some sort of slip would occur. Some jumps even really look like Satoko could have been the one dying first. Yet the show seems to ignore this possibility entirely. While it’s nice how the fight is jumping through iconic places, it also seems very plot convenient to keep going like that. Things get even more confusing when the sword is involved and keeps being held by the characters even though logically there should have been a need to retrieve it for each new loop. While you could theorize that it’s because the sword is related to the looping powers, I would prefer it if the show itself would hint at that instead of me having to make excuses for it.Also, let’s talk about Satoko. Turning one of the main characters into a villain is an interesting idea for sure, but Satoko’s motivation just keeps getting more bullshit. “Sure, you’ve suffered through a century of psychological and physical torture, but I really hate studying, so I’m the victim here”. Yep, just cause more pain to your best friend and others around you to keep said friend bound to a shitty place to which they have traumatized memories tied to. Because you can’t keep up with school even with a literal time looping power and because you’re jealous your friend is making new friends. There’s overreacting, and then there’s this. Excuse my language, but I have no better description of this behaviour as retarded. Now, maybe Satoko is on the spectrum and then it would make sense, but that would again be me making up excuses for the show. The reason Satoko went postal is just so weird and hard to grasp, making her motivation unrealistic and therefore her being a weak villain, and this is pretty much the one reason why I won’t rate Sotsu higher, even though I’m overall enjoying the new sequel in general. And while the finale of original Higurashi had some strong friendship theme so it’s not exactly a sudden element, I’d still prefer it it the power of friendship was toned down a bit. The finale felt quite underwhelming - yet, call if copium if you want to, I'm still hoping for a continuation or a tie-in.To contrast this with a positive point, I love what new Higurashi did to Teppei. It’s the exact opposite of Satoko development. Here we have a previously hated character that was simply a violent villain, a dumb dickhead, no redeeming qualities. Then one of the best redemption arcs I’ve witnessed happens. Redemption arc is usually “bad guy is now kinda good because the character was popular with the audience”. Not in this case. Here we have what was considered a lost cause, one of the most hated characters in anime (no hyperbole, check out the lowest ranks of character ratings on AniDB). And he’s given character depth, an actual desire for redemption and realization of the weight of his mistakes. If before 2020 you told me I would feel sorry for Teppei, I wouldn’t be able to take you seriously. But I’m glad it’s how the development ended up and the emotional attachment to the character relationship it caused. Seriously, the dynamics between evil Satoko and redemption Teppei are more interesting than those between Satoko and Rika. Or maybe that could be considered a fault of the show? You be the judge in this case.I’ve seen people complaining about the art, but while it’s not breath-taking, it certainly isn’t bad or flawed. It’s definitely better than the DEEN version, but that’s not exactly hard goal to clear.I rate this controversial/10. I prefer creators trying new things instead of plain remake, but keep in mind that there is a chance you might be disappointed even if you’re a long time Higurashi fan. And if you’re not interested in Higurashi that much, this might not be interesting to you that much either. Or it might. This is one of those cases where I hesitate to make a verdict whether to recommend this or not in overall. I guess you’ll just have to see for yourself. I’ve you’ve watched Gou already, you might as well finish this anyway, no? If nothing else, you can then engage in heated flamewar with someone that holds the different opinion about this series, and isn’t that what’re we here for? yet.Sotsu is the answer arc for Gou.

Rule of cool can be, well, cool, but for Higurashi where the plot is supposed to be logically explainable it’s not something to swing around too much. The rapid scene transition from the loop makes for a really cool fight scene, but if you think about it, you remember that Satoko cannot in any of those jumps die as the first one. It seems likely that at this speed and with Rika knowing she needs to defend herself some sort of slip would occur. Some jumps even really look like Satoko could have been the one dying first. Yet the show seems to ignore this possibility entirely. While it’s nice how the fight is jumping through iconic places, it also seems very plot convenient to keep going like that. Things get even more confusing when the sword is involved and keeps being held by the characters even though logically there should have been a need to retrieve it for each new loop. While you could theorize that it’s because the sword is related to the looping powers, I would prefer it if the show itself would hint at that instead of me having to make excuses for it.Also, let’s talk about Satoko. Turning one of the main characters into a villain is an interesting idea for sure, but Satoko’s motivation just keeps getting more bullshit. “Sure, you’ve suffered through a century of psychological and physical torture, but I really hate studying, so I’m the victim here”. Yep, just cause more pain to your best friend and others around you to keep said friend bound to a shitty place to which they have traumatized memories tied to. Because you can’t keep up with school even with a literal time looping power and because you’re jealous your friend is making new friends. There’s overreacting, and then there’s this. Excuse my language, but I have no better description of this behaviour as retarded. Now, maybe Satoko is on the spectrum and then it would make sense, but that would again be me making up excuses for the show. The reason Satoko went postal is just so weird and hard to grasp, making her motivation unrealistic and therefore her being a weak villain, and this is pretty much the one reason why I won’t rate Sotsu higher, even though I’m overall enjoying the new sequel in general. And while the finale of original Higurashi had some strong friendship theme so it’s not exactly a sudden element, I’d still prefer it it the power of friendship was toned down a bit. The finale felt quite underwhelming - yet, call if copium if you want to, I'm still hoping for a continuation or a tie-in.To contrast this with a positive point, I love what new Higurashi did to Teppei. It’s the exact opposite of Satoko development. Here we have a previously hated character that was simply a violent villain, a dumb dickhead, no redeeming qualities. Then one of the best redemption arcs I’ve witnessed happens. Redemption arc is usually “bad guy is now kinda good because the character was popular with the audience”. Not in this case. Here we have what was considered a lost cause, one of the most hated characters in anime (no hyperbole, check out the lowest ranks of character ratings on AniDB). And he’s given character depth, an actual desire for redemption and realization of the weight of his mistakes. If before 2020 you told me I would feel sorry for Teppei, I wouldn’t be able to take you seriously. But I’m glad it’s how the development ended up and the emotional attachment to the character relationship it caused. Seriously, the dynamics between evil Satoko and redemption Teppei are more interesting than those between Satoko and Rika. Or maybe that could be considered a fault of the show? You be the judge in this case.I’ve seen people complaining about the art, but while it’s not breath-taking, it certainly isn’t bad or flawed. It’s definitely better than the DEEN version, but that’s not exactly hard goal to clear.I rate this controversial/10. I prefer creators trying new things instead of plain remake, but keep in mind that there is a chance you might be disappointed even if you’re a long time Higurashi fan. And if you’re not interested in Higurashi that much, this might not be interesting to you that much either. Or it might. This is one of those cases where I hesitate to make a verdict whether to recommend this or not in overall. I guess you’ll just have to see for yourself. I’ve you’ve watched Gou already, you might as well finish this anyway, no? If nothing else, you can then engage in heated flamewar with someone that holds the different opinion about this series, and isn’t that what’re we here for?"", '*Note: While this review does not have spoilers for Sotsu, it does have major spoilers for Gou.*tl;dr: Slow moving and with an ending that is quite bizarre, but still enough worthwhile content to be pretty good.Higurashi Sotsu is the sequel to Gou, and could be seen as the answer arcs to it. However, while the Question/Answer arc structure worked well for the original Higurashi, it does not work as well for Gou/Sotsu. The original’s answer arcs were interesting in that for the most part, they didn’t retread old material much but rather solved the mysteries of the question arcs while going through new stories. However,...the first three arcs in Sotsu are straight up repeats of the first three arcs in Gou from new perspectives, which isn’t anywhere near as interesting. This is especially an issue because the final arc in Gou gives you enough information that you should be able to figure out essentially everything that matters in the three preceding arcs of Gou. As such these arcs feel unnecessary.It’s not like these answer arcs don’t have anything worthwhile at all. The first arc I thought was pretty clever in how it essentially overlaid two of the arcs from the original on top of each other. The second is interesting in how it shows a character that was seemingly immune to Hinamizawa Syndrome getting it and it manifesting pretty differently from how it has in others. It’s a completely new story that’s pretty creepy even if you’ve gone numb to seeing Hinamizawa Syndrome in action. The third arc in hindsight I think may only be predictable to those that have read the Comic Anthology since it uses the same subject material as one of the stories in it. There are a lot of minor details that needed explanations for it to make sense, though the actual explanations given weren’t very good as they involved coincidence, luck, and things just working out how Satoko wanted them to. That fits with her character and abilities, but it’s still not all that interesting. Still, this arc does a really solid enough job of showing how low Satoko has fallen. So there is some good new content here. Just not enough for the runtime of the anime. It felt like each arc could have been cut down by an episode for a tighter better paced experience.Still, after all that it finally gets back to cliffhanger that the second to last arc of Gou ended on with Rika realizing that Satoko loops. After that, things get messy. Really messy. At first things get extreme in a way that’s very un-Higurashi-like. Still, it’s really cool and well executed so I’ll give it a pass on not actually making much sense. But then they keep going in a way that doesn’t make sense and the anime overall ends in a way that feels like it completely ignored everything that just happened. It felt like throughout the anime it was heavily emphasizing how much of a psychopath Satoko was becoming while also emphasizing how traumatized Rika was getting, but in the end they just completely shrug it off. In the end, everything that happened is treated as the equivalent of the shounen trope where two friends get into a fistfight by the river as they bare their souls to each other. It’s just incredibly bizarre. Despite all that, I would still have to say that I enjoyed what they did with the epilogue. It doesn’t fit Higurashi very well, but I’m a sucker for endings like that so I’ll take it. All in all, Gou/Sotsu have major issues, but I’m still glad they exist.The art and animation were really solid. Episode 14 especially was amazing, with the highlight being the shot early on that spun around. The animation of Rika’s Watanagashi dance was impressive in Gou, but after seeing it so many times it started getting kind of old in Sotsu. The OP and ED are both solid in terms of the songs and visuals used. I also thought the use of the insert song “You” from the original was very well done. As an aside, I didn’t mention it in my review of Gou since it would be spoilers, but I’ve always thought of Lambdadelta and Vier as Takano expys so them actually being Satoko will always feel weird. the first three arcs in Sotsu are straight up repeats of the first three arcs in Gou from new perspectives, which isn’t anywhere near as interesting.

It's a recap movie for some Super Nintendo RPG, so nobody should really be expecting more out of it, but the worst part is that the backstory lore stuff was almost interesting enough to make it worthwhile. This would have been a pretty good 4-5 episode TV arc if done correctly.For some reason they remade this later, and removed the video game tie-in stuff... I wonder about it,...but I also really don't want to have to watch this story again because that version has an even worse reputation somehow. but I also really don't want to have to watch this story again because that version has an even worse reputation somehow."", ""So, they made Trunks use an icicle as a sword. Yeah, that was the most memorable part of this OVA.I mean it's fine, nothing really good about it, but nothing terrible either. So why did I give it a 7/10 instead of 5/10 it deservers? Because like I said before, Trunks using an icicle as a sword is too hilarious and goody for me to not give it an extra 2 points. The OVA that came with the game Raging Blast 2 is basically the same plot as this so go watch that one instead because find that version more entertaining. But sadly, in...that version Trunks does not use an icicle as a sword, truly a missed opportunity.What else? Well fun fact, I guess. So, this Ova series is part of an old dragon ball game where you made choices along the way that would impact the game. Thats why the ending has a fadeout where Vegeta supposedly takes out the main villain cut to credits only to cut back to the main villain still alive. In the game the main villain even has a super form he can go into if you do not make the right choices. that version Trunks does not use an icicle as a sword, truly a missed opportunity.What else?

Furusato Japan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3367/Furusato_Japan,"['The most destructive war the world has ever faced has come to a close. A once powerful nation lies in ruins. Millions are dead, and most cities have been razed to the ground. Those responsible have much to answer for and will face punishment for their crimes.  But in the aftermath of such violence and destruction who will be left to pick up the pieces afterwards, and rebuild an entire nation?Those who are least responsible: the children. Those generations which were either too young to influence what was happening, and those who had yet to be born. They may have escaped the fighting and...bloodshed, but they have still been left with nothing. Furusato Japan is a film about a group of children living ten years after the Second World War in an impoverished district of Tokyo. Still toddlers by the time of the Pacific Victory, one cannot place any of the blame with them for Japan’s crimes during the war yet it becomes clear that the struggle to rebuild the country will be their cross to bear.Though the main cast are all children, for them childhood is only part-time; all of them must assist their parents with their work. Whether it is lead character Akira helping his father by transporting wood around town in a trolley, to Gonzo serving drinks and clearing away bottles in his father’s bar, no-one seems to be getting away easy. That is until a new girl arrives in town. Shizu is originally from Kobe and the daughter of a wealthy family. While many of the boys find her pretty to look at they are shy to admit it in front of each other and poke fun at her strange accent and wealthy background. However, all are moved by her wonderful singing voice. Her singing is so good that the new class music teacher considers her a shoe-in for the school choir, which she plans to run in a national event for the first time.All that seems like such a co-incidence, one might expect there would be something in it. Particularly when the music teacher is introduced as a “singer who could have been a professional vocalist” and Shizu says her dream is to become a singer. However there is nothing in it and it is a mere co-incidence. It’s the first of a few incidences of sloppy writing in Furusato Japan. Particularly because it could easily have been worked around without creating any problems with the rest of the story; but because they don’t even mention that fact it is a co-incidence it feels more than a tad awkward.Other examples of sloppy writing come in various plot twists which occur without any foreshadowing and feel derailing. In one instance the lack of any hints about it is justifiable, but in the other it is completely unreasonable. Attempts are made to get away with it by characters offering some explanations but these seem like token gestures put in place as an excuse for something the writers knew wouldn’t sit with the audience.Another sign of weakness in the Furusato’s writing is the script, which is pedestrian at its best and clichéd and obvious at its worst. The fault for this may lie with those who wrote the subtitles (Medgirl) but whoever is responsible should be ashamed of themselves; characters never say anything original or clever; they respond to what happens by either stating it plainly (and not bluntly). On other occasions they insert unnecessary exposition into the dialogue, which attempts to explain what the audience would know already if they had only been paying attention. This gets quite irritating after a while and leaves one with the feeling that if only they had tried just a little bit harder, this film could have been so much better.Because for all the faults I have described here, there is plenty to show that the writers gave this project quite a bit of thought. On the surface this film has a rather ordinary storyline and a terrible script, but what lies beneath is a complex ecosystem of symbolism dealing with a subject far more interesting than the lives of a few teenagers- a picture of Japan’s economic development during the post-war period. Indeed there is much that is remarkable about this subject, given that in the space of only forty years (which means that these characters would be starting to reach retirement age) the country was transformed from a war torn wreck into the second most powerful economy in the World. Much effort has been made to capture the post-war feeling in the characters. For example, two boys –Akira and Hiroshi- are said to be capable of entering a state High School, even though a small percentage of students get high enough grades to do so. Hiroshi is eager to try it out, representing Japan’s desire to strive and improve through hard work, but Akira wants to go to the local school, because he does not want to abandon his roots.These two desires, which at times conflict with each other, are the two key themes in the film. The desire to rebuild and develop to become prosperous; and the sometimes desire to retain a national identity and the traditions of the past. Furusato Japan concludes that the second is important on an intellectual level while clearly portraying the necessity of the first. Another example of this is Akira’s family heirloom, a sword which identifies them as the direct descendents of a Samurai Warrior. Akira’s family do not own a telephone- they must instead use their landlords phone, even for business calls. This causes both the landlord and the customers some irritation and it is decided that they must buy a new phone. The problem is they need money to do it- and so the prospect is raised of selling the family heirloom.  The solution to the problem makes the films position quite clear.It could be argued that this is a rather simplistic story and that does not show this film to have much depth, but to include every example would be an exercise in futility. There are some who would say that one can see links like these if one wants to see them. That claim I refute; the sheer abundance of these allusions and metaphors is not the result of wishful thinking or coincidence. It is clearly something quite deliberate. Having said that, if one is unwilling to look beyond the narrative then there is little I can recommend you about this film. The dialogue is weak and the story is not particularly original either.The characters are not particularly special either; the only member of the cast who stands out is Gon. His difficult family background and anti-social behaviour seem like rare qualities in an anime character and there is something about him which is complicated and real. One development of his character is poorly explained and this leaves us with a rather muddled picture of him, but this is quite refreshing when the other characters are so straightforward and predictable.The film does not score well for presentation either, and in many respects is weak. The studio responsible for the production, WAO World, is not particularly well known. In fact only two items in its back catalogue stand out: Speed Grapher, which was largely the work of Studio Gonzo, and the rather infamous Mars of Destruction. History aside, the art and animation in this film is typical of what one normally gets from a studio that isn’t well established: generic character designs, not terribly well animated and predictable cinematography. It does the job, and manages to avoid looking awful but there are plenty of things out there that are prettier and more exciting. One quality which is worthy of praise is the use of 3D visuals. In particular there is one scene early on in the film where a bridge is depicted in accelerated time, illustrating the way society has changed since the Second World War.While the visuals are functional, the audio is largely painful. As discussed the script was weak to begin with, but the delivery is utterly flat. Whether the characters encounter happiness or tragedy, whether they are with friends or with their teachers, everything line is delivered in the same one size fits all packaging. Even if one cannot understand what is said, one can still hear the apathy (or the absence of talent) in the voice actors. However, much like the visuals it is something which can be overcome. The soundtrack on the other hand is absolutely dreadful, which is rather problematic given its importance in the story. The film features many renditions of songs performed by the same Children’s orchestra in quick succession, which leaves the impression of stalling for time- particularly as those sequences featured random images with limited animation.Indeed there is much about Furusato Japan which is done poorly or is unremarkable, yet simply because it has some substance behind it, you cannot bring yourself to hate it. Daring to be different goes a long way in a medium which at times seems so formulaic it is mathematical. Furusato Japan on the other hand is art. Not a great masterpiece from the past which thousands of people queue up to see; rather a slightly ugly modern art piece which a few people in turtlenecks and odd hats will gather to talk about in a cafe over coffee.Or to put it another way, the film is much like the period it presents. It is a bit scruffy round the edges, and a bit impoverished. The production has a lot of faults and there isn’t much in it yet. ‘yet’. Because there is something intriguing beneath the textbook plot, the ugly character drawings, and awful soundtrack. There is something here that can be salvaged.

Geu Yeoreum,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49982/Geu_Yeoreum,"['Since nobody has written a review for this yet, I’ll be the first. I tried to watch it a long time ago but could not find a version with English subtitles (Even with my VPN, the official version is not subbed) so I forgot about it for a while. I decided to give it another go and found a version with Google translate English subtitles, which was a bit hard to understand at times but I could at least get an idea of what was happening. It’s a shame that it’s not licensed outside of Korea, since it’s a good series.The show is very down...to earth and real, kind of like Aoi Hana. There’s no exaggeration, no dramatic music, and the characters feel like real people. It’s cute and wholesome and I think like it does a spectacular job of portraying what it’s like to be wlw in an environment where that sort of thing isn’t really accepted. The show also portrays loneliness and dissatisfaction in a painfully relatable way, I could really feel what the main characters were going through because they don’t spend much time telling you what’s going on, they show you instead. I think the producers did an amazing job at creating art that imitates reality so closely, and it’s kind of refreshing, even if [spoiler]the ending was disappointing (but that only brings it closer to reality, we don’t always get happy endings)[/spoiler]The art is spectacular and so is the voice acting.

The visual aesthetic they were going for kind of reminds me of violet evergarden, and the voice acting was mellow and soothing, without the soap opera-esque crying you normally find in these sorts of shows.It’s a solid piece. 8/10', ""The Summer is an indie Korean film which follows the relationship of a young lesbian couple, from their school days to the beginning of their adulthood .To begin with, the animation is really beautiful: I love the attention to detail and the lighting. Whilst I have some qualms about the film in general, I think it's really exciting for the Korean animation industry especially to see firstly this level of original animation and secondly to see queer characters represented in Korean animation.The first 10 minutes of the film are like super slow if you feels like the sort of typical lesbians having sexual...and romantic tension and both being too shy to make a move and then being angsty over it. When they finally do get together there is really cute and there are some very wholesome scenes.Only one of the characters in the couple gets to narrate the film and I also feel like the film would have been richer if both characters in the couple could have narrated. The advertising of the film gives the impression that is going to be really wholesome but by the end of the film, it turns out it's a film where the character the main character spends a summer justifying why she wants to cheat on her partner - thus the name, 'The Summer'.For me, the main character is pretty awful to her partner in the second half. In the first half it mainly focuses on them aty school and it's kind of cute but in the second half the main character goes to unniversity and her partner eventually tries to move to the city with her. Her partner who is the sort of sporty kind of butch lesbian who is initially quite cool really struggles when she transitions into adulthood because she doesn't come from a rich family and she has a sports injury, which means that she can no longer get a sports scholarship to university. She can't really afford to move to the city unless she gets a jo, which she does and she is a very put together person even though she's doesn't always talk about her decisions. She works really hard all day to study to become a mechanic and afford better living conditions for her and her partner which is the main character.However the main character changes and that's natural when you move to the city and begin university you meet lots of new people, particularly within the lgbt community which is much larger in urban areas. The two began to drift apart, especially due to their class differences and then being in different stages of life. The butch partner doesn't always understand the importance of showing up on time and making sure she spends quality time of her partner, because her love language is acts of service and providing for her partner and playing a more stereotypically masculine role. She often fails to communicate her intentions or what she's going through which leads the main character to feel very frustrated to feel like she doesn't understand her partner and to feel like she isn't being cared.But the main character is also quite self-centered sure, for example there's a scene where her butch partner finally comes to the lesbian bar that she loves and in that moment the main character gets embarassed at her partner turning up in their team mechanics clothing and being very obviously working class and she talks about the shame she felt. The main character never really overcomes out or fully apologizes for. It not long later she falls for a character who sports several visual symbols of wealth, for example expensive watch, and eventually breaks up with her partner to be with this woman.Whilst my friends talked about it as like his sort of story about someone who's like naive and immature which makes a lot of sense I also felt frustrated that the narrative of the butch partner never really gets the same chance to show her side of the story, because Ifor her there's an expectation or a pressure as the more masculine presenting person to also fulfill that more so typically masculine role of providing. So even if she doesn't verbalize it, she's always thinking about how to provide for her girlfriend. It's frustrating that the main character doesn't understand this and she's really immature.At the end it returns to seeing from when they were younger and one of the conversations they had- this could have been better if instead of showing the scene from the main characters perspective, they could have shown the scene from her partner's perspective, like in Aku No Hana.Overall this wasn't necessarily a bad film, my dislike/disagreement is more personal than artistic. I think the studio and animators who worked on this definitely have a lot of potential and I hope they make more stuff in the future and that there's more queer Korean animation. It's definitely important that films like this can made so they can pave the path for more films about queer lives in the future. and romantic tension and both being too shy to make a move and then being angsty over it.

So I watched this when it first aired but I\'m of course not a kid. It\'s kind of a typical magical girl show for kids but the demographic is much younger than let\'s say Sailor Moon.

Hitohira,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1721/Hitohira,"[""Chances are, last Spring when you where watching the likes of Lucky Star and Gurren Lagann you were not watching this little gem.  Hitohira slipped under the radar and went for the most part unnoticed.  Although Hitohira shares the school drama format of many shows from the time, it puts an original spin on it, ensuring viewer attention.Hitohira's storyline is an interesting subject, parts of it are dazzlingly original while other parts are downright generic and predictable.  Whilst the basis of the school drama genre is all too familiar, what actuals happens in Hitohira is a refreshing change, albeit a change still...confined by the shackles of the genre.  The series explores the theme of self-confidence to marvellous effect.  The series has a unique pace to it, most easily identified by the event that usually ends this kind of show not actually being the end of the series.  There are a few good twists in the storyline but the main problem is that they're way too predictable, and easily seen coming by anyone paying attention.  Nevertheless the storyline progresses nicely and matches the episode count.The animation is of the usual standard for anime these days, adequate but not pushing any boundaries.  The character designs really stand out, they're imaginative, cute and just plain likeable.  The backgrounds are somewhat mediocre though.  The animation style works really well with the series.Hitohira is one of the anime audio experiences, the soundtrack is superb, full of well composed and arranged piano and woodwind pieces, it suits the series incredibly.  The  opening theme &quot;Yume, Hitohira&quot; by Yuuko Asami is beautiful and credit to the series, the ending theme &quot;Smile&quot; by Mai Mizuhashi whilst not as good is still certainly worthwhile.  Perhaps its to be expected from a series about a drama club but the voice acting mind blowing.  With Kimoto Orie in particular standing out as lead character Asai Mugi, she portrays Asai's shy nature perfectly and expresses her true voice just as well.  The other seiyuu's represent their characters brilliantly too but Kimoto steals the limelight.The characters are the other exceptional aspect of Hitohira, they've got interesting personalities and are genuinely likeable as a consequence, which allows the dramatic side of the series to have a much greater impact on the viewer.  Hitohira is a masterclass in character development, best shown through the development of main character Asai Mugi, the changes to her personality are clearly noticeable after she overcomes each obstacle in the series and the series ends with an Asai almost unrecognisable when compared to the one at the start.  The other characters aren't left out, they get their own storylines which are fully developed in a way that captivates the viewer.Hitohira is very enjoyable experience, there's plenty of gripping drama and enough comic relief to prevent the viewer being bogged down by it all.

While others may not agree with me but this series was indeed underrated and it wasn't a mainstream series to begin with. Considering there wasn't anything special about the series, I still recommend it as its fairly enjoyable in a whole.In moving on, the central focus of this series is on Asai Mugi. As the synopsis already mentioned she transfers into a new school, has trouble speaking publicly and now she is pushed into joining a drama club. Now when...a person who has trouble speaking publicly and then all of a sudden joins a drama stage acting club, you will be sure there will be some funny acts and humorous moments to entertain your viewing  purposes.As mentioned before, the central focus is on Asai Mugi so great character development can be seen from here. Not only we are being entertained by her, but we get to watch and see her grow from the events she is given. We get to see how she manages to build her confidence, lift her spirits and achieve the dreams she wants. In addition, we get to see how her friends and rivals play a vital part with her learning experiences, and indeed you will be entertained in some of their activities they do.Inconclusion, if you enjoy school based dramas then this one shouldn't be overlooked. Its a funny and lovely series where, at times, there are favorable moments. a person who has trouble speaking publicly and then all of a sudden joins a drama stage acting club, you will be sure there will be some funny acts and humorous moments to entertain your viewing  purposes.As mentioned before, the central focus is on Asai Mugi so great character development can be seen from here.

Definitely one that's worth a watch.Story:The story has a good pacing, but the arrangement could have been better. Although the introduction was done very well, the ending loses in comparison. Ending is a very important part of a story, it gives the last impression which a lot of people based their score on. Though Hitohira's ending was lovely, some parts were not presented well enough and kinda awkward to see. But the message of the anime was beautiful, so if you could sit back relax and don't mind so much about details,...it's really an amazing story.Art &amp; Animation:No doubt the art is great. For an anime about school and slice of life, Xebec M2 studio did a good job animating. You won't see lousy animating such as crappy movement much in Hitohira. They did a good job animation the OP &amp; ED too , you can get a good idea of how all the characters are like by just watching the OP. ED is simple and nice. Although it's a little plain,i never got bored watching it. Another thing that i like is the beautiful background thoughout this anime.Music:Nothing much to say about the soundtrack, it fits the anime but i do wish they have some background music which could really bring out the emotions in the story. OP has a nice song which suit the anime very well. ED was cute. Smile smile :DCharacters:One thing really good about this anime is that it has a very good character developement. Each character is very well design and portrayed. This is one of the key points for me loving this. The character growth especially the one for Mugi was perfect. The seiyuu for Mugi could have done a better job though, but i won't blame her, trying to voice someone who is really scared of talking is not an easy job.Conclusion:Overall, this anime is surprisingly good. It's really enjoyable as there are many unexpected turn of events as well as lol moments. I wouldn't say that it's an epic masterpiece, but comparing with most slice of life anime, this is certainly one of the goodies that you should watch. it's really an amazing story.Art &amp; Animation:No doubt the art is great.

The series follows her first school year where she is recruited into a drama club and how she changes as a person.The story was quite interesting, in that it portrayed school life from a different point of view, not so much sports or exams and stuff,but on a particular club. The story emphasizes on the theme of friendship and self confidence, not so much on romance. Though it does have a small bit of romance it is not one of the main themes, and is...merely used to create a more real school experience, though i did wish that they focussed on the romantic aspect of the show, this would have brought out the true potential that the show has, as it does set up some nice couples.Anyway, it is a good story that can be inspiring to some and palces lots of value on friendship thopugh some may find it a bit like a yuri, i think it is just the deep friendship that the characters have for each other. I found the ending the best part of the series, in how they depicted the end as a new beginning(won't say anymore then that) and how they brought out the nonstalgia, that is something that this anime did quite well.I liked the art, it was something different from the more popular animes, suttle yet suitable for such an anime. The use of sakura is heavily applied in the anime which is unique yet a bit common at the same time.The sound was nothing special, the opening and closing songs were okay. though there was'nt much of an attempt at inserts to help bring out the mood or atmosphere in the show.The characters conveyed some depth but i cannot compare them to that of the longer series which would obviously have deeper characters due to the longer span, but each character is of some importance and is not left out at all. Even the side characters have a decent amount of showtime and are influential to the story. The character development in this show was quite good but a bit unrealistic due to the pace at which it occured which is attrbuted to the short timespan of the series, this is something i didn't like.I enjoyed the series only so much because of the meaning as well as the comedy that wassuccessfully pulled off. Some people may even be able to empathize with the characters which makes it more interesting to watch, but i just did not find it captivating enough.Overall, the story is not a typical cliched school life and the school life is quite realistic to an extent. There is a lot of drama in the show with a little romance. If you are a romance fan then i don't suggest this anime but if you like meaningful animes with a school based theme and a lot of drama you might want to give it a try.

The story of a shy character getting in the drama club is appealing. You already see the conflicts the main character will have to overcome, and the change in her personnality as a consequence. As I haven't seen mangas about drama clubs, though I'd be surprised there wouldn't be any other out there, the idea isn't overused, and quite relatable since people tend to recommend acting classes for shy kids, and since I was quite a shy kid myself, I've been through that.The anime, though, did not make a very good first impression on me....I found the first episode clumsy : too much exposition, for little knowledge about the characters. They all looked shallow to me, with some exceptions. Nishida Kai, the male lead, is well introduced, lively, boisterous yet considerate ; and Chitose Kanna, one of the main character's friends, somewhat of a rival to her, who touched me with her love for drama, something I could relate to and felt real ; also the character is funny, I laughed quite a few times throughout the anime thanks to her. On the other hand, the main character seemed defined only by her shyness, her best friend seemed lackluster - as I felt her love for photography was more or less a way to botch her up, since we don't know anything else about her - and the Drama Research Club, a bit too cliché for my taste.The art didn't appeal to me that much. I found the sakuras overwhelming, and all this red everywhere, the uniforms, the hair, too much for me. All throughout the anime I had this weird feeling that the voice of the main character didn't fit, although the actor does an impressive job playing out her shyness. The music pissed me off : I found it most of times not that befitting to the scenes, not helping that much conveying the emotions at hand. All of these little things that put me off at first.Still, I carried on, and found myself willing to watch an episode after the other. Some change of scenery throughout the episodes felt refreshing, and the struggles of shyness while learning acting little by little is an interesting topic. What especially saved the anime for me was that the character development clicked. Through learning the backstory of the characters, they somewhat gained a bit of that depth the first episode couldn't give them. Yet, the second half of the anime was a bit of a struggle to watch for me, as I found it unnecessarily overdramatic, didn't find the story very compelling and as a consequence, I didn't enjoy the resolution that much.Overall, the show can be enjoyable, but not of the greatests. The idea is good and the anime does a fine job working it out. I leave opened the fact that my impressions can be misleading, as there's no accounting for taste. However, I'm pretty confident that there are better stories out there. I found the first episode clumsy : too much exposition, for little knowledge about the characters. They all looked shallow to me, with some exceptions. Nishida Kai, the male lead, is well introduced, lively, boisterous yet considerate ; and Chitose Kanna, one of the main character's friends, somewhat of a rival to her, who touched me with her love for drama, something I could relate to and felt real ; also the character is funny, I laughed quite a few times throughout the anime thanks to her. On the other hand, the main character seemed defined only by her shyness, her best friend seemed lackluster - as I felt her love for photography was more or less a way to botch her up, since we don't know anything else about her - and the Drama Research Club, a bit too cliché for my taste.The art didn't appeal to me that much. I found the sakuras overwhelming, and all this red everywhere, the uniforms, the hair, too much for me. All throughout the anime I had this weird feeling that the voice of the main character didn't fit, although the actor does an impressive job playing out her shyness. The music pissed me off : I found it most of times not that befitting to the scenes, not helping that much conveying the emotions at hand. All of these little things that put me off at first.Still, I carried on, and found myself willing to watch an episode after the other. Some change of scenery throughout the episodes felt refreshing, and the struggles of shyness while learning acting little by little is an interesting topic. What especially saved the anime for me was that the character development clicked. Through learning the backstory of the characters, they somewhat gained a bit of that depth the first episode couldn't give them.

Some might say that this anime exactly like Clannad minus the good parts, but I think this anime is pretty decent for a low budgeted one.The story features Asai Mugi, a dreadfully shy girl that even gets tongue tied when she\'s nervous. Mugi joins the drama club,and throughout the anime she keeps blaming herself that she\'s hopeless and blah, but after...certain events happen, she started to find her true voice, the voice that she is.This anime is pretty simple and it is a little dramatic, good to say that this anime really brought the emotions. The only problem was the animation and the voice actors. Mugi\'s ""real"" voice was a little too over the top and she cries like a pig. The animation\'s colors was a little blank because the atmosphere looked like a 50\'s movie because of its ""sepia-like"" coloring. But the form of the characters was pretty good and i guess the only true downfall of the set of characters is the lead herself.Story9 - it was pretty god and dramatic. i really liked the story overall. I really recommend this to on-stage drama enthusiastsArt6 - the drawings were pretty good but i hate the poor coloringSound6 - the background music was average for a dramatic anime// voice actors were good except for Mugi\'s which i thought was a little patheticCharacter8 - they weren\'t presented formally in my opinion due to lack of background but they developed pretty good so an 8 it is.Enjoyment8 - I really enjoyed the anime because it was fun seeing them practice and how the heat of the two drama clubs competition is. I also enjoyed the drama which is not too mush but not too less too.Overall8 - I give this anime an 8 because even though it has poor coloring and looked like a 90\'s anime, it has a pretty awesome story and good character relationships, especially of Nono and Mirei. certain events happen, she started to find her true voice, the voice that she is.This anime is pretty simple and it is a little dramatic, good to say that this anime really brought the emotions.

The twist is she is a naturally shy person who breaks down around other people. I found this to be an interesting yet cliche premise to the story. Nothing really stands out plot wise after this event at all , but that is not to say the plot is bad , just that it lacks originally. One key point people should be aware of when...looking into this anime is the fact the pacing is HORRIBLE past episode 8. While the last episode does conclude things nicely the series drew out the plot from episodes 1-8 too much, they literally turned a 4 episode arc into an 8 episode one ( nicely done though , but it left them no material for the remainder of the series ) and it is like they realized this and tried to throw a plot together for the remaining episodes only to fail horribly ( again minus the final episode ).Characters 7/10Much like the story it is like the creators had no idea what to do after episode 8. They built up the two main characters only to put them into ""filler"" with their development. Had this been a 24 episode series this would have been fine , but on episode 9 of 12 to basically cut off all character development is a total joke. Aside from this I personally hated how they only developed one other character , and that would be the "" antagonist "" of the series.Art 7/10The characters looked decent , and I did not notice any animination issues. My only complaint with this series art wise would be the coloring. The coloring was very bland for the series.Sound 7/10Again , everything was decent. My only complaint was the crying of the main character. Sounded VERY  forced.Enjoyment 7/10Aside from pacing issues this series had a good story with decent characters that made me enjoy the series. The reason this is an average rating for enjoyment is due to lack of drama , lack of comedy , and the pacingOverall 7/10I suggest this series to anyone who wants a layed back school anime , with a decent plot and characters and does not expect too much development of the plot or characters. looking into this anime is the fact the pacing is HORRIBLE past episode 8.

What a beautiful surprise it was! Sometimes having low expectations is the key to enjoy something even more. Maybe that was the case for me or maybe it was that this ""little"" anime is really nice! In any case here is my review on it :Concerning the Story & CharactersThe story is simple and straightforward but at the same time engaging. There aren\'t any really complicated situations or unexpected turnarounds or something like that. It\'s not over-dramatic either. However it never feels shallow or boring. There\'s a nice progression overall and 12 episodes felt exactly right. Not too long or too short.The...characters are this anime\'s great strength. They\'re interesting and well developed. Their struggles, doubts, worries as well as their happiness is expressed in a beautiful way. For example lets take Mugi. In most anime it\'s not clear how exactly the characters grow stronger. I mean at some point they\'re really weak and then suddenly after getting some beating they become much stronger for no other apparent reason. This is not the case here. In those 12 episodes we see in detail how Mugi grows stronger, how her personality changes for the best and how she\'s able to overcome even her own irrational (pathological) fears.Concerning the Art & SoundThe art was fine. Characters were distinctive and well drown. Animation was fine too. I didn\'t really like the opening or the ending songs but then again that doesn\'t really affect the anime itself. However the music and sound effects inside the episodes were fitting. The voice acting was very nice (i saw the Japanese version dunno if there\'s a dub)Overall I enjoyed Hitohira very much! It\'s a sweet, heartwarming anime that doesn\'t underestimate the viewers. Watch it! characters are this anime\'s great strength. They\'re interesting and well developed.

Ikkitousen: Xtreme Xecutor,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7580/Ikkitousen__Xtreme_Xecutor,"[""More of the same from this series. It's one of almost half a dozen Romance of the three kingdoms animes being done in the same season.  As before its almost pure, unadulterated fanservice with gratuitous panty shots and clothes tearing for no apparent reason.If you like that kinda thing, watch away. If you like substance in there somewhere, avoid at all costs. "", ""Before reading please note that this is the latest season as of 2010, if you did not watch the previous seasons I highly suggest that you do so.Right off the bat flashbacks.  So if you did choose to watch this season first you will be slightly confused since there are a lot of flashbacks and references to past events.  While it may be possible to just watch this series and enjoy it because of all the fan service, that alone does not make this story line good.  From beginning to end, watching each characters progression through a life that they are forced...to live in because to the magatama that has been passed down to them.  Now that is where the story is.  Each persons magatama represents a famous person from a war that happened long ago.  While that does have a very big influence on how each characters act, that is not entirely the case in this season.  This season try's to point everyone in the direction that you do not have to be tied down to the fate of your own magatama.Wait... what artwork?  The only thing that you notice in this anime are the girls boobs.  Strategically ripped/torn clothing.  I honestly can't remember but I am pretty sure that not one girl wears a bra, so every fight you see boobs.  This is in my opinion the biggest selling point of this anime.  You most likely watched this anime because you wanted to see half naked girls fighting each other.Opening song is decently catchy.  It is slightly fast paced to match the fact that a fighting anime is about to start.  Other than that nothing much to say about the sounds, unless you want to count the moans ands groans that the girls make. ^_^Information about characters are based on the persons magatama.  Based on history from the past that information is taken into account in the present day to predict what may happen.  Apparently everyone is based on a book called the three kingdoms.  I don't know if the book is real or not, and honestly I don't care.  Unless the book has pictures of boobs on every page I am not interested.While the story is not the best ever, it is very entertaining to watch.  Best part about this series are the fight scenes.  Every single fight you see boobs left and right.  It just puzzles me that the fight can be so intense that clothes are ripping everywhere, but panties seem to be indestructible.  I mean come on just go all the way... but then again if that happened this anime could easily turn into a hentai.  Either one would have been fine by me but whatever.If you are the kind of person that likes to have a good story behind the anime that you watch you might want to stay away from this one, unless you like boobs.

', 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Somewhat review for the whole franchise. By somewhat I mean a minimally, as I watched previous seasons many years ago.✦StoryThe whole story I\'ll sum up in a following way. Story is basically about martial artists who use power of historical and legendarry warriors. That\'s all you need. There is plenty of character development and depth to a story whilst staying now and then simple as fodder for fights. Story I didn\'t mind for the most times, it was fun to know about various powers and cause of...their fights. Probably story presentation wise only complaint I have and a big complaint as it\'s something I despise in general, are they rapey themes.✦Art&SoundMusic and OST is quite enjoyable and hype at times. So don\'t have much complaint for the sound part, it\'s good, but nothing amazing.As for art I have a quite a specific complaint about it. It\'s a fanservice anime obviously, but usually with fanservice you either get cute fanservice, lewd fanservice, sexy/hot fanservice and so on, but with this anime it felt really ""loose"" type of women fanservice, not sure if s word is allowed in reviews thus the ""loose"" word. Anyhow, women were here hot, but not in a enjoyable way. They really felt loose type of hot, which was a huge turnoff. Ofcourse style of clothing was also pretty loose. Good for those who like breast, as this franchise offers lot of clothes being ripped and also western type of body types and clothes with ""loose"" vibe that they ooze with.Anyhow, art was for most part good, fights were cool, could see lot of women, but style was simply not nice for me at all. Looseness regarding fanservice is worst type of fanservice for me.✦CharacterThere are a lot of characters in this franchise. Some are good, some are okay, some literally annoy the hell out of me. Lot of s....""loose"" type of women as well and plenty of rapists on both gender sides... But development and the links between all of the characters nevertheless left off a good impression.✦Enjoyment & OverallIt\'s been like 7 years since I watched last ""Ikki Tousen"" , score\'wise it seems that I used to enjoy it more than now. But yeah the obvious things that I pointed out that I disliked and big factor for it. I did like the fights and plenty of chicks. But yeah, biggest downside which miracously didn\'t lower score that much was the whole thematic of ""looseness"" that anime simply oozed of.. was absolutely a biggest turnoff of this anime.Feel like this was more of a personal view rant, but ehm that what reviews basically are. Each viewer creates their own point of view and dislikes&likes regarding what is being ""reviewed"" . Mine simply changes its shape now and then. Feedback is welcome on my blog where review system is being explained.To sum it all up. Ikkitousen is a good franchise, if you don\'t like fanservice, that I do not recommend to watch this at all as it\'s one of the pinnacle of annoying fanservice anime. (for me), but if you like any sorts of fanservice and on top of the this type of ""looseness"" style, then its your Anime. As well if you want to watch for most part cool martial arts fight sequences, then it\'s as well your anime. their fights.

That could be a good or bad thing depending on how you felt about the second season, personally I like when the show leans more into the grounded slice of life stuff and doesn't rely too much on the poorly defined dragon magic and historical battles as a narrative device. I like the inclusion of the new tomboy character, adding a fresh face can sometimes liven up a stagnant story. Every other character seems to be pretty much unchanged from previous seasons, with perhaps the exception of Hakufu briefly taking...on a mentor role. Honestly the training montage where she keeps getting famous quotes wrong is one of the highlights of the show.The whole misadventure of the fake tournament that leads everyone to that island with all the boring dragon magic stuff was... boring. This is a titty fighting anime, don't get so bogged down in lore that's needlessly complicated while somehow managing to remain incredibly vague. The last episode also has what feels like a really rushed final confrontation that doesn't go anywhere, and it almost felt like they were trying to start and then wrap up and entirely new story arc all within the second half of a single episode. The heavy use of stills really contributed to the feeling of a rushed production.Overall, Ikkitousen is and always has been pretty much exactly what it says on the box, a cross section of history porn and actual porn. 7/10 on a mentor role.

Ikkitousen has a lot of fanservice. But oh my god, it is absolutely not worth it.This season, and most of the series, is a nightmare. The art is about the only competent feature. The plot is also so poor. In the end, you find yourself wondering what the point of all their bullshit is, other than simply being compelled via destiny. That is not a plot you grow attached to. The characters are not diverse at all and their names are completely bland and hard to memorize. There are scenes where two characters refer to the same person, by completely different...names within the same 10 seconds. This absolutely boiled my blood.

Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7088/Ichiban_Ushiro_no_Daimaou,"['""That\'s why I decided not to think about anything anymore!""That\'s a good one-line summary of this anime taken straight from the last episode. It\'s safe to say that the enjoyment of this anime is inversely proportional to the amount of plot stuffed into one episode. Simply, the more plot, the less fun. Ichiban is a harem anime. That means it doesn\'t exist to cater to the brain, and it doesn\'t. You should be aware that if you\'re going to watch this anime, then you\'re watching it for a good laugh, a small smirk, and moments where you can go ""Oh Japan!"" and laugh at what...makes it onto millions of TV sets across seas. You will like the fight scenes, and you will never learn the characters names - you will refer to them by hair color.Story: 5/10The demon lord, 100 years ago, tried to destroy humanity. The demon lord was killed and peace resumed, and up until our story begins, nothing as terrible has happened since then. Here our protagonist is introduced, Sai Akuto. His goal is be someone of great authority who will lead people to lead righteous lives (the anime alludes to the Pope). He then meets Hattori Junko, or ""the Blue one"", and she and Sai hit it off and look like they\'re going to be great friends. Then a tweest. Sai Akuto is designated by the sorting hat, I mean, the Yata-Garasu, as the future demon lord! Oh no! Blue gets mad, challenges Sai to a duel, then tsundere love kicks into effect and then a robot (Green) comes out of nowhere and an invisible girl gets fingered (Red) all in one episode! Actually, the exposition was pretty awesome and I really enjoyed it... But... It is safe to say, that the plot of the anime was almost nil after the first episode. Eventually we have incestuous sibling love, the power rangers, ninja idols, time travel, pseudo-space and all other kinds of crazy stuff coming into the anime. I understand it\'s anime about magic where \'anything could happen because we are led into a mysterious world whose limits are not ever revealed\' but I would like at least some boundaries. When the mysterious man who is awkwardly introduced tried to rape numerous protagonists with giant sea cucumbers, I could safely say that I no longer took the plot seriously. But that\'s okay. It\'s a harem.Art: 8/10Think Gurren Lagann fight scenes. Then turn it down a little bit and make sure that there is a lot more OVER 9000 and laser beams and is sped up about fourteen times. You now have a good idea about what fight scenes in Ichiban are like. Animation is superb, art is a little different. The art for me was a little too generic. It felt kind of like fluidity and motion were really nice but left more to desire when someone wasn\'t kicking ass. If you were to compare this to numerous other harem anime, it just doesn\'t seem to be much different visually. But that\'s okay. It has cool fight scenes.Sound: 7/10Aki Toysaki does a really awesome job as Soga Keena (Red), but if you don\'t like her then I recommend turning the volume off, she gets a LOT of screen time, and talks a crap load. Aoi Yuuki (who voiced Mina Tepes from Vampire Bund and Noel from Sora no Woto) had a great voice too. She voiced a monotone character, but did a really job making it sound ""not as monotone.""  I really had no affection toward the OP or the ED. But that\'s okay. They suited a harem anime very well, and maybe you\'ll like them because music is a developed taste.Character: 6/10I don\'t know whether to give this a 1 for about a million bland characters, or a 10 for Peterhausen the dragon who shoots fiery drills. The main cast is a pallet of fun (rimshot). Everyone is a different hair color and a different ""dere"" so they\'re easy to tell apart! That\'s where the harem anime has the most trouble in my opinion. A harem has set archetypal characters and refuses to create an original endearing woman. I\'m not saying that any woman in this anime is poorly written. Each one is written with her character in mind, but never strays from what the textbook says. Red is an airhead, Etou (Purple) is masochist, Blue is tsundere, and Green is emotionless. All of them can be summed up in one word.Sai Akuto is on the other hand, a very interesting character. The setting continually sets him up to be a bad guy, but somehow he always manages to do the right thing, whether people know he\'s doing it or not. The typical male protagonist in a harem always tries to avoid temptation, but without a clear motive as to why. For example, for some craaaazy reason one of the beautiful ladies has appeared in front of our protagonist naked.Our protagonist, who very often envisions this event happening, suddenly has an over-powering urge to avoid any sexually conduct with this woman. BUT WHY? She\'s beautiful, naked, and right freaking in front of you! This creates character inconsistencies, but where our protagonist differs, is that when he refuses the woman (which alas he does), he is still in character. In summary, Sai Akuto is a good guy, and no one can tell him otherwise. I like that. As for the rest of the other characters, they\'re nothing special. But that\'s okay. Sai is a really cool character you\'ll love to see on screen, and to boot he isn\'t a sissy wimp like a lot of other harem protagonists!Enjoyment: 7/10Even with so many things working against this anime, there are so many moments where you\'ll seriously just laugh. I enjoyed a great portion of this anime. The only problem I really had was with the plot. But that\'s definitely okay! I remembered that it was a harem anime and anyone who forgets this key factor should try to understand that a little bit of mindless humor is good once in a while.Overall: 6/10Ichiban is not a memorable anime. It really has nothing worth remembering (except Peterhausen). It just follows a long line of other harem anime into oblivion. But hey, it\'s only 12 episodes, and it\'s a fun little anime. I\'d say it\'s worth recommending, but not worth ask feedback on. The response you\'ll get will be ""Well... It was a harem anime... I liked \'X female\'"" so on and etc.But that\'s okay. Because it IS a harem anime and expecting anything more than that is just plain craziness. makes it onto millions of TV sets across seas. You will like the fight scenes, and you will never learn the characters names - you will refer to them by hair color.Story: 5/10The demon lord, 100 years ago, tried to destroy humanity. The demon lord was killed and peace resumed, and up until our story begins, nothing as terrible has happened since then. Here our protagonist is introduced, Sai Akuto. His goal is be someone of great authority who will lead people to lead righteous lives (the anime alludes to the Pope). He then meets Hattori Junko, or ""the Blue one"", and she and Sai hit it off and look like they\'re going to be great friends. Then a tweest. Sai Akuto is designated by the sorting hat, I mean, the Yata-Garasu, as the future demon lord! Oh no! Blue gets mad, challenges Sai to a duel, then tsundere love kicks into effect and then a robot (Green) comes out of nowhere and an invisible girl gets fingered (Red) all in one episode! Actually, the exposition was pretty awesome and I really enjoyed it... But... It is safe to say, that the plot of the anime was almost nil after the first episode. Eventually we have incestuous sibling love, the power rangers, ninja idols, time travel, pseudo-space and all other kinds of crazy stuff coming into the anime. I understand it\'s anime about magic where \'anything could happen because we are led into a mysterious world whose limits are not ever revealed\' but I would like at least some boundaries. When the mysterious man who is awkwardly introduced tried to rape numerous protagonists with giant sea cucumbers, I could safely say that I no longer took the plot seriously. But that\'s okay.

Because it IS a harem anime and expecting anything more than that is just plain craziness.', 'Is it just me, or is the playback rate at 200%?\'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou (The Great Demon King in the Very Back)\' is set in an elite magic school where aspiring magicians learn to control their mana. The initial setting is very similar to \'To Aru Majutsu no Index\'. One day, a transfer student (Akuto Sai) arrives. New students are required to go through an analysis by the ""artificial spirit"", which predicts future occupation with 100% accuracy. Surprisingly, the artificial spirit predicts Akuto will become the next Demon King. Once dreamed of becoming the High Priest, Akuto must spend his school life with the burden...of becoming the ultimate evil while his true powers awaken, going through one misunderstanding after another.Story:I actually found the original setting to be very intriguing. My impression after the first two episodes were... it\'s good enough that it didn\'t even have to be ecchi. The setting itself had the fantasy, opportunity for interesting story development, and possible obstacles all built in. It even had a super cool background where Akuto\'s self-introduction sounded like the real demon king that appeared 100 year ago.I haven\'t read the light novel or the manga series, but from the anime, it seems like the title ""The Great Demon King in the Very Back"" comes from the fact that Akuto was given the seat in the very last row of his classroom. Sadly, the title of this anime series foreshadowed the pattern of story development... You would think Akuto will slowly become a dark presence in the back of his classroom while he tries to clear all the misunderstandings right? Think again. If I\'m not mistaken, he hasn\'t sat in his seat since episode two. And so, the story jumped from one direction to another, random new organizations and villains appeared out of nowhere, and it eventually became mindless fights before the series ended, leaving me completely clueless. It actually got so bad at one point that Akuto threw a monster egg out of a window during breakfast, and the next cut was the crew outside at night in front of the monster egg, which grew exponentially. Really, it\'s one of those 突っ込み所が多すぎて ""I don\'t know where I should begin pointing out the flaws"".Just like that monster egg, the story seemed to have an exponential acceleration in terms of pacing. The first two episodes had good pacing as introduction of the surroundings. Up until episode 7 was fast paced, but acceptable for slapstick comedy, but the final 5 episodes were packed with random events and explanations that seemed to go on and on without giving the audience time to absorb the story. The characters in the latter half actually started verbally describing the situation, and it wasn\'t even a deliberate slapstick joke.I have to say the ecchi element was applied very effectively in this series though. Sometimes ecchi scenes were forced, like repetitive explosions stripping Junko or Keina getting naked every time she becomes transparent, but somehow they were funny every single time. Other ones happen more spontaneously, from skirts too short and creative camera angles that seem to focus on their panties. If there was a cameraman for this show, he was a major perv. This show is probably the closest to hentai category as an under-18 show can possibly get. It goes as far as giving a sea cucumber hand job until it squirts sticky white goo on another girl\'s face in a certain episode, and ""classic tentacle hold"" (you know the one I\'m talking about if you\'ve even seen an action hentai series) where one tentacle almost goes all the way in.In the end, the story was a mess, and there were way too many loose ends and question marks unanswered.Animation:Extremely inconsistent.The character designs are very good. Akuto has the obvious ""mark of the Demon King"" below his eye, but it keeps his appearance somewhat original, and he has that cool look and badass confidence that will eventually attract all the girls and create his harem. The girls are all hot, and there were abundance of fan service. Action scenes are pretty cool, and early episodes had really nice CG effects with magic circles and spectacular spells.Unfortunately, they try to be ""So bad it\'s actually good"" with Brave and villains similar to something out of ""Needless"" or even ""Scryed"" about half way, and fails miserably. Monsters attracted by Akuto\'s powers looked like they\'re from late \'90s demon hentai anime.Perhaps it was caused by deadlines or budget, the animation quality noticeably degrades as the show go on.Sound:Voice acting is decent. All the characters sound like they should, and none particularly annoying. Considering the (presumably) low budget they had, they gathered a decent cast as voice actors.Music score is disastrous. Although none of the pieces were out of place, the back ground music completely lack originality, and made absolutely no impact to the viewing experience.OP/ED were average. They fit the series pretty well, but not especially catchy.Character:All the main characters were extremely likable, and had unique backgrounds. However, very few of them actually developed as the show had hazardous pacing problems. Junko remained an archetype tsundere to the end, and Fujiko was a SM queen who we don\'t know if she was a ""S"" personality who wanted to control Akuto or a ""M"" personality who wanted to serve under him. I feel Akuto and his henchman Hiroshi were somewhat well-developed, but the pacing made it impossible to pursue such deep issues such as responsibility, justice, morality, and all those things they wanted to explore.I really liked Korone\'s character. An android with sense of humor done right is rare, and the character developed as much as an android could in a 12-episode-long series. She was also a very effective comedic device, and I liked how she gave Akuto the hardest time with her sexual approaches.Enjoyment/Overall:\'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou\' had a great potential to become something special. The show started out pretty strong, and had the slapstick comedy seemed to be working at first, but it was a downward spiral from there. As mentioned many times before, the pacing is far too fast, even for a slapstick comedy series. They tried to pack 20 episodes worth of material into a 12-episode, 1-season long series. Everything seemed to be twice as fast as they should be. I tend to read subtitle as future reference for fansubbing, but I gave up halfway because the characters were babbling nonsense at an absurd rate. Also, if you blank out for 3 seconds, chances are you missed an important explanation of the plot, a cool action scene, or even worse, a panchira.Perhaps it would\'ve been better if they added some more material and extended to a 2-season long series, but then again, it would\'ve been even longer painful viewing experience unless they made major modifications to the story. Despite the worthless production value of this show, it\'s an enjoyable series if you shut down half of your brain because the characters had the charm and it offers good laughs from many ecchi jokes and misunderstandings Akuto had gone through in the first half of the series.I feel the major problem was that \'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou\' tried to be too many things. There was ecchi, comedy, drama, and tried to tackle the issue of right and wrong. The producers should\'ve simply made it an 12-episode long ecchi-driven slapstick comedy, or 25-episode long action drama with a philosophical touch. Not both. of becoming the ultimate evil while his true powers awaken, going through one misunderstanding after another.Story:I actually found the original setting to be very intriguing.

Not both.', 'This is why I liked Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. It had the most ""badass"" protagonist I have ever seen (Sai Akuto). I loved how the characters, effects  and environment were drawn. There was many turning points where I was amazed how the things turned out absolutely other way, what I first thought. :) Tiny little minus in the anime was that there could have been less ecchi scenes, but most of them were saved by they turning to funny or awkward moments. Which were a good things/parts because I got to laugh in those moments. :P If there is second season coming, Im \tcertainly...gonna watch it. If the anime intrests you even little, I recommend you to watch it! gonna watch it. If the anime intrests you even little, I recommend you to watch it!', 'I started watching this the first week it was aired, so I was following most of this as it was being subbed, apart from the last 4 episodes which I burst through this evening by force.This anime starts off very strong in my opinion, it is funny, it is reasonably paced, the characters are interesting, and although there are hints of being slightly generic on occassion in the first few episodes, I dismissed them as everything else was great.The intro hooks you as it starts out at a train station, the main protagonist Sai Akuto is getting on the train to his new school with...hopes of becoming a priest, how wrong his hopes will turn out to be though.Immediately he meets with one of the female heroines, and gets off to a rocky start, which is quickly remedied, and they quickly become friends, and from that introduction easing you in, it starts throwing scraps of the main plot at you, mixed in with interesting characters and lots of funny moments to keep you interested, it seemed so perfect at first, to me at least, as everything was right, everything fit, it seemed great and I couldn\'t say a bad word about it.The main character was likeable, he wasn\'t a stale, brown haired with glasses ""I want to always do the right thing nothing else matters I won\'t hurt people but I don\'t want to die"" cliché piece of rubbish we\'ve seen a million times. He was a unique character, interesting, likeable. He wasn\'t afraid to stand up, to get in a fight where necessary, but he tried to avoid it otherwise in a reasonable fashion, a simple first hurdle that so many protagonists in this kind of genre fail at and which anger me every time.The female heroines had some generic stereotypes thrown in here and there, but overall were a solid set of characters, all unique and different, with different motives for being with the protagonist, different goals in mind, all drawn to him and all playing an important part to the main plot evenly, no girl is completely left out.On a personal side note I absolutely adored the robot girl and student council president. Especially the president, my lord she was brilliant.The other \'throwaway\' side characters as I like to call them aren\'t annoying, they\'re reasonably likeable, they do their job well and don\'t feel forced.Overall the cast was very solid and worked together well.The main problem with this series though, is that it starts to rush things.REALLY rush things, and it loses a lot of it\'s charm, especially around the middle sections to near the end.Before you know it, everything has been introduced for a base to build the main plot on, then suddenly the main plot kicks into overdrive and you\'re left sitting with your head cocked to one side, confused as to where this all of a sudden came from, who these new people are, what is actually going on. Especially in the build up to the last few episodes.It was obvious that they had to cram a lot together in the 12 episodes, and it would have been much better as a 24 episode series in my honest opinion, as a lot of it was explained in a rather backhanded manner, ""Oh, by the way, x is now x of so and so and does this, this is what is the cause of that, understand what\'s going on now? no? me either."", at least that is how it felt to me at times.One thing to note though, when the main serious plot does kick in, while the jokes don\'t completely dissipate; they are toned down. A lot.There are probably more jokes and hilarious moments in a single early episode than there is in the last 5.Another gripe is how it seems to almost change genre episode 5+, at times it suddenly gets rather cheesy, with fighting and action scenes that I can only describe as ""a mix between dragonball z and naruto"" in some cases, especially the sword in the stone bit, I won\'t spoil, but that seemed too ludicrous for me to handle.It almost feels as if it can\'t decide what it would prefer to do, stick with the way it started in the first few episodes, or switch to a generic fighting anime style, it hovers in-between and it aggravated me somewhat.Despite it\'s flaws, and in my opinion becoming very generic and average in the middle areas, the late areas redeemed themselves, with the final two episodes being genuinely enjoyable again, although the ending felt like a slight cop-out to me, it was still enjoyable, so if you do watch, be warned that you might have to force yourself to watch some episodes near the middle.Anyways, enough with explaining the story, characters and my enjoyment of it, onto the art and sound.The art was very good, the animation was done to a reasonably good standard, neither were anything to go crazy about, but they were good.Most of the characters had unique visual properties  (I say most) that define them and make them unique, so for the most part there are no copypasted characters, the main protagonist is definitely unique, and in a very good way.I never found any glaring faults with things like anatomy or the way characters move, which is always a good thing, oh, and I watched it uncensored so I cannot comment on how the censorship was done, sorry there.In regards to sound, the OP was very nice, I liked it a lot in terms of both the animation and the music, the ED was alright too, but I wasn\'t a huge fan.The music in the actual anime wasn\'t really that memorable except in one or two sections, so it is a solid 5-6 on that front, but I liked the voice acting a lot, so that bumps it up to an 8.The voice actors were very good in my opinion, they conveyed the emotions, reactions and feelings well, I can\'t say anything bad about them.All in all, it gets a 7 in my opinion, it was honestly enjoyable, but it rushed too much and felt like it couldn\'t decide what it wanted to be as an anime.It could have been so much more.Still, I would recommend fans of the comedy/supernatural genre give it a try as it is a good all rounder still, I just don\'t see it getting any special mention or being considered ""amazing"" any time soon. hopes of becoming a priest, how wrong his hopes will turn out to be though.Immediately he meets with one of the female heroines, and gets off to a rocky start, which is quickly remedied, and they quickly become friends, and from that introduction easing you in, it starts throwing scraps of the main plot at you, mixed in with interesting characters and lots of funny moments to keep you interested, it seemed so perfect at first, to me at least, as everything was right, everything fit, it seemed great and I couldn\'t say a bad word about it.The main character was likeable, he wasn\'t a stale, brown haired with glasses ""I want to always do the right thing nothing else matters I won\'t hurt people but I don\'t want to die"" cliché piece of rubbish we\'ve seen a million times.

A lot.There are probably more jokes and hilarious moments in a single early episode than there is in the last 5.Another gripe is how it seems to almost change genre episode 5+, at times it suddenly gets rather cheesy, with fighting and action scenes that I can only describe as ""a mix between dragonball z and naruto"" in some cases, especially the sword in the stone bit, I won\'t spoil, but that seemed too ludicrous for me to handle.It almost feels as if it can\'t decide what it would prefer to do, stick with the way it started in the first few episodes, or switch to a generic fighting anime style, it hovers in-between and it aggravated me somewhat.Despite it\'s flaws, and in my opinion becoming very generic and average in the middle areas, the late areas redeemed themselves, with the final two episodes being genuinely enjoyable again, although the ending felt like a slight cop-out to me, it was still enjoyable, so if you do watch, be warned that you might have to force yourself to watch some episodes near the middle.Anyways, enough with explaining the story, characters and my enjoyment of it, onto the art and sound.The art was very good, the animation was done to a reasonably good standard, neither were anything to go crazy about, but they were good.Most of the characters had unique visual properties  (I say most) that define them and make them unique, so for the most part there are no copypasted characters, the main protagonist is definitely unique, and in a very good way.I never found any glaring faults with things like anatomy or the way characters move, which is always a good thing, oh, and I watched it uncensored so I cannot comment on how the censorship was done, sorry there.In regards to sound, the OP was very nice, I liked it a lot in terms of both the animation and the music, the ED was alright too, but I wasn\'t a huge fan.The music in the actual anime wasn\'t really that memorable except in one or two sections, so it is a solid 5-6 on that front, but I liked the voice acting a lot, so that bumps it up to an 8.The voice actors were very good in my opinion, they conveyed the emotions, reactions and feelings well, I can\'t say anything bad about them.All in all, it gets a 7 in my opinion, it was honestly enjoyable, but it rushed too much and felt like it couldn\'t decide what it wanted to be as an anime.It could have been so much more.Still, I would recommend fans of the comedy/supernatural genre give it a try as it is a good all rounder still, I just don\'t see it getting any special mention or being considered ""amazing"" any time soon.', ""Ichiban Ushiro no DaimaouThis had the potential to be great, but they failed to bring a well paced story.StoryThe story was really interesting, Sai Akuto had a dream, and that dream was to be the Pope but little did he knew that he was destined to become the opposite of that, and that was to be the Demon King, every one in the Academy sees him as a treat and evil, when in reality he's not, he is a good person, who even wants to marry a woman and therefore he doesn't do anything with the girls that follows him, even when they try to...seduce him, the problem with this, is that this was too short to rush the last episodes to be serious and throws you a lot of things that you didn't know and a lot of new factions and people, it was too much for just three or four episodes, it could have work with 24 episodes, but they failed with this, but that doesn't mean the story was bad, it was good, what i didn't get was if he hated god why did he wanted to become Pope, why don't just become the president of the country? if he wanted to help people or anything else related to help people and not something related with what he hates? and the ending was pointless seeing the last scene where he goes to see in which career he's good and following the story logic that can't happen but it did.Art & SoundThe art was really good for being from 2010, sometimes was odd in some scenes but was good and the sound matched with the art style and the music background was good, the OP was great but the ED song was meh, the VA was fine.CharacterThe characters were interesting at some point, but there's little back story for the majority of them they don't go nowhere, they don't have development but the characters are really good or at least Akuto was really interesting and this was because this just only had 12 episodes, they needed more to develop better the characters, Akuto was a badass, and i liked a lot Junko, she was my favorite girl.EnjoymentI really was enjoying it, but like i said i couldn't because everything felt too rushed and the ending logic was a little disappointing. seduce him, the problem with this, is that this was too short to rush the last episodes to be serious and throws you a lot of things that you didn't know and a lot of new factions and people, it was too much for just three or four episodes, it could have work with 24 episodes, but they failed with this, but that doesn't mean the story was bad, it was good, what i didn't get was if he hated god why did he wanted to become Pope, why don't just become the president of the country?

These are the basics, and anyone who has watched more than one ecchi knows that this is a common theme in all of them.And of course, naturally, these people don\'t go too hard on the show because ""it comes with the genre,"" and ""you have to look at it as a harem/ecchi.""I disagree.There is a fundamental problem with ecchi anime that goes overboard. For an anime to be considered a good work, it needs to accomplish things such...as thematic development and effective symbolism, amongst other things, although there are a few exceptions. There are, for sure, aspects such as art and sound that come into play when judging an anime, but when we consider the big picture, that is, the overall score, art and sound comprise 40% of it, while another 40% goes to story and characters, and 20% to enjoyment. Ecchi comes short when trying to develop the story and characters because of its various sexual moments. When an anime uses up screen-time to show these scenes, it loses time to develop the story and characters. In moderate amounts, you could argue for character development, for example, by demonstrating a certain character to be attractive, which may be an integral part to his/her character, but in most cases, you do not need her to jiggle her breasts ten times within the first five minutes to get that point across. When you constantly do this, you lose out in certain areas, which inevitably makes the anime lose points overall.That being said, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a stellar example of this phenomenon. The show is, and although I have no hard data to really prove this, half ecchi (and you might as well call some of that ""ecchi,"" hentai). I mean, quite literally, if the show is twelve episodes, and we do the math, that\'s 4.6 hours. I would go as far as saying that a good 2.3 hours of that time is devoted to some sort of ecchi. When half of your show is ecchi, you will inevitably lose out on the story and character sections. Thus, my ratings for those sections are considerably low. The art and sound are not impacted by this, and that would explain my rather high score for the show\'s art (I\'ll explain my sound rating later). Enjoyment is entirely dependent on the individual, and I care quite a bit about story and characters so my score for that is quite low too.Now for the specifics.(I MAY HAVE SLIGHT SPOILERS)STORYIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou\'s story is nothing to praise. To provide a light synopsis for use in this review, the protagonist is supposedly a demon king and the show attempts to produce some sort of message about free thought and goodness through some morally gray situations. However, it is clear that the writers did not understand what the color gray looks like, because what I saw was pure black and pure white. The story is plagued by a lot of typical shounen moments and decisions that have had clear ""right,"" answers. I was not for a second challenged with a question that I found to be considerably controversial. Not to mention, the way the story ends so idyllically ends up toppling whatever the writers accomplished, so even giving points for their attempt is difficult.The story also suffers from a lightweight feeling. For example, a lot of things in the story do not have much of a backstory to provide support. Why is the protagonist a demon lord again? Was there any meaning in his status as one? Or what about his rival? What about him? Where did his powers come from? And what is with the convenient arrival thereof? A lot of unexplained questions lead to a lack of weight and the story loses a lot of points in this regard. What about the mystical magic all-powerful sword? It is given, (along with a little trope-tag of ""it\'ll work when you need it to) yet the weight of this particular weapon weighs more than the entire story.The inclusion of random characters is also everpresent in Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, although it is to be expected from a typical harem that tries to squeeze in the entire world\'s population\'s C cup and above girls into a one mile radius within one day. However, compared to a show like Clannad, where the girls are actually people and not toys for the main character, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou prefers to toss all sorts of spices in hoping one of them tastes well to the viewer. The fanservice involving these randomly tossed in characters inundates the viewer. It seemed to me that if there was an explosion, it was ingeniously rigged to blow up in just the perfect manner so as to rip the girls\' clothes to shreds but leave their perfect skin and breasts untouched. Can\'t have bad complexion, now can we?There are also some aspects of the story that just seem absolutely childish and idiotic. And for a show like this, where it goes as far as showing off some of the characters nipples (and this is why some may consider this almost a hentai), it clearly is not aimed at children. An ancient slumbering dragon is actually a robotic machination that shoots missiles and hacks computers that the God(s) use to interact with reality is a blasphemous concept. A girl who likes to masturbate in front of her brother\'s still-alive, preserved head and fantasizing about an evil demon lord? Did they originally attempt for a hentai plot but then forget about it? This sort of consistent foolishness would be acceptable if the show was some sort parody but it is not, and it is simply unnecessary and takes away too much attention from the story\'s attempts at thematic development (of which there is so little I will not even expand).The story is also plagued with a lot of outrageous ecchi elements and tools that become almost intrusive, and at best, laughable. Our little Meena can go invisible, but somehow she hasn\'t studied magic enough to apply it to her clothing, so she has to go naked. Junko has a habit of only ripping her torso clean off. And Korone has a cute little tail that you need to pull to turn her off. Make sure to get a firm grip boys!Overall, combined with generic and overused characters, the story is one of the more unoriginal things I\'ve seen. Especially speaking of the backstory elements.There is a few merits though that I must give to the story. The attempt is something I consider to be worthy of some points, since I think it is something that isn\'t found very often in the show\'s genre. The story is also pretty decent at building up some sort of tension, which is also nice to have. But the merits here are few, and are overwhelmed by the many blemishes.I give the story a 3.ARTThe art, which also includes animation for me, was actually pretty rock solid. The fighting scenes were well drawn and had great and flashy physics. The scenes also seemed to be running at a great frame rate or had some apt motion blur, or both. A lot of times I could really get into the fight scenes since they looked captivating. They were smooth, cool and sometimes just simply awesome. The characters were for the most part also well drawn (with the exclusion of Hiroshi, who I thought just looked ridiculous). And I\'ll even go far as saying that those breasts looked great. Really though, the few men there were in this show (as it is a harem) were pretty well drawn and the artists put apt attention to important details and aspects of them, like the protagonist\'s unique eyes and toned body, or the cocky hair of Bouichirou, the man who challenged the Gods. I would have given it something closer to a 9 if it weren\'t for some bad inconsistency and coarseness with casual scenes, and the usage of pretty generic and crazy anime hair (although this part is mostly a preference).I give the art an 8.SOUNDThere\'s not much to say here since the sound didn\'t really catch me whatsoever. I was never really captured by moving music in highly emotional parts of the show, or drawn to the screen during a bass filled drum-crazy fight theme, nor was I ever relaxed as I watched characters being casual with a smooth walking theme playing in the background. I do not, for the life of me, actually remember anything slightly noteworthy about the sound. If anything, I remember the OP having awkward and nonsensical lyrics. Overall, nothing amazing here, and since the soundtrack of a show is designed to heighten moments and keep it alive, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou fails terribly.I give the sound a 4.CHARACTERI have probably already developed on my critique of the characters in my story section, but regardless, there\'s much to say here.Now, granted, since Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem, the character quality would decline, and just because it is a harem does not mean all of a sudden you should give it a 6 (Fair). Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou suffers from what I already described as the harem-character problem, where an interminable stream of characters (usually very attractive and sexualized girls) are shot into the show with little to no justification whatsoever, and this already destroys the score for the show. The characters become lifeless eye candy. You don\'t remember these characters by their names or by their achievements or by their struggles or their personality, but you remember them by their cup size, hip-waist ratio, and hair color. Oh, and I guess the sexually relevant traits are included too (I like the one who\'s all shy and doesn\'t want to have sex but clearly does!!!, etc.).Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou also has some of the most heavy trope-elements in it, regarding characters, that I\'ve ever seen. Every character in the show is some clear manifestation of some trope. Here are some examples (mind the spoilers, or skip):Korone: Silent and smart hot girl that doesn\'t understand the meaning of sexual tact. Also has a conveniently placed off switch in the form of a fuzzy bunny-ball tail.Junko: Active, tough and independent woman with a soft side for protagonist.Keena: Onii-chan!!!Mitsuko: Hot teacher with a deep compassion for her students. You can interpret compassion in whatever way you want. Wink.Hiroshi: Dependent young brother that fights for his big bro and becomes powerful. For the yaoi fans out there.(By the way, I read somewhere that when they were auditioning for the characters, they demanded a cup size of C or above from the ladies.)I don\'t particularly hate tropes, they will always be present and you could argue that without tropes there would be no such thing as genres. But tropes can become intrusive when used to such great extent and absolutely demolishes the originality factor. Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou\'s cast is a chaotic blend of all sorts of harem/ecchi-suited tropes that provide no sort of unique or refreshing feel whatsoever.The characters also are very two dimensional. Fujiko\'s little back-story for example is an overused vengeance plot and she overcomes this predicament with such ease and expediency that you really wonder if there was even a point of using that episode for that ""development,"" when they could have just thrown more bare chested Junko at us. At least then, I could have used my imagination, and thus my brain, a bit more. Their back-stories are also, just like their character models, tropes.Well, at least they look hot. Kind of.I give the characters a 2.ENJOYMENTThe enjoyment value for this show, for me was pretty low, but is subject to change depending on who is watching it, since I know some people who love ecchi, and others who despise it.I personally am quite impartial with ecchi, and I am confident that my score for this area is unbiased, or at least, as unbiased as a score for a category named ""enjoyment,"" can be. The enjoyment was low because of the low scores the show receives in all other areas. Simply speaking, I personally do not enjoy bad shows very much.A lot of the enjoyment points were torn off due to ridiculous and outrageous scenes and unexplained and unanswered questions, all resulting in a slight bit of frustration and definitely a lack of joy. Such as the awkward and unjustified ecchi/almost hentai scenes that usually just made me uncomfortable and not enticed whatsoever. The characters were also too shallow for me to develop real connections and love for any of them, and the sound never heightened my feelings or emotions when watching so as to imprint a positive impression.Also, the show is given the genre of ""comedy,"" but it wasn\'t often that I laughed. There was one or two times where I did smile at a well written dialogue, but it wasn\'t nearly as often as I should have for my enjoyment factor to rise at all. The show also is classified under a handful of other genres that it all smashed into twelve episodes, leaving me unsatisfied and overstuffed.However, the art did help the enjoyment factor a bit (and as expected, I gave it a very high score). The fight scenes, like I have said before, were well detailed and smooth, and I highly enjoyed watching a good punch in the antagonist\'s face or a vibrant ball of mana/energy being flung across the battlefield, or a dragon flying through the stratosphere.OVERALL4.4 --> 4.LAST WORDSIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou is, well, a harem ecchi and you really shouldn\'t expect any more than just that, and this mentality should be used for essentially every harem/ecchi you run into. You shouldn\'t run into this show expecting glory, but you shouldn\'t raise its score just because it chose to give up 40% of the overall score\'s value.Seeing my score, I wouldn\'t recommend this show to anyone unless someone was specifically asking for ecchi, in which case, this cool show shows you a girl masturbating, some fine breasts in their full glory at high resolution and many other unsavory/pleasurable (you decide) things.As I like to say:""Only in anime."" as thematic development and effective symbolism, amongst other things, although there are a few exceptions.

The action-romance-harem is much more enjoyable, and is a far better investment when it comes to time spent watching anime. So, when I saw this series, I had hope. And, throughout the first six or seven episodes, I thought that my hope had been realized. But, by episode ten, I have realized that I was premature in that judgment. This anime does a lot right, and is probably worth of a watch, but it is no masterpiece, and suffers from some major flaws, particularly in regards to...it\'s over structure and the way it\'s story plays out.WARNING: There are some spoilers in this review. They aren\'t super huge, and you kinda see them coming in the series anyway, but whatever.Story: 6 fair**Really it should be ""story for eps 1-6 is an 8 or 9; story for episode 7 on is a 4""This is a ""magic functions along with science in and alternate modern day or near future"" kind of universe, much like Zero no tsukaima or Maburaho. As I watched, I realized it was amongst the best of these type of anime. The characters work nice together and are consistent in their behavior, so that once you accept the premise you don\'t find yourself having to suspend your disbelief too much. Now, that\'s not to say there isn\'t some silliness, but it works. Also, the idea for the story is a very interesting one. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS, it moves too fast. This is not a 12 episode series. This is a twenty four episode series crammed into twelve. As a result, they sacrifice character building (though they manage an admirable job within their limits) and world building (which is the one that really suffers) to fit everything in. Unfortunately, this means that there are characters, like the headmaster, or the teacher, who you don\'t really care much about and who don\'t seem to fit in the story. The central characters could really use more time together, letting us get to know them and invest in their well being.Instead the story pacing is like that girl who you like, and have a good first and second date with, but now she is having some major financial problem and demands your aid even though you\'ve only really known her a week and a half. You\'re torn, because you know it could have developed into something good if you\'d have just had more time, but now she\'s asking too much too soon, and you really just wanna back off a bit.SPOILER FOLLOWINGAlso, I have major problems with the content of the story. Like the fact that it\'s an entirely unsubtle atheist rant, with some humanist overtones. The whole, ""I\'m going to destroy God"" and the ""God is just a system that human came up with to justify war and inequality they want to enforce, so it\'s bad and evil"" and all that is just so unnecessary. In the story world, ""God"" is a giant evil computer that\'s not really well explained at all, and is somehow blamed for some of the bad stuff that is happening to the main characters. The story would be so much better if they had left that out, or at least not attached religious names and iconography to the computer system and the magic officials. The atheist message would have been an implicit, potential reading, but it would completely and suddenly alienate people of faith, like myself.Also, it is so thematically weak because of what it does. In the story universe, there is no God literally is a created machine that people have illogically deified. In the real world, the existence of God is, at the very least, debatable. I don\'t want to make religious arguments here, but what I\'m saying is, I want the God computer destroyed because it seems evil, but I\'ve not been influenced in my opinions relating to God in the real world at all, because they are two totally different things that have only been connected by the author\'s choice to use the same name.It\'s just dumb. I hate it when heavy handed, talentless hacks with an axe to grind ruin what was shaping up to be an interesting story with unnecessary, foundationally weak preaching, because they don\'t know how to show the audience something, only how to tell them.END SPOILERAdditionally, there are some mild inconsistencies int he main character\'s actions, the background behind the major conflict, that is the ""why are they even doing this"" is never really discussed, the major villain appears with minimal warning and development, and the pacing goes from  0 to 60 and then back, so you\'re never sure whether it\'s a side story or the main story until you\'re already in it.Also, the main character\'s powers develop a bit too fast. That\'s one of the reasons they should have spent longer on the series. He seems to spontaneously become the master of all magic, even though he is only barely learning and has minimal control at the beginning. They could have made him a super powerful badass, they should have just don so more gradually. Showing him fight some of the student as the disciplinary guy, or a learning montage of him in school getting better, would have easily satisfied this and made the passage of time feel a bit less rapid. Also, some time references, like ""it\'s already been x months since you came!"" and such.Art: 9 greatReally well animated. The character designs are nothing ground breaking and new, but originality does not mean quality. These characters fit their voices and personalities, the combat (especially) is well done, and pretty well choreographed, there aren\'t that many continuity problems with the animation from cut to cut, and the even the fan-service is drawn particularly well. Usually I don\'t much care for fan service at all, especially when it distracts from the story, and there are some instances it does in this anime, but they are far fewer than is the standard for harem series, and it is well done when it occurs, so I don\'t over penalize it. So, yeah, for nothing something that\'s already been done really well, you still get a gold star.Sound: 7 goodThe opening is fitting and catchy, a good choice. The foley and background music is unobtrusive, doesn\'t really stand out. Once again, it\'s nothing amazing, like the full orchestral scores they do for one piece, or the edgy synthesized instrumental/industrial style stuff they use in Bleach, but it\'s well done enough that it contributes a bit to the story atmosphere rather than detracting.Character: 8 very goodThe main character, unlike in Zero no Tsukaima, is not such a ridiculous pervert that you hate him for it; nor is he weak, limited and indecisive, like in Maburaho. He\'s actually one of the few harem main characters that I really like. He\'s generally consistent and a good guy, if a bit on the ruthless side at times (which I don\'t have a problem with.) What bother me is the feeling of inconsistency I get from him.SPOILER: A perfect example is that he is very willing to maim and torture the delinquents who attack him ruthlessly, but won\'t allow Brave to kill the creepy old man with the noise coat. This particular choice makes no sense. He should, frankly, not have a problem. In fact, the entire conflict constructed between him and Brave is a major story weakness, as it highlights major inconsistencies in their  characters actions.END SPOILERAdditionally, the female characters are fairly well developed, I felt, particularly the android observer and the blue haired ninja girl, who are the two I like best anyway. That\'s not to say it wouldn\'t have been better to get to know them a bit better, and to let the main character\'s relationship develop a bit further with the two primary potential love interests (blue haired ninja and red haired bimbo), but I was accepting.(The red haired, airhead bimbo will hopefully not be the one chosen as the end of story romantic interest finally. I am so freakin tired of the dang japanese and their stupid ""many girls, but who do I choose?""romance anime where the protagonist passes over the awesome, empowered, self sufficient, tsundere female for the retarded, airheaded, naive redheaded(or pink haired) idiot.)Enjoyment: 6 fairSo, overall, my enjoyment was greatly lessened by the fact that it could have been such a better series if they\'d have just let it go 24 episodes, and also hired a decent writer to reword the latter half of the series. A bit more character development, beefing up the story world early on so it doesn\'t fee like they are just making it up as they go to be able to create the final conflict, and a lack of atheist ranting would have greatly increased my enjoyment. I don\'t know what the final two episodes will hold, and hope that they can change my opinion, but I doubt they will.Thus, overall it was good(7), but it could have been great. It didn\'t suffer some of the debilitating flaws that many other series like it did, but it still could have used tweaking and lengthening.Hope this review was helpful, if not thought provoking.Respectfully,~Daemonblade1229P.S.Apologies for any spelling errors, but it is rather late. I\'ll likely tweak it someday, but I leave for 9 weeks of living in the forest soon (I work summers at a Boy Scout camp), so I won\'t have internet.

We all make sacrifices... it\'s over structure and the way it\'s story plays out.WARNING: There are some spoilers in this review. They aren\'t super huge, and you kinda see them coming in the series anyway, but whatever.Story: 6 fair**Really it should be ""story for eps 1-6 is an 8 or 9; story for episode 7 on is a 4""This is a ""magic functions along with science in and alternate modern day or near future"" kind of universe, much like Zero no tsukaima or Maburaho.

(I do hope the rest of the episodes will be similar to the first)For those who love magic, superpowers, and battles (like me), this will be a great anime to watch as the first episode already shows the style and power of magic that is going to be used. (Energy large enough to destroy a small field)Story & Character (9/10):It is...interesting how the main character tries to clear misunderstandings, but they just get worse off. He is labelled as the demon king by the system and he criticizes the system while trying to reject it and makes his own life worse. The same thing happens with a girl he is trying to impress. This adds the humor element to the story.Art (10/10):This anime does have some ecchi feature so be warned (If you hate ecchi please just don't rate it just on that. The introduction to the story line is great.) The scenery is very realistic and magic is imbued on top of weapons very nicely. interesting how the main character tries to clear misunderstandings, but they just get worse off.

I\'m not really a fan of the harem genre, but i really liked that the MC seemed to be quite badass and have lots of power.However, the entire concept of ""Brave"" felt super, super stupid and out of place. What a hypocrite. Weak, and given power just because of a suit created by someone else. The ""Hero"" was really lame - the suit looked stupid, and...he was really going against his \'Aniki\' all along. I dont get why the MC apologized to the \'Brave\' guy at the end cause really it should be the other way around. Brave could\'ve killed the MC and not only that, but went insane for a stupid girl who he barely knew/was an idol who wouldnt even give the Demon King a chance to explain himself or anything.The last several episodes were wayyy to rushed. They escalated waayyyy to quickly. So many times I had no idea which side the characters were on, and it felt pretty stupid overall - like this anime tries to have too much going on and fails miserably with it.So, overall, I think giving a rating of 5 is being extremely kind. Like i said, pretty decent and interesting beginning, only to get really lame in the middle and utterly stupid by the end. Waste of your time and wouldnt recommend watching it. he was really going against his \'Aniki\' all along.

Waste of your time and wouldnt recommend watching it.', ""Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a harem series written by Mizuki Shotaro. It was originally a light novel series, which is still going, and got an anime adaptation more recently. I have to say that I have a bad feeling about this one just from the harem and ecchi tags so let's get it over with.Sai Akuto is a transfer student into a prestigious magic academy. He plans to work hard and make the world a better place. When he reports for his physical exam he's told that his future occupation is a demon lord and everyone wants him dead or to get into his...pants because free will doesn't exist and he can't just choose a different career or some such nonsense. The plot moves at an absurdly slow pace for most of the series where they introduce minor sub-plots that go absolutely nowhere only to rush through the main story in the last episodes. The plot is cheesy, full of ridiculous cliches and, as if it wasn't bad enough, it gets a deus ex ending. The humour is another factor that utterly fails. How badly? They make a joke about tentacle rape. That's all you really need to know, but if you're curious about the rest of the humour it's mostly tasteless sex jokes.The characters are flat, one-dimensional cliches. They're about as developed as the cast of Kingdom Hearts. That's how exceedingly bland they are. You can pretty easily predict what each character is going to do shortly after being introduced to them just by being passingly familiar with the tropes they embody. Making their interactions completely uninteresting.The art could be well done, if not for one major issue. The fan-service. I know, I complain about fan-service frequently in my reviews, but this has such an excessive level of fan-service that it makes everything else I've reviewed look tame by comparison. It's so bad that it borders on soft-core porn. The fight scenes are dull. They're over far too quickly and, frequently, they're used as a thin excuse to strip the female characters. This anime wouldn't be able to understand how to keep things classy with four years of study under Gail Simone.The voice acting and music are both pretty forgettable. They aren't bad but they aren't anything special either. They just get the job done.The yuri factor is a 2/10. There's one scene involving Fujiko, unfortunately it's a rape joke. Most of the time the female characters can't even pass the Bechdel test, much less develop relationships with each other.My final rating for Ichiban Ishiro no Daimaou is a 1/10. The series substitutes any kind of depth for ludicrous amounts of fan-service. Add the fact that the humour is repulsive and the characters flat and all you have left is the fan-service and, frankly, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off just watching hentai. pants because free will doesn't exist and he can't just choose a different career or some such nonsense.

What makes an anime good?Are you perhaps, looking for a great story? One that hooks you from the beginning, and doesn\'t let your balls go until they\'re blue and screaming? Maybe characters that grow on you and feel like actual people, or how about stunning visuals that breathe life into the show, and an OST that kicks ass? A masterpiece, if you will?Then stop reading here, because that\'s definitely not what the Color Wars is.However the Color Wars is one thing. Infinitely entertaining. Explosions, panties, giant tentacle monsters, dragons fighting airships, ninja, pedophiles, and sexual innuendo that pass right over the main characters head, it\'s all right here. The Color Wars is like watching some of the best and worst things in anime come together and have an explosive tea party. It won\'t be like anything else you\'ve ever seen, and it won\'t even make any fucking sense. But I can assure you, it\'ll be entreating to watch.Why is it called the Color Wars? This is simple arithmetic my unobservant friend. Even after spending a substantial amount of time watching the Color Wars, you\'ll find it challenging to recall the names of the harem members. So how do we refer to these characters? Just call them by their abnormal hair color of course! You\'ve got the rainbow at your disposal, all that\'s left is to pick your army, and fight with all you’ve got. Throw as much shit as you can at anyone who picks any girl besides your favorite, because they have a disorder my friend. A disorder called Shit Taste.12 episodes isn\'t a very long period of time to tell a story. Adaptions seem to suffer from this minuet overlooked detail. The Color Wars doesn\'t have much of a story; well it does, but it doesn\'t make much sense. All the details are smashed together, especially in the final episodes, and explanations are locked up like a child who asks too many questions in the basement, never to be seen again.  It doesn’t even matter that the pacing of events is wacked like a drugged hooker. If I have one piece (Shut up, that\'s not funny) of advice to offer, it\'s don\'t take anything anyone in the show says seriously. Decide not to think about anything anymore!While the animation is fairly good, character designs completely lack in any sort of diversity. Green hair goes with green eyes, and blue hair with blue eyes. And just like colors, we\'ve got all sorts of personalities too! Tsunderes, aloof types, lolis, and even a Rei; the fun never really stops. Characters never break out of these cookie cutter archetypes that chain them; not like I ever expected them to anyway. You need to constantly keep in mind that this is a bad harem. I\'ll reiterate the point, don\'t think about it.However there is still a group of characters that really get my blood pumping, Primarily Peterhausen (Hah! An alliteration!) and the lead Sai Akuto. Peterhausen is a giant dragon that fights airships and fires drills from his mouth. His character is perfect, never requiring a second of development, by far the best part of the show. Sai Akuto hates the system called god, and would do anything to rebel against an oppressing force. He really keeps the show interesting, playing both the good guy, and the bad guy. While he seems to shy from girls like most harem leads, he also takes shit from no man. You might be surprised at some of his more daring actions.So what is a good anime? I think that\'s mostly up to you to decide, but for me as a general rule, a good anime, is one that achieves what it strives for. The Colors Wars tried to force a horribly written plot down my throat, and I ended up just laughing in its face. By my logic, it isn\'t qualified to be classified as a good show.Even though the show misses at its primary target, it still manages to impress me by how over the top and endearing it is. I found myself grinning at the corny lines and colorful fight scenes, even if the context of the situation didn’t quite make sense. In essence, it could be summed up as fun.But I need to tell you something Yui. Fun doesn\'t mean good. I\'ll start by posing a question.

One boy has been chosen one and was left on the doorstep to be token care of… welcome to the world of Harry Potter… er… I mean Demon King Daimao. But in all seriousness, this show starts out feeling much like a Harry Potter novel then its own thing.Akudo Sai is a rather interesting character as he wants to be a real holy man with valor so he can be a high Priest but yet ends up in a lot of perverted scenes in seeing women have dressed...and up their skirts. He has the feeling of a naïve little boy without being just like Alan from D.Gray Man which would be a little bit over the top. His storyline when he was little is just the same as Harry Potter in that he was left on a doorstep and is considered the hope of someone.Junko Hattori is a very tomboyish character who at first starts out as a loving friend and then turns her back on him when he is seen as the demon king. Since she follows the Suhara religion, she pretty much is aloud to fight all the time. I don’t really understand why she wears a Fundoshi which looks like a really uncomfortable thing. They show her underwear all the time.Kena Soga seems a bit annoying, and magical girlish. Even though she acts stupid, it seems she is rather smart and her feelings are always true. She may be annoying but I came to like her a little more after each episode. The only thing I don’t like isKorone has the personality of Yuki from Haruhi Suzumiya and yet she act least jokes. I’m not sure weather or not I actually like her though she does make the show interesting at times. The perverted jokes though do get a bit overboard. For being an android, she seems to love to make fun of all the misunderstandings that happen.Hiroshi Miwa is pretty much the wimpy boy who is always being picked on. He seems exactly like Youhei from Clannad in that he is always following around his ‘best friend’ for whatever reason. He never seems to think about what he is going to say which makes things even worse for Akudo because most of the misunderstandings are made because of him.There are a lot of misunderstandings and the show ends up using them as a comedy skit, many times to the point that sometimes it feels old. Girls always end up in fights where their clothing gets ripped off but it’s not as though it’s as bad as Master of Martial Hearts. In this idea, there is actually a reasoning behind the clothing ripping, not because its tissue paper. The show moves rather fast actually and yet, sometimes it feels a little too fast (I know… gasp! An anime that goes to fast in its plot!) but still, it makes me feel like I’m missing something.In the end, it leaves a few questions that I have had, not really explaining much of the full structure. They keep talking about god this and god that but it doesn’t explain much of what that really is. Also, it has some of the feeling from Air: 1000th Summer. Not going to explain how but you will understand when you watch more. They change so many things around and leave it open ended.The animation is pretty nice and standard, looking a lot like D. Gray Man in how the characters move and the darkness it sometimes has. The ending animation doesn’t hide that this is all a harem in that the main character is seen being paired up with multiple girls at the same time and them all kissing.I love Akudo’s voice in the English dub, giving him just enough naïve-ness to make him feel innocent but yet at the same time, shows a bit of strength in what he believes in. Chris Patton is pretty good at voicing characters like that well. Greg Ayres is also pretty good at the voice of Hiroshi who is pretty much a minion. This is a guy that does the best as a minion I’m not sold on a couple of the girls voices though since they seem like mostly a hit or miss. Even the music has an air of Harry Potter, making it really hard for me to take seriously. But yet it still has a rather hip and fun feel to it.This actually has become one of my favorites. and up their skirts.

The premise is great, the world has a lot of potential, and there are many things this show does really well.  Despite its gratuitious action scenes which are violent without being overly gory, the show never quite takes itself too seriously, and there are plenty of things to laugh about.  It also has a typical ecchi harem subplot to add a healthy dose of titillation.Despite all its good points however, it suffers from a single, major flaw, from which all its weaknesses stem: this story is far too ambitious for 12 episodes.All the problems of...this show could have been solved if it extended the same story to two seasons.  There would have been more time to develop the characters and learn the motivations behind the various factions.  It would also give more room for a few filler episodes so that it would feel like there\'s a middle to this story and not just a beginning and end.Story: 3Honestly, it\'s way too confusing.  Again, this has to do with the fact that there\'s not enough time in 12 episodes to develop the plot.  Also, there are too many factions with various goals.  It\'s not a simple good-guys-vs-bad-guys show (which, admittedly, is to be expected from a show where the hero is a demon lord).  Instead, you have various groups vying for power.  When they all come to a head in the final episodes, it\'s hard to know who to root for because you don\'t know their motivations.  Heck, they even introduce some new factions right in the final battle who show up just to add confusion to an already confusing plot.It all gets sorted out in the end, though.  I must admit, I really like the resolution to the show.  The hero fulfills his role as Demon Lord better than anyone could have hoped and worse than anyone could have feared, while somehow still managing to remain a good guy.  The final resolution is good enough to counter a lot of the problems of the show.  Not quite enough to break even though, so I give the whole thing a 3.Art: 6Nothing spectacular, but I can\'t really complain about anything.  The character designs are fine.  It has a great looking dragon.Notes on fanservice: There\'s a little nudity, but too often they employ convenient censorship.  I mean, how can you have a girl (Keena) whose magic depends upon her being nude, yet somehow limit her frontal nudity to one brief scene?Sound: 10I score it this high because of the theme song.  This is the one thing the show does perfectly.  Normally it takes me three or four times listening to the theme song of an anime show before I really like it, but this one hooked me right from the very first time.Speaking of which, let me take just a moment to comment on the opening credits.  Totally badass!  Easily my favorite opening of any anime.  The theme song is great, right from the beginning with the electric guitar introduction and especially where the mana gauge cranks up to max just as the bass starts playing.  I like the nightmarish imagery of Akuto running through the city and encountering all the different characters in the show.  I get chills when the dragon bursts out of the ground and at the brief closeup of Akuto\'s red eyes.  This is the perfect opening credits for an action anime.Characters: 5There\'s no time to really develop the characters enough to make them particularly interesting.  The result is some canned characters that don\'t have enough time to establish themselves before they\'re forced to make life-changing decisions in the final episodes.  The result is that we don\'t really understand them, therefore we can\'t empathise with them, therefore their motivations are confusing.  That\'s not to say the characters aren\'t likable; they are.  They\'re just not developed.One other note:  Personally, if I were the hero, I would just run away with Keena (after investing in the world\'s biggest rice cooker).  Forget destiny.  I know she\'s a bit of an airhead, but she\'s the only one who accepts him just for who he is, and doesn\'t care that he\'s a demon lord.  Can you tell who my favorite character is?Enjoyment: 5The show has some strengths and weaknesses.  There are some great moments, like the battle between the dragon and the flying battleship, the most absurdly comical resolution to a battle I\'ve ever seen in Episode 3, and ""I\'m going to betray you all"" in Episode 11.  If only these scenes were fit into a cohesive plot... sigh.Overall: 4Honestly, the confusing subplots ruined this for me.

I wonder if the parade of gags, parody and eros are medicine for those starting a new life, or just a sign that the industry is falling into an endless limbo.Story: 6Like many of the animes this season, the synopsis is catchy enough to attract many fans. It's hard to resist the temptation of an anti-hero who is labeled a demon king from the very start. Compared to the other animes this season, it isn't too bad either. The story is, although very questionable at times, very fast-paced and keeps your eyes on...the screen and your mind on the next best thing this anime is going to slam in your face. In essence, the story has no seriousness and could have been better with a little more philosophical sense, but of course you can't expect an anime trying to appeal eroticism and comedy to have such depth. However, there is a lot of potential in the story nonetheless.Art: 7Compared to a lot of the visual headaches I have seen this season, at least this one stands out among the rest. It's not enough to go up against kyoani and key, but it's a real saviour.Sound: 6Unless you really want some good songs and bgms, it won't bother you much. As expected of a gag-filled harem anime, anyways.Character: 7The main character is the type i have absolutely no complains about. He's the perfect anti-hero who is able to stay calm while the whole world around him goes crazy. In contrast, the harem girls have so little character they're just good for the visual experience and unstoppable gags.Enjoyment: 8I've very much tired myself of harems which portray nothing but idiotic and shallow eroticism, but I must say this anime has introduced a different enjoyment to me. I still think that it would be a lot better if they scraped most of the eros and put more thought to the plot, though.Overall: 6Compared to the other spring animes, this one is probably a gem amongst them, but still not good enough to be a noticeable winner. the screen and your mind on the next best thing this anime is going to slam in your face.

That´s what i would say.Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is one of these anime´s that isn´t serious.

Where to even begin with this trainwreck?Believe it or not, the main problem is not the insane exploitative nudity. That certainly is a problem, though. You can only see boobs so many times before they stop being funny, sexy, or even uncomfortable. But that isn't the main problem. There are two main problems with this show.The first problem is that the plot is rushed, confusing, unclear, and terrible in both idea and execution....I barely had any clue what was going on, and nothing was happening that made me want to know. Things just sort of happen, who cares about coherence. The main plot comes out of nowhere maybe 2/3 of the way through the show, is too much too fast, and doesn't have a satisfying conclusion.But my main issue is a moral issue. I believe in God, and this show hates God. It's not humanist, it's not anti-fatalist, it's not agnostic. It just hates God. There is no other way to say it. The main character is an atheist who thinks that God is just a system, and literally (and by literally I literally mean LITERALLY) tries to kill God at the end. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. He seems nice, I guess, except for when he puts down people who believe in God. And I wouldn't care as much if this show was just critical of religion. But there is no intelligence at all to its claim. There is one point where they state that life is about relationships with people, not religion. But when the time comes for the show to actually put its cards on the table, it cops out. What saves the day at the end is plot contrivance BS that comes out of nowhere and has no rhyme or reason. And the final result is that the whole plot never really happened. There are topics that can be discussed about religion, such as bad things happening to good people, with a loving (or at least intelligent) God. But this show raises a question, doesn't answer it, and acts like it won the argument.This show is a stupid harem show for the first half and a morally reprehensible, intellectually bankrupt, pretentious trainwreck for the second half. I barely know what I watched, I just know I hate it. I don't even think I would like it if I were an atheist, because it is not smart in any way. Stay the hell away from this show.

There are topics that can be discussed about religion, such as bad things happening to good people, with a loving (or at least intelligent) God. But this show raises a question, doesn't answer it, and acts like it won the argument.This show is a stupid harem show for the first half and a morally reprehensible, intellectually bankrupt, pretentious trainwreck for the second half. I barely know what I watched, I just know I hate it. I don't even think I would like it if I were an atheist, because it is not smart in any way. Stay the hell away from this show."", 'Okay, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, or ""Demon Lord furthest in the back"" or whatever it is that you want to call this series, starts off with a basic setup, boy meets girl, boy helps girl (actually helped her grandmother who was helping her, kids these days, huh?), boy shares aspirations to become big-shot good guy, boy and girl swear allegiance. It also seems to involve magic. This would be a good start to an anime where the Main Character becomes a hero. It isn\'t.As soon as MC gets to school he is put through a rigorous health and well-being test, also known as a smoking,...bespectacled bird in a jar. Who also tells the future, specifically the future job of the person under inspection. This all takes three seconds. And shocking twist, MC turns out to be destined to become a Demon Lord. Such a good setup, this anime should be interesting!It\'s from about this point that things all go awry.Why does it go awry? Well, let\'s start with my ratings.Story: 3""Why did you give it a three, you just told us that the story was set up so well, how can anyone mess it up?"" I hear you asking. It\'s rather simple really, the extent of the plot and the story.Now, don\'t get me wrong, the story isn\'t actually that bad, for a 50 episode series, 26 at a push, the problem with it is that the story is jammed into 12 episodes. You can literally see the anime bursting at the seams by how much story it\'s trying to hold in. I quite frequently got confused by a turn of events simply because of the lack of development and potential forshadowing, and the final four episodes or so felt like a two hour slog *per episode* that much story is crammed in. It goes from a fairly light, gag-based setting, where panty shots are routine, to suddenly the world has been flipped upside-down, shit got serious somewhere off-screen, and panty shots are routine. The lack of development in the major areas of the story had me almost reaching for the stop button in the final few episodes.The magic system in this anime felt tacked on as an afterthought almost, as a body to convey the fact that weird shit is happening, and indulge in too much nudity.Characters: 3As a consequence of the above crammed story, the characters come off as one-dimensional, and unrelatable. The main Love Interest (and good luck trying to pick EXACTLY which one of five girls this is supposed to be, the OP and ED don\'t help this cause) regularly flip-flops between support and understanding, and hatred and anger, all with love underlying it, something that is never developed.MC is no exception to the one-dimensional characterisation that was caused by the jam-packed storyline. In the first episode, prior to learning his future occupation, he claims that he want\'s to become High Priest of all things Holy, Just and Pure (so much so that apparently littering would cause him to loose all chances). This is so that he can fulfil his wish of helping all those worse off, later the wish becomes to change ""God"", and finally to destroy ""God"", all with little indication of what happened in between.Of the rest of the main cast, which is very thin on the ground, there is Evil Witch (who tries to promote the Demon Lord), Creepy Stalker (An android sent to keep an eye on the Demon Lord), Love Interest #2 (Ditzy), #1 Follower (Complete with catch-phraise ""Aniki!"") and Evil Bitch (nemesis of Love Interest #1). Add a giant dragon that knows more than it lets on and there is your cast, and motivations. Things get a little complicated when #1 Follower gets Powers Of His Own, but that doesn\'t result in much.Secondary Cast includes another potential love interest (also Student Council President), the school nurse (and MC\'s homeroom teacher), and a bunch of people who really only serve to deliver a handful of lines.I gave Art and Sound 7 simply because there wasn\'t much I could fault it on, it worked, the art got across more than the story could manage (not saying much) and the sound was everything you could want from a soundtrack, it didn\'t get in the way. Otherwise, nothing outstanding.My enjoyment of this series was limited. I\'ve harked on enough about the presentation of the story, so I won\'t bore you any more with that. As a result, enjoyment got a 3.Overall I gave this a 5, due to the bonus marks from art and sound and for having a good basic idea, but I had to fight for that high a mark, simply because of how much I was disappointed with it. The mood flip-flopped (as often as Love Interest #1\'s mood) between light-hearted, gags and nudity to Serious Shit. I would watch an anime that expanded on the story so things made more sense and they fixed the pacing issues, but wouldn\'t recommend watching this series. bespectacled bird in a jar.

It leaves a lot to be desired in its 12 episodes and i think a second season should be somewhere in its future. I think it could have had a lot more success as a 24-26 episode series because the story seems too complicated to be explained in half that. Anyone who loves Zero No Tsukaima or similar anime should enjoy a bit more ecchi version of it or similar anime. Its character development was alright but i feel like the end of one episode didn't directly lead into the next and sometimes leaves you wondering what the...hell happened in between. hell happened in between."", 'Well, I have to say this one was pretty hard to rate.  I really want to give this anime an 8 or maybe even a 9, but I\'ll have to settle on something lower because there are some flaws that are just too big to ignore.Let\'s start with the story.  This is why it\'s so hard to rate.  It actually has a good story.  But the pacing is pretty hard to cope with.  The first 7 or 8 episodes are mostly character development with little bearing over the overall plot.  This guy comes to a magic school wanting to...become a high priest and help mankind as much as possible.  So then there\'s his physical when he enters his new school that also acts to predict the future occupation of students.  And our here gets to be.....that\'s right a Demon Lord.  King of all the demons in the world and somewhat opposing to his ""I\'ll do my best to help everyone"" mentality.  That\'s all well and good until the main plot begins to move somewhere around episode 7.  Then you get this massive, somewhat complicated plot that other anime 24+ episodes long would have trouble fitting in.  And this one is only 12.It seems like this one tries to be the anti-Bleach/One Piece/Naruto and just does its best to not be longer than 12 episodes.  No.  Matter.  What.  And so the last 4 episodes generally leaves you a little unsatisfied because it moves so fast and leaves out any explanations of the situation that would serve to either make the anime longer or make the plotline comprehensible.  I just finished watching this series today, and I\'ve spent quite a lot of time just trying to figure out how I should rate it all.  The story is actually quite decent if you can grasp most of what\'s going on in the last few episodes, but it feels so rushed I\'ve thought about rating it anywhere from a 4 to a 9 because of it.  So, for putting 97% of a massive, complex, and pretty decent story into a blender and serving it all in just a few episodes, I\'m giving the story a 6.  I\'m going to touch on more of the story later in the enjoyment section, like the harem and ecchi points, so stay tuned.Moving on, I think I\'ll combine the art and sound.  Both are good but not spectacular, fairly generic at times, and that\'s about it.  They don\'t take anything away from the show and don\'t make the show stand out either.  So the art and sound departments get a solid 7 from me.Next I\'ll go into the characters.  The main character is Sai Akuto.  Like I said before he wants to help people as much as possible and has high aims to reach that goal.  The first episode makes sure to show him as being one to help as much as he can, even if the situation he has fallen into seems to have made it impossible to really help people.  He\'s not your standard magical harem kind of main character though.  He\'s one of the more likable, yet misunderstood characters I\'ve seen in a main character role.  So, enter harem of girls.  Hattori, Korone, Etou sempai, and Soga are the girls.  They all have unique points, but are overall mostly generic.  If you watch, you\'ll see what I mean.  And Hiroshi is the obligatory male friend who worships the future Devil Lord.  He\'s quite funny early on but later, his character changes completely and I don\'t know if I like it or not.  I give the characters an 7 because I really liked the characters early on, but in the onrush of the plot, some of the characters\' personalities changed quite a bit with no explanation or really any warning of a change.Now for the enjoyment part.  I really enjoyed the show early on.  In the first 5 or so episodes the humor was incredibly lewd and just plain fun.  There was a whole lot of ecchiness in the show.  Really the front half of the show was bursting at the seams with ecchiness.  But it was hilarious and super enjoyable as well.  Around the midpoint of the show though, all that is turned down to a just somewhat ecchi show, and in the last few episodes is the action of the plot with no room for humor or hardly any ecchiness at all.  That coupled with the unreal expectation of fitting that plot into 4 episodes dropped my enjoyment from a 10, but I still give it a 9.I would reccomend this show to most people, but I would also warn everyone to pay attention carefully in the last 5 episodes cause if you miss anything, you really might not understand the plot at all.  So, because of the extreme rushed feel to the last half of the anime, I have to give the show as 7, no higher. become a high priest and help mankind as much as possible.

Maybe they discovered it post 2015 or something. I don\'t know.Sound was bad, enjoyment was less than what I came to this anime fore and overall didn\'t hold up to expectations of ""ecchi harem battle magic and overpowred MC""...thing.

The problem is that this anime serves up some plot faster than you can pop a pop tart which drag down the harem/comedy that starts out strong.We can sum this anime up as quoted from a character: ""I found the rest but I just can\'t find my panties[plot]."" ...possibly because the plot is like air, its everywhere but you can\'t really see it, just feel it. Yeah I don\'t really get this analogy either.What could have been a half decent harem/comedy anime with a semi interesting...main character (because he\'s not the goody do-er that\'s overused in these types of anime) instead attempts to focus a little too much on overall plot which leads to its downfall. Though it bombards the viewer with girls of all types and interests leading to sexy scenarios with our MC, the overall plot keeps driving new developments that take away from the comedy and harem aspects that the first few episodes excel at. And obviously nobody is really watching this for the plot. So turn off that brain and watch a few episodes if that\'s your fetish. Otherwise there\'s better anime other there for either harem, or plot, and maybe a bit of both as well. (Sekirei, Familiar of Zero, Kampfer, World only God Knows, Rosario Vampire, etc). By better I mean, at least the pacing and the story are told better than this anime.Story - Starts off strong. Rapid development after first arc is as unexpected as its unnecessary. Ending even more rapid than the middle episodes.

After Akuto successfully enrolling in to the Magical Academy he’s been told by this fortune teller artificial being that he’ll become a demon king, which will go further introducing the other main characters of this anime. An Android Girl who observes Akuto, but ends up seducing him. A naked invisible girl, A...goody two shoes guy that loves justice and another girl that uses Black Magick that wants to use the powers of the demon king for her own purposes, who I still believe that she has a freaky brother complex :l You can obviously see that this will turn in to a harem, by the end.Character:I never took the characters seriously in the anime, because the drama that they were trying to show, when they were either having an argument or a fight was a hit or miss.

It passed the three episode test, albeit barely, so I felt the need to power through and finish it to see if it goes anywhere. Yeah...It doesn’t....VISUALS [ 3 / 10 ]>>>>>While I was never personally offended by Daimao’s presentation, I was disappointed; often. The two major letdowns were the character designs and the fight scenes. Both were barely animated, consistently. While being budget doesn’t necessarily ruin a show, it does make it noticeably worse than it otherwise would have been; in the case of something like Daimao, massively so.>>>>>Ecchi isn’t a genre known for its intelligence; quite the opposite, in fact. So when the viewer is presented with something that is neither eye candy nor food for thought, it kinda kills the anime before it even starts. Characters are off-model so often it’s hard to tell what they’re supposed to really look like. I used the OP for reference, and even then I was mildly disturbed at just how often someone was drawn either badly or outright wrong. A shame, really, as Daimao could have managed to look passable at the very least, going by the handful of good scenes that do exist.SOUND [ 6 / 10 ]>>>>>Another case of good voice actors being forced to run with a bad script. For a few of the later episodes, there practically was no script: the english VA’s were basically just reading direct translations off a used gas station napkin and praying the editors could clean it up in post; they couldn’t, of course. I don’t imagine the sub is much better, but at the very least I doubt they had to scrounge around in translation notes looking for usable words.>>>>>All that said, the cast themselves were actually decent and the score was inoffensive. Decent song choice for the OP, which was weirdly better than anything else in the entire production. I still can’t believe that talented voice actors were wasted for multiple episodes in a row... but just judging the quality, it’s far above average when the scriptwriters actually decided to show up that morning.SETTING AND PLOT [ 2 / 10 ]>>>>>Welcome back to Generic Not-Really-Magical City, Japan. If not for a couple interesting dungeon locales featured in some of the middle episodes, this would have easily achieved absolute failure. The background artists knew how to set the tone, at the very least. That’s about as much credit as I can give them, given the extreme lack of originality, creativity, ingenuity... anything that makes a light novel adaptation palatable, really.>>>>>The plot is your standard run-of-the-mill Deepest Darkest Web of Light Novel Conspiracies. In normal english, a convoluted mess of loose plot threads that tries to batter you with so many random side plots and pointless side characters that you get lost and confuse the writing for something actually deep and well thought out.>>>>>With more effort from both the original author and studio Artland, something decently written seems possible. As you likely guessed, this isn’t it. The plot just kind of jumps around, throwing in random episodes dedicated to one particular character or just outright filler. Almost nothing of worth actually happens, and when it does it’s either at the beginning or the end of the viewing experience. Daimao could have been a comfy, goofy little OVA with better planning and far fewer episodes. Sadly, it was greenlit for a full twelve episode TV anime run. If this anime was toast, the butter would be stretched so thin you’d just be eating bread.  What a nightmare.CHARACTERS [ 5 / 10 ]>>>>>For everything bad about this anime, at the very least the main cast isn’t a total trainwreck. About half the harem, including the demon king Akuto Sai himself are actually quite likable. These characters may not be well-written but at the very least they seem like alright versions of the archetypal cliche anime tropes every viewer is familiar with.>>>>>Main guy Akuto actually has some decent motivations and really is just a standup kind of guy, which is nice to see in a genre plagued by sad, miserable helpless loser protagonists with no identity. If you’re the kind of viewer that likes deadpan loli characters, there’s a decent one here in the form of Korone, though I don’t think you should sit through this hot mess of an anime just for one side character. Everyone else is either one dimensional or zero dimensional; as in, the character does not in any way deviate from their tv tropes page. Wonderful. How did I even get here? Ah right, a power outage. Moving on.PACING AND PRODUCTION [ 1 / 10 ]>>>>>It would be quicker and easier to just beat your screen to death with a rock than it would be to sit through an episode of this godforsaken anime. The pacing moves at such a painfully slow crawl that at times you’ll be wondering if the animators just fell asleep at the keyboard, or if your friends are alright, or what the weather is like tomorrow; then you’ll snap back to reality and the same boring scene is still playing at the same boring locale. Then you’ll sit quietly for a moment wondering what the hell you’re doing with your life; maybe even get up and make yourself a sandwich. That is the true Daimao experience; and it is truly an unpleasant one.>>>>>When the show isn’t wasting your time with elongated, nothing dialogue scenes, it’s aggressively cliche. When it’s not cliche, it’s disappointing you with a poorly animated action sequence. Sadly, there are few redeeming factors anywhere in this anime. It’s easy to see why studio Artland went bankrupt; it was undoubtedly lackluster productions such as this one. What a sorry state of affairs.[ Analysis section redacted due to spoilers ]OVERALL [ 3 / 10 ]- Visuals are painfully budget.- Characters are often off-model and rarely drawn well.- Fight scenes are poorly done as well.- English VA’s were good.- The script ranged from terrible to nonexistent.- Setting is almost completely barren.- Plot is messy with many loose ends.- Characters are a mixed bag; some likable, some not.- Peter is best girl. Korone is second.- Pacing and production were both appalling.- Writing was so generic you could sell it on a shelf at Walmart.For recommendations, you’re mainly looking at Campione, which is more or less leading the charge for good ecchi harem anime. Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar is another solid recommendation. Everyone will send you in the general direction of High School DxD, which you’ve probably already seen. In all honesty, it’s hard to recommend good fan service shows because there are so few of them. As always, good luck with your animu. VISUALS [ 3 / 10 ]>>>>>While I was never personally offended by Daimao’s presentation, I was disappointed; often. The two major letdowns were the character designs and the fight scenes. Both were barely animated, consistently. While being budget doesn’t necessarily ruin a show, it does make it noticeably worse than it otherwise would have been; in the case of something like Daimao, massively so.>>>>>Ecchi isn’t a genre known for its intelligence; quite the opposite, in fact. So when the viewer is presented with something that is neither eye candy nor food for thought, it kinda kills the anime before it even starts. Characters are off-model so often it’s hard to tell what they’re supposed to really look like. I used the OP for reference, and even then I was mildly disturbed at just how often someone was drawn either badly or outright wrong. A shame, really, as Daimao could have managed to look passable at the very least, going by the handful of good scenes that do exist.SOUND [ 6 / 10 ]>>>>>Another case of good voice actors being forced to run with a bad script. For a few of the later episodes, there practically was no script: the english VA’s were basically just reading direct translations off a used gas station napkin and praying the editors could clean it up in post; they couldn’t, of course. I don’t imagine the sub is much better, but at the very least I doubt they had to scrounge around in translation notes looking for usable words.>>>>>All that said, the cast themselves were actually decent and the score was inoffensive.

He basically wants to be someone like Gandhi bringing peace and harmony throughout the world but is told by the extremely accurate fortune telling machine that he will be a Demon Lord, or the next Adolf Hitler....So from the beginning he is constantly harassed by his fellow schoolmates. There are however a few people that actually tries to befriend him and understand his situation rather than seeing him as a monster. Many things happens that makes him look even more as a monster bent on destroying the God Suhara. Once he realizes that it is almost impossible to escape from his role as the next Demon Lord, he goes against God Suhara, hoping to change the system that is making people accept their fate base on their ability to use magic and the fortune telling machine.Art: The characters looks pretty good, but the scenes they are in looks quite average. There isn\'t a lot of elaborate or beautiful scene. The anime itself just stick close to the plot and keeps it that way so that is pretty nice, though I would have liked it if they paid a little more time to make the scenes more detailed.Sound: The sound was ok and the theme song was pretty good.Characters: The character are alright. What makes this anime quite different from many that I have watched is that it doesn\'t really bother to go in detail on background stories. It completely focus on Akuto Sai and that is about it. There is barely any character development that can be noticed, beside Akuto on how he chooses to change his fate. So the plot moves by really quick in this 12 episode series.Enjoyment: Personally I enjoyed this series again. It was extremely short, and the plot seemed kind of undeveloped, making this series to go by in a blink of an eye. Also the shortage of character development is easily seen in this series. Though I really like the ""rebellion"" idea, how Akuto tries to defies his predetermine ""destiny."" Also the idea of being the ""Demon Lord"" was also kind of cool. Wish there were more fighting scenes though or like he was able to use more of his powers. Well hope you enjoy this anime! So from the beginning he is constantly harassed by his fellow schoolmates.

While the concepts are not novel by any stretch of the imagination, I had hope for it based on the fact that the main character was NOT milquetoast like most harem main characters are. However it seems that this series has taken a turn for the worse. Already we have multiple female characters in love with Sai Atkuto for no good reason at all and a 'mysterious' organization targeting him. Most of the gags are just reused garbage from other harem shows. The only thing the show still has going for it is...the art. For which I must admit is a guilty pleasure for me.

This system creates a loop of events that occur every 100 years. This includes the continual reincarnation of 2 main characters. The Demon King, and The Law of Identity. But this time, the Demon King is different, can Sai, Akuto, escape the loop of inevitable events created by the one and only god?Whew, Daimou definitely was a roller coaster ride of events that occurred mainly because of the main...plot line behind the anime.Story:3Art:8Sound:9Character:7Enjoyment:6Overall:6Now to explain my reasons for the scores above. Please remember that when writing a review, the MAL ratings are very unbalanced, which indicates that for each category; it can be considered ""decent"" from a score of 4 (+). Whereas below 4, is negative.The Story: The story was very captivating and well done, with an introduction to a harem/ecchi/romance anime that I haven\'t seen yet, Daimaou was going very well. The main plot line of an almighty God, and The Demon King tested by a loop of events was thrilling to me since the animators didn\'t leave out a nice development of a shounen main character that also does not entirely fall under the two commonly seen harem main character personalities. Those would be, the kind-hearted saviour, or the useless loser that constantly has to be saved. To my surprise I have recently found similar anime with main characters of a harem that I would like to relate to for Sai,Akuto. Sai, Akuto can be filed as a kind-hearted one, yet does not entirely fall under that category because of the implication of a shounen themed anime. This type of main character can also be seen in Campione!,Hataraku Maou-Sama!, and Princess Lover!. As one can see each main character out of these anime that I have listed aren\'t the standard types in harem, so they manage to stand apart in their own category. This unique aspect I found very enticing, which is why I found the anime to overall be a score of 7-8, however this is only in the beginning. If I could make an analogy of how the story developed, the simplest would be; The take off of a space shuttle, everything goes optimally well, when a sudden engine failure and the shuttle crashes to the ground. Thankfully, 4 of the 6 pilots managed to survive and crawl out of the wreckage. Got that picture in mind? In other words, they took a very well made anime with a good start, and smashed it to tiny little pieces, then managing to tape some of it back together in the end. To quote one of my favorite Youtube reviewers, GRArkada ""The ending is Paramount"". In Daimaou\'s plot line, this was done quite well. The story managed to pick it self back up after horribly committing anime suicide with a load of cliche, power ranger, korean drama shit. The reason I still managed it to be scored as ""Fair (6)"" overall is because the ending is something one can definitely look forward to.The Art and Sound: I\'ve never had to complain about an anime\'s art or soundtrack before, and I don\'t plan to start now. The animations for Daimaou were well done, very smooth, I couldn\'t see any breaks in a picture, the action was very well done. All in all, a good job by the animators. The soundtrack complimented the anime well, adding tense music when needed, and badass music where the main character needed it. Although it didn\'t strike me entirely as ""I need to download this OST"", it is still worth a mention of supporting the shitty plot line through to the end.Characters: I\'ll have to say that the main character reminds me of a recent anime that has just been completed and the theme of both do not fall that far apart from each other. Hataraku Maou-sama! Coincidentally both are Demon Kings xD. The main character has his faults, that coming from the common necessities of a MC from a harem minor themed anime, nonetheless even when the story fell apart, he was IMO the only thing that didn\'t fall to pieces. The other characters were introduced quite well, although the anime was more plot driven and failed to elaborate enough to satisfaction on the development of each character. The story definitely pushed the anime pace to its limit,which in turn hurt the potential character development deeply.Enjoyment: To reiterate, the beginning was very well done, and I enjoyed it very much, when the shuttle crashed, I never stopped cursing myself for even clicking on the next episode, when some of the pilots survived, I was mediocrely ( I made that word up) satisfied.Overall: Those looking for a harem shounen romance drama anime that is mainly plot driven, look no further, but prepare for the ride of ups and downs. It doesn\'t do too badly in terms of characters, yet one can see the neglected potential. If this anime went maybe for 20 episodes rather than 12 I believe it would have been 5 times better.

Now to expand on this...1)It started off ok, it felt very generic, nothing too amazing, ive been there done that, but at number 2) it got a bit better with the demon lord twists, his reactions, the ecchi scenes were a bit explicit for this anime and i got bored of them... i mean how much can boobs bounce... Anyways, i guess the demon lord twists was good.3) Ok, so now this dude is wearing a power rangers suit, with all these new powers, tears a page out of the book King Arther, or however you spell it, and then slaps it into the anime with all the other crap inside.4) At here i had no idea what was going on, it suddenly jumped form a good straight story line to a room where nuclear fusion was occuring, high pressure, high temperature (10,000,000 degree C), all the particles bouncing everywhere, trying to escape...

Why is everything repeating, why is he the demond lord again... It made no sense WHAT SO EVER!What i did like about this anime, as i have already mentioned is the unorthodox aproach where the protagonist wants to be a preist yet turns out to be a demon, but became very cliche.Overall, i have to say this atleast desrves a 7 for the good effort, but lost alot of potential for its crappy storyline.... 1)It started off ok, it felt very generic, nothing too amazing, ive been there done that, but at number 2) it got a bit better with the demon lord twists, his reactions, the ecchi scenes were a bit explicit for this anime and i got bored of them... i mean how much can boobs bounce... Anyways, i guess the demon lord twists was good.3) Ok, so now this dude is wearing a power rangers suit, with all these new powers, tears a page out of the book King Arther, or however you spell it, and then slaps it into the anime with all the other crap inside.4) At here i had no idea what was going on, it suddenly jumped form a good straight story line to a room where nuclear fusion was occuring, high pressure, high temperature (10,000,000 degree C), all the particles bouncing everywhere, trying to escape...

(what a dull introduction).I mean for a harem/ecchi anime, it was just pure mindless fun. The thing that needs to be noted though is that this shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you are expecting deep character development and an amazing story line, then this anime isn't for you!Now for the rest of you... I'm gonna keep this short (hopefully) since it's my first review.If you are feeling down or your brain needs a rest after writing a 10 000 word thesis, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a pretty good cure to prevent you from slitting your wrists. No...need to think deeply about plot twists, or your life problems... Just sit back, watch and enjoy...I do have to warn viewers that I had low expectations for this so I may be kinda biased haha, don't worry though it shouldn't be too bad.Story:It's a harem/ecchi anime, there really isn't much of a plot till you start reaching the end of the show and even then you'll hardly care much for the plot. It's mostly just a bunch of entertaining characters doing stupid or perverted stuff, which you should be expecting anyway when looking at this genre.Art:It really depends on the person if they enjoy the artwork style. To me I feel consistency is most important and there's absolutely no problem here. If anything, the animation is pretty good, implementing CG effects throughout the show as well as beautifully drawn female characters (duh!).Sound:The opening and ending songs are suitable for an anime in this genre. They are neither catchy or memorable. Again, this is just opinion. Music throughout the show seems non-existent, you'll hardly know it's even there.As for the voice acting, I've only seen the Japanese dub and there was no problem here. In fact the voice actors/actresses are pretty well known (Yuuki Aoi, Toyosaki Aki, etc) so good quality acting is most likely guaranteed.Character:The characters are pretty much your one dimensional females (its a harem anime what do you expect!). Despite this, you are bound to like at least one of them depending on what your ideal girl is.As for the main character Akuto -  he certainly isn't one of those typical main guys who seems to either be an ass, *cough* Makoto Itou *cough* or a pussy. In fact, he is a bad ass character who seems to have appeared from an action anime. He is the only one that develops in this anime. He tells us his ideals which are pretty admirable or agreeable.Enjoyment:Again I have to reiterate that this anime is for pure fun. It should be watched when you are bored and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. If all these factors are taken into account, I would have to say that this is definitely one of the most memorable and funny HAREM/ECCHI animes that I have seen. I also think that this is quite underrated, probably because it's in this genre and no one can take it seriously.Final Score is 7.5/10 (can't get half ratings, but I'm trying to be nice here!) purely for the reason that it's the first and only harem/ecchi anime that will stick in my head compared to the hundreds that are out there. need to think deeply about plot twists, or your life problems...

While he is being cool in many ways, he is still a wimpy embarrassed fellow. When I look at him he kind of reminds me of Ousawa from Rogue Hero, but when you watch the anime you will see the huge difference.Still, a great watch.

For the first part of the show, you get a slice of life that is sort of a cross between Devil is a Part Timer and Baka-Test.

So he gets involved in all sorts of goofy situations against his will.In this first part you are treated to some goofy action, light comedy and fan-service.

Easy, cheap, and relatively effective entertainment, though nothing incredible.Then we get to the second part of the show, the final 3-4 episodes.  All comedy and fan-service flies out the window and we are treated to this enormous ""final battle"" involving every character.  This is where everything gets hilariously terrible, in a good way.

I don\'t know anything about the source material, but clearly the producers of this anime tried (and spectacularly failed) to cram like three seasons into twelve episodes without considering what makes the show any good.I wouldn\'t particularly consider this one a harem story--although there are obvious scenarios of ecchi sluts begging for Demon King railing; rather, this is an OP antihero changing his destiny to become the hero by tossing off the chains of fate. Or, you know, it would be that simple if the writers had stuck to a linear increase in backstory, worldbuilding, and explaining how...all this magic/demon king/hero stuff works over the course of the series. But that would require tact and restraint which are obviously complex techniques, so instead we get about eight episodes of cheery magic fun times then four-ish episodes of encyclopedia-cramming by people who get overexcited when approached with the opportunity to flex their nerdity in front of normies.There are other spoiler-ridden plot reviews here, so I\'ll just skip past that. What I enjoyed immensely about Ichiban Blah Blah are the characters. The protagonist is an overpowered Harem King Lite while his chief bimbos are a tough ninja with a soft side, a libido-powered lust queen, and a robot with a monotone voice who calls everyone perverts. Pretty cliche stuff. But a lot of people often label cliches as inherently evil simply because they\'re regularly done in poor taste; Ichiban Blah Blah takes the cliches and makes them enjoyable to the point where it doesn\'t matter. After all, Tibetan zero gravity cross-stitching tutorials are supposed to be entertaining, and even if there\'s nothing groundbreaking it can still achieve that benchmark by being well produced. And this one is.The dub (GASP TIME TO CLICK REPORT DUB EVIL EVIL MUST PROTECT ANIMU INTEGRITY REEEEE) actors all do a great job with the exception of that little shit Miwa whose prepubescent voice feels like getting giant rock dildos shoved into my ears. Animation is all top-tier and smooth, along with the sound effects and music. In reality, Ichiboohoo should get way closer to 8/10 or higher; sadly, the colossal infodump of meaningless and unimportant things towards the latter third of the show is stupid and unenjoyable. Not only that, the ""hurr god evil must kill god durrr"" plot device comes across as exceedingly edgy in the last episode, kind of like that dumb emo kid in high school who wrote edgy poetry and had a Myspace full of pictures with ketchup smeared on his arms and a butter knife center-frame.Is it worth watching?

I can't just completely disregard the enjoyment I did receive from the show other than that. I will definitely have to re-watch the last couple episodes. the show itself was a really fresh take on a played out subject. there are countless Demon Lord animes and this one was kind of a fresh plot that I've yet to see.The...characters in the show are very odd, there are the token loli, tsundere, and kuudere, of course but the character development was quite interesting with both Akuto and Keena. I would definitely not call this a harem anime because it really isn't. It's been a minute since I've seen an anime where the weak best friend is their rival so that was also fresh. I think the biggest issue with this anime for me personally is the wildly complex ending that  completely took over the story and made a 180 with the protagonist’s motives. within one episode he went from saying he was not the Demon King  to saying he was going to kill God, once again I have absolutely no clue how this came about. I saw the swiped opportunity for it to come by the clip of him doubting God when he was a child but still how the fuck did his friend almost being assassinated lead to needing to kill God. as you can tell I'm still very Shook Up by this. characters in the show are very odd, there are the token loli, tsundere, and kuudere, of course but the character development was quite interesting with both Akuto and Keena.

I thought that they were gonna elaborate on the whole ""black magic is in the school"", or that they would add some episodes to have our protagonist settly into this new and mysteriously wonderful world he is just introduced to, but...no.CHARACTERS(The character development in this anime was so bad, I had to google most of the character\'s names because there was such poor development, that you coulnd\'t care who they were)AKUTO: He wasn\'t a puss, what can I say, its a harem (kinda) so what can I say, he is amasing othere than his absolutely terrible decision making throughout the animeMITSUKO: felt like she was going to be an important teacher/advice giving character who was gonna help akuto to master his powers or something. however she was just cutoff right awayKEENA: she was cute, but god damn annoying at times. I satred to accept the idea that she was the main love interest at one point, but then whaaattt???? I guess... not???.....wait maybe?...no (watch the damn anime)FUJIKO: she was some hot stuff. I honestly though she was goign to be the experienced chick who was gonna have some osrt of relationshit with akuto. like, really, nobody in all of anime history gets so much screen time so early on, and provides so much fanservice just to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. yeah that\'s right, NOTHING! in my honest opinion, it went downhill as soon as her presence faded, I think a lot of people were looking forward to her possible roles. with all the plotting she did, she had a frickin crystal ball and did dark magic and shit, you\'d think she would play some sort of roll being one of the hottest chicks there. biggest character letdown I have ever experienced.KORONE: where to start, I liked the idea, but she got so annoying, I got bored of her instantly. things just got wired and she ended up slowing down the whole anime\'s progress. literally, two episodes were wasted on her backstory, while they could have trashed that shit for the OVA people to deal with so that they could make room for other character development for the ones who TRULY needed attention. I think that she was necessary to be present, but in no way deserved her own plot seeing how short the anime wasLILY: liked the character, played no part in the ""harem"" duggested by the ending theme and had no character development at all, so it left me with no time to even care about her at all. basically, all that undeserved screentime throguhout the last few episodes was but another...wasteHIROSHI: I liked this guys at first because he brought some joy to the anime table and a couple laughs. but the holy shit, they didn\'t need to turn him into a sexually confused power ranger. next thing you know, someon outside of the harem had all this plot based around him even though he was built up as a minor character. in my honest opinion, he should not have got any real screentime after the first few episodes, he woulda been less hated if he was just a nobody characterJUNKO: I was open to the idea of her being a love interest to our protagonist. but I pictured her as the butchy type pretty much exactly like that tatsuki chick from bleach. with how wierd she was with her rope (or whatever the hell they were) panties which did not need to be seen. I did not like how favoured she was by the writers, it was actually rediculous, because you really couldn\'t tell if she was a love interest or nah.EIKO: she was hot, and since it\'s a harem, u\'d expect our protagonist not to be a man, and add that lady to his list of ladies, but of course, the one time he pussies out, it\'s in a place where he completely throws away his man-card. she should\'ve at least been able to do something for the plot, once again, being a harem, she looks like that one wierd stalker chick that every few animes have. but she just disappears for a reason that is not even understanable, then comes back like the viewer is supposed to care.MOTHER F*CKING PETERHAUSEN!!!: this is the biggest badass of the whole anime, I would nothave continued if it weren\'t for a dragon named f*cking PETERHAUSEN. props to this character.BOICHIRO: WAIT WHO ARE YOU??? OKAY youl reveal your plans later? no?....wait what I blinked where are you from?...wait future?!?! WTF? where did you come from and why are you in this anime. I really couldn\'t figure ouyt his business in this anime to begin with, let alone know who he is.Not one character had the opportunity to have proper development so that the anime can succeed. VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL HAREMS (I don\'t normally watch them, but this is still a must) : YOU NEED A BOTTOM B*TCH! AKUTO needed to make up his mind so that we could at least have SOMETHING to follow, viewers need a little bit of guidance, we can\'t do all the work ourselves. I think this anime could have used much more nurturing than it had, 25 episodes MINIMUM, coulda gone for 50 to maximize ALL development or pulled a Death note with 30 something. one of the most important parts of an anime is the memorable feel that you get from watching it that you will always remember the next time you watch it, this anime had none.don\'t get me wrong, it was enjoyable, just not as good as I had hoped. I would have immediately gave this anime a 10/10 if it followed the incredibly srtong start it had with the exact same stuff so that people know what they are watching. I want to be able to tell the difference between an anime, and a bunch of pictures being thrown at my face.either way, I still recommend watching as you never know, you might still enjoy it. :) cons:- terribly messy and uncoordinated character and plot development- horrible pacing the rest of the anime- seriously, neede more than 12 episodes, cummon- unneccessary sh*tmore detail if ur up to it -FIRST THOUGHTSwhen I first started watching it, I didn\'t know what to think, but I immediately liked the idea of it. cool and humble main character (who wasn\'t a HUGE P*SSY!). magic school is something that isn\'t really that common, and I liked where it was all going. it was even pretty funny at first.however, this little taste of awsomeness from the first few episodes, was all I was gonna get. I thought that they were gonna elaborate on the whole ""black magic is in the school"", or that they would add some episodes to have our protagonist settly into this new and mysteriously wonderful world he is just introduced to, but...no.CHARACTERS(The character development in this anime was so bad, I had to google most of the character\'s names because there was such poor development, that you coulnd\'t care who they were)AKUTO: He wasn\'t a puss, what can I say, its a harem (kinda) so what can I say, he is amasing othere than his absolutely terrible decision making throughout the animeMITSUKO: felt like she was going to be an important teacher/advice giving character who was gonna help akuto to master his powers or something. however she was just cutoff right awayKEENA: she was cute, but god damn annoying at times. I satred to accept the idea that she was the main love interest at one point, but then whaaattt???? I guess... not???.....wait maybe?...no (watch the damn anime)FUJIKO: she was some hot stuff.

Up until around episode 9, the character development was going somewhat smoothly, the art was pretty average, and overall I was enjoying the series.But then everything came crashing down.Seemingly out of nowhere, the story goes from taking one step at a time to falling down three flights of stairs and getting a concussion, which I may have suffered from after taking in the ending.  I don't want to write any spoilers, but this show just screwed itself in the end.  I guess it's worth a watch, just to see what I'm...talking about.tl;dr: You're better off watching this show when you're high/drunk and get a portion of enjoyment from it. talking about.tl;dr: You're better off watching this show when you're high/drunk and get a portion of enjoyment from it."", 'Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou or Demon King Daimao in the english translation is, well...bad.  As much as I love harems, I cannot under any circumstances put this as one of the best things ever.Story: With the story of Sai Akuto, our main protagonist wanting to be a holy man or priest, his life suddenly changes around when a weird raven in a glass container wearing swirly glasses and smoking a cigar tells him that he will be a demon king, something that apparently going to happen as the bird is quite accurate.  (I think the whole bird thing is BS) Then, people begin...to freak out at the apparent arrival of the new demon king, and everything goes to crap.Characters: Sai Akuto, our main protagonist is a kind person who throughout the whole series, just wants people to know that he isn\'t the demon king and the absurd rumors about him are well, absurd.  (Seriously, there\'s one that says he\'ll impregnate you just by looking at him.) As for the rest of the cast, well...they\'re crap.  The female ""harem"" is just really a bunch of cardboard cutouts that don\'t really change.  Like really, they don\'t change EVER!  Playing the roles as a kuudere, an overzealous blob of fanservice, an overactive rice eater (my personal favorite), the student council president, and the katana wielding blob of fanservice.  The only other guy that was in this series actually had some credible use in the series, but...he gets toned down in credibility after being given this hilariously bad costume.Sound and Art: While the art in this anime was fairly good, it was rather ordinary for the most part.  Only in the action scenes was the animation actually very fluid and good.  Other then that, fanservice, fanservice, fanservice.  Repeat that process of art scenes, and you have this.  The sound wasn\'t really that good to listen to either.  It sounded completely different then what this anime should\'ve had in its soundtrack.Personal enjoyment: Oh god, where do I begin?  First of all, tentacle monsters and nipples shouldn\'t be included!  (personal complaint).  The pacing in this anime was just...horrible.  From episode 1 everything just failed to come together.  They try explaining what the premise is, but it just doesn\'t work out.  In the end, something weird happens and...I don\'t know.  The pacing of this anime is very bad and the explanation of what is happening is even worse.  For the last few episodes, my mind went blank trying to comprehend what the hell I just watched.  Yes, this anime is funny in a sense of the word, but it just really falls short as one of those animes that needed some more time.  Like...seriously.  For anyone who\'s watched this, can you explain to me?  Did god really exist in that anime or what?  For anyone who wants to take this blob of insanity and manna into consideration, it\'s best advised to turn your brain off and just watch, cause I can guarantee you, nothing will come together or make sense. to freak out at the apparent arrival of the new demon king, and everything goes to crap.Characters: Sai Akuto, our main protagonist is a kind person who throughout the whole series, just wants people to know that he isn\'t the demon king and the absurd rumors about him are well, absurd.

To summarize, this has a better MAL score than Black Clover. Just let that sink in for a moment.Anyway, the review:The story seemed very promising. With titles like How Not to Summon a Demon Lord out there, I was expecting a badass protagonist followed by a bevy of hot girls who don't really contribute to the plot other than eye candy and damsel in distress cliche's. That's what I was expecting. My rating for harem anime is skewed to be more forgiving to ecchi and...other troupe's. Even with that, this show is hot garbage. The characters are as flat as I wish my EKG was when watching it, the sub and dub are equally terrible, the story makes no sense and even when I'm done with it's run, I'm just as confused, if not more, as when I started it. The art is fine most of the time but that had problems too. The characters change in appearance for relatively no reason with no explanation, the style shifts more times than a teen changes clothes, and when all is said and done, there are just no excuses for DBS Episode 5 level drawings during major fights on a 12 episode series. Oh you wait, because the art is the best part of the show. The sound department couldn't even be bothered to use the actual opening during important fights and used a midi version that just makes you yearn for the sweet embrace of death. The sound effects are either off base, at best, or completely wrong to what something should sound like. The worst part however, for sound anyway, is the terrible voice acting in both the sub and dub. I've never had to question if what I'm hearing is a parody or not. I had to watch an entire episode in both and compare notes but they're both the same dialogue. I'd normally say that's a good thing but the plot is so hard to follow and woefully incompetent that there's no way the VA's could've done better with what they had. There were multiple times where a character would express a feeling, then contradict it and support the opposing feeling within the same scene. There was no growth, no substance, and no plot. This is by far the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen and I feel horrible for anyone who wants the time to watch this. Seriously, pick anything else. Watch Hentai. They have better plots. Sorry for the rant MAL, this show ruined everything I thought I knew and now I need to clear my brain with a good anime that isn't horrible.

Expect boobies not plot---------------------------------------------------------Demon King Daimao is an interesting story with alot of potential that falls flat during the 12 episodes. While i didn\'t really hold much hope for it from the beginning when they introduced the first girl named Hattori. You could see straight away that she would be the Will-they-wont-they-tsundere-love-interest which i don\'t hate but it has been done so many times.The Story...Story resolves around our main character named Sai Akuto, or Acchan as one of the harem girls calls him. He is is an orphan who transfers to a prestigious magic school. First day of he has to take a medical exam in which there is also a magic crow that can tell you what your future job will be. Akuto touches the orb around the crow and thus he is told that he will be a future Demon Lord which scares everybody in the school but that\'s ok since most of the students don\'t seem to remember it after few episodes.I guess the running joke in the series is that Akuto does not want to be a demon lord and tries everything in his power to stop everybody thinking that he would become one. It\'s fun at start but starts to get boring pretty fast when the humor is supposed to come from constant miss understandings.Closer to the end we get the more half-assed the plot gets. I think they might have realized that they dont have the funding for second season so they have to force everything in one and thus we get a really rushed ending. I mean the ending resolves around Keena and The blond  whats his face guy.

That is exactly what I got from Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou! Although, I have to admit, the story was rushed and made no sense at times (Hoping for another season to clear some things up). The art was pretty good, I loved the effects and the way the characters look. The sound was very good, at least it was for me. The characters all needed more time for their development, which (Sadly) they didn't get much of in this anime. But, I did...enjoy the anime and I think that it was a successful anime that should come back with another season! Overall, I had mixed feelings about this anime. I like it sometimes, loved it, then I was confused by it. However, I enjoyed it and I am definitely looking for more! So in the end, I'll have to give this anime either good rating that could be even better if more time is spent on the next season! I would recommend this to anyone who likes; Blue Seed, Kanokon, Omamori Himari, Accel World, or Rosario + Vampire! However since I felt the romance didn't come to a satisfying end and the story was weird I cannot recommend this to anyone who likes; Toradora!, Shuffle!, MM!, Fate/stay night (Along with the others of it's series), AIKa R-16: Virgin Mission, or AIKa: ZERO enjoy the anime and I think that it was a successful anime that should come back with another season!

Keep in mind that there are 2 categories that you have to not bat an eye at (ecchi and harem). It's also important to understand that it's not over the top in these 2 categories as well. I was nervous going in but was relieved after the first episode. I had lowered my expectations before seeing this series and was actually pleasantly surprised. That being said, I was able to enjoy what story there was, but I really enjoyed the comedy aspect the most.This is not a story driven anime by any means....There is some action, some cool magic, and really I loved the artwork. The music worked, and I was able to watch without feeling like a complete pervert (the panty shots rival Highschool of the Dead). What I found most enjoyable were the colorful characters, though it could have done with a lot more character development. Thankfully, the main character's personality stays consistent, and he's likeable all the way through to the end.Moving past any snobby remarks about character development and storyline, I would recommend this 12 episode series to those looking for something to fill the time while waiting for your favorite weekly shows to air. Not a bad watch, and it has great repeat value. Not a must see, but not something to necessarily avoid. There is some action, some cool magic, and really I loved the artwork.

I liked the way Akuto became everything he didn't want to be. I liked the sexual frustration and the way in which teenager-hood was encaptured. The art was also very good and i often found my self pausing and tracing or drawing stills from various episodes. I'm not sure what this anime lacked but perhaps it was a fairly poor plot line which wasn't realistic or enthralling "", 'There\'s so much I want to say about this anime... I don\'t even know where to start.You know, in my personal blog back in the day, I had a post, from 2010, when this anime was just airing. In it, I said the following about it:""I think, that this is a new masterpiece for my collection. I can\'t see anything wrong with this anime. OP is fantastic, I\'m listening to it for the 3rd day straight. Seiyu are perfect, beyond praise. Girl who voiced Korone is absolutely priceless.Art is, once again, great. The authors definitely had their own style. Maybe legs are a bit too...thin, but whatever.Music is not particularly original, but is always to the point.The story is simple, but never boring. And the characters - oh my god - they are the absolute best! And, imagine this, are not over the top crazy. Especially the protagonist. He\'s not a mumbler, not a pushover, not a loud showoff or a superhero, he\'s just a normal, decent guy. It\'s so refreshing, that it alone is enough to call this a masterpiece!""And so, now I have re-watched this anime, and want to take this ""review"" apart to see what changed in almost 10 years, now that I have more experience and, hopefully, better taste in anime. So bear with me.First things first, ""OP is fantastic, I\'m listening to it for the 3rd day straight.""Absolute truth. Now I can say that I\'m listening to it for the 10th year straight. It\'s one of the best anime openings I\'ve heard in my life.When I was a kid, I always watched ""Darkwing Duck"" before school, and to my neighbors\' and parents\' dismay, always pushed the volume of that opening to a 100%. I\'m not doing this often now that I\'m an adult, but when Daimaou\'s opening started, I just couldn\'t help it and caught myself doing exaclty that. It\'s just that good.The rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable, but always creates the atmosphere needed. I also liked that it included the variations of the opening song for action scenes.Next one. ""Seiyu are perfect, beyond praise. Girl who voiced Korone is absolutely priceless.""You can\'t even imagine, how hard I laughed when I\'ve seen this in a 10 years old post. The thing is, I never really cared about seiyu. I knew the most popular names at the time, like Miyano Mamoru, Romi Park, Rie Kugimiya... you know, the big names. But I rarely, if ever, checked the other ones. It was enough for me that it sounds good, I didn\'t need to know who voiced who. So, noting a seiyu was a big deal for me back then.So, with that said, now I know that Korone was voiced by, hands down, my absolute favorite seiyu these days, Aoi Yuuki. This is just destiny. I need to make a statue of this girl and pray at it every morning. So, there\'s really nothing more to add, seiyu in this anime are indeed perfect.I thought that I may have oversold it when I said that art is great. And maybe I did, it definitely has it\'s flaws and it\'s not, say, Violet Evergarden by any means. But if you give it some leeway for it being a harem anime, then compared to its ""colleagues"" at the time, like Rosario+Vampire or Princess Resurrection, it looks like a masterpiece. Especially the animation. It doesn\'t look too static (for example, much as I like it, I could only re-watch Princess Resurrection at x1.5 speed, because of how badly it was animated), not too twitchy, it\'s just good. The backgrounds are sometimes a little meh, but that was never a big deal for me.Other than that, the picture is bright, the lines are pleasingly thick, it is pretty detailed. Easily passes the test of time and looks better than many modern anime.There\'s also almost no censorship. Yay, nipples!As for the story and characters. Usually, harem anime follows a simple path of one waifu per episode until they show them all. Daimaou was different in that it showed every single character in the very first episode, and then started to develop them only when the story needed them, and not just because a new waifu must happen.The episodes are full of content, there\'s barely any downtime at all. There is no time wasted, the episodes are literally just opening, ending and new content. No flashbacks, no ""previously, on Daimaou..."", nothing unnecessary. However, because of how packed the episodes are, everything moves a little faster than I would\'ve liked and some moments feel rushed and undeserved. Including the character relationships (especially between Acto and Junko) and the series finale.Acto, the protagonist, is amazing. He doesn\'t constantly whine, his nose doesn\'t bleed every time he sees a woman. He\'s charismatic, looks badass, acts rationally. One of the best harem protagonists to date.Korone is the best girl. If anything, just because of her ""turn off"" button. Dream come true. Plus her hairstyle, voice, striped panties... everything that I love, she\'s still my favorite character in this anime.And while we\'re on the topic of panties. This anime has some of the best variety that I\'ve ever seen. Eto has lace, Junko has fundoshi, Soga has a bear print and they are signed so that she doesn\'t lose them etc.And speaking of Soga... she\'s just precious. Every dialogue with her is worth quoting. It\'s interesting how she manages to be adorable, but in a non anime cliche way. I really miss characters like her in modern series.Junko is an unfortunate victim of that content overload. If their conflict with Acto was more developed, it would be just perfect. Their arc had a lot of potential. But instead it felt rushed and therefore phony. Still, love her.Lily is even worse in this regard. Compared to manga, they may have as well just cut her out altogether. Which is unfortunate, because she is easily one of my favorite characters visually. And not just in this anime, but literally one of the favorite ever. I still use her face on avatars in some places. Just gorgeous.And finally, to touch the last point of my original ""review"".""I think, that this is a new masterpiece for my collection. I can\'t see anything wrong with this anime.""And you know what? 10 years later, I pretty much stand by it.The biggest problem this anime has is that it only has 12 episodes. But it\'s 12 episodes with 24 episodes worth of content. On one hand it\'s great, because there\'s never a dull moment, the story keeps moving, the relationships fluctuate... but at the same time, it doesn\'t let you stop enjoy said relationships, develop characters, world etc. They do it, but very hastily. Which only makes me think ""what if they had at least 24 episodes...""Still, I got immense enjoyment out of this anime now, just as I did the first time.Yes, it\'s a harem anime. A harem anime, in which the hero respects the girls around him, doesn\'t spray fountains of blood of his nose, doesn\'t constantly try to look under the girls\' skirts, doesn\'t focus on one single ""main"" girl shoved in your face by the story. And they, in turn, have reasonable motivation to be with him, other than ""he\'s the protagonist"".This is a good story, covered in beautiful art with colorful panties flying around from time to time. ""Harem"" is not the purpose here. It\'s just some fanservice that a good author can add tastefully. Which is exactly what happened in Daimaou.Is it the best anime ever? No, of course not. But one of the best in the genre? Very likely. And if I were to make some sort of a top-50 anime list, there\'s a good chance Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou would end up in it.P.S. I also recommend the specials. While nothing outstanding, they are still a fun addition if you enjoyed the main series. The animation took a bit of a hit in quality, but not to the point where it\'s ugly or anything.

Lastly and most forgettably the art and sound are both really good, not that you're likely to notice or remember thanks to the general high pace. by the end of the first episode you have a good grasp of the direction of the whole season.While a small number of parts in the plot were sort of weak a surprising amount of the rest was surprisingly good.

His motives are somewhat important and mentioned later in more depth, but essentially he wants to make the world a better place. Along the way he meets and interacts with various girls of different – yet common – harem archetypes.The universe this anime is set in is quite varied with many magical – or otherwise – based powers. Demons, witches, heroes, and a futuristic imperial army are just a...few of the many inspirations.Overall, the story is somewhat reactionary and convoluted. There is a lot of concepts being tossed around and I was confused at times, but the real issue is that there is too much material for one season. The story itself is fine, but I must have blinked at some of the wrong moments, as it took me a while to grasp what was going on. The families and various underdescribed factions are the main source of blame.The failings of this anime are almost certainly due to the limitations of what can be portrayed well within a 11- to 13-episode season. It would have undoubtedly fared better if more time had been spent on clarifying the positions of the gods, and the structure and intentions of the various factions.I have to hand it to them though, the mood felt well balanced, with silly and sexy moments almost as often as the crazy fight scenes.As expected of a rushed ecchi-harem-shounen, there is some BS strewn throughout, and many characters are lacking in justifications for their feelings, but I don’t weigh that in as heavily for lighter hearted anime.ART+ANIMATION+MUSIC:Animation is befitting of an action anime. Battle scenes are very well animated with high frame rates and few static scenes. One episode partway through the season stands out especially for looking like a scene out of a major series. Day to day animation is fine but doesn’t really stand out otherwise.Art is good but it is not my favorite style. It draws from the pointy arched hair styles of the 2000’s that I’m not really fond of. Plus, what’s with all the crazy hair colors? I know it helps you distinguish characters from each other but ehh…. green and purple…. bleh… I just can't stand the overly saturated color palette.There are some nude scenes, and plenty of panty shots with compromising angles. The ecchi theme isn’t too outrageous though – most of the girls have average sized chests, which is somewhat fresh.The electronic / rock mashup music in-show and in the intro are good. The outro is a cutesy song that is also good.Sound effects are fine.CHARACTERS:There isn’t much depth beyond the generic character types.I wish some characters got more showtime.With the variety of character styles and powers, I’m getting a One Piece vibe – witch girl certainly helps with that. That being said, I strongly dislike the school uniforms.ENJOYMENT:Heavily enjoyed this show. I recommend watching the uncensored version if not for nips, then at least to avoid having lightly clothed rear-ends patched over. The censoring is not too annoying, but if you have the choice, just go all out.The harem interactions aren’t anything really new on their own, but I must be a slut for stuff like this because I enjoyed it enough.The battle scenes caught my expectations off guard. Had this show come out with today’s art style (Re:Zero, Shuumatsu no Izetta), it would be in my favorites.OVERALL:Great battle animations, standard harem humor, somewhat convoluted story – likely thanks to production limitations.

I rated it this high purely on a thematic basis. The shows comedy falls a bit flat and the plot is very unevenly paced and difficult to get invested in. What carries this show is the very interesting thematic concept behind the plots development, and the sort of interesting main characters.Quick overview: Main character is foretold to become the new ""Demon King"". Story proceeds like a regular harem show with a broken OP protagonist. Nothing out of the ordinary here.I have no real comments on the art and sound. You either like it or you don\'t.The characters are...fairly basic Harem. The only interesting character is the main character (Akuto Sai) and his idealogy. I honestly really enjoyed watching Akuto\'s decision making and thought it was well done.The show tackles religion in a way that is very unusual and is quiet interesting. Akuto believes that God is a ""system"" and isn\'t real. However, this belief carries multiple contradictions throughout the show in a way that is both intriguing and relatable.I would recommend watching the show if you want to think about religion in a more interesting way while watching a show that you don\'t have to pay attention to at all. fairly basic Harem.

What an anime. I don\'t know about the rest of the reviews, and I\'m not really a good reviewer, but WOW. That is all I can say about it.

He befriends a ""reckless"" girl and they make off to the Academy. All of a sudden, the machine that determines your future tell him that he is... You guessed it, a Demon King. Then hilarity...ensues.Art - 8The art was average, but the character designs made use of that, and the beasts are all well portrayed.Sound - 10I loved the OP and ED music, as they were original and catchy.

He did warn me about the drop in quality, but I never expected it to end like that.Perhaps it would have been better for me to give this a miss altogether......StoryThe initial premise isn\'t actually that bad - Akuto Sai wishes to become something similar to a high priest, yet is predicted to become the next demon lord, a bringer of destruction. So now he has to do his best to fight his apparent dark destiny.This anime was good at the beginning, but its pacing more or less destroyed this anime. The last episodes in particular tried to cram FAR too many things into such a short space of time, and it left far too many things unexplained - episode ten especially so.AnimationThere really is not a lot for me to say about animation this time around. That or I can\'t put it into words.The animation was amazingly average for me. The action scenes were nice to look at, but outside of that, there was nothing that really stood out for me.The character designs were also nothing really special, with maybe the exception of the different hair colours for each of the heroines. Not one of them shared a colour, which was a little odd at first, but otherwise not important.SoundThe background music in Daimaou is one thing I never really noticed. There were some times when it seemed out-of-place, but otherwise there was nothing really noteworthy about it.The opening song somewhat fits with the anime\'s style; the ending, however - being a sweet J-pop song that emphasised the harem aspect of the show - , grew increasingly dissonant to the episode\'s mood after each one.The voice actors fit the characters rather well in this anime. Takashi Kondo and Shizuka Itou in particular seemed to fit their characters like a glove with Akuto Sai and Fujiko Etou, respectively.CharactersWhen all else fails, you need to at least have characters to make the show entertaining. However, this may be due to my bad mood when watching the latter half of Daimaou, but I couldn\'t even really enjoy the characters that much.While Akuto is a good character, what with wanting to help people yet is always seen as the bad guy even if he isn\'t involved in something, the real star of the show was most definitely Korone. This single character brought so many laughs to the show, going so far as to adopt a ""little-sister"" voice from time to time, which brought even more laughs.Sadly, the other characters leave something to be desired. Junko is a textbook tsundere, while Keena is the energetic airhead and Fujiko is the beloved sempai with a darker side. It certainly doesn\'t help that Lily Shiraishi, despite being shown in the ending theme, isn\'t even seen a lot of the time. Which is a shame really, because she was one of the other characters I liked.Final thoughtsI shouldn\'t have expected much from Daimaou, but with such an interesting start, it was inevitable. Overall, unless you just want some mindless fun with some fanservice on the side, I would avoid Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou like the bloody plague. Its story - particularly at the back end of the show - is an inconsistent mess, and the characters aren\'t particularly enjoyable to watch either.The only thing that really saves this show is the android observer, Korone, and MAYBE the show\'s opening theme.Truthfully, this anime needed at least 24 episodes. I wouldn\'t watch a sequel, but if a reboot were to come about with more episodes to fix the atrocious pacing this anime had, I would gladly watch it.Story - 2.9Animation - 6.1Sound - 6.8Characters - 5.4Enjoyment - 3.0FINAL SCORE - 4.84 StoryThe initial premise isn\'t actually that bad - Akuto Sai wishes to become something similar to a high priest, yet is predicted to become the next demon lord, a bringer of destruction.

But after entering he is designated as a demon lord and that causes everyone to fear him(including Hattori Junko) and so begins his notorious life at the academy with unneeded troubles that his new earned title has given him.CharactersBeing a harem...genre there are a lot character interactions with some typical and not so typical charactersthats not to say that the interaction between the characters are boring, they are easy to tell apart from each other but they dont excel thearchtypes that the harem genre has put up.The main character, Sai Akuto could probably classified as the anti-hero main character type the story sets him as a villain but in the end he does the right thing.Art/AnimationThe art is around the standard mark, it doesnt look bad, every thing is distinguishable but its nothing real breath taking. The animation though has its good points during thefight scenes the animation and art changes a bit to give the dark feel when it needs it, it also keeps the fight scenes easy to keep up with. But outside of the action scenes its standard.SoundThe bgm for the fight scenes added some excitement to the scenes but at other moments its forgettable same goes for the OP and ED.Character voice acting was done well for most characters even for the monotone characters.OverallBeing a harem anime it would of benefited from having more episodes, but for people who want a kinda easy going yet has some good fight scenes give this a go.That's it for my review if you like to see my personal opinion of this anime please check out my page. genre there are a lot character interactions with some typical and not so typical charactersthats not to say that the interaction between the characters are boring, they are easy to tell apart from each other but they dont excel thearchtypes that the harem genre has put up.The main character, Sai Akuto could probably classified as the anti-hero main character type the story sets him as a villain but in the end he does the right thing.Art/AnimationThe art is around the standard mark, it doesnt look bad, every thing is distinguishable but its nothing real breath taking.

When the Power Ranger appeared and the oh-so-powerfull Demon Lord turned into a Super Sayan for no apparent reason i couldn\'t take it anymore and turned it off and decided to write this review in hopes that no one else would make my mistake and watch this.I went into Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou expecting to see some light comedy and some nice ""lady parts"" but i got not a lot of the former to be honest and way too much of the...later, which, coupled with a pretty good premise that required none of those, is not  a good thing. As other reviewers have noticed the anime starts off pretty strong but goes downhill after about 5 episodes.I actually found the premise quite interesting, a boy is destined to be the next Demon Lord and cause mayhem and destruction all over the world. The problem is that he doesn\'t want to be the next Demon Lord and cause mayhem ... etc. That had a lot of potential as an action anime or a nice philosophical/drama series, but since this is a harem anime instead, we get girls, lots of girls, that take their clothes of or show their underwear for no apparent reason every 5 minutes. And that is where the anime started failing for me, not that i mind a bunch of cute girls wearing nothing, but when that side starts to move in on the actual story and character development, everything becoming just an excuse to give a panty shot, getting a girl naked or throwing another sexual innuendo on the screen and the story, which again, had the potential to be interesting, is forgotten or rammed down our throats with some new villain or organization that just sprouted in the last 5 seconds of screen time and we have no idea who they are what they want is time to turn off or go watch a better series. Which i did, at the seventh episode where, as i said before, there was a Power Ranger, a Super Sayan, an old dude who licked a 10 year old and a giant sea cucumber (i couldn\'t make this up even if i wanted!). Even the comedy was pretty much forgotten after the first 5 episodes. Everything became so convoluted and weird there was no point in continuing.The animation was varied. The first episodes were good, nice effects, not annoying or distorted. But the last episode i saw was awful, it went from bad to good, weird effects and distorted characters that didn\'t even look human to the way it was before then back again. The Demon Lord turned Super Sayan and had huge muscles for one minute then he was skinny then Super Sayan again the skinny again. It is like the animators had two teams that had no idea what the other was doing then merged the two animations together and decided to hope for the best. It made no sense whatsoever.The sound was good, voice acting was adequate. I don\'t remember any soundtrack songs that stood out, good or bad, but i guess that says something.In terms of characters i liked the girls, they were cute, funny and didn\'t really fall into a ""type"", had a background that seemed interesting and even presented some development, even if slight. The one i had a problem was the so-called Demon Lord. I thought he was too wimpy. He had some confidence but he didn\'t have that "" i will overcome everything"" attitude, nothing that made him stand out from the sea of main characters that had their own shows until now. In a month or two i will not have remembered him at all.If you really want to see it, although i don\'t know why, there are better ecchi/harem/comedy anime series out there, i suggest the first 5 episodes then go look at paint dry, it will seem like better way to waste some time. later, which, coupled with a pretty good premise that required none of those, is not  a good thing.

I wouldn't have minded if there wasn't as much fighting and the main character wasn't so powerful. More school life, less big fights.The conversations were entertaining because of the different types of (cliché) characters. I think some of the characters should even have gotten a little more screen time.The animation is what I would have expected.I got my hopes up to high by watching the first half of this series. Unfortunately the second half wasn't as...good. I even hated the episode in between. good. I even hated the episode in between."", 'Ok,ok so yeah I watched this because I knew it was ecchi and knew what to expect. The story takes place somewhere that seems like feudal Japan, present day Japan and future Japan and a magical world that would remind you of negima. The main character Akuto Sai, is going to train at at Constant Magick Academy and wants to be high preist. It never really explains what a grand preist is, it just shows you a vaugue image of something that looks like a pope. The story never exactly explains how christianity could exist in a magic world but alas we don\'t know if...a grand preist is christian. When they arrive at the academy they are all put before an elcetronic crow to have there destiny\'s fortold. The series paralles Harry Potter, they take a train ride to a magic school, have their ""Innitiation"", and there is also a ""Forbidden"" forest with magical animals. Some could argue otherwise or pherpahps it was simple coincidence but back to the story. The crow fortells his future as the Demon King that arose 100 years ago and almost destroyed the world. AKuto is then subjected to ridicule and objection, as his is feared. The goverment sends an android girl to protect him. Then as with all Harem anime, multiple girls throw themselves at him for different reasons despite his un-populairty. The anime fits the bill with the homey dunce girl, the tomboy, the big-breasted heiress,the semi-emotionless android and the elite smart girl. Also another small boy attaches onto Akuto and calls ""Big Brother"" despte being the same age as Akuto. The 12 episodes usually cater to the male psyche with panty peeks, jiggly content and kinky situations. Word of the wise, come for bounce, forget the pathetic story. The bulk of the episodes is mainly spent trying to help Akuto figure out his true destiny and the menaing of his prophecy. Til the end the story becomes a confusing mess and it tries to incorporate some type of religious over tones and god turns out to be a computer in a tree, or thats what I could understand of it. The animation is surprisingly good, and don\'t get me wrong everything was good except the actual story, which was the really annoying part a grand preist is christian.

Tits - more often than anywhere alse. To be honest, I was kinda bored with the story at the end because of a fact that I was kinda surrounded with nudity at first. O wait, the story? Oh yea. One guy, Sai Akuto aims to become a High Priest in the world of magic or whatever. He suddently finds out about his potential status of Demon Lord and he has some unusual powers as well. As I already pointed out, the nudity meter sometimes really exceeds the limits. There're basically situations where something causes an explosion and girls are...top-less.I may sound like critizing much. Well, there are also some seriously hillarious scenes led by Korone, the Observer (an artificial intelligence perhaps?) having no limits in self-control of her actions (mostly the seducing ones aimed at main character).I can recommend this to all ecchi fans, but story was kinda ewww - not really interesting, especially in last 2-4 episodes. top-less.I may sound like critizing much.

I will also note that I am female,not very important here,but I will not be saying anything like ""Too much fanservice!"" Or anything. I completely understand that this is an ecchi anime,and will review it accordingly. Now,on to the review,Story:7It\'s a decent good story,although it had a lot of potential(but I\'m writing about an ecchi anime here! Of course there\'s going to be wasted potential,but who cares?!). There was a demon king some time ago,he was defeated,things returned to peace,all that stuff happened....Then,our protagonist Sai Akuto comes in! Sai has very powerful magic and wants to be a high priest to change the world and whatnot! At the beginning,he explains this to blue-haired tsundere of the harem on his way to magic-school-thingy! Then,at school,he is told his future job will be as the new demon king. He meets the green haired robot of the harem,and the red haired girl that can turn invisible. The harem is a pretty nice one,and not too stereotypical (except for the tsundere),and I do like the whole idea of magic and all that. But there is a lot of wasted potential,this is an ecchi and harem anime after all,so it\'s pretty good.Art:9I honestly don\'t pay much attention to the art many anime,but this one had good quality art. Shading and such aside,I believe you know what the ""art"" section actually means in this review...(not really,but still counts for something!)Sound:7The opening was good. The sound here wasn\'t bad,but not really outstanding.Character:6Ohh,this is where plenty of ecchi fail. The harem girls were decent enough,most having distinct personalities that weren\'t just different types of dere\'s. But that tsundere is pretty bad. Of course,some people like tsunderes,and this one would\'ve been good if she wasn\'t basically just a tsundere. Nothing more,nothing less. Our protagonist Sai isn\'t too great of a character himself,but he definitely isn\'t completely unbearable.Enjoyment:8I enjoyed the story and a couple of the characters. The story was pretty interesting and original. Alright,fine. I\'ll admit,the ecchi has something to do with it as well,but seriously,I watched an ecchi show for a reason damnit,I am going to include it here!Overall:7It\'s good,and worth a watch if you\'re looking for something to keep you entertained for a bit,although that feeling may fade and you may notice things that could\'ve been done much better,but you\'ll probably be satisfied if harem and ecchi in a fantasy/school setting are your things!

Having said that, you might wonder why exactly I gave this anime an 8? It's all taste dependent. See, as long as it isn't boring, I generally enjoy B-movies or just cheesy content in general. So far there are a few other animes I've seen that can perfectly fulfill that role as well as Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou.The plot is straight JRPG-tier ludicrous (while also being poorly developed), the character writing is incredibly flat, there's an awkwardly set up superhero for some reason, the art and the action aren't particularly compelling, and the series...rushes through events like a coked-up cheetah. Yet, with its excessive ecchi, and fairly good comedy writing, you've got a recipe for something that's incredibly entertaining.Don't go in expecting anything of quality, and you'll probably have a great time. rushes through events like a coked-up cheetah.

It also made...me dislike the MC which sucks because I kinda liked him at first and I think if the show took its time getting to those last few episodes id like it a lot better.Art; Yeah it looked pretty decent.

I like the main girl that's always naked the best, the blue-haired girl is cool too. The MC was fine in the beginning but I kinda started to hate him by the end it just seemed weird and out of character a lot of the stuff he was doing. Also didn't like how OP the MC was like I get he was supposed to be but like it was just too much I wasn't really a fan I wish he'd have to earn the power more. But yeah overall the characters were just kinda meh I did like the one girl tho I thought she was fun and interesting.In terms of quality, id say this show is like a 6.

DxD."", ""I saw this series when i was around 12, despite watching multiple bad series and enjoying them, i absolutely hated this one , but since the moment i saw conception i was wondering if this was as bad as i remember, the answer is kinda, but not really.See, this anime has a decent plot and decent characters, i'm gonna ignore the ecchi because it was the 2010's and this was all over every anime on that time, so besides that this is decent, however...it has one of the weirdest pacing i've ever seen in a series as a whole.Until chapter6 you could say stuff makes...sense and goes in one direction but in chapter 7 the whole story feels like is running non stop, episode 7 deals with 4 plot points one after the other to the point it feels like it should belong in two different episodes not just one and after that, stuff keeps happening way too fast, like they're trying to tell a story that was supposed to be longer but in way less chapters, so everything starts to not make sense slowly, the ending feels super rushed too.Also i'm pretty sure i was a bit bored enough to notice this, but there's several times when something is happening in a short time, is daytime in a scene, they go outside and is night time ???? For real this happens in 3 chapters where i was noticing this, most of the fight scenes if not all of them are in night time so i'm sure this happened more than those 3 , i think they didn't want to deal with fight scenes in daytime for some reason? but it feels like there was not a remote sense of continuity at all between scenesI guess this is decent, not good imo, but you can get entertained enough. At least i don't hate it as i used to sense and goes in one direction but in chapter 7 the whole story feels like is running non stop, episode 7 deals with 4 plot points one after the other to the point it feels like it should belong in two different episodes not just one and after that, stuff keeps happening way too fast, like they're trying to tell a story that was supposed to be longer but in way less chapters, so everything starts to not make sense slowly, the ending feels super rushed too.Also i'm pretty sure i was a bit bored enough to notice this, but there's several times when something is happening in a short time, is daytime in a scene, they go outside and is night time ????

However, the future holds a different title for him... the next demon lord! Everything goes down hill from there as his class mates begin to fear him. It's gonna take a long time to earn their trust now.In my opinion this was an AWESOME anime. I would recommend it to anyone who like comedic, actiony, adventure type animes and have some free time.

He is a benevolent type of guy who just wants to make the world a better place and help everyone. So when he is told his future occupation (by a talking bird who is never wrong, like the hat at Hogwarts...) is going to be a Demon King,...he is not ready for that or happy about it.

Especially when the girls are throwing themselves at him!Very ecchi, with lots of pantsu and nudity and a reasonable amount of action,there's definitely fun to be had here, even if it gets confusing towards the end...the production values and animation are great, all the characters have distinct looks and personalities and Akuto is no wimpy main man, Akuto was pretty badass when he was in his super form and sexy too haha...worth a watch! he is not ready for that or happy about it.

I'm going to add my pro/con opinion below.Pro:Characters - I actually enjoyed the characters quite a lot, they had some fun personalities.World Building - There is some decent world-building here and cool concepts.Both of my pros are sadly let down a little by the shows con of pacing.Con:...Pacing - A lot happens in this show that is either not explained well or glossed over. The ending is a great example of this issue. The show could have been an easy 26 episodes to allow the fun characters to get far more development.

Likeable characters, story you could follow - the works.But halfway through, something just snaps and the entire show goes off the rails so incredibly hard that I can't believe someone green lighted this.The second half of the show I kept checking if I had accidentally put on the wrong episode because I felt that I had missed several episodes worth of story and character development.It felt like the first half every episode follows like a chapter of manga, while the second half felt like each episode covers...50 chapters.But you know what? I kinda liked it. It was so sped up, so ridiculous, that it was like a train full of clowns going off the rails and speeding to their doom while laughing about it.I'm slightly sad that it went out like that when the show started off so strong, but that's life.

Unfortunately, as in many other garbage anime series, the first episode is a trap.The most apparent flaw of the show is that the plot is rushed. There is just too much stuff happening for a series of only 12 episodes, and as a result it is hard to follow the story. The pacing is...also inconsistent. There are some episodes where the story goes too fast and it feels like random stuff happening on the screen, and others, such as episode 6 (the inevitable beach episode) and episode 8, where almost nothing of importance happens and the plot barely progresses.The other major flaw of the series is its randomness: the protagonist’s fanboy becoming a bootleg iron man; ninjas fighting against mages; people dressed like warriors from the japanese middle ages using machine guns; tentacle monsters that look like they come from a hentai; a bad guy who is a masochist; a villain who is a pervert and attempts to rape a child…  To sum up: things seem to happen for no goddamn reason. This is even more the case in the few last episodes, which are a complete shit fest. It is pretty obvious that this anime is stupid and random on purpose, but even so, does that make it good? It doesn’t! Randomness isn’t necessarily comical.Regarding how magic works in this series, don’t expect anything new or interesting: it is lazy and nonsensical. As in any fantasy series like this, magic is nothing more than re-branded SF elements: telepathy equals magic phone calls, magic circles make a cheap replacement for helicopters as they can make people fly, and there’s even teleportation. What’s next? Magic coffee machines?There is little to no explanation as to why magic can do so much. It is also never explained how modern science (or futuristic science, since there are androids) and magic coexist.What about the characters, then? Well, sadly, they aren’t that great. Sai Akuto is the stereotype of the naive, kind and idealist protagonist who has all of the girls at his feet but prefers to stay a virgin. Junko is just your typical tsundere. Korone is the archetype of the girl who seems emotionless and speaks in a monotone voice, similar to Arin in Trinity Seven and Re=L in Roku de Nashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, to name a few other garbage series. Soga Keina is the “genki” girl who is also childish, dumb and annoying. In a nutshell, the characters are boring stereotypes.By the way, the female characters aren’t even that cute, which is pretty problematic since this anime is a ecchi.The technical aspects didn’t manage to save the show. The production value is very average. The animation is too inconsistent. There are a few episodes where it is alright, but in most episodes it is jerky and ugly, and it gets worse as the show progresses. The only character who has a decent character design is the protagonist, the others are all generic and dull. Magic in this anime looks like what you would find in any other lazy fantasy anime: cheap and shiny magic circles. Smoke and explosions often look like the type of special effects you would find in an amateur youtube video from 2011. The backgrounds don’t look ugly but they are forgettable. There is also some CGI for trains and such, though it isn’t too invasive.The voice acting is mostly okay, but some of the characters have irritating voices. Regarding the background music, it is shit. The main theme and its variations that are repeated multiple times throughout the show are particularly cheesy and ridiculous.In conclusion, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou is a failed comedy anime that must be avoided.SUB-SCORE EXPLANATIONS:Animation: sometimes jerky and ugly, sometimes alright; dull and generic character designs; cheap SFX; minor use of CGI; decent backgrounds → 5/10Sound: decent VA; some irritating voices; horrendous BGM → 5/10Story: random, stupid and rushed plot; bad world-building; lazy magic system → 3/10Character: all generic and boring → 3/10Enjoyment: only enjoyed the first episode; no historical value whatsoever; no re-watchability; no sentimental value → 3/10Overall: 3/10 also inconsistent.

After that point it seemed to shift from school harem to end of the world without really a good transition.  It was just that all of a sudden the director noticed that he had 2-3 episodes left and threw everything into it.  If there was a better transition, I would have rated it higher.  It just seemed to become a different story completely.  I didn\'t mind the Deus ex machina ending.  That doesn\'t bother me, maybe because I love Doctor Who.  Who knows.  Anyway, without giving away any plot points,...I think that either adding another episode or two to give a good transition would have helped in understanding the story.  It\'s almost like the director assumed that anyone who read the manga knows the lead up, so let\'s just get it over with.  I think the Harry Potter movies did the sane thing here and there.  Also, it was a bit weird how certain ""friends"" of the Demon King seemed to switch sides multiple times to either help him through or hinder his path.

The bane of most of you completionist MAL users.  Most are terrible.  Some are simply a chore to watch...which is a real shame considering the idea that they are meant to be a bonus candy, icing on the cake exclusive to viewers who are privileged to have the DVD.  Fortunately for you, Prisma Illya is the exception.These Specials don't bring anything new to the table, but fortunately they are drafted and storyboarded like the 4-5 minute anime we see today, in that each one does a nice job of delivering its punchline.  The core of which, is typically...fanservice, but as a fan of the Fate multiverse the specials also keep in line what the anime itself did which is make subtle and otherwise not references to the Fate universe, such as Shirou's cooking, Rin in cosplay...well I won't spoil the other easter eggs for you.Surprisingly or not, the art department stays true to the quality of the series, which was also hit or miss, but it has production quality similar to an actual episode of the show which is refreshing.  There are some specials that should have been buried at the drawing board (K-On I'm looking at you) and this is not one of them.  Once again, well directed and sounds like a regular episode.  Our same tried and true all-star cast is present as well.Overall, I've generally come to accept that if there's a DVD special out it's probably some gag reel (like Index/Railgun), something poorly constructed and thrown together (like K-On) or generally boring (Tachikoma no Hibi).  Instead I was pleasantly surprised by these specials that retain the quality of the anime itself.

Futari wa Precure: Splash☆Star Movie - Tick Tack Kiki Ippatsu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4124/Futari_wa_Precure__Splash☆Star_Movie_-_Tick_Tack_Kiki_Ippatsu,"[""I've looked at quite a few Precure works already. That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you. I promise this is the last Toei animation film for the week. I've looked at an absurd number already. Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D.

Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series.

They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10."", ""I've looked at quite a few Precure works already. That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami.

They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D.

You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series.

It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10."", ""I've looked at quite a few Precure works already. That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far.

More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too.

Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series.

Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana."", ""I didn't have too high hopes for this movie so was pleasantly surprised when I watched it as it exceeded my expectations.Story 6/10: The story is a side story to go along with the series. You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point.

More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too.

Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would.

I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana."", ""I didn't have too high hopes for this movie so was pleasantly surprised when I watched it as it exceeded my expectations.Story 6/10: The story is a side story to go along with the series. You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text.

I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D.

You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series.

Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you. I promise this is the last Toei animation film for the week. I've looked at an absurd number already. Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

I promise this is the last Toei animation film for the week. I've looked at an absurd number already. Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana."", ""I didn't have too high hopes for this movie so was pleasantly surprised when I watched it as it exceeded my expectations.Story 6/10: The story is a side story to go along with the series. You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that.

I promise this is the last Toei animation film for the week. I've looked at an absurd number already. Tomorrow, Mary to Majo no Hana. I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series. I have seen 4 Precure movies now and I have enjoyed this one 2nd most.Overall I give it 7/10. move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too.

That list includes Splash Star, the first Max Heart film and the second. This film came out towards the end of 2006, while the anime was still going. I predict some les-yay and them going to some random kingdom because that's been all the films thus far. Although one of them was considerably better at executing that vague premise than the other.Story:We open with Mai waiting for Saki. Oh, they have a date. That's precious. Unfortunately for her, Saki is still at home sleeping. Well, we know who isn't getting a goodbye kiss today. And yes,...I know I could go with a more explicit joke but they are way too young for that. In any case, they encounter a strange man who looks like he came out of Vampire Hunter D. He asks for directions to a really old clock. And they oblige, being helpful young ladies, before hurrying on to the karaoke competition that they're entering as a pair. Time freezes for everyone but them during the competition, and not in the figurative lovey dovey way.The two find their way to the land of clocks where the man they saw earlier is trying to stop the clock for everyone but him. You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You know, so he can have time to read all the books. Until he breaks his reading glasses and there's no one to fix them. Or maybe he wants to remodel all the buildings into coffee houses so he can sip coffee while doing readings of bad poetry and not get produce thrown at him, finally. Now they have to stop Sirloin and unfreeze time for everyone's sake.The only thing I can really criticise the film for, narratively, is that it's got the same basic strokes as the other two. Which I did expect. But it is a bit lazy. And it doesn't help that we all know these events will never be so much as referenced in the series proper.There are quite a few things I like, though. The major conflict betwixt Saki and Mai, and the whole narrative surrounding it, is really good. It's a fight that works for them, given their personalities and the arc of the whole thing ties into the film's action really well. And the way they symbolically connect it with their initial meeting is really good.Characters:Saki & Mai continue to be great characters with a strong dynamic. The film's new characters are relatively simplistic. We have Hours and Minutes, two faeries from the land of clocks who are meant to parallel Saki and Mai in order to help them return to the proper path. Which is kind of interesting. There's also Sirloin who doesn't have the most developed motivations in the world, but has perfectly passable ones considering that it's a film and that he's a very minor Precure villain. Even Kabuki guy got more screen time than him.Art:The big difference betwixt the art in the film and the series proper is that stock footage isn't an issue. The land of clocks has an interesting look\xa0 and the time-based faeries are pretty nicely designed. I do like Sirloin's design quite a bit. It has a nice, gothic aesthetic. I do like the imagery when Saki and Mai are going through their low phase. It's nicely done.Sound:Enomoto Atsuko & Kimoto Orie continue to be fantastic, but I'll focus primarily on the new characters since I've talked about the main cast in detail. there are some really strong performances from Hayami Show, Tarako & Kikuchi Masami. Hayami Show in particular. Sato Naoki's music is solid. Which isn't a surprise. Although I don't think there's much in the OST that's actually new. I'm relatively certain that the bulk of it, at least, was recycled from the series.Ho-yay:This film is the most heavily laden with ho-yay thus far. There's some talk of Saki & Mai being the only possible partners for one another. They also have quite a long scene where they talk about forging the future together and how they'll always be together. It sounds like they're planning to get married at some point. And they probably are because this is Precure. I assume Moop & Fuup will carry\xa0 the rings and flowers respectively. Is that one of the aims of the films, I wonder? To move the subtext into text. Because the second Max Heart film did the same kind of thing with Honoka & Nagisa, albeit to a smaller extent.Final Thoughts:I have to admit, I really enjoyed that. More than I have any other film thus far this week. Not that it's hard to be better than two of them. Honestly, I liked it better than the other Precure films I've reviewed too. So, I'm going to give it an 8/10. If you liked Splash Star\xa0and want to see a lot of concentrated gay for Saki & Mai, this film has got you.

You do not need to watch this movie in order to understand things in the show. It is an optional extra that I would recommend.The basic story is Saki and Mai are going to perform in a karaoke contest when a new bad guy from Dark Fall interrupts this by invading the Land of Clocks and stopping the World Clock. This stops time everywhere. Only spirits and the Precure can...move but if they don't fix the World Clock in time they will stop too. So Saki and Mai travel to the Land of Clocks to stop him and help the clock spirits Minutes and Hours start the World Clock again so time can continue before it stops all together. The 'bad guy''s motive was to rule over the world in silence with just him there which is a bit of an odd boring motive but ah well.Art 9/10: The art was a LOT better in the movie than it was in the show. I was quite impressed with the backgrounds and animation. It was smooth, well drawn and animated. Very visually pleasing.Sound 8/10: I liked the sound. Precure generally has good music. This had a more orchestral sound to it, fitted the movie well.Character 6/10: Saki and Mai were Saki and Mai. They did argue quite a lot throughout then realised how good friends the are ect the usual friend strengthening plot. The spirits were the spirits. Minutes and Hours were very cute and enjoyable. The new villain didn't have much backstory apart from that he was from Dark Fall and little development. He is what lets the characters down, just a generic unexplained villain with a bit unusual and boring motive.Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It was a pleasant watch that kept me entertained with decent enough characters, great animation and music. It is a nice little add on extra for the series.
