They explored the world, science, their own body. A very long time later, they were exploring space. The heros of our story witnessed other beings on different levels of technical and ideological progress to finally meet the witnesses of themselves.This is a review about 「銀河パトロールＰＪ」, also known as ""Once upon a time... space"", ""Il était une fois... l\'Espace"", ""Ai confini dell\'universo"" or ""Es war einmal... der Weltraum"". I have watched the German version and I highly recommend NOT to watch the english...one. (These series live of things told between the lines. The english version just leaves many information out.) As you might know, this series was co-produced by a japanese and several european companies, the producer is french. Thus the art is not comparable to that standart anime, but has a very own style, kept throughout the other six series by Albert Barillé.The style of how the story is told varies a lot between episodes. At the beginning, the episodes seem not to have any relations, but in progress, most things piece together.Aside the main charakters Psi, Pierrot and Métro, there are several side charakters of which some are very flat und undistinguishable.Albert Barillé is mostly known for writing educational stories, so it seems odd, he chose the science-fiction setting. And although there are many episodes containing lessons about humanitiy, physics or history, it does never get to much.The fantastic music creates the perfect atmosphere; With two Mecha battles and several space battles, extrasensory powers and many odd aliens, Barillé\'s journey into the future can be called a success.All those speaking German really have to watch this, it\'s great!All those only speaking english should ignore the show and watch ""The Hitchhiker\'s guide to the galaxy"" (Live action TV series) or ""The Animals of Farthing Wood"" (ファージングウッドのなかまたち) or something else.

Future Card Buddyfight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19067/Future_Card_Buddyfight,"['Yay! I have the honor of being the first review!Future Card Buddyfight is a brilliant TCG anime that never takes itself too seriously. I find this show a lovable mesh of Pokemon meets Cardfight!! Vanguard.STORY:In contrast to other card-based animes, the characters can actually ""fight"" in the battles instead of only shouting commands. The characters keep one partner only (exception: Gao), so no time-consuming episodes of them trying to fill their fighting rosters.FCBF constantly uses the word ""buddy"" in any sentence possible. This could potentially annoy you (along with Gao\'s victory one-liners), or it might make you laugh at the sheer cheesiness. In...my case, it made me try to count all the \'buddies\' used in one episode.This is a kid\'s anime so it\'s lighthearted, but the battles can become dark when the (dun dun) dark cores arrive. One of the characters has a dead brother who is fondly mentioned as well.There are few fillers in this anime unless you count the two cliché tournament arcs.CHARACTERS:I think this is one of the few animes where I liked all the characters and their magical creature friends. My favorite characters were Zanya, Gao, Jin, Asmodai, and Noburu. My least liked would be Tetsuya who is annoying for the entire first season. Still, I found his character evolving from the annoying dance guy entertaining and sad.  You can honestly sympathize with any of these characters!There is a serious lack of female characters and only four to five girls buddyfight in the show.The show slowly introduces its main characters and lesser ones appear often. FCBF never forgets its side characters because ALL the characters have a purpose. At some point, they reappear and contribute to the plot usually in a “Gao gains a new friend/foe"" way. This characteristic of FCBF has me eager for its sequel! I can\'t wait to see them expand my favorites\' story-lines even more.Concerning Gao Mikado, our main character, he is an actually intelligent lead.  He is childish and eats a lot, like so many leads before him. He understands when the villain or one of the antagonists is trying to hurt him and OUTSMARTS them... By buddyfighing! Well, this is a TCG show! Some may find him too perfect due to his many wins and use of OP moves, whether you like or dislike him for that is up to you. Personally, I find it different having a character who is ungodly good the first time he plays a game. Almost every TCG or shounen anime has its main lead start out losing before becoming the best in the game. FCBF sets that trope ablaze and stomps and spits on it. You can argue other characters get more development than lovable Gao.SOUND:I have seen the dub version, and I can say they did an excellent job casting!Bushiroad is well-known (or notorious) for reusing its actors. You will recognize their voices in more than one role. I feel like one VA played at least five different characters!All of the voices sound professional and unique. I enjoy three characters\' voices in particular: Kyoya, Shido, and Genma. Although, all of the voices are satisfactory to my humble ears you could be disappointed by where the directors assigned them. Genma and Rouga, middle school students, have the voice of grown men. Another character, Zanya, who has an actual boy voicing him, takes time to like. Initially, his voice was too amateurish.  Zanya is considered the cool character, but his VA tried too hard to achieve that effect. I began to like his voice as the episodes progressed though. I think Zanya\'s VA really grew with his role until his voice became comfortable. His voice shines in the hilarious moments when Zanya freaks out!Kyoya\'s voice is my absolute favorite! His voice is angelic. It\'s like beauty in the form of sound. Ha!MUSIC:I LOVE the soundtrack! As soon as it is released, I am adding it to my music library.The music is rock-based and uses ample guitar solos. They also have some songs with electric bagpipes and organs! So cool! All of the music is not upbeat, there are even slow songs where piano is used.The theme song is catchy! It is one of those “either you love or you hate it” type of things. I don\'t think it has a neutral ground.The ending theme (Season One) is horrendous. It is just bad. I thought it was too cutesy and had a bad melody. You will have to skip past it or suffer for 20+ episodes. However, the second and third ending themes are wonderful! They could fall under the “too cutesy” trope, but unlike the first, I don\'t find them grating.The BGM works well to convey any of the scene\'s feelings. 10 out of 10!ART:I love the style and the character designs. Gao\'s design has a lot going on because he\'s extra special!OVERALL:Please watch this anime! I love spending Friday nights or Saturday mornings watching FCBF. All of the episodes are on Youtube, so go binge-watch it!“Can YOU open a buddy rare card?” my case, it made me try to count all the \'buddies\' used in one episode.This is a kid\'s anime so it\'s lighthearted, but the battles can become dark when the (dun dun) dark cores arrive.

The first season of Cardfight Vanguard was a pretty great show. I really adored the more grounded feel of the series as most of the Cardfight were won by still rather than lucky draws. It had great theme exploration such as not running away, communication, teamwork, redemption and understanding one another. The characters were the most part were nicely developed and likeable in they own way and the soundtrack while a bit repetitive at times was nicely executed.The...only problems that I had with Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 were the gags, Kamui\'s junior love triangle BS and the limited animation other than that I really liked the first season of Cardfight Vanguard and I consider it to be one of the best children animes I have seen along with the first season of Gundam Build Fighters. However, notice I said the first season of Cardfight Vanguard. Why because after the first season the series started to lose a lot of charm that made the original season as it became another soulless cash grab by Bushiroad to sell cards. The series got worse quality wise to a point where they are now rushing the Cardfights themselves... When the series got to Cardfight Vanguard as well as G completely lost all respect of Cardfight Vanguard as the series along with the G saga is nothing more but a pretentious fanfic written mess that doesn\'t even respect the viewer. It was that point where I decided to find another card game anime that I watch weekly along with other seasonal anime and the first thing that pooped up was Future Card Buddyfight a fairly new card game anime that was meant to be a more enjoyable, entertaining child-friendly series compared to Cardfight Vanguard.At first, I was put off by the title of the series as it seemed too childish for my tastes however despite that I deiced to give the series a chance and after watching the first season of Future Card Buddyfight I have to say this. Future Card Buddyfight season 1 is a great and fun card anime. While it was it not in the same league as Yugioh 5ds and at times Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 in terms of quality and writing Future Card Buddyfight was still one of the more enjoyable anime I have seen in a long while. Now with that said let\'s begin.Story.The story follows Gao Mikado an eager young martial artist who becomes Buddies with the Hot-Blooded Drum Bunker Dragon. Receiving a Core Deck Case from Tasuku Ryuenji, a Buddyfight prodigy working for the Buddy Police, he takes his first steps into the fantastic world of Buddyfight.I really enjoyed the story of Future Card Buddyfight. Yeah, the story may be cliched and predictable in nature but the least the journey towards the destination was a fun one.For starters, this show is easy to follow as the show goes a great job at established its own setting as well as its characters to the viewer especially kids.The one thing I really liked about Future Card Buddyfight is that it doesn\'t take itself too seriously. One of the things that plagued Cardfight Vanguard is that after season 1 the series went off rails where it devolved into an over-dramatic and contrived show series to itself too seriously. Future Card Buddyfight docent do any of this as the show from start to finish stayed true it\'s good roots which are being a light-hearted card game anime. The show did have some serious moments every now and then but it never went off rails.The comedy in Future Card Buddyfight is for the most part hilarious as they not only they are very funny but the comedy itself plays along with the shows lighthearted narrative. Some of my favourites include Zanya getting scared by girls, Shido failing his evil antics to Testua\'s gags. I will admit the comedy did somewhat repetitive as it progressed but never got annoying compare to Cardfight Vanguard comedy with the Morikawa Grade 3 stuff and Kamui\'s comedic love triangle antics.Despite Future Card Buddyfight being a more lighthearted show compare to Cardfight Vanguard the series did have some good theme exploration however unlike Cardfight Vanguard I thought the themes explored in this show were better executed here compared to Vanguard. One of the series recurring themes is adult corruption where the adults in the series seemed to have more power than the children an, as a result, the kids would only feel powerlessly unable to do anything. The theme also plays along into certain characters in the series manly Tasuku. Other themes that Future Card Buddyfight explores is friendship, confidence, pride and superiority.My favourite arc in this Season 1 of Future Card Buddyfight is the ABC cup arc due to engaging and entertaining it was. Most of the Buddfights in that arc was not only fun to watch but it\'s filled with good engaging strategies and smart plays. My favourite fight in that arc was Rouga vs Jin. That fight was such a joy to watch as both fighters battle out it restrive settings that they both set themselves. Some other notable fights include Tetsua vs Sophia, Zanya vs Rouga, Gao vs Gremlin and Noboru vs Genma.Now with all the good out let\'s talk about things some of Future Card Buddyfight flaws.First up is the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc. While the series is indeed being very well paced through most of it run the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc was too slow for its own good to a point where some of the Buddyfights drag on especially when all of the characters that were introduced in that arc were not all that interesting. Now if I think about it the Sengoku Academy arc was the weakest arc in the season. Minus the good character building for Rouga and Kiri, the arc didn\'t all that much to the overall plot.The second and final problem I had with Future Card Buddyfight is Gao\'s plot armour. It\'s such a shame because I really enjoyed Gao personality/development as well as his relationships towards characters. I just thought of his wins felt more like asspulls rather than legit victories thought I would admit it\'s not as bad as some of the asspulls from the Yugioh series as well as Cardfight Vanguard G.Overall, despite the show flaws, I thought the story of Future Card Buddyfight to be solid.7.5/10Characters.The characters in Future Card Buddyfight were easily the shows biggest strength.First, we have Gao Mikado. I actually really liked him. He may appear as this generic shounen hero at first but he\'s actually a pretty interesting character. Unlike Aichi Gao already has an established backgroundHis backstory was pretty interesting as he before used to be this ruthless guy who would do anything to win even if hurting others in the progress. However in order to make friends at all he to change his mind where he doesn\'t use ruthless techniques to hurt others in both martial arts and in Buddyfight. This really gives a pretty good insight about Gao\'s character as a whole as his actions were pretty reliable as he simply wants to escape from being a person that he used to be.Besides the backstory there\'s a bit more I have to talk about Gao\'s as a character.I really liked his character interactions and relationships towards the other characters as he wanted to support and help his friends take the right path but when he fails he gets pretty upset and he will end up doing anything just to save his friends from corruption and evil.The one cool thing about Gao is how he\'s able to use and master different decks and worlds. It really makes Gao think twice about the moves that he\'s going to play against set opponents using set deck.Now as much I enjoyed Gao as a character I have one problem with him and it\'s not about the character but rather how the plot treats him. You see despite Gao being a solidly written character who has character flaws there was a couple of instances where the plot wanted him to be this generic overpowered protagonist even though the series at various points showcases that he is a flawed character. I honestly wished the showed treated Gao a bit better because outside of all of the plot conveniences that the story gives his a likeable and fun character to be around. Overall, despite how the plot treats him at times, Gao is a pretty good character.Next, we have Tasuku. I really liked Tasuku. He\'s a friendly individual who is nice to everyone that he meets. However, despite his kindness he\'s want\'s to grow up faster as he works as a Buddy Police officer where he protects the world from crime done by criminal buddyfighters.(Spoilers ahead)Despite him being a successful buddy police officer, he feels that the buddy police force is corrupted as shown later on the series he gets very frustrated with the buddy police organisation as a whole as he quickly falls into darkness where he joins team Disaster as the Purgatory Knight.After getting defeated by Gao in the final match he starts doing through a mini redemption arc where he starts feeling ashamed and guilty of everything that he has done as the Purgatory Knight. (End of Spoilers)Despite the lack of screen time in the first half I found Tasuku to be a nicely developed and written character that I enjoyed from start to finish.I absolutely adored Kiri no am kidding I really like the show did with his characters. He starts off as this timid boy who would look up with his senpai being Gao. However, a couple of plot twists and plot aspects Kiri starts to grow as a character whereby the end of the show he\'s like a totally different person where it literally becomes a likeable badass. He\'s easily my third favourite character.Now we have Zayna. While I didn\'t care for him all that much in the beginning due to him being a solo who prefers to work alone rather than with other however as the series progresses he starts to become quite a cool character as he starts to open up to people as well trusting them.Despite him being a cool character overall the thing that hurts him quite a bit is he\'s afraid of girls and is not talking about his being afraid of girls boobs or anything but he literally cannot talk or go against a girl in a Buddyfight. I don\'t know why the writers didn\'t give him a 3 episode arc where he overcomes his fear of girls as that would have been interesting plus we got a backstory that showed how he became scared of girls. Don\'t get me wrong I still like Zayna as a character but him being scared of girls removes quite a bit of coolness about him.Tetsuya is an interesting likeable character. Unlike Gao and Zayna where they are dedicated to Buddyfighing Testuya is a dancer who doesn\'t devote his energy to Buddyfighting and because of those reasons he\'s basically an underdog and a very good one. Throughout the series people would gossip of how\'s he\'s a low rate fighter who cannot win however thanks to his buddy as well his determination he slowly moves up the ranks of being a pretty strong Buddyfighting where we end getting a lot of respect from his peers. If you remove the following characters that I will talk about next, he would be my favourite as he\'s not only a nicely written character but he\'s just so fun to watch and seeing improved at the game was so satisfying My second favourite character in the Future Card Buddyfight.If I had to pick my favourite character in Future Card Buddyfight, it would be Noboru Kodo. I absolutely adored this character from start to finish.He started off at this arrogant boy who had an inferiority complex where it always diminished Gao\'s Buddyfight as pure luck rather than actual skill. Typical rival stuff however what made him my favourite character in the series when he\'s starts to realise that he\'s not that special. When Tetsuya defeated Noboru in a Buddyfight, he didn\'t just lose the match but he\'s lost his pride and confidence to a point. A few episodes later he has gone so far that he was going to quit Buddyfight for good.However, thanks to El Quixote\'s advice defeats a criminal Buddyfighter and he started to become more confident about himself. From there he not only has the courage to be himself he also reconciles with Gao where he becomes his true friend again. Because of these reasons along Noboru is my favourite character. Thank you Buddyfight.Kazane was a fun charterer. While she didn\'t develop all that much when compared to the other characters in the show she still a lot of fun to watch.Now I have praised many of the characters in Buddyfight but now it\'s time to talk about the charterers that I have mixed feeling for and that character is Rouga. Now Rouga is a fun and entertaining character that I enjoyed, however, I feel like the writers did not what to do with him in the narrative as the writers keep on changing what type of character Rouga is. At times he can be lone wolf antagonist, while other the plot portrays as a misunderstood rival. The plot can also as times portrays him like the sword of Kyoya as he would do anything to defeat anyone who gets in Kyoya way while at others he\'s a typical badass student. This unfortunately really makes him an inconsistent character as I feel the writers had created a character that would have worked in Cardfight Vanguard or Yugioh Arc V.The other two charterers I have mixed feelings towards is Baku and Kuguru. Despite them being Gao best friends and deck builder/intel they didn\'t do all that much as characters. They aren\'t bad characters but any means, in fact, I found the humour to be decent but they didn\'t leave a lasting impact of the series compared to many of the characters like Kiri, Tasuku and Noboru.As for the villain origination Disaster, I thought they were pretty good overall. Some were better than others but that they brought enough entertainment to make them enjoyable to watch on screen. My favourite characters in Team Disaster were Sofia and the main antagonist of the season Kyoya.Finally, we have the buddies themselves and to be honest apart from Asmodai, Jack, Drum and El Quixote they are pretty one-note mainly because they only have single character trait and not much else.Overall the characters in Buddyfight were great for the most part and them easily my favourite thing about this series. If it weren\'t for the characters that I simply wouldn\'t have enjoyed it all that much. Great job Buddyfight.8.5/10Visuals.As for the visuals, I thought the show was pretty good.The characters designs were unique and fitted well with the personality of the characters especially Noboru who is far the best character design wise thanks hair resembling like an actual brown tiger on the top of his yellow hair. Other notable designs include Gao, Kiri especially his second form, and Tetsuya. The buddy designs were for the most part pretty good despite some of them being in full CGI.The one thing that I really liked about the visuals is how colourful it is. The series uses its urban smooth colour palette for the background scenery in the series. It really makes the setting of Future Card Buddyfight feel more alive.The animation in Future Card Buddyfight surprisingly pretty good. It is smooth, consistent, and nicely animated. The show did have some stock footage in certain moments but don\'t you worry the stock footage doesn\'t get abused as much compared to older brother Cardfight Vanguard Season 1.The only issue that I had with the visuals is the use of CGI at times and while it wasn\'t that bad compared to other shows of its genre it still pretty distracting to look at.Overall I thought the visuals were pretty good.8/10Sound.The soundtrack of Future Card Buddyfight is pretty good and memorable. It uses a selection of clam, thrilling sci-fi and ninja tracks pieces to enhance the setting and tone of the series. Some of my favourite tracks include Gao\'s theme, Noboru theme, Grim Reaper theme, I be mine and team Disaster theme.The first opening Card Of The Future by Psychic Lover is a catchy opening theme that fits well with the lighthearted tone of the series. While the first opening visuals were bland the second opening visuals were much better and engaging.The second opening theme ""Buddy Buddy BAAAAAN!! sung by the Seiyuus of Gao and Baku was decent at best. While the song itself was alright the visuals didn\'t fit the tone of the arc at all thanks to its bizarre tone.The first ending theme Buddy Buddy Fight!"" sung by Paruko Seiyuu Sora Tokui is an ending theme that is so bad it\'s good. The song itself was very cheesy and the melody wasn\'t all that good. The only redeeming theme about the first ending theme was the visuals which were pretty solid.The second ending theme Natsuiro Fighting!! sung by Paruko Seiyuu is a good catch that was a big improvement over the first ending theme. Not only the ending visuals were much better, but the song had a great and catchy rhythm.The third ending theme Shining Up sung by Hanako Seiyuu is in my top 30 favourite anime ending themes as it was a very sad song that perfectly showcases the lifespan of Gao brother.I have not seen much of the sub mainly because its most of the episodes didn\'t get an English translation but I what I remember I thought it was solid.The dub of Buddyfight is pretty good. The voice actors really did a job with the roles that they were given and it really makes these characters feels more live. My favourite performances were Bacchus, Patricia as Gao, Hannah Dickinson as Kiri, Slusar, Zoe as Noboru and Hanson, Cole as Tasuku. Overall very good dub.9/10Final Thoughts.There is no secret that I really liked Future Card Buddyfight.The story despite being cliched at times was entertaining and interesting to watch. The characters were, for the most part, great and likeable. The visuals were solid and consistent minus the awarded use of CGI at certain points and the music was good. It did have a small couple of problems, though. The Sengoku Academy arc could have been better paced, the plot armour was out of control at times and a small handful of the supporting characters were not that good. Despite that issues, I still made it through the first season feeling a sense of satisfaction. Future Card Buddyfight gain a pretty strong following after it came out as it, not only card game anime watchers into watching it but it also converted many jaded Yugioh/Cardfight Vanguard players into playing the card game itself. If you\'re looking for a good card game anime that has likeable characters and has a fun addicting plot than I easily recommend Future Card Buddyfight.The show may not revolutionise the card game anime genre, but I still think it\'s a great show that I enjoyed.Final Score 8.5/10 only problems that I had with Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 were the gags, Kamui\'s junior love triangle BS and the limited animation other than that I really liked the first season of Cardfight Vanguard and I consider it to be one of the best children animes I have seen along with the first season of Gundam Build Fighters.

Some other notable fights include Tetsua vs Sophia, Zanya vs Rouga, Gao vs Gremlin and Noboru vs Genma.Now with all the good out let\'s talk about things some of Future Card Buddyfight flaws.First up is the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc. While the series is indeed being very well paced through most of it run the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc was too slow for its own good to a point where some of the Buddyfights drag on especially when all of the characters that were introduced in that arc were not all that interesting. Now if I think about it the Sengoku Academy arc was the weakest arc in the season. Minus the good character building for Rouga and Kiri, the arc didn\'t all that much to the overall plot.The second and final problem I had with Future Card Buddyfight is Gao\'s plot armour. It\'s such a shame because I really enjoyed Gao personality/development as well as his relationships towards characters. I just thought of his wins felt more like asspulls rather than legit victories thought I would admit it\'s not as bad as some of the asspulls from the Yugioh series as well as Cardfight Vanguard G.Overall, despite the show flaws, I thought the story of Future Card Buddyfight to be solid.7.5/10Characters.The characters in Future Card Buddyfight were easily the shows biggest strength.First, we have Gao Mikado. I actually really liked him. He may appear as this generic shounen hero at first but he\'s actually a pretty interesting character. Unlike Aichi Gao already has an established backgroundHis backstory was pretty interesting as he before used to be this ruthless guy who would do anything to win even if hurting others in the progress. However in order to make friends at all he to change his mind where he doesn\'t use ruthless techniques to hurt others in both martial arts and in Buddyfight. This really gives a pretty good insight about Gao\'s character as a whole as his actions were pretty reliable as he simply wants to escape from being a person that he used to be.Besides the backstory there\'s a bit more I have to talk about Gao\'s as a character.I really liked his character interactions and relationships towards the other characters as he wanted to support and help his friends take the right path but when he fails he gets pretty upset and he will end up doing anything just to save his friends from corruption and evil.The one cool thing about Gao is how he\'s able to use and master different decks and worlds. It really makes Gao think twice about the moves that he\'s going to play against set opponents using set deck.Now as much I enjoyed Gao as a character I have one problem with him and it\'s not about the character but rather how the plot treats him. You see despite Gao being a solidly written character who has character flaws there was a couple of instances where the plot wanted him to be this generic overpowered protagonist even though the series at various points showcases that he is a flawed character. I honestly wished the showed treated Gao a bit better because outside of all of the plot conveniences that the story gives his a likeable and fun character to be around. Overall, despite how the plot treats him at times, Gao is a pretty good character.Next, we have Tasuku. I really liked Tasuku. He\'s a friendly individual who is nice to everyone that he meets. However, despite his kindness he\'s want\'s to grow up faster as he works as a Buddy Police officer where he protects the world from crime done by criminal buddyfighters.(Spoilers ahead)Despite him being a successful buddy police officer, he feels that the buddy police force is corrupted as shown later on the series he gets very frustrated with the buddy police organisation as a whole as he quickly falls into darkness where he joins team Disaster as the Purgatory Knight.After getting defeated by Gao in the final match he starts doing through a mini redemption arc where he starts feeling ashamed and guilty of everything that he has done as the Purgatory Knight. (End of Spoilers)Despite the lack of screen time in the first half I found Tasuku to be a nicely developed and written character that I enjoyed from start to finish.I absolutely adored Kiri no am kidding I really like the show did with his characters. He starts off as this timid boy who would look up with his senpai being Gao. However, a couple of plot twists and plot aspects Kiri starts to grow as a character whereby the end of the show he\'s like a totally different person where it literally becomes a likeable badass. He\'s easily my third favourite character.Now we have Zayna. While I didn\'t care for him all that much in the beginning due to him being a solo who prefers to work alone rather than with other however as the series progresses he starts to become quite a cool character as he starts to open up to people as well trusting them.Despite him being a cool character overall the thing that hurts him quite a bit is he\'s afraid of girls and is not talking about his being afraid of girls boobs or anything but he literally cannot talk or go against a girl in a Buddyfight. I don\'t know why the writers didn\'t give him a 3 episode arc where he overcomes his fear of girls as that would have been interesting plus we got a backstory that showed how he became scared of girls. Don\'t get me wrong I still like Zayna as a character but him being scared of girls removes quite a bit of coolness about him.Tetsuya is an interesting likeable character. Unlike Gao and Zayna where they are dedicated to Buddyfighing Testuya is a dancer who doesn\'t devote his energy to Buddyfighting and because of those reasons he\'s basically an underdog and a very good one. Throughout the series people would gossip of how\'s he\'s a low rate fighter who cannot win however thanks to his buddy as well his determination he slowly moves up the ranks of being a pretty strong Buddyfighting where we end getting a lot of respect from his peers. If you remove the following characters that I will talk about next, he would be my favourite as he\'s not only a nicely written character but he\'s just so fun to watch and seeing improved at the game was so satisfying My second favourite character in the Future Card Buddyfight.If I had to pick my favourite character in Future Card Buddyfight, it would be Noboru Kodo. I absolutely adored this character from start to finish.He started off at this arrogant boy who had an inferiority complex where it always diminished Gao\'s Buddyfight as pure luck rather than actual skill. Typical rival stuff however what made him my favourite character in the series when he\'s starts to realise that he\'s not that special. When Tetsuya defeated Noboru in a Buddyfight, he didn\'t just lose the match but he\'s lost his pride and confidence to a point. A few episodes later he has gone so far that he was going to quit Buddyfight for good.However, thanks to El Quixote\'s advice defeats a criminal Buddyfighter and he started to become more confident about himself. From there he not only has the courage to be himself he also reconciles with Gao where he becomes his true friend again. Because of these reasons along Noboru is my favourite character. Thank you Buddyfight.Kazane was a fun charterer. While she didn\'t develop all that much when compared to the other characters in the show she still a lot of fun to watch.Now I have praised many of the characters in Buddyfight but now it\'s time to talk about the charterers that I have mixed feeling for and that character is Rouga. Now Rouga is a fun and entertaining character that I enjoyed, however, I feel like the writers did not what to do with him in the narrative as the writers keep on changing what type of character Rouga is. At times he can be lone wolf antagonist, while other the plot portrays as a misunderstood rival. The plot can also as times portrays him like the sword of Kyoya as he would do anything to defeat anyone who gets in Kyoya way while at others he\'s a typical badass student. This unfortunately really makes him an inconsistent character as I feel the writers had created a character that would have worked in Cardfight Vanguard or Yugioh Arc V.The other two charterers I have mixed feelings towards is Baku and Kuguru. Despite them being Gao best friends and deck builder/intel they didn\'t do all that much as characters. They aren\'t bad characters but any means, in fact, I found the humour to be decent but they didn\'t leave a lasting impact of the series compared to many of the characters like Kiri, Tasuku and Noboru.As for the villain origination Disaster, I thought they were pretty good overall. Some were better than others but that they brought enough entertainment to make them enjoyable to watch on screen. My favourite characters in Team Disaster were Sofia and the main antagonist of the season Kyoya.Finally, we have the buddies themselves and to be honest apart from Asmodai, Jack, Drum and El Quixote they are pretty one-note mainly because they only have single character trait and not much else.Overall the characters in Buddyfight were great for the most part and them easily my favourite thing about this series. If it weren\'t for the characters that I simply wouldn\'t have enjoyed it all that much. Great job Buddyfight.8.5/10Visuals.As for the visuals, I thought the show was pretty good.The characters designs were unique and fitted well with the personality of the characters especially Noboru who is far the best character design wise thanks hair resembling like an actual brown tiger on the top of his yellow hair. Other notable designs include Gao, Kiri especially his second form, and Tetsuya. The buddy designs were for the most part pretty good despite some of them being in full CGI.The one thing that I really liked about the visuals is how colourful it is. The series uses its urban smooth colour palette for the background scenery in the series. It really makes the setting of Future Card Buddyfight feel more alive.The animation in Future Card Buddyfight surprisingly pretty good. It is smooth, consistent, and nicely animated. The show did have some stock footage in certain moments but don\'t you worry the stock footage doesn\'t get abused as much compared to older brother Cardfight Vanguard Season 1.The only issue that I had with the visuals is the use of CGI at times and while it wasn\'t that bad compared to other shows of its genre it still pretty distracting to look at.Overall I thought the visuals were pretty good.8/10Sound.The soundtrack of Future Card Buddyfight is pretty good and memorable. It uses a selection of clam, thrilling sci-fi and ninja tracks pieces to enhance the setting and tone of the series. Some of my favourite tracks include Gao\'s theme, Noboru theme, Grim Reaper theme, I be mine and team Disaster theme.The first opening Card Of The Future by Psychic Lover is a catchy opening theme that fits well with the lighthearted tone of the series. While the first opening visuals were bland the second opening visuals were much better and engaging.The second opening theme ""Buddy Buddy BAAAAAN!! sung by the Seiyuus of Gao and Baku was decent at best. While the song itself was alright the visuals didn\'t fit the tone of the arc at all thanks to its bizarre tone.The first ending theme Buddy Buddy Fight!"" sung by Paruko Seiyuu Sora Tokui is an ending theme that is so bad it\'s good. The song itself was very cheesy and the melody wasn\'t all that good. The only redeeming theme about the first ending theme was the visuals which were pretty solid.The second ending theme Natsuiro Fighting!! sung by Paruko Seiyuu is a good catch that was a big improvement over the first ending theme. Not only the ending visuals were much better, but the song had a great and catchy rhythm.The third ending theme Shining Up sung by Hanako Seiyuu is in my top 30 favourite anime ending themes as it was a very sad song that perfectly showcases the lifespan of Gao brother.I have not seen much of the sub mainly because its most of the episodes didn\'t get an English translation but I what I remember I thought it was solid.The dub of Buddyfight is pretty good. The voice actors really did a job with the roles that they were given and it really makes these characters feels more live. My favourite performances were Bacchus, Patricia as Gao, Hannah Dickinson as Kiri, Slusar, Zoe as Noboru and Hanson, Cole as Tasuku. Overall very good dub.9/10Final Thoughts.There is no secret that I really liked Future Card Buddyfight.The story despite being cliched at times was entertaining and interesting to watch. The characters were, for the most part, great and likeable. The visuals were solid and consistent minus the awarded use of CGI at certain points and the music was good. It did have a small couple of problems, though. The Sengoku Academy arc could have been better paced, the plot armour was out of control at times and a small handful of the supporting characters were not that good. Despite that issues, I still made it through the first season feeling a sense of satisfaction. Future Card Buddyfight gain a pretty strong following after it came out as it, not only card game anime watchers into watching it but it also converted many jaded Yugioh/Cardfight Vanguard players into playing the card game itself. If you\'re looking for a good card game anime that has likeable characters and has a fun addicting plot than I easily recommend Future Card Buddyfight.The show may not revolutionise the card game anime genre, but I still think it\'s a great show that I enjoyed.Final Score 8.5/10', ""This isn't the bottom of the barrel. We're through the barrel and plunging into cavernous depths previously unknown to man. This is garbage.And that's the thing, too. There's no pretension of it being anything other than garbage. Everyone involved knew this was garbage pumped out to kill time on the airwaves and shill a third rate collectible card game. If the creators made a quick buck, I can respect their business sense. I can only muster respect for Future Card Buddyfight as a scam.This show is as creatively bankrupt as it gets. All the cliches that Pokemon and its ilk have worn into the ground...for decades are on display, and somehow Future Card Buddyfight bungles every last one of them. Look, I'm not George R.R. Martin, I don't scoff if all the meticulous inner workings of a setting aren't accounted for. I can suspend my disbelief, especially for a kids show, but this is just stupid. There was no effort or thought put into any of this. That goes to the insanely cookie cutter characters, as well.I gave Aldnoah Zero's Second Season a 3 because, for as insipid as it was, it at least felt like there was some creative, artistic spark, even if the execution was terrible. Future Card Buddyfight doesn't even have that. It's just cynical.As far as positives go, a friend and I got a few good laughs at its expense. The main character's mom is obviously the best girl. It's sometimes animated. That's all I've got.As a show, Future Card Buddyfight is a turgid, rancid failure. Don't let any kids waste their time on it. They deserve better.

Freezing Vibration,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18001/Freezing_Vibration,"['First off, I will start by saying that I have not read any of the manga nor do I plan to.Freezing Vibrations, simply put, was very bad. More so, Freezing Vibrations was even worse compared to it\'s first season which was quite a good show. My main focus in this review will mostly be directed to anyone who has watched the first season.(which I don\'t know why you wouldn\'t watch that before watching this...) Let\'s begin.Story: 4The story never really was this shows strong spot. That said, the first season at least did a fair job at keeping it from being weak. This season,... they...really dropped the ball. While the exact idea of the plot wasn\'t bad, it\'s execution was something of a nightmare. While I would like to go through each episode and beat them down like the wild animals they are, it is taboo to do so in a basic review. I will, however, address the **** storm that was the final episode and warn you about the 6th.(Possible spoilers) Firstly, the 6th episode led to a moment that could be misinterpreted ENTIRELY. They did a GREAT job at completely misguiding you on a very important event that almost had me quit the show right then and there. When you get there, you will see, and will hopefully remember little ole me warning you now. To add to this episode, it resolved itself in the most insane way.  Just everybody acting like nothing really happened. I just couldn\'t believe it!Now for the final episode. So, while the build up to this point was already pretty bad, the phrase, ""They dropped the ball"" simply no longer does it justice. Vaguely put, the last episode could be described as: A character, who was never really hinted to being important, turns out to be pretty damn important and basically becomes Iron Giant Jesus, everything goes black and white, and then a picture of a nebula gets flashed at you. Yeah,..  you\'ll see...  To top it off, they try to leave you with a cliff hanger by introducing yet another character who looks like three other people in the show. I just couldn\'t care enough at this point and just wanted it to end.Art & Sound: 8If you saw the first season, the Art was the same. For me, there is nothing to complain about and nothing really special about it either. So, all in all, no worries there. The sound on the other hand was quite swell. I spent most of the last episode listening to it with my face in my hands trying to cope with the pain. It might have actually been the only thing keeping me sane at the time...Character: 2Despite of all the stories flaws, the characters might have actually been the most disappointing part of this. While I thought that the first season spent a lot of time making Kazuya the ""main"" character, the second season spends most of its time making sure you don\'t think that. In terms of character development, he has ZERO. I warn you all now, if you wanted him to have any significant part of this story where he did ANYTHING useful, walk away. Now that I think about it, he gets less screen time than most characters in the show. Completely disappointing.While the show does it\'s best to make him NOT the main character, it can\'t, FOR THE LIFE OF IT, decide who is. Call me old fashioned, but I like a focused story from a mostly singular perspective and strong development from a MAIN character. The story can\'t decide who the hell is important and just kills anybody it decides isn\'t. On top of that, EVERYBODY is crying ALL the time and nobody acts realistically. NOBODY. The weak characters strongly effected the stories progression and ultimately killed entire experience for me.Enjoyment: 3Do I really have to say it? It sucked. Every corner of every episode was just one disappointment after the other. I powered through in hopes that something would get good but to no avail. While this rating is strongly influenced off the success of its progenitor, which means it is probably receiving a heavier bashing than it deserves, the show was just bad.  And I very rarely give below a seven.The action scenes were pretty decent at times. I guess I got some enjoyment out of that maybe.Overall: 4I don\'t think I need to go any further. If you liked the first, I can\'t imagine you will like this one more. Though, you may not hate it like I did... really dropped the ball.

It’s not the temperature I’m referring to but the fact the show is stone cold in terms of storytelling, characters, and presentation. I tried to remain optimistic about what this sequel could bring because the establishment of season 1. Despite being clichéd and molded with unbalanced characters, the first season at least had some standards on its premise. The way it was orchestrated did not live up to its promise but if you thought Freezing was bad, season 2 is at another level of catastrophe. It’s like an avalanche heading for disaster and eventually buries itself...in this disaster of a continuation.Freezing Vibration is the direct continuation of season 1 of Freezing, a manga based on the same name written by Dall-Young Lim. If you haven’t seen Freezing yet, then better get to that now if you’re curious about this series. The fact is that you’ll be a bit lost at what’s happening. Therefore, it is highly advisable to watch season 1 of Freezing before venturing on this continuation.Season 2 takes off wasting little time with its plot. From the beginning, we meet our three main protagonists Kazuya, Satellizer, and Rana whom seem to be part of an expedition in a very frosty location. It’s soon we find that they were sent there to undertake and be part of an experiment for the “benefit of humanity”. I put this in quotation marks as this will be explained later. But as the plot begins to unfold itself, we find out there’s more than meets the eye especially for what’s going behind the scenes.The anime is adapted from the manga as part of the “E-Pandora” arc that introduces many new characters into the show. New characters such as Amelia Evans and Gina Papleton are introduced as supporting characters and part of a project known as “E-Pandora Project”. Other prominent characters such as Chiffon, Elizabeth, and a returning Cassie Lockhart make their way in the show. What do they have in common? Nothing except their rankings in terms of fighting abilities that made the famous throughout the world. Altogether, they are in line to support the latest evolution in experimentation to combat the deadly Novas. That’s at least what they think anyways…At the core of the experimentation is a research with extensive knowledge of the Stigmata. We learn throughout the show that the experimentations aren’t as they appear to be especially involving a powerful drug. It’s hard to categorize what kind of drug this is but the effects are malevolent. To make matter worse, there’s a line where E-Pandoras cross before they get themselves hurt. By hurt, I mean real hurt. For this sequel to work with a storyline this, there’s need to be a realization on the history of experimentation (or at least similar cases). Unfortunately, the series explores only its effects on the surface through actual combat. The fighting itself doesn’t hold any promise as most of the fights are one sided. Even when there’s a little glimmer of hope, it goes back to being stale again with predicable circumstances.The plot of Freezing Vibration also apparently explores a bit of our main characters in particular Satellizer. We already know that she is nicknamed the “untouchable queen” for a reason in season 1. However, that element is really touched upon (almost in a literal sense…) in this sequel. To say the least, it’s disturbing, ominous, and distasteful to watch considering the relations involved. To make matters worse, it makes little effort in resolving the issue. Sure, there’s the emotions and symbolism that were involved. However, there’s little sense in who to exactly blame. Was it really the perpetrator, Satellizer’s own insecurities of herself, or just nature of humanity itself? It’s also unknown what sort of message it's trying to sent; especially with its odd coordination at the middle of the story. The premise is completely separate from the E-Pandoras or war against Novas itself. It seems like the series is trying to develop characters but rubs it in the wrong way. It’s literally forcing itself at the body of its plot to show the grim reality of Satellizer’s past. It’s excruciating to watch and makes us feel uncomfortable with its delivery.At some respects, Freezing Vibration does give many of the characters screen time. Almost everyone gets a little action in whether you’re a Pandora, E-Pandora, or Limiter. Just be aware that the series is a one cour show so don’t expect any characterization on anyone. In fact, we only get a little glimpse at the true visage of a few characters such as Elizabeth and Amelia. Our antagonist of this show named Scarlett Ohara is also stereotypical with the lab coat, cynical personality, and ambition of a researcher just without the mad scientist glasses. With no sense of a personality she is about as stone cold as the freezing winds of Alaska. At various points, I question if the main problem of the antagonist is humanity itself because the E-Pandoras suffers by the products of humans’ inventions. Without them, the E-Pandoras wouldn’t even be there or have to live through a fear of being a human lab animal.In terms of aesthetic values, Freezing Vibration does keep up with its science fiction theme well. Characters are designed to look and feel like they are part of the program. Because the show brings out the female dominance of the characters, most of them are designed to look compelling and can handle themselves. In particular, the top 5 Pandoras of the world distinguishes themselves by different nicknames that matches their personalities/abilities. On the other hand, there’s a subtext of cruelty related to the E-Pandoras as we get to see where some of them came from; not literally with background histories but rather what they are fighting for or why they’re there.Similar to the first season as well, there’s fan service. It feels odd to see many pool scenes in a cold climate where the experimentations take place. Of course, with a pool filled with hot water can only mean one thing: clothes coming off. In more ways than one, a few of the characters goes on a more daring way to advertise themselves such as Elizabeth or Roxanne. Rana also follows this trend in order to “take advantage of Kazuya”. Oh and speaking of the relationship Rana and Kazuya, there seems to be no progression there as well except for the occasional tease that achieves little results. Similarly, Satellizer still remains unbaptized despite overcoming a crucial obstacle in her life. It’s factors like these that really degenerates the main plot together as viewers may be left with how to feel. In the end, I felt unsatisfied. The way some conflicts are resolved are also questionable with predictable results left with clichéd holes. It’s a cold stone reality and the E-Pandoras doesn’t like it either.Artistic wise, most of the designs are generic although fits with the overall science fiction theme well. There’s not much change in any of the main characters’ designs although a few of the new Pandoras introduced give them a distinguishing appearance. These include the scarlet hair of Roxanne, the short stature of Charles, or the glamorous figure of a nude Elizabeth Mably. On the contrary, we don’t get to see a lot of Novas in this season as the show focuses on the E-Pandoras so it’s hard to tell if they underwent significant changes. The setting of this season goes well with its style though in the cold climates of Alaska. The freezing snow depicts the cruelty of the experimentation and the reality of E-Pandoras like the frozen winds.Soundtrack isn’t entirely impressive but is tolerable enough. Music director Masaru Yokoyama returns for his role and does a standard job. The OST is only tolerable at best during the action scenes and less so during emotional subplots. The choreography of the action scenes rises above the standards though especially for moves such as the rapid Tempest maneuver or Accel Turns. The OP song ‘Avenge World’ balances itself with a sense of science. On the other hand, the ED song ‘Sekai wa Kizu wo Dakishimeru’ is saturated with fan service that makes the sinister style of this season look like a joke.Freezing Vibration is one of those shows that I only recommend for completion’s sakes or if you want to see what happens after season one. It’s really hard to not feel disappointed after seeing the weak characterization and its mess of a plot. The plot itself also doesn't end well with a rushed conclusion and hinting a possible continuation. There are many inconsistencies related to the E-Pandora arc such as to who to blame or its main purpose. Sure, it might be to save humanity but who is to save the E-Pandoras themselves? Thankfully, the show introduces a diverse amount of characters that fans might get accustomed to along with some intense action and feuds. But ultimately, Freezing Vibration doesn’t live up to its name. If Freezing is a prototype, then Vibration would be the defection. Clearly, evolution is NOT the solution. in this disaster of a continuation.Freezing Vibration is the direct continuation of season 1 of Freezing, a manga based on the same name written by Dall-Young Lim. If you haven’t seen Freezing yet, then better get to that now if you’re curious about this series. The fact is that you’ll be a bit lost at what’s happening.

New characters such as Amelia Evans and Gina Papleton are introduced as supporting characters and part of a project known as “E-Pandora Project”. Other prominent characters such as Chiffon, Elizabeth, and a returning Cassie Lockhart make their way in the show. What do they have in common? Nothing except their rankings in terms of fighting abilities that made the famous throughout the world. Altogether, they are in line to support the latest evolution in experimentation to combat the deadly Novas. That’s at least what they think anyways…At the core of the experimentation is a research with extensive knowledge of the Stigmata. We learn throughout the show that the experimentations aren’t as they appear to be especially involving a powerful drug. It’s hard to categorize what kind of drug this is but the effects are malevolent. To make matter worse, there’s a line where E-Pandoras cross before they get themselves hurt. By hurt, I mean real hurt. For this sequel to work with a storyline this, there’s need to be a realization on the history of experimentation (or at least similar cases). Unfortunately, the series explores only its effects on the surface through actual combat. The fighting itself doesn’t hold any promise as most of the fights are one sided. Even when there’s a little glimmer of hope, it goes back to being stale again with predicable circumstances.The plot of Freezing Vibration also apparently explores a bit of our main characters in particular Satellizer. We already know that she is nicknamed the “untouchable queen” for a reason in season 1. However, that element is really touched upon (almost in a literal sense…) in this sequel. To say the least, it’s disturbing, ominous, and distasteful to watch considering the relations involved. To make matters worse, it makes little effort in resolving the issue. Sure, there’s the emotions and symbolism that were involved. However, there’s little sense in who to exactly blame. Was it really the perpetrator, Satellizer’s own insecurities of herself, or just nature of humanity itself? It’s also unknown what sort of message it's trying to sent; especially with its odd coordination at the middle of the story. The premise is completely separate from the E-Pandoras or war against Novas itself. It seems like the series is trying to develop characters but rubs it in the wrong way. It’s literally forcing itself at the body of its plot to show the grim reality of Satellizer’s past. It’s excruciating to watch and makes us feel uncomfortable with its delivery.At some respects, Freezing Vibration does give many of the characters screen time. Almost everyone gets a little action in whether you’re a Pandora, E-Pandora, or Limiter. Just be aware that the series is a one cour show so don’t expect any characterization on anyone. In fact, we only get a little glimpse at the true visage of a few characters such as Elizabeth and Amelia. Our antagonist of this show named Scarlett Ohara is also stereotypical with the lab coat, cynical personality, and ambition of a researcher just without the mad scientist glasses. With no sense of a personality she is about as stone cold as the freezing winds of Alaska. At various points, I question if the main problem of the antagonist is humanity itself because the E-Pandoras suffers by the products of humans’ inventions. Without them, the E-Pandoras wouldn’t even be there or have to live through a fear of being a human lab animal.In terms of aesthetic values, Freezing Vibration does keep up with its science fiction theme well. Characters are designed to look and feel like they are part of the program. Because the show brings out the female dominance of the characters, most of them are designed to look compelling and can handle themselves. In particular, the top 5 Pandoras of the world distinguishes themselves by different nicknames that matches their personalities/abilities. On the other hand, there’s a subtext of cruelty related to the E-Pandoras as we get to see where some of them came from; not literally with background histories but rather what they are fighting for or why they’re there.Similar to the first season as well, there’s fan service. It feels odd to see many pool scenes in a cold climate where the experimentations take place. Of course, with a pool filled with hot water can only mean one thing: clothes coming off. In more ways than one, a few of the characters goes on a more daring way to advertise themselves such as Elizabeth or Roxanne. Rana also follows this trend in order to “take advantage of Kazuya”. Oh and speaking of the relationship Rana and Kazuya, there seems to be no progression there as well except for the occasional tease that achieves little results. Similarly, Satellizer still remains unbaptized despite overcoming a crucial obstacle in her life. It’s factors like these that really degenerates the main plot together as viewers may be left with how to feel. In the end, I felt unsatisfied. The way some conflicts are resolved are also questionable with predictable results left with clichéd holes. It’s a cold stone reality and the E-Pandoras doesn’t like it either.Artistic wise, most of the designs are generic although fits with the overall science fiction theme well. There’s not much change in any of the main characters’ designs although a few of the new Pandoras introduced give them a distinguishing appearance. These include the scarlet hair of Roxanne, the short stature of Charles, or the glamorous figure of a nude Elizabeth Mably. On the contrary, we don’t get to see a lot of Novas in this season as the show focuses on the E-Pandoras so it’s hard to tell if they underwent significant changes. The setting of this season goes well with its style though in the cold climates of Alaska. The freezing snow depicts the cruelty of the experimentation and the reality of E-Pandoras like the frozen winds.Soundtrack isn’t entirely impressive but is tolerable enough. Music director Masaru Yokoyama returns for his role and does a standard job. The OST is only tolerable at best during the action scenes and less so during emotional subplots. The choreography of the action scenes rises above the standards though especially for moves such as the rapid Tempest maneuver or Accel Turns. The OP song ‘Avenge World’ balances itself with a sense of science. On the other hand, the ED song ‘Sekai wa Kizu wo Dakishimeru’ is saturated with fan service that makes the sinister style of this season look like a joke.Freezing Vibration is one of those shows that I only recommend for completion’s sakes or if you want to see what happens after season one. It’s really hard to not feel disappointed after seeing the weak characterization and its mess of a plot. The plot itself also doesn't end well with a rushed conclusion and hinting a possible continuation. There are many inconsistencies related to the E-Pandora arc such as to who to blame or its main purpose. Sure, it might be to save humanity but who is to save the E-Pandoras themselves? Thankfully, the show introduces a diverse amount of characters that fans might get accustomed to along with some intense action and feuds. But ultimately, Freezing Vibration doesn’t live up to its name. If Freezing is a prototype, then Vibration would be the defection. Clearly, evolution is NOT the solution."", 'As someone who enjoyed the first season of Freezing, I found Vibration to be very disappointing for several reasons, but first I will cover the good points of this series.Story - (Synopsis from Freezing)The story hasn\'t changed, Set in a slightly futuristic world where Earth has been invaded and is at war with aliens from another dimension called the Nova, the story follows the adventures of a Japanese boy named Kazuya Aoi who enrolls for training at a special school for genetically modified girls called Pandoras who battle the aliens, and their male partners, called Limiters, who use a special power called ""freezing"" to limit...their opponent\'s mobility. The protagonist makes the acquaintance of an unusual older girl named Satellizer el Bridget who appears to be the most powerful Pandora in her class, but has not yet chosen a male partner to be her Limiter, and in spite of the warnings of all his friends, he decides to be her Limiter.This isn\'t your typical School/Romance/Harem in my opinion, it is quite different which actually holds a plot - defeating the aliens combining forces of one female, also known as a Pandora and one male who is called the Limiter; although one boy has a different type of power being the younger sibling of the greatest Pandora to exist, where he can use his \'full\' freezing power for anyone he fights with and all the Pandoras fight over him. I rated the story an 8, based upon the two seasons.Art -Now for the art, exactly the same as the first Freezing, it is remarkable. The detail put in, each snowflake falling and all the detail put in to the characters, background and the whole surface of it, it\'s clearly had a lot of time and effort put in and in my own opinion, this is the best part about this season. I rated the Art a 9.Sound -I didn\'t find the sound that interesting, it\'s got the type of opening/ending sound tracks you just listen to once, don\'t find it catchy and skip it and move on. I rate the sound tracks a 5.Characters -Well, here we go. In my opinion; the character development is the biggest flop of Freezing Vibration; the first season had 3 main characters, Kazuya Aoi, Satellizer el Bridget and Linchen Rana, who had a great back-story and you find out a lot about them all within the first couple of episodes. But, then you come to Freezing Vibration, they have doubled the amount of mains from 3 to 6 and make it confusing; their isn\'t a big story behind these characters because you are not told much about them, they haven\'t presented them in the right way and just rushed them into action. Characters - 5.Enjoyment -Although their are bad things about Vibration, it isn\'t all bad. It is enjoyable to an extent and does keep you moderately interested, although at points I have felt bored and \'couldn\'t be bothered\' watching. In my opinion, the newer mains annoy me and don\'t interest me, I would of rather watched the first season again but with more development to the story and what/when Kazuya and Bridget finally become the #1 team.Overall -Overall taking all my ratings into account, I rated this a 7.The story and art are the best things, like in any anime these are a key necessity for a good show, although the Characters are the biggest let down for me and I\'m not too bothered about the sound.Thank you for reading.~Malteasers their opponent\'s mobility.

I can force myself to finish off an anime, even if I do not like that anime, but for this one I just couldn\'t. Even if their clothes do get ripped off in almost every scene.I wrote this, from watching the first season, to watching this season up until episode 10, hopefully you did the same, but actually finished this season.If you want an actual review with the reviewer actually watching all of it (12/12 ep.) then feel free to skip this. For those of...you who actually take the time to read this, thank you.Story 5/10 (Well let\'s just dive right into it~)I simply just did not like the story plot in this season, at all. First they tell you where they are and why they are there, sort of, but I don\'t understand the sudden, weird, awkward switch of settings from season 1, for I liked the school life... Anyways, probably the biggest reasons why I found Freezing Vibrations story to be so, ""meeehhhhh"" is simple. (spoiler) They somehow found a way to sort of forcefully bring Satellizer\'s past back into this season. Whiiich I wouldn\'t have minded, if not for the, smooth yet very, very, very awkward transition into it. What I mean by that is, you\'re going to just let the lead characters go off into their own world, right in the middle of the story??? That honestly just blew my mind, plus I felt like Satellizer\'s past was rushed and not thought of carefully. Okay, I\'m probably being a bit rough on this, (already...) but don\'t get me wrong I did enjoy watching the tidbits of good story to Freezing. If they would have made the characters face the actual problems at hand, and not have so many little side details that didn\'t matter come up and in the way, the story would have been much, much better.Art 6/10I\'m not usually too knit-picky when it comes to art, but Freezing doesn\'t come up to par with some of the other anime from it\'s year/years. Overall standard animation.Sound 6/10For sound, I\'m usually not to picky either. There are a few points I\'m looking for, a nice opening/s and ending/s. If the anime doesn\'t have these I don\'t mind, but if I hear the same ost for a few scenes over I do get a bit annoyed. Freezing did fine when it came to that.  Also, the voice acting was quite, ""OK"" I liked the sound of their voices a majority of the time.Character 3/10""Why such a low score for this!?!?"" Is what a friend of mine said, and here is what I had to say. In Freezing Vibration, they spent FAR too much time on the small, supporting, never to be seen again characters. I would have liked to see some more character development on the  characters from season 1, you know the ones who won\'t die off. And I do say that the main Heroines, did get some attention, but honestly it\'s not the type of attention I wanted. When the characters ""grew"" closer together, I just felt super awkward, like AWKOTACO awkward. Satellizer is the main bad-ass in this series, I just felt like she got weak, (spoiler, she did) and seeing a main heroine go bipolar all over the place is sort of distorting.The overall fighting was pretty good, I get a bit confused on what they are saying from time to time, but the individual characters are good at stating the facts about themselves and the current battle situation.The characters, to me just... They felt so one-sided, not fake but on the verge of just being to predictable. Even if the main characters did get more time, I feel like it would be for nothing, since from the start, they were sort of brought up, only to just ""be there.""Enjoyment 4/10It\'s not like I didn\'t enjoy Freezing Vibration, it\'s just that saying, ""I like this season!"" Is too far fetched. Granted the clothes randomly ripping did make me laugh out loud from time to time, but less of that and more on things that actually mattered would have been great. I mean especially since they want you to sort of take this series seriously, but how can you and I take a battle serious when we see boobies everywhere? My enjoyment for this season would have been higher if the plot and the character\'s weren\'t so predictable, cliche and awkward. Seeing on how I just randomly dropped this on episode 10. Probably means that I just lost all interest in it.  Honestly I\'m being a bit nice on this end. The only thing that kept me going stronk, was Satellizer.Final Verdict 4.I don\'t really recommend this to anyone, unless you\'re into ecchi and just want to watch a bunch of girls fight.

All in all good not great but good.Art- Same as the previous season so it is decent nothing out of the ordinary but the biggest problem they did with the 2nd season is censoring the fan service scenes which was so badly done but not the worst censoring ive seen. The censoring is just a really blinding white circle or oval and whatnot it really took away from many of the fight scenes especially since the first season was uncensored and the 1st episode of the 2nd season was uncensored but for some reason the other 11 episodes from 2-12 were censored...(funimation).... so thats why, Minus all of that its good during fight scenes and some other stuff i cannot mention cuz their spoilers.Sound- Ima give this a 9/10 i prefered the op and ed of the second season alot more then the first. The 2nd season has a powerful opening theme from the start of it just a great op and the ending theme is good as well the ost is good certain themes catch your attention to where you just stop to watch and listen just good overall.Character- You get the same characters from the previous season along with many more characters for the second season some characters from the first season arent in the second but thats not important. The characters are good from main to side you also see satellizer's worst fear *spoiler sorry but they show him as a child during season one. To get back to the point many characters i wished they were showcased more in anime which they really didnt do all that well. A good character roster but kinda fails on making us care about some of the new characters which indeed kinda sucked and fell flat but it doesnt take away from utilzing the characters for the amount of time they had.Enjoyment- 8/10 i enjoyed it probably more than the first season but i didnt think it was better than the first season mainly because the ending seemed kinda rushed and theirs no sign of a 3rd season although i enjoyed it quite a bit some things they did with this anime's second season was just plain bad but the story was compelling enough it gave suspense and wonder and this time around you genuinely feel emotionally attached to certain characters based on who they are and what they perceive.Likes- Story, Fight scenes, All the music, More characters & more enjoyable characters, attachment with certain characters,Dislikes- Censoring, The use of the main character towards the end & in the end, Pacing was to fast towards the end.Overall- i am being really generous with this score an 8/10 i enjoyed everything enough to give it that score even if it was uncensored it would still receive an 8. The pacing is really what makes this season not as great as what it should have been and thats what it all comes down to it did everything right aside from cesnoring but the story was not perfectly executed it had alot of potential but 12 episodes didnt give it justice if it were extended to about 14 maybe the outcome would be different. Freezing as a whole is a super underrated anime that doesnt get enough love. Although i loved it i wouldn't recommend it to everyone both seasons that is. the end and it left you feeling unsatisfied by the ending it seems to give you the rushed feeling and the feeling of wanting more and probably a 3rd season there isnt really a cliff hanger but it seems to indicate a 3rd season.

He was a terrible character, but he was a character. Here, he’s an empty shell that does nothing. There are episodes where he hardly appears and he contributes nothing to the climax. Remove him, and the only thing that will go away are the two worst episodes.Freezing always had a funky relationship with sexualized violence. It boasts some of anime’s sexiest characters, but isn’t it more fun to see them swing their cool weapons with swooshing backgrounds? This could have been a really fun series about...warrior women. In fact, that’s what it is at its best. I don’t mean this in the pseudo-feminist, give a woman a gun and she’s strong way. There’s a big cast of female characters, each with her quirks and potential to be fun. Talk about fanservice all you want, but here the women are the leaders instead of sexual options.Along comes Kazuya though, and a funny attempt to bring us to the dark ages. Satellizer’s story had to come to a close, but the way it did was disgusting. There is putting a woman in a weak position, and there is letting the camera linger on her breasts as the rapists fondles it.This is what people criticize about Game of Thrones. It’s not the presence of violent sexuality that’s the problem. It’s the way it’s presented on the screen. Satellizer’s sexiness didn’t need to be emphasized during her moments of abuse. There is nothing sexy about a man raping a woman. Our dear rapist is also given a position of power so solid it makes no sense. A lot of sexual harassers are sexually attractive. It’s that quality that enables them to continue. Yet, women have a limit. Some women may forgive you for a little harassment if you look like Justin Timberlake, but Holly Rose’s devotion was completely unbelievable.It’s not connected to something in her personality. If there was something in her psyche that made her forgive such behavior it’d develop both her and the rapist, telling us what kind of women he’s into. She’s devoted to him just to make the situation harder for Satellizer. This is no longer pushing characters to the edge and seeing how they react but abusing them for the audience’s pleasures. No one has yet put a good argument for how rape can be a decent of form aestheacized violence. All I could see was the strings behind Holly Rose, and all I wanted was to grab her hand and run away with her to a world where there are no Novas and teenagers don’t have to join any military.I can dream, can’t I?It gets a little better once you move beyond that and to the other characters. Vibration is more ambitious than its predecessor. There are more characters, more of them are important to the plot, the story is more about people against people rather than humanity vs. an unknown enemy and the fanservice is often forgotten.So long as Vibration stays ambitious, it’s a lot of fun. Like Date A Live, though, we see another case of good ideas remaining undeveloped because the creators are too afraid to break the chains.There is an interesting story here somewhere about how we get lost trying to save humanity. It’s a good topic, considering the series feels like another response to Evangelion. By the time Vibration reveals its main theme, it reaches a climax that aside from being huge has no direction.You don’t expect a cozy climax from this, and the climax shouldn’t be. It’s a series built on visuals, but it can’t ride on it completely. You need to focus. You need to decide what you’re trying to do and make sure every thing points to it. Vibration decides to be a drama, which is a great change from the first season. It’s not sure what’s the dramatic core it revolves around.Maybe this mess could have been excused if they put more effort into the charactrization. There is humanity and personality lurking beneath all these great looks. These great looks actually help attract attention to the people beneath the skin. [i]Freezing[/i] boasts a very sexy character design – something I will elaborate in a different essay – but it’s also creative.They don’t just stick boobs on women. There is attention to the whole body structure that will look good. There is also variety in the facial expression and hairdos. This is not the dullness of Sekirei. The personalities that are hinted at are varied enough – Cassie is warm and accepting. Elizabeth is an uptight, judgemental moralist. Rana takes everything lightly and remains unaware of what’s around her. Roxanne is down-to-earth. Amelia is a well-intentioned girl who came from nothing and is afraid of returning there.The series never takes advantage of this varied, charismatic cast. Most of the character development is handled by the voice actors. The script is too busy moving the plot forward. It doesn’t give us enough moments that show us how they feel and react to everything. Things happen everyday, everywhere. The only thing that grants them meaning is how people perceive them, and isn’t art and entertainment a way to examine various viewpoints?The big climax is solved not by realizing how strong you are, but by the characters coming to a realization. That’s great. The creators decided to take the hard way out and not prove that one side was right via violence. I can’t stress how important this is. If the hero chops up the bad guys to pieces perfect for grilling, it doesn’t prove he was morally right. It proves he was stronger. By the time the big epiphany comes, the characters are wasted. So even if the idea was good in theory, it doesn’t offer much in the execution beyond not succumbing to cliches.How exactly this failure happened is a mystery. Chop the two episodes where they ruin Satellizer, chop the occasional moment of fanservice and you’re still left with plenty of time. Maybe they were just insecure. Maybe the creators were so busy not succumbing to cliches that they forgot to develop the good stuff. It ends up being defined more by lack. When you view the glass as half empty, it’s a sign of pessimism.There are fun moments, and there are cool ideas to borrow if you’re writing your own story. Overall, though, it’s a series that tries more to avoid being cliched than developing its unique ideas. It wins the award for sexiest character design, but I can’t help but wish for a little more. I would have forgiven more fanservice, or more Kazuya if the cost was learning more about Amelia, Cassie, Roxanne and all the rest.2 mutations out of 5 warrior women.

I was AMAZED. The amount of detail they went into of getting to know each and every character that you saw is outstanding. You actually get to SEE how each character grew up and why they are who they are.The story in itself is very different from its predecessor ""Freezing"", so don\'t expect to be seeing boobies flying...left and right. It\'s a huge change from what you might think it is but you won\'t be disappointed, because it\'s very story driven and the action comes at you like a slap to the face from your girlfriend who just caught you cheating with her best friend.I would STRONGLY recommend watching Freezing and Freezing Vibration back to back so you get the full experience and story left and right. It\'s a huge change from what you might think it is but you won\'t be disappointed, because it\'s very story driven and the action comes at you like a slap to the face from your girlfriend who just caught you cheating with her best friend.I would STRONGLY recommend watching Freezing and Freezing Vibration back to back so you get the full experience and story', ""In the Chevalier's Alaska base is a project to produce more Pandora to combat the dwindling population that currently exists to combat the monstrous and enigmatic Nova. Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana, Elizabeth, and Chiffon are called along with other Pandora to provide data to assist with the project. When project's specifics are brought to light is the cost really justifiable or are the Chevalier going too far?Story - (9) Freezing Vibration improves story wise in all aspects. While the first season is mostly just hazing, this season brings Satellizer and company into an interesting and at times disturbing story about humanity...and just how horrible and monstrous we can be when backed into a corner. It also focuses on the many different characters views and opinions on what it means to be a Pandora. Are Pandora merely tools that should follow what their superiors say? Are they obligated to use their powers to challenge what goes against their morals for the sake of the innocent? Are the few expendable if it means saving humanity? These questions aren't given concrete answers and it's up for the viewer to decide who was right or wrong at the end of all this. Though it doesn't do as well at making arguments for all the characters in motivations as the manga does, it's still pretty compelling.Art - (8) Freezing Vibration slightly increases art quality across the board for most characters. The new characters are all well designed and even minor Pandora have really nice designs. Just like the first season however I feel far too much of the scenery is too dark and dreary. This helps with the feeling of isolation of Alaska in this season, but even then I would've liked some brighter colors here and there.Sound - (8) Freezing Vibration again has a very nice set of songs. It's ending and opening in particular are both very catchy and awesome.  The themes in the anime are on par with the first season and I really seen no upgrade or downgrade in them.Characters - (9) This is really Freezing Vibration really shines. This season introduces the top 5 world ranked Pandora to the cast. Much like the first season. each girl in this season has different reasons for being a Pandora and answers to what it means to be a soldier. They are unique and interesting for the most part. We also get to delve deeper into the characters we already know. Satellizer confronts demons from her past and has noticeably changed from season 1. We get a better idea of who Elizabeth is and what she stands for. Chiffon gets to show how she got to be number 1 in the world. Even Cassie/Cathy shows development from her battle with Satellizer at the end of season 1.- Few Notes hereUnfortunately the majority of the characters shown in season 1 aren't in season 2 at all due to the setting.Kazuya does kind of get the short end of the stick this season, but his relationship with Satellizer does develop.A certain character's personality is completely different from her manga counterpart this season. Whether this is for better or worse is up to the individual.Enjoyment (9) - I really enjoy Freezing as a whole and enjoyed season 2 more than season 1. I was never bored and was really invested in the characters and overall conflict. I really thought it was good.Overall (9) - Freezing Vibration, like most anime that has fanservice, gets overlooked by people who don't even give it a chance. What I watched was an interesting look into Pandora and what they fight for. I liked that Satellizer and Kazuya shared the spotlight with other characters. It's got disturbing scenes in it, but I think that makes it unique. It's a show pushes people's buttons, but in my case I guess they were the right ones. If this show gets a 3rd season I'll be right there continuing the ride. and just how horrible and monstrous we can be when backed into a corner.

After the announcement of Freezing vibration, i was kinda happy to see what is that about and expectating new things and also new interesting events to happens just like few events in the first show. But after completing the series....i was very disappointed by how freezing vibration turned out. In other words, i can freely say that Freezing(2011)...is superior than Freezing Vibration. I have a lot of things to say in this review and about this anime so lets start to the point shall we?Story: 4/10Lets start with the weakiest part of the show that are the story. It happens some time later after the first season. Chevalier concluded that most of the Nova assaults are causing many loss of pandoras that they can even produce. For fix this, a certain project starts called E-Pandora(Evolution Padora), that consists in giving powers to normal humans in order to turn them into pandoras aswell. In order to help with experiences  and developing the E-pandoras, most of the pandoras around the world is invited to come to the alaska in the base of the project for help. Satellizer, Kazuya and Lana aswell are invited for it but they soon manage to discover some secrets of the e-pandora's project as they lives some dark events around it. Well....about the story....it have decreased a lot in terms of enjoyment. The first season was building a good plot with a gripping atmosphere and certain interesting events that the second season could have turned it better but the e-pandora arc is not really interesting. Few episodes saved the anime for being bad but yet the story doesn't really impressed me. I have see a lot of animes with that nakama feeling with emotional themes that had sucess in transmit it just like One piece, fairy tail(but i think FT just overruse it that nakama thing) and etc. I have feeling that freezing vibration tried to do that, showing about how much of the e-pandoras cares about theirselves and her friends, but for be sincerity, in the sad scenes, i don't feel sorry for them because i didn't find they interesting in point of having me locked into them(i will explain more about it in the character section).The Fights are not so good as the first season, they are somehow rushed and skipped a lot for show other scenes, something that really disappointed me since freezing had some good fights before, i was expectating to see more good fights in this season aswell but i couldn't see, there are some fights involving pandoras but they are not interesting to see, you will just see and wish it for end quickly for how boring it is. In the first season, it was good to see pandoras fighting against novas and how epic were the effects during the fight scenes, but this second season don't have any fight involving novas(only more near of the end but i can't tell since it would be spoiler) but is very quickly, decreasing the excitment. Other thing i want to make sure is i readed freezing manga and i already saw how the e-pandora arc is in the manga and i can say...is so much better and amazing than the anime. Its somehow more deep and dark with a lot of interesting contents and more explained things. In other words, i can say in the story, Freezing vibration had a mediocre adaptation, with a lot of unexplained things and skipped information that decreased the story in point of becoming a lot of uniteresting and boring. As i said before, few episodes saved the anime like episode 6-7 and the last 2 episodes that turned the anime slighty interesting, yet the story is still awful duo the bad adaptation, becoming unmotivating to keep watch.Art: 7/10Nothing to say about it, is the same animation since Freezing 2011, with some few changes in the visuals and effects. New changes would increases the quality of the anime but meh is still a good animation.Sound: 6/10The sound decreased it a little in terms of OP and ED, is not really memorable, those are OK OP and ED, you will just hear but won't remember or feel like hearing it again. Yet the Orchestral and Piano OSTs of Freezing vibration are still so epic to hear.Character: 5/10In terms of character, i have to say that is slighty better than the original Freezing. Now there is more characters that somehow fits with the story and the events around it or got more attention than the first season like roxanne, ticy, cassie, chiffon, Elizabeth, Amelia and etc. They are eh...OK characters, not exactly memorable, they are like just for fit their hole in the anime, not like will make any change to the story, there few ones that really will change everything in the story or how the things will go. Satellizer, Kazuya and Rana are back, they are exactly the same, won't change anything, but Satellizer gets a little more of development, becoming a slighty better character but yet i really don't liked how OP satellizer be, i know she don't like giving up but we can give too much protagonism on her. Well, Duo the rushed adaptation, i will say a problem that appears aswell in Black Bullet. For a lot of content and information being skipped and unexplained, you won't know many things about the characters, in other words, in case of something happens with them, you won't really care for them because you think of them like just a support for help the protagonists and if they die, won't make difference. This is not a problem of the manga, and yes of the anime. A ongoing manga(with more than 30-50 chapters) cannot have only 13 episodes, because it will be very rushed and less enjoying. Characters that would be memorable, will be eh...good but not excitting characters that you will always remember. Nowdays animators think less information and more action makes something good. =/Enjoyment: 5/10The Ecchi/Fanservice decreased a little, giving some more focus in the story that still comes rushed and unexplained, turning it less excitting. i Didn't liked Freezing Vibration too much for having the same mistake as many animes around, bad adaptation. I was expectating more from it since i enjoyed the first season. A lot of things decreased principally the quality of anime in terms of story and sound that before were kinda good but it have fall.Overall: 5/10Freezing Vibration, for most mediocre it is, you have to watch or you won't catch to the story, and also you will do not understand anything if Freezing have future seasons. Is not really good as the first season and also not very enjoyable because the excitment have decreased for anime that don't bring anything new  or something to lock us into the series.Pros:+Good Animation/Soundtracks+Some Characters got their respective attention/They have good roles in the series.+Amazing Visual EffectsCons:-Bland Rushed and Unexplained Story-A lot of Skipped Informations-Not All characters got developed-Less Excitting Scenes is superior than Freezing Vibration. I have a lot of things to say in this review and about this anime so lets start to the point shall we?Story: 4/10Lets start with the weakiest part of the show that are the story.

The first season was building a good plot with a gripping atmosphere and certain interesting events that the second season could have turned it better but the e-pandora arc is not really interesting. Few episodes saved the anime for being bad but yet the story doesn't really impressed me. I have see a lot of animes with that nakama feeling with emotional themes that had sucess in transmit it just like One piece, fairy tail(but i think FT just overruse it that nakama thing) and etc. I have feeling that freezing vibration tried to do that, showing about how much of the e-pandoras cares about theirselves and her friends, but for be sincerity, in the sad scenes, i don't feel sorry for them because i didn't find they interesting in point of having me locked into them(i will explain more about it in the character section).The Fights are not so good as the first season, they are somehow rushed and skipped a lot for show other scenes, something that really disappointed me since freezing had some good fights before, i was expectating to see more good fights in this season aswell but i couldn't see, there are some fights involving pandoras but they are not interesting to see, you will just see and wish it for end quickly for how boring it is. In the first season, it was good to see pandoras fighting against novas and how epic were the effects during the fight scenes, but this second season don't have any fight involving novas(only more near of the end but i can't tell since it would be spoiler) but is very quickly, decreasing the excitment. Other thing i want to make sure is i readed freezing manga and i already saw how the e-pandora arc is in the manga and i can say...is so much better and amazing than the anime. Its somehow more deep and dark with a lot of interesting contents and more explained things. In other words, i can say in the story, Freezing vibration had a mediocre adaptation, with a lot of unexplained things and skipped information that decreased the story in point of becoming a lot of uniteresting and boring. As i said before, few episodes saved the anime like episode 6-7 and the last 2 episodes that turned the anime slighty interesting, yet the story is still awful duo the bad adaptation, becoming unmotivating to keep watch.Art: 7/10Nothing to say about it, is the same animation since Freezing 2011, with some few changes in the visuals and effects. New changes would increases the quality of the anime but meh is still a good animation.Sound: 6/10The sound decreased it a little in terms of OP and ED, is not really memorable, those are OK OP and ED, you will just hear but won't remember or feel like hearing it again. Yet the Orchestral and Piano OSTs of Freezing vibration are still so epic to hear.Character: 5/10In terms of character, i have to say that is slighty better than the original Freezing. Now there is more characters that somehow fits with the story and the events around it or got more attention than the first season like roxanne, ticy, cassie, chiffon, Elizabeth, Amelia and etc. They are eh...OK characters, not exactly memorable, they are like just for fit their hole in the anime, not like will make any change to the story, there few ones that really will change everything in the story or how the things will go. Satellizer, Kazuya and Rana are back, they are exactly the same, won't change anything, but Satellizer gets a little more of development, becoming a slighty better character but yet i really don't liked how OP satellizer be, i know she don't like giving up but we can give too much protagonism on her. Well, Duo the rushed adaptation, i will say a problem that appears aswell in Black Bullet. For a lot of content and information being skipped and unexplained, you won't know many things about the characters, in other words, in case of something happens with them, you won't really care for them because you think of them like just a support for help the protagonists and if they die, won't make difference. This is not a problem of the manga, and yes of the anime. A ongoing manga(with more than 30-50 chapters) cannot have only 13 episodes, because it will be very rushed and less enjoying. Characters that would be memorable, will be eh...good but not excitting characters that you will always remember. Nowdays animators think less information and more action makes something good. =/Enjoyment: 5/10The Ecchi/Fanservice decreased a little, giving some more focus in the story that still comes rushed and unexplained, turning it less excitting. i Didn't liked Freezing Vibration too much for having the same mistake as many animes around, bad adaptation. I was expectating more from it since i enjoyed the first season. A lot of things decreased principally the quality of anime in terms of story and sound that before were kinda good but it have fall.Overall: 5/10Freezing Vibration, for most mediocre it is, you have to watch or you won't catch to the story, and also you will do not understand anything if Freezing have future seasons. Is not really good as the first season and also not very enjoyable because the excitment have decreased for anime that don't bring anything new  or something to lock us into the series.Pros:+Good Animation/Soundtracks+Some Characters got their respective attention/They have good roles in the series.+Amazing Visual EffectsCons:-Bland Rushed and Unexplained Story-A lot of Skipped Informations-Not All characters got developed-Less Excitting Scenes"", 'This is one of the best animes that I have watched so far. Tho it\'s a supernatural action anime with strong female lead, it\'s also of ecchi and harem genre. Many says it\'s boob\'s show. Truthfully, I myself also couldn\'t handle that level of ecchi when I first watched it(as I was a newbie then). But TBH when I rewatched after 1 yr, it was completely fine and the inner meaning of the anime was awesomeeeeeeeee. ""Freezing"" is just like another anime where humans with supernatural powers fight against many supernatural beings. It doesn\'t have that deep message or sth. But when you think of...""freezing vibration"", there are so many emotions and thoughts that comes to your mind. Like sad moments, action moments, sacrifices, breakdowns, anticipations, fun...in short everything.The things that made me love freezing vibration so much are the deep meanings of this series and obv satellizer who is such a strong and badass character. Tho satellizer is strong, she has a dark past. And when you watch the anime, it naturally comes to your mind that how can a girl with such a dark past be so strong. I don\'t know about others but this thought encourages me to be strong no matter what.Then again it shows how cruel social circumstances can be. Because the series shows how just because of poverty e-pandoras risked their life.And at last it shows us that what almighty gives us is the best things we will ever get and if people try to overturn or copy nature it will only cause disasters and havoc which we can also relate to. If we think about all those disasters that are happening today, isn\'t these all the revenge of nature for what we have done to it?? That\'s exactly when the nature that is so good for us becomes the death of us. And that\'s exactly what is shown in freezing vibration by Amelia.So, how can an anime which depicts so many deep meanings be bad just bcuz it\'s ecchi?? Honestly, I too don\'t like ecchi and harem but trust me this anime is too deep to think about all those unnecessary things. And obv it\'s written on the genre that it\'s ecchi. So, a friendly reminder to all those people who can\'t take ecchi, please don\'t watch it and downrate it. IT\'S NOT A CRAPPY ANIME, JUST AN UNDERRATED ONE BECAUSE OF SOME PEOPLE WHO COULDN\'T UNDERSTAND THE INNER MEANING.

However, this is still meant to be a review of this season specifically. The comparisons are only there to illustrate and highlight some of the points I make.Also, I highly recommend to watch the first season before considering to watch this one.First off, the art and the music. They were pretty good, like in the first season, and did enhance the experience wherever possible. They're not really exceptional either.But the writing, oh dear... This series was confusing and tiresome to watch. Before...explaining, I'll talk about what made the first season good in my opinion.The first season, while being not the most profound or thought-provoking series, was fun and quite enjoyable. In essence, it's an action anime, blended with ecchi that is unsubtle but not overdone, with a rather intimate/romantic vibe. Next to that, it spent some time developing its characters, their background and even its lore to a degree, but subtly, and never becoming complicated or narrating. The show wasn't afraid to bring up some slightly darker themes, but those were never strong enough to throw off the tone either.This season's writers somehow manage to mess up to such a degree, that it takes every aspect I mentioned (action, ecchi, character dev, lore and dark themes), and throws them all into the blender with none of the refinement of the original, resulting in a confusing and painful mess.So many different aspects are overdone in such a way that you can tell even the writers were confused about what the focus was even supposed to be. The atmosphere is all around the place, going from almost fetish ecchi (on the verge of pornography), to torture and death (but no real gore luckily), to drama, to politics, to even low key biblical references (yes, seriously).I would guess that this season was mainly supposed to expand on the background of the first season as a military drama of sorts (with a religious undertone?) -at least, that's what I make out of all the major plot points.However, if that's the case, despite ecchi obviously not being highly compatible with the suffering and death that war brings, the writers still didn't want to/couldn't get rid of the ecchi element, which was obviously a defining aspect of the first season.And for some reason, here they decided to take the brakes off; where the first season's ecchi generally had a sort of passionate/intimate context, here it's rather raw, lusty and often fetishised (even the scenes referencing rape that occur seem almost fetishised). I can see that some people may enjoy this, but to me it's a major turnoff. And I don't understand why they thought throwing it in the same mix as torture and death themes was a good idea.This series is a mess. It has many contrasting themes going on at the same time. But where in the first season seemingly incompatible elements were cleverly balanced resulting in an all around enjoyable and unique experience, here they all end up pushing against each other and screaming for attention, making this series mentally and emotionally tiring to watch, and thought-provoking nor fun. explaining, I'll talk about what made the first season good in my opinion.The first season, while being not the most profound or thought-provoking series, was fun and quite enjoyable.

There music is brilliant! The storyline is still unexciting though.The number one complaint from critics is that boobs are present. Let me tell you something. There isn\'t a single moment boobs are present without being accompanied by action or emotional character thought/development. Therefore, no sacrifices are made to squeeze in fanservice like other series tend to do. That aside, the story here had potential. The problem is the students spend a ton of time fighting amongst themselves rather than directing their power to the true enemy. Because of this I...found myself feeling like I couldn\'t really root for the ""good guys"" due to them all being incredibly ignorant assholes. But they aren\'t just assholes. They are really savage about it and fuck each other up pretty bad. This really made the story suffer.If it weren\'t for the storyline flaw, this anime would be supreme. The art and lighting is incredible. They do a great job at creating a realistic atmosphere to pull you into their situations. The battles are extremely intense and brutal. The emotional experiences are much stronger than most series as well. You\'ll find yourself tearing up a lot. There is a good variety of characters, but some go underdeveloped so you don\'t appreciate them as much.

All in all, Freezing is an excellent anime.', ""tl;dr: For those that loved all of S1, this review may not be as helpful. For those that found S1 to have serious problems, this review may be more in tune with your perspective.Having just watched the first season of Freezing, I had high hopes for the second season, since the first ended much better than it started, and I was not disappointed at all. Gone were the socially awkward moments in S1 that had me pausing the video and facepalming. Gone was all the plot armor surrounding the MCs from S1. And gone was a big chunk of the poorly done, shameless Ecchi in...favor of some Ecchi related to the actual plot. S2 is a lot darker and grittier than S1, and although it's a bit less action packed in the beginning, it more than makes up for it in the end with a much wider variety of action than S1 had.First of all, the story. The premise of S1 was mere SoL at a magic university, while Vibration starts off with a mission-based premise. It felt much more natural and, though it had less physical conflict at first, the pacing was supremely better in the buildup to the end. This season also focused a bit on a secondary story involving Satellizer that was done fairly well. Both stories going on in Vibration are darker in nature, which was a welcome shift from the rather upbeat and overly happy children from S1. The weakpoint in both main stories going on would definitely be the endings. Endings are make-or-break for me, and I felt that, although they didn't break the story, they could have been done much better.The character developments in Vibrations were more varied than S1. Vibration focused on more characters than S1 did and, for the majority of the time, on characters that weren't the MCs. The female MC, Satellizer, still got a fair amount of development, but the Male MC, Aoi, got pretty much squat (he's a pretty boring guy anyways). Overall, I felt the characters to be more believable and making harder choices in this season than the first, especially the secondary characters. They seemed more like real people rather than plot-driven dolls.Normally, I do not comment on art or sound, but one episode in particular had some... curious design choices. That is all I will say.Overall, Freezing Vibration provides a much deeper and focused look into the problems plaguing the planet, and focuses more on difficult, meaningful decisions by the cast over the rather silly choices made in S1.  It takes the solid final half of S1 and builds upon it.P.S. My review may seem a little, perplexing, to some. I feel this may be because the story of the first half of S1 was not to my liking, and most people that would have liked it, may not like the premise of Vibration as much. For those that found all of S1 to be enjoyable, including the SoL at the beginning, the darker tone that Vibration sets right from the beginning will not be as appealing. It's a shame because I feel there are many people who would enjoy Vibration that were completely turned off to the show by S1. favor of some Ecchi related to the actual plot.

The reason for this is that some necessary background to make this anime enjoyable is omitted and can only be found in the manhwa. Another failing point of the anime is that it doesn't have the same pacing  or character development that the manhwa does, it feels less plot driven than it's source material. That being said, apart from the content added for the anime version the plot is astoundingly high quality for this genre, the CGI is well done and...the anime sticks very close to the manhwa. A few notes on how to make this a more enjoyable experience:* skip the extra fanservice added by the anime it feels forced and makes things less enjoyable.* read the manhwa first, specifically vol. 7 - 14 which this season covers, this anime can be a bit fast paced and confusing otherwise. the anime sticks very close to the manhwa.

Militaries around the world came up with a plan to fight back against the NOVA. The Military in each country has an acadamy for men & women who attend the acadamy to hoan thier skills & become stronger to fight against the NOVA. The women who attend this school are known a Pandoras, a rare being capable of skills to bring a...NOVA to its knees to protect humanity. Though Pandoras are powerful, they would be nothing without the aid of their Limiters. The NOVAs are capable to cast a field to FREEZE their attackers in place & also making them supceptible to an attack from the NOVA itself. To counter this, the Pandoras have male partners known as Limiters, the abilites of a Limiter is the same as a NOVA, they are able to cast a field freezing anything in its range. But this ability is normally used to counter a NOVAs freezing to give the Pandora a chance to strike at the NOVA.Yes, this anime is a ecchie & a harem, but the PLOT only seems to revolve around a single male. Normally, that\'s what a harem is, but in this anime the girls who want to become more then friends are 2 girls with occasional attention from other girls around the school. I\'ll get into detail in my breakdown review. At any rate this show is anything but bad, it\'s a interesting & enjoyable watch to those who are ecchie & harem fans. If you can\'t take nip slips & there I advise not to watch it.

But through self realization he breaks free from her shadow & becomes his own person.-Satellizer el Bridget- A powerful Pandora who is known as the ""untouchable Queen"" who does not rely on anybody but herself & rather die then admit defeat to anyone & refuses to have a Limiter. Ironic as it may seem she reluctantly meets Kazyuya. Very mean & resiliant at first to Kazyuya she evenually warms up to him slowly.-Rana Linchen- A transfer student from a an old world country & who is not aware of certain terms amongst average Pandoras.

By chance she meets Kazyuya & falls head over heals for him & is convinced that Kazyuya belongs to her NOT Saterllizer, thus forcing Kazyuya into a love triangle.[9]ENJOYMENT: The show is not a bad watch, with the fan service it actually makes the show even better.[9]OVERALL: Freezing overall is show worthy of praise for its originality & worth watching if you\'re really into ecchie & harem with a side of action packed fights.To those looking for another ecchie & harem I recommend this show you will not be disappointed.Enjoy =) NOVA to its knees to protect humanity. Though Pandoras are powerful, they would be nothing without the aid of their Limiters. The NOVAs are capable to cast a field to FREEZE their attackers in place & also making them supceptible to an attack from the NOVA itself. To counter this, the Pandoras have male partners known as Limiters, the abilites of a Limiter is the same as a NOVA, they are able to cast a field freezing anything in its range. But this ability is normally used to counter a NOVAs freezing to give the Pandora a chance to strike at the NOVA.Yes, this anime is a ecchie & a harem, but the PLOT only seems to revolve around a single male. Normally, that\'s what a harem is, but in this anime the girls who want to become more then friends are 2 girls with occasional attention from other girls around the school. I\'ll get into detail in my breakdown review. At any rate this show is anything but bad, it\'s a interesting & enjoyable watch to those who are ecchie & harem fans. If you can\'t take nip slips & there I advise not to watch it.

Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana, Chiffon, and Beth return; meeting other Pandoraii, getting involved with the mysterious ""E-Pandora Project,"" and (for Satellizer) dealing with a re-opened wound that is her half-brother.Fans of the manga version may not like the switches and changed within the anime, but everyone else who\'d been watching this anime should be glad: The upskirt panty shots, nudity, gore, and useful male leads return as if they\'ve never left. What you get more of is the ""Sis-Fist"" and the psychological suffering. ', ""Its hard to rate with numbers, considering the fact that the reason i don't like the second season of freezing is because is totally goes against all the good vibes (no pun intended) i got from the first season. Without spoiling anything, I feel that the second season is not only weird in itself, but it also ruins the first season, and therefore I would recommend just watching the first season, and leaving the rest to imagination.I also found the ecchi to be totally irrelevant to the plot, which I don't like, because when ecchi is irrelevant, all it serves is to take away from...the seriousness of the situation, such as an important conversation in between two characters, where you can't focus on the conversation, because the camera is focused on the characters breasts. If you watch ecchi just for good boobies, then this is the anime for you, but if you want good plot, I would recommend sticking to the first season. the seriousness of the situation, such as an important conversation in between two characters, where you can't focus on the conversation, because the camera is focused on the characters breasts.

In all reality it seems more focused on fan service in the fact that it\'s showing the abilities of everyone in more detail than in the first series.But on that note, I\'ll say this has been my one problem overall with the series: Too much unnecessary nudity. It\'s like the writers thought the only way to draw in was by showing girls in a state of undress. No exceptions, every single episode had girls ""conveniently"" getting their clothes cut in a way that showed off their breasts. If it wasn\'t in...a fight, there was always a guaranteed ""water"" scene where someone was either naked in a shower or in a swimming pool with a slow pan up from their stomachs.I\'m not usually a stickler for these types of things considering the perv I normally am, but how often it happened and for no reason was just ridiculous to the point of making the show less enjoyable. a fight, there was always a guaranteed ""water"" scene where someone was either naked in a shower or in a swimming pool with a slow pan up from their stomachs.I\'m not usually a stickler for these types of things considering the perv I normally am, but how often it happened and for no reason was just ridiculous to the point of making the show less enjoyable.', ""Coming back to this anime after I left it years back.

So instead of the survival of humanity of Nova attacking humanity, we have a artificial vs.natural in the form of discrimination towards the newly shown plotline of E-Pandora, artificial Pandora using ordinary girls to the naturally-battle ready Pandora\'s. So before LA delves into this ""agenda""...that Vibration has, LA will get into the typical basics.In terms of characters, we have a new line of characters, from the international Pandora\'s and their Limiters to the new cast of E-Pandora\'s, essentially the cast has DOUBLED but omitted some of the characters from the first season such as Ganessa. As for character focuses, we do get some insight to some of the characters that were hinted at the first season such as Chiffon and Elizabeth Mably voiced by Sayaka Ohara, as for the new cast of E-Pandora characters, well the centralized focus is on these new E-Pandora\'s, most notably Amelia Evans voiced by Suzuko Mimori. Oddly enough Satellizer and Kazuya doesn\'t get much of a focus until the halfway mark, however that is ""slightly"" compensated with an in-depth look at Satellizer\'s past which will for LA will immediately bring up Satellizer\'s younger step-brother Louis el Bridget, if there was a lack of execution or payoff for even looking into Satellizer\'s past with Louis involved, well the biggest problem with developing Satellizer\'s past is that Louis in reality didn\'t get the comeuppance he deserved to all he did to Satellizer in the past AS WELL AS during the events of Vibration, LA already loathed Louis as a character from the first season (in fact LA hated this character more than the main villain of Vibration), the payoff to this just wasn\'t handled properly. As much as the characters and their development are scattered and LA has overall mixed feelings to the new and old characters. If you want to know whether Satellizer is STILL LA\'s favourite character, she is, however as for the minor character cast, well LA\'s favourite minor character is STILL Chiffon, however Cathy Lockharte voiced by Rie Kugimiya can easily be LA\'s second favourite from the minor cast...and no it\'s not because of Rie Kugimiya.In terms of animation done once again by A.C.G.T, well it\'s overall decent like the first season but LA felt that it kinda lacked in the battle department with some stiff and awkward battle movements here and there, still Vibration still has the same color palette it had in the first still briniging in that dark tone and mood it needs for this season.The fanservice however takes a big dip in levels as Vibration gets serious with it\'s agenda and really due to this agenda, most of the fanservice and ripped clothing is hardly noticeably, let alone LA cares about it. However the biggest offender of the fanservice is the shameless fanservice girl of Elizabeth Mably essentially her walking in the nude is the highest level of fanservice Vibration ever gets.Now onto the ""difference of agenda"" LA said at the beginning of this review, well Vibration overall has lowered their stakes in the plot for a more focus on artificiality vs. natural while taking on abused human experimentation for a ""ambitious mad scientist human villain"" -sigh- see what LA means by lowering the stakes, sure Vibration is multi-faceted with it\'s new agenda but ultimately towards the overall impact on this plot, it doesn\'t do much for LA to care about the plot when the villain is a scummy human villain instead of ohh LA doesn\'t know the already powerfully insane Nova\'s, made worse by Satellizer\'s failed execution of her past (though her character development along with Kazuya gets better) and made even worse is that Kazuya becomes utterly one-note as a supporting character to Satellizer. As much as LA is bashing Vibration LA will say that at the VERY least the new agenda Vibration took with it\'s multi-faceted messages doesn\'t ring hollow as it\'s centralized focus on this does make it engaging even if the payoff is horrible, also the new cast of characters of E-Pandora\'s and the international Pandoras are welcome additions to Freezing.The ending if anything gave the focus from Satellizer to Chiffon Fairchild and to be honest it was kinda baffling where this ending led to, yes it actually lead to an actual death compensated with a few ""deaths but not"" by the end of it. Now LA really thought that this ending was a clusterfuck of themes and ideas put together with some plotlines that still become unexplained by the end of Vibration, however for a clusterfuck, LA didn\'t mind this ending, sure it has lots of loose plot threads (like the obvious, what the hell are the Nova\'s!?!??!?!) that ""might"" hint to another season but how batshit insane it went to the central focus of the Nova, LA didn\'t mind it as it had a similar ending to the first season.Freezing Vibration, with it\'s negatives and positives, all LA can say about Vibration is that, it\'s not THAT bad a sequel to Freezing, however LA would say that if you want higher stakes in Freezing just stick to the first season, if you wanted a different agenda to Freezing and like the new cast of characters, then Vibration will scratch that itch, for LA however Vibration is ""decent"" but can\'t stand up to it\'s first season as the negatives ""just"" outweighed the positives for LA. that Vibration has, LA will get into the typical basics.In terms of characters, we have a new line of characters, from the international Pandora\'s and their Limiters to the new cast of E-Pandora\'s, essentially the cast has DOUBLED but omitted some of the characters from the first season such as Ganessa.

If you want to know whether Satellizer is STILL LA\'s favourite character, she is, however as for the minor character cast, well LA\'s favourite minor character is STILL Chiffon, however Cathy Lockharte voiced by Rie Kugimiya can easily be LA\'s second favourite from the minor cast...and no it\'s not because of Rie Kugimiya.In terms of animation done once again by A.C.G.T, well it\'s overall decent like the first season but LA felt that it kinda lacked in the battle department with some stiff and awkward battle movements here and there, still Vibration still has the same color palette it had in the first still briniging in that dark tone and mood it needs for this season.The fanservice however takes a big dip in levels as Vibration gets serious with it\'s agenda and really due to this agenda, most of the fanservice and ripped clothing is hardly noticeably, let alone LA cares about it. However the biggest offender of the fanservice is the shameless fanservice girl of Elizabeth Mably essentially her walking in the nude is the highest level of fanservice Vibration ever gets.Now onto the ""difference of agenda"" LA said at the beginning of this review, well Vibration overall has lowered their stakes in the plot for a more focus on artificiality vs. natural while taking on abused human experimentation for a ""ambitious mad scientist human villain"" -sigh- see what LA means by lowering the stakes, sure Vibration is multi-faceted with it\'s new agenda but ultimately towards the overall impact on this plot, it doesn\'t do much for LA to care about the plot when the villain is a scummy human villain instead of ohh LA doesn\'t know the already powerfully insane Nova\'s, made worse by Satellizer\'s failed execution of her past (though her character development along with Kazuya gets better) and made even worse is that Kazuya becomes utterly one-note as a supporting character to Satellizer. As much as LA is bashing Vibration LA will say that at the VERY least the new agenda Vibration took with it\'s multi-faceted messages doesn\'t ring hollow as it\'s centralized focus on this does make it engaging even if the payoff is horrible, also the new cast of characters of E-Pandora\'s and the international Pandoras are welcome additions to Freezing.The ending if anything gave the focus from Satellizer to Chiffon Fairchild and to be honest it was kinda baffling where this ending led to, yes it actually lead to an actual death compensated with a few ""deaths but not"" by the end of it. Now LA really thought that this ending was a clusterfuck of themes and ideas put together with some plotlines that still become unexplained by the end of Vibration, however for a clusterfuck, LA didn\'t mind this ending, sure it has lots of loose plot threads (like the obvious, what the hell are the Nova\'s!?!??!?!) that ""might"" hint to another season but how batshit insane it went to the central focus of the Nova, LA didn\'t mind it as it had a similar ending to the first season.Freezing Vibration, with it\'s negatives and positives, all LA can say about Vibration is that, it\'s not THAT bad a sequel to Freezing, however LA would say that if you want higher stakes in Freezing just stick to the first season, if you wanted a different agenda to Freezing and like the new cast of characters, then Vibration will scratch that itch, for LA however Vibration is ""decent"" but can\'t stand up to it\'s first season as the negatives ""just"" outweighed the positives for LA.']"
Grimm Douwa: Kin no Tori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3760/Grimm_Douwa__Kin_no_Tori,"[""Kin no Tori is an animated adaptation of a classic fairy tale that was clearly meant to air for years on end via public-access TV, to the delight of children everywhere. Its visual inventiveness and zest for life shine through every colorful character design and gorgeous piece of scenery; much of it recalls the pastoral worlds that early Miyazaki was so fond of, such as on Future Boy Conan, Heidi, and Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro. The atmosphere of a playful, dreamlike fantasy is absolutely fulfilled. Beyond its visual delights, it's a simple story by design, told without much fuss and leading to an exciting...climax. Aside from a comically over-the-top and somewhat outdated musical number by the main villain (which is very funny nonetheless), I found myself thoroughly enjoying Kin no Tori. climax.

I mean, sometimes there were intriguing elements; a few grotesqueries that are almost always removed from the adaptations, as most of them are intended for children; these stories were pretty much skeletons for artists to add meat and flesh to, yet the telling is almost always too faithful. Artists are all too happy to just dress the skeleton up in a suit, paint its face and put on a clown nose, parade it around town, chuck it in the cellar closet once everyone gets bored, then call it a day!This adaptation compresses The...Golden Bird story in a way that's serviceable, kidifies it, and most of the story changes are for the better, though largely irrelevant and not worth recounting.One of the bigger referents for the art direction might have been the old Disney fairy tales—primarily some of the art of Eyvind Earle for Sleeping Beauty... otherwise, old fantasy and fairy tale artwork from the likes of John Bauer or Kay Nielsen.Shelved until 1984, finally being released in 1987, and, eh... I can kind of see why they weren't overly eager about releasing this, but at the same time it's solid enough and has worthwhile enough contributions to deserve being seen—it's just there's a constant issue of mismatch and mediocrity.After the opening cut of a bright glowing bird and abstract animation, followed with an atmospheric scene of a mist-cloaked tree, appropriately depicted using mystical tones for the music, my interest was piqued, but then we have scraggly cartoon characters running around flat fantasy art—some of which is very good... other times the characters and background art are simply too mismatched to maintain immersion.It's not altogether bad. I'm sure kids would enjoy it. Lulu, the fox, is a fun character, the cats are good henchmen, even the bird is charismatic as a drunkard, there's decent character animation for the childish character art, and the animation is often solid, though I wouldn't say there's much in terms of the style that makes it a must watch, though with a few exceptions...The battle scene with the tin knights is more rousing than most of what precedes it, even if the guitar music is poorly chosen at the end, and the flow continues when the massive tin knight chases the heroes, but the only scene that was truly phenomenal was Atsuko Fukushima's key animation for the boy and girl riding on the golden horse. The whimsical yet technically meticulous animation, the sense of perspective, the color and lighting, and really everything about the scene is a great example of the power of animation. I'd say it's worth watching for that reason alone, but you'd be better served checking the choice bits on Sakugabooru or YouTube. Almost everything that I really liked was on the former.Most of the best parts are from Fukushima, and the witch gets some of the very best scenes in general, including the psychedelic segments of the pointless musical interlude. One other standout scene is the cutesy moment when the kids ride the horse through the sky.I really have to say that musical numbers are one of the great sins one can commit in art. The first song was bad, but at least it had quirky animation and was edited well. You can see the budget tank on the second musical bit when the boy meets the princess and falls in love. They are literally stills we're presented with.

Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/266/Gunparade_March__Arata_Naru_Kougunka,"[""::QUICK REVIEW::Story: 6 (Great action horrible drama)Art: 7 (Most of the money went into the mech battles)Sound: 4 (without the mecha, this would have been a zero)Character: 3 (Never seen such a large group i could care less)Enjoyment: 5 (it was both fun and agonizing at the same time)Overall: 25/50 = 5.0 (watch this as one of your last resorts)::FULL REVIEW::Don't be fooled by the cool mecha action you get from episode one. Thats just there to draw you in to the story. As you keep watching, you will come to realize it's all a ploy. A ploy to lure you into a romantic comedy...between two members of the military.  It was a HUGE disappointment too. When the action was there it was just awesome. From the animation, to the monsters, to the action, and right down to the military chatter (dub of course) it was fast, fierce, and fantastic. Unfortunately those parts only took up of about 15% of the series. The romance and drama though was a bit iffy relying on the &quot;will they ever confess&quot; formula. If you enjoy that style of drama then give it a try. But people like me aren't real fans of that style. Don't get me wrong the drama wasn't horrible, but it was 'mediocre' (5/10) at best.The production value was also a mixed bag as well. Considering its basically 2 different anime. On the warfare standpoint, I really appreciate all the detail and fluidity that they put into the mech battles. The sound effects were great in 5.1 and mix it in with some good old fashioned military chatter in proper English, I was on an action high when it ever came on. But on the drama/comedy/romance side of things it was just mediocre. They all wore the same outfits about 90% of the time. Of course they were all kids 18 or under so some loli tendencies were obvious. They tried to do some fanservice but it was really poor. And the voice acting was forgettable from both sides of ocean (English/Japanese dub). For the most part i just kept it in English during the battles and i kept it in Japanese during the drama.The character themselves were pretty forgettable considering the voices were forgettable and their chemistry between each other really wasn't there. Even the two main characters didn't feel like they were playing their roles quite well. It's hard to explain but the only way I can say it is that tsundere didnt feel like a tsundere and the shy type felt more like a mumbling loser just repeating the same thing over through 12 episodes.If you love mecha and you have absolutely no other mecha anime to watch I'd give this a try. Or if you like anime that sound like they're accomplishing one thing but in reality, its cover to tell a different less intriguing story give this a shot too. Other than that leave it alone. between two members of the military.  It was a HUGE disappointment too. When the action was there it was just awesome.

Gunaparde takes place in a alternate future when after the end of WWII in 1945 a alien race appears on the earth and begins to kill of humans.  Fast forward 54 years to 1999 humans are still fighting.  The story takes place in Japan one of the last remaining strongholds on the planet.  The story focuses on the 5121st Platoon who are made up mainly of young teenagers who were drafted.The characters were great adding life and emotion to the anime.  I personally...liked the two main characters, Atsushi Hayami and Mai Shibamura the best.  They helped the anime become great.The animation and sound was very good but not great.  I didn't like the design of the mecha in the anime, but it really didn't bother me much.  The music was had some flaws but was still very good.The biggest problem I had overall with Gunaparad March was the length of the anime.  It was only 12 episodes long.  I think it could have gone on for a lot longer.  The story was broad and could have gone on a lot longer.  I would have love to see the story taken to other parts of the world along with the great characters.  Still it really doesn't take much away from the anime, it's still great and worth watching. liked the two main characters, Atsushi Hayami and Mai Shibamura the best.

It's not something explainable, just watch it and you'll understand.This series does have all sorts of anime cliches and the ending is visible from miles away, but it is still quite interesting to learn about who the characters are, witness their development(though very minor)and slowly understand how exactly the world got to what it is in the series-how...theI kinda make it sound dull, but it isn't. The series is filled with comedy in all the right places, there is decent action throughout the 12 episodes and (almost) nothing feels out of placeto sum up - what makes this anime special is the storyline that doesn't leave many holes open and the unique atmosphere it delivers. if you love mecha, love post apocalyptic wolds and don't hate the &quot;friendship crap&quot;, this is a must watch. theI kinda make it sound dull, but it isn't.

For example, the characters may be rehearsing for a play one second, but a siren goes off and a voice says ""Unit 5121 prepare for battle"" then we see the characters getting in their giant robot suits to fight the aliens. What if an anime like Toradora did this? It\'s like the anime goes from being this slice of life anime to an action scifi anime at a moments notice.However, what makes it worse is that it fails at both being a slice of life anime...and a scifi action anime. To tell a good slice of life story requires strong characters, but these character are all dull with nothing interesting to say about them. This anime also fails as an action scifi story because literally every fight the characters have with the aliens is the same. The characters kill a couple of aliens, jam a bomb in the head of the ""brain"" alien, retreat, detonate the bomb, and the missions over. It\'s cool the first time, but the not the 12th time.Also, can someone explain why the aliens pop like balloons after being shot once?Sound 1/10First, the music.For an anime about teenage soldiers fighting in a war against alien monsters this anime has a very upbeat and positive opening which really doesn\'t introduce the show well. Furthermore, for some reason, whenever the characters are doing normal school stuff military marching music plays. Why?Second, the voice acting.The voice acting for this anime\'s English dub is awful. The VA\'s put so little emotion into their voices; it\'s so robotic that it almost sounds like the animators just used some text-to-speech program to voice the characters. Also, there are some characters like Mai who yell everything they say and others like Hayami that have this super annoying stutter.Characters 3/10All of these characters, with the exception of Mai who is the only character that goes through any kind of development, all feel like tokens with nothing memorable or likeable about them.Takayuki is the ladies man who flirts with every girl he sees.Matsuri loves money and is always trying to make a quick buck.Tadataka is the level-headed leader.Mio is clumsy.Nonomi is cute.The real tragedy is I feel like all these characters have the potential to be great, but none of the them get fleshed out enough or get enough focus.Overall 3/10Another anime that Gunparade reminds me of is Gundam Wing. Both anime are about teenagers fighting in a war and both have giant robots. However, what makes Gundam Wing superior is it doesn\'t just depict being a soldier as some part-time job you do after school, it shows that people aren\'t exaggerating when they say war is Hell. The life or death uncertainty of a battle field, the physical and psychological trauma it can cause, and even the gray area of morality that soldiers operate in. Gunparade is like ""Hurry guys, let\'s finish our mission so I can be on time for my date.""If Gunparade was less serious like Girls & Panzer or more campy like a magical girl anime then I could understand, but because this anime goes from being super serious to being not serious at all so suddenly and it fails at both being a slice of life anime and a scifi action anime I\'m giving it a 3 out of 10. and a scifi action anime.

Most people are going to be looking more for one or the other, and will be annoyed at this genre fusion. I found myself actually enjoying this blend, for the most part I felt like the two sides helped each other more than hurt, though I did find that the second half appeared to pick a side much more than the first.This is an anime from 2003 so don’t expect much from the visuals, they were good enough but that’s about it. I liked all of the characters enough, with...Mai as a high point and Hayami as the weak point. The world is also interesting and I hope to find Gunparade Orchestra does more with it. This is a nice 6/10 slice of life show with some character and a mecha twist. Avoid if you don’t do romance. Mai as a high point and Hayami as the weak point.

So I fire it up and...wait, where's the meccha stuff??Yeah, that's what I was thinking the whole time.  We get a little exposition at the beginning about this unknown creature invasion that took over most of the world back in World War II, and then...it becomes a background story.  To a high school slice of life...  Huh.Maybe they planned to do something more with this, and the twelve episodes we have are just a wind up, but it never happened....So we have this untapped potential mecha show that instead focuses on a group of teen pilots, and a third grader for...reasons (?) but most of them have little to no substance or background.  They're just there.The art style is bright and polished, but there's not anything to show it off.  The music has some nice tracks but not much play time when it's all said and done.  Gunparade March isn't a bad show, it's just an incomplete show.  So much goes unexplained.  It needed to focus more on the combat sorties and this rampaging foreign species and flesh out the cast.If you do fan fiction, give this a shot.  It's basically a clean slate.

Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13161/Hagure_Yuusha_no_Aesthetica,"['How refreshing. After slapping the Demon King\'s shit around and stealing his daughter, our beloved hero Akatsuki returns from fantasy-land as an overpowered motherfucker. He rides lightning-charged motorcycles, gets bitches, makes em\' piss, and crushes others using only his testosterone. A refreshing character and premise indeed, but does refreshing exempt the rest of the show from being mediocre?Story\'Tis a rare thing, my Pappy once said, to find a show with enough courage to stray from your average cut and paste framework. So the protagonist goes in and comes out with the belligerent demon armies dry humping the ground he walks on... then what? We see...that protagonist use his new found badassery to engage in shennanigans like putting assholes in their place, or stealing girls underwear? Sign me the fuck up. And while this is surely present in Hagure, behind the scenes there stirs a new disturbance just begging the hero to be brought back into the whole ""We are the secret organization. You don\'t even meet our standards. Wahahaha."" trope. ""But Selsica!"" You argue ""It didn\'t reach that point in the anime, and we\'ll probably never get a second season!"" Ahhh how right you are, but that brings up another point. Good stories have an ending, a conclusion that ties together the relationships, plot, and ultimately, the world of the series, leaving you with a feeling of bubbling warmth. Not the kind of bubbling warmth you find after eating a week old bean burrito either. In conclusion, interesting premise, bad execution.ArtGood character designs make shows more enjoyable. Beautiful animation makes shows more enjoyable. This is a fact. Akatsuki looks buff, powerful, and ready to rip a dinosaur in half and piss on its face. But then, so do the girls (minus a loli). I loved the damn show, but it could have been much nicer to watch. Anime is a visual medium, so love should be put into making the visuals decent. Oh, and this show has ecchi up the ass. I can see the studio in their planning stage: ""How much of this shit can we put in before it\'s considered a hentai?"" ""Well son, we\'ll cross that bridge when it comes.""SoundFitting, yet unmemorable.CharactersFirst, the obvious reason to watch the show. Akatsuki. A good protagonist drives the plot, he is not swept along by it. And Akatsuki drives the plot through motherfucking 6-inch walls of steel. However, good protagonists are also developed, which is a tad hard to do when the development stage of the story is confined to past-tense conversations between the fantasy worlds denizens. That aside, Akatsuki has been one of the better protagonists this season. In fact he\'s SO powerful you can\'t help but feel the enemies aren\'t really much of a challenge, or in his friends case, much help. He overshadows the others by a large margin, adding some predictability to the show.TL;DR... Uhhh, I mean OverallDespite my criticisms, I enjoyed Hagure Yuusha immensely. You like a good ol\' fashioned shonen? Pick this up. Your hand feelin\' a little antsy after that break up? Pick this up. You tired of pussy MC\'s? Pick this show right the hell up, because alphas are a rare commodity nowadays. The show is decent for what it is, but it isn\'t going to go breaking any records any time soon. that protagonist use his new found badassery to engage in shennanigans like putting assholes in their place, or stealing girls underwear?

However, good protagonists are also developed, which is a tad hard to do when the development stage of the story is confined to past-tense conversations between the fantasy worlds denizens. That aside, Akatsuki has been one of the better protagonists this season. In fact he\'s SO powerful you can\'t help but feel the enemies aren\'t really much of a challenge, or in his friends case, much help. He overshadows the others by a large margin, adding some predictability to the show.TL;DR... Uhhh, I mean OverallDespite my criticisms, I enjoyed Hagure Yuusha immensely. You like a good ol\' fashioned shonen? Pick this up. Your hand feelin\' a little antsy after that break up? Pick this up. You tired of pussy MC\'s? Pick this show right the hell up, because alphas are a rare commodity nowadays. The show is decent for what it is, but it isn\'t going to go breaking any records any time soon.', ""Have you gotten pissed at those wimpy leads that always hesitate before doing anything?Have you gotten annoyed at the fricken insane power ups and power of friendship crap?If the answer is yes, this anime is the perfect break for you.Story-9There hasn't been much of a storyline yet except there is foreshadowing for great things to come.Art-8It's ok.

What more can you ask for? 10/10Enjoyment: had some good faps, saw some tits and lesbian scenes, OBVIOUSLY I ENJOYED!!10/10Overall: Good appetizer before i go watch some real porn/hentai. 10/10------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I think it was quite obvious that everything I wrote above were just jokes, or is it? Hagure Yuusha no Estetica seemed like a very promising anime when I first saw it. Now that i’ve watched it though, i’ll have to say that judging...a book by its cover is a very fitting saying as to what this anime is. I was utterly disappointed as to what is has become, as it had a great concept and could’ve been a good anime. But what exactly went wrong?Story: This is the biggest fault of the anime. I remember when I first read the description of this anime from a website. It says that “Hero defeats bad guy. Good triumphs over evil. The end. Or, at least that's how it usually goes. But what happens after the hero goes home? Our hero, Ohtorizawa Akatsuki, is about to find out that sometimes the greatest adventure starts once happily ever after ends.”. Now, with a description like that, I couldn’t help but be curious. At first, I thought that this could probably be the setting of a good comedy, or maybe he hasn’t really defeated the demon king and that this would become a good shounen anime. After I watched the first few episodes though, I realised that I was completely wrong. While I was watching the first episode, the first thing that hit me was “what in the world is this guy doing, stealing panties and stuff?”. Of course, I was ok with that, as i’ve seen a lot of anime with those kind of stuff. Then somewhere in the middle of that episode, some girl with huge, uncensored tits suddenly appears out of nowhere. Of course, I also wasn’t fazed by this, as I thought that “ok, i’ve seen this somewhere before. Ranma ½ did some titty flashes too but it turned out as a good anime.”. But as i got deeper into this anime, I realized one thing. THIS IS NEITHER A COMEDY NOR A SHOUNEN ANIME, IT’S A DAMN ECCHI ANIME! Ok, so it is an ecchi anime, i’ve watched some ecchi animes, but this one is just terrible. It has an absolutely terrible plot, or it doesn’t have an actual plot, for that matter. It seems that whoever made this anime just makes a couple of scenarios that will lead into either the main character grabbing and flashing some tits and stealing underwear. Action, which was supposed to be its main theme, was just used as an excuse to make the female characters wear skimpy outfits and FUCKING BIKINI ARMOR. In other words, instead of using its potential to become a great anime, it just resorted to fanservice and tits to hook its viewers. Although it does have an actual plot, which is that some secret organization is planning to do nasty stuff with the main character right in the middle of it, it just becomes second priority for the people who made this crap, as it seems that they try to add ecchi even in the most serious scenes. I mean seriously, so the lead main character got poisoned and is losing body heat. Sounds like a serious situation? Well, what does female lead character do? SHE STRIPS AND HUGS THE MAIN LEAD CHARACTERS, THAT’S WHAT! So yeah, in conclusion, I would give this anime a 3/10 for the story for reasons that I should have explained clearly above.Animation and sound: The only good thing about this anime. The animation was smooth and clean, the mouth syncs properly with the voice and the OP and the background music was good enough, although nothing special. This is the only criteria that I could give a 7/10, as it is neither fantastic nor mediocre.Characters: I don’t think that there is a need to even discuss this. The characters are just about as interesting as a potato, or a rock as not make it sound so degrading for the potatoes. They are just pathetic excuses for the makers of this anime to make ecchi scenes. I mean, every girl in this series have like F-cup boobs, with the exception of one Loli. Heck, they even made a background story for the main character, that he was trained in things like finding and fitting the right size of bras for concubines. Since there really isn’t much to discuss about this criteria anymore than what is mentioned above, I would just give it a 2/10 and get it over with.Enjoyment: Unlike my joke review, no, I didn’t enjoy this anime. There is no story to enjoy, characters are very boring, and it is an utter waste of time. I give it a 1/10.Overall: Very rarely do I give a score below 6 to any anime, but this anime doesn’t deserve anything higher than a 3, so I would give it a 2/10 for being a complete waste of my time.If you have read the entire review and are not mentally retarded, then please don’t watch this anime as it is a complete waste of time unless you have some other plans. :ifyouknowwhatimean: DAMMIT, I WANT 240 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK!Thank you very, very much for reading this review.

Anyway, thanks for bearing with me and reading my entire review :))"", ""Hagure Yuusha no Estetica, or The Aesthetics of Gary Stu as it's pronounced in English is anything but good.We are introduced to a main character that for once, isn't your stereotypical shy guy and has the balls to back up what ever is thrown at him. That may start off as promising, but it loses its charm by the 2nd episode. When a character is overpowered at introduction, there's not much direction you can lead the story. So where does the series head to? Tits. I'm starting to think the anime industry's answer to budget restraints is always going to lead straight to female breasts,...as it sure ain't going to the script writers.Hagure starts off where most stories end. Hero beats demon king, goes home and everyone lives happily ever after. Well it's supposed to. What the series entails is of what happens after all that's been done with supposed hero. To be honest with you, my first impressions episode 1 was a sign of promise as it's rarely told through anime or any forms of medium that I know of(bar sequels), yet unfortunately it fails miserably as each episode goes by.We are derailed from the minimal plot the series offers and instead are provided with 75% of the anime showing how awesome the main character is supposed to be(and I say this derogatively), and the remainder of  each and every episode on how the heroine is shy about her breast(whilst having little clothing on). They 'try' to show some character development with the supporting cast, but it never comes to fruition due to the MC upstaging each and every one of them whenever he gets a chance to.The art and animation for the series is mediocre and the music feels like something from a cheap JRPG.All in all, Hagure is a time waster and is best viewed when you really are left with nothing better to watch or plainly just bored. It does not need you to put your thinking caps on and if anything, would be best served as fodder for AMV enthusiasts. as it sure ain't going to the script writers.Hagure starts off where most stories end.

I find myself to be more of an ass man. Hagure Yuusha no Estetica had both however.I can't say I had high expectations for Hagure Yuusha no Estetica, it really falls flat on its face plot wise like most other series' in the ecchi genre. It was plagued by an abundance of fast selling nudity fan service.I have to admit the exposition got off to a fast start. The concept of people crossing different dimensions and learning skills from other worlds isn't a new one.  The cast centers around a school specifically made for...them to flex their abilities from the other worlds, essentially they are further trained to be soldiers for different governments. The school has a caste system based solely on their different abilities and they are placed accordingly, A-class being the highest. The plot was pretty much what you would expect from a school setting: character interaction, a beach episode and a little this and that. Rushing an opening like throwing a couple of kids into this type of school probably wasn't the best move. Opening the audience up to additional information about their alternate dimensions would have been insightful.  However, I feel with no real conflict resolution this opened up for more seasons.I found the plot itself to be boring after the first couple episodes. It wasn't that it was bad it was just predictable.A majority of the characters had a fast introduction and the plot got off with a fast start. Miu and Akatsuki are immediately placed into B-class, with a promise of advancement to A-class. But bone heads will be bone heads and Akatsuki tried to pick fights with everyone in sight. He manages to offend almost every person he comes in contact with. He sets his sights on beating the student council and everything builds up around this concept. In the other world they plot on killing Miu to suppress her people and that takes up the last few episodes. In the end good guy wins and bad guy losses. Like I said before, it was just too typical and it ended up being boring. More focus could have been given on a Akatsuki and student council relationship rather than miix in cross world plots.To me a majority of the characters were duds, most of the episodes were centered around Akatsuki the macho main who isn't afraid of copping a feel.I didn't find myself liking any of the characters, the only notable one would most likely be Akatsuki. I would categorize this under harems and like most harems the female leads have an array of different personalities. Its a simple character formula so it doesn't stand out. You have a macho lead surrounded by bishoujo or pretty girls and he slowly wins over their hearts one by one. Aside from his unique talents and over the top mental and physical prowess he is a standard lead, so its fair but not exciting. Simply put, too much attention was given to him.I felt the studio tried to animate the battles but they seemed to focus more on the fan-service and this derailed the series for the most part. The sound effects for some of the spells being cast and battles didn't feel like they fit either. You probably found yourself drooling over Miu or some other chunky breasted girl. The studio did a fair job at character animations and scene settings. I don't really have much to say about much of either the scores or animation.This killed some time but ultimately it just wasn't good enough. them to flex their abilities from the other worlds, essentially they are further trained to be soldiers for different governments.

Well, Studio Arms (Elfen Lied) attempted to tackle this very question with their 2012 adaptation of the light novel, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero. With a rather unique premise as a backbone, I was very curious to see what this series was about. Unfortunately, what followed was a lewd, generic insult to anime fans everywhere, with more breast development than character development. Join me as I chart the fanservice waters and explore one of the worst anime I’ve seen to date.The story...sounds promising from the start. It begins with our conceited, overpowered protagonist Akatsuki leaving a foreign land to which he was summoned to defeat an evil Dark Lord. Instead of taking home a trinket as a souvenir for his efforts, he decides to go a few steps further and kidnap the vanquished Lord’s daughter as his own personal “consolation prize” (first indicator that this dude’s probably an arrogant prick). Once they return to Earth, he and Miu are “forced” to join BABEL, a school focused on extracting and enhancing the skills Akatsuki and others learned during their time in the foreign land of Alayzard.Now I’ve never really delved into the ecchi genre, so I figured Aesthetica would be a decent place to start, given the cocky nature of the main character. The main problem is that the writers spend an unnecessary amount of time justifying Akatsuki’s lecherous actions, that it amplifies the perverted nature of the show. If he grabs a girl’s breasts, he’s just trying to show her how to make use of cleavage. If he steals a girl’s panties, he’s just trying to prove a point. These moments are so prolific early on that you end up not taking the show seriously. The amount of ecchi moments are plentiful too, with a unique mix of lesbians, random crotch-grabbing and heinous nudity to go around. And some of the scenes I was downright ashamed to watch, including an excerpt involving Akatsuki using his divine powers to cause three girls to pee themselves to prevent one from being embarrassed. I can’t even make this stuff up. I can see why the light novel is so popular around Japan…Most of the show’s 12 episodes are eaten up exploring the generic cast, and by the time the real story comes into play near the end, Aesthetica has already lost its steam. Any inkling of hope I had for the serious elements to play out were eradicated by the copious amounts of fanservice plaguing the anime’s beginning. The overpowering nature of Akatsuki also eliminates any feeling of drama throughout the series. Much like Sora and Shiro from No Game No Life, the battles are over before they begin, leaving much less opportunity for suspense from a viewer’s perspective. Most efforts at backstories are waived off to promote more ecchi scenes or are truncated due to the series’ short run. Considering it’s been five years since Aesthetica’s release, I don’t see a sequel in the works either, so the five of you out there that actually enjoyed the show can wait with bated breath.When I first saw Akatsuki, I was delighted. Finally we get a protagonist who isn’t shy around women and doesn’t get caught up in melodramatic inner monologues! But, it only took an episode for him to show his true colors, and before long I despised his presumptuous personality. Egotistical doesn’t even begin to describe him, and you could even go as far as to call him sexually sadistic. Akatsuki is so much better than everyone else in the show that they seem almost irrelevant. Generic iterations of various tropes are scattered throughout Aesthetica, leading the viewers to feel cheapened by the lazy writing. Miu has her fair share of, um well, “development” (aka, tits) but again this is overshadowed by the extraneous amount of time spent on Akatsuki’s perverted acts. The whole show is like some kind of messed up harem where instead of having girls fawning over him, they’re forced onto him against their will. But instead of hating him for what he does, he always finds a loophole excuse or convenience to make it okay. It’s almost as though the writers are saying to their viewers, “It’s okay to grope women as long as you make up a good reason!” Truly disgusting.The animation is a constant reminder of what Studio ARMS is not known for. It’s one of the same reasons I didn’t care for Elfen Lied. Everyone that’s not a main character is a pain to look at, as the models are a generic wreck. Even the protagonists leave a lot to be desired in the art department. The action scene’s animation was lackluster at best, and had some framing issues. Honestly, the most accurate part of the entire anime is the nudity. Depravity at its finest. The animation in the OP reminded me a bit of the old Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball games with all of the breast bouncing. I should’ve known then to run for the hills.The music in Aesthetica is reminiscent of something I’d hear in a cheesy DDR ripoff. It’s BAD. It’s almost as though the creators went down a sorted list of cheapest to most expensive when it came to purchasing the musical rights of the tracks here. At least the ecchi-ness helps drown some of it out. The ED is better, but still misses the mark for me. All of these begin to blur together after awhile. On a positive note, the English dub is actually pretty good. It incorporates some better known actors and is casted well. Some of the translations were altered to make them a bit more Westernized, but nothing really detracted from the scenes.To make a long story short, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is NOT a good show. It’s inexcusably perverted, lacks any character development and has a story that fizzles out faster than a middle school relationship. I guess if you were really bored or just looking for a terrible series to put things into perspective, then this could be a potential option for you. Just make sure you come in without any other expectations than tits. Lots and lots of tits.

Obviously, it doesn’t usually make for a compelling and intelligent show. But that’s not to say that all ecchi anime are bad. In fact, some ecchi anime can end up being pretty funny and charming; with at least a few characters that don’t make you want to shove knives in your ears every time they open their mouths. And then there’s the other kind of ecchi anime. It’s the kind that is self-aware if its suckiness and tries...to compensate with over the top, sometimes fetishy, fanservice that straddles the line between ecchi and hentai. In the end, you won’t remember its story, characters, or humor. Instead, you’ll only remember its shockingly inappropriate fanservice that practically screams “trying too hard!”Can you guess which type Hagure Yuusha no Aestetica is?Hagure Yuusha is a tale of silliness, fanservice, and magic. Its conception was handled by studio Arms, perhaps most (in)famous nowadays for their other sexually charged series Ikkitousen and Queen’s Blade. Hagure Yuusha shares many similarities with both of these series.The story begins where the typical fantasy tale usually ends: at the end of an intense battle with the demon king. After our hero Akatsuki Ousawa’s triumphant victory, he takes the demon king’s daughter, Miu, and heads back home to his own dimension. Now fully equipped with magical powers, he and Miu are sent to a special high school for magic users named Babel. Dramatic duels with mysterious opponents out for Ousawa’s blood, magical mayhem, and high school hilarity ensue.To be honest, Hagure Yuusha had an excellent setup. Its story had a vast amount of potential with a world whose lore and politics are completely pushed to the side in favor of panty shots and tits. The creators had a lot of room to work with the world but they refused to. For example, we don’t learn much about the differences between the dimensions. Apparently Babel is a special school where kids returning from another dimension are stuffed so they can be monitored. Therefore, we can assume that Akatsuki’s world is one where magic users are the exception, not the rule. Yet we never hear about the other dimensions that the other characters come from, or how their worlds influence their personalities or mannerisms. And what of Akatsuki’s relationship with Queen Risty? None of this is ever expanded upon.  Even if the creators had half-assed some backstories and explanations on the lore and world, it still would have been a much better show than what it is now. But instead we get tits. It’s one thing to give bare bones explanations when it’s an ecchi comedy, because then you expect mostly humor and not much else. But Hagure Yuusha sporadically jumps between wanting to make us laugh, wanting to turn us on, and wanting us to take it seriously. But the plot resembles something from a really bad JRPG, so when it wants to be taken seriously, its pretty hard for the viewer to do that.The characters don’t fare much better either. They are all extremely bland and boring, making it very hard to care about them or this show for that matter. Akatsuki Ousawa is indeed the one who steals the show here, though that’s not really hard when you have such a pathetic cast. He is lauded as a “badass” and “refreshing” simply because he’s not some wimpy male lead and can actually back up all the smack he talks. True, he isn’t your typical “super skinny or super fat loser who plays video games well, then has girls throwing their panties at him” archetype. But that doesn’t mean he’s a good character. He is one dimensional, obnoxious, and showcases throughout the anime that he may even be intellectually inept.Take the second episode for example. He and the other female protagonists get locked in a gym closet. Kuzuha has to pee quite badly. They say out loud that she could use earth magic to make a toilet. Instead, Ousawa uses his magic mumbo jumbo to make the other two girls feel what Kuzuha is feeling and really have to pee too, because…because. After biting Kuzuha’s ear, all three girls pee themselves. They then proceed to beat him up. Honestly, this is probably one of the most memorable scenes in the anime, but for all the wrong reasons. Why the hell couldn’t they just make a toilet like they said literally a few seconds ago? Oh right, omorashi fanservice.Then the justification used for his actions (“he made himself the bad guy so I could make friends!”) is almost insulting to the viewer’s intelligence. Remember kids, if you want to make friends, pee yourselves in unison!Face it; he’s only a small step above your usual wish fulfillment protagonists. The only thing that puts him slightly above the typical wish fulfillment protagonist is, once again, that he’s not some frail looking little flower that is overpowered for some inexplicable reason that defies logic.The female characters aren’t much better. Miu is a girl who is very shy about her body, but somehow always ends up groped or exposed. It would have been interesting to learn about her backstory. Something worth noting is that she’s a demon but looks human. Could her mother have been a human? Clearly the creators thought, “Who cares about that! Let’s get her naked!”Kuzuha is the loli class chairman and Chikage Izumi is the raging tomboy lesbian. Her actual introduction in the show is her molesting another female student in a gym closet. We learn little to nothing about these characters. The rest of the supporting cast are unimportant and hardly worth mentioning. Their only real purpose is to be curbstomped by Akatsuki and nothing more.In addition to being one dimensional and boring, the character’s motivations and actions aren’t really given reason. Nor do they make any sense. One example: Akatsuki kills Miu’s father. Why in the world does she not hate him? Why does she end up falling in love with him? It’s also hard to pinpoint a character’s motivation when we get little to no backstory on them or when they have such boring and flat personalities. The characters don’t seem like much more than dolls.With all this disappointment, we should at least be able to turn to the action and violence for comfort right? Wrong. The animation is pretty bad, looking quite dated for its time. The character’s heads look far too small for their bodies. And they all look like pallet swaps of each other with different hairstyles and varying breast sizes. The coloring looks incredibly flat and unreasonably bright. The fight scenes are lazily animated and unexciting. Couple that with the fact that Akatsuki dominates every opponent fairly quickly and you’ve got yourself some boring fight scenes. The music is also nothing spectacular, ranging from mediocre to bad.Overall, this show is pretty terrible on all counts. It had so much potential to be something excellent. Or at least decent, if they had just tried a little. Or it could have been one of those ecchi shows that you know isn’t all that good, but it ends up being humorous and charming nonetheless. Unfortunately, Hagure Yuusha isn’t funny, it isn’t endearing, and it’s just not enjoyable. It’s like a bad JRPG in anime form that tries to pull off a laughable plot with a straight face. Or a bad hentai without the sex. The only thing you’ll remember when you’re done are the inappropriate fanservice scenes, because those definitely push the envelope.There are better ecchi anime out there. There are far better action anime out there. There is also porn, which has sex, which Hagure Yuusha acts likes it’s going to show you but never does.Go find those splendid titles and leave tripe like this where it belongs. to compensate with over the top, sometimes fetishy, fanservice that straddles the line between ecchi and hentai.

After defeating the 'bad guy' of this medieval type world of magic, Akatsuki goes back home to a more modern scenery, taking a girl Miu- the daughter of the demon king with him. Another mystery set up is the organisation Babel, which is supposedly set up to protect the young returning from another world and a prophecy which concerns Akatsuki.The characters are also interesting, especially the protagonist Akatsuki. It's refreshing to see the main guy taking charge of...things. Miu is also an interesting character, it reamins to be seen why Akatsuki took her with him and what role she will have. She doesn't seem to be the typical passive character that needs to be saved constantly, but we'll see.I have no problems with the art, it's decent, but i wouldn't say it particularly stands out for me. The voice work is above average and it's a great cast i would say. The music is okay, the opening & ending tunes not really to my taste, but it sets the tone quite well.One of the main issues with this, is the amount of fanservice, it may not suit some people. From just the first episode we already see Akatsuki taking the bras of several maids and a lot of shots of Miu's body and chest. I have a feeling it'll only increase. I am only worried because this story could be something worth watching, but sometimes i feel fanservice can lower the impact and quality.Will i keep watching? Most likely. The first episode has definitely shown a lot of potential in introducing the characters and the story. The question is will this become an awesome anime or will it be let down by the fanservice factor? things.

I think that my stubborn nature made me watch it until the very end, but it was very painful. Nothing in this anime made me say that it was at least decent to watch.We have once again hero who defeats everything,not to forget...very powerful. We have big breasted women in entire anime,I mean everything I see is breast breast and some more breast. Oh and panties.I mean, I don't have anything against that, but not in that amount.I am not even thinking about watching side story they made.Majority of the things from the beginning that made the story interesting was left forgotten and never returned to.That was mainly the reason why I didn't like it at all.

I wasn\'t going to watch it at first but 3 month after I first heard of it I decided to check it out on one boring school day with nothing to do but to play with my phone. I fell in love with this anime the first episode.The thing that caught my eye about this anime is the main character and the concepts of the story. The main character is just....awesome. He is strong, smart, understanding, confident, relaxed, funny, fun, perverted,...open minded, serious, honorable and most important of all selfless. Analyzing him makes it pretty epic. He is like the title suggests a rogue hero, and a true hero like the anime suggests. All he wants to do is to make people happy and protect innocence (which i feel is represented by girls in here) from everything that dare make it unhappy. He doesn\'t need gratitude. He gladly shoulders this burden to protect innocence knowing he will have to make great sacrifices (suffering others pain to help them, taking on all the problems by himself, physical injuries etc.) and the only reward he will get is happiness of others. His goal is realistic understanding that he is only a man doing only as much as he can physically do but still always testing his limits to improve himself so he can do more. Rules or laws do not stop him. He knows what is more important and must be done. He is my hero now. He is everything that I always try to be so I guess that is why he appeals to me so much when I watched this show.The setting is pretty awesome. Its society has both magic and technology. The structure of government is uniquely built with a feeling that babel is has all the power. It also includes other dimensions which are medieval by appearance and has their own government. The dimensions seem to know of each other\'s existence which I thought is interesting to see how they would interact. The concept leaves much to wonder on and therefore a lot of mystery and potential. This is still only season 1 and I can\'t wait for season 2.The story itself is quite entertaining. The story has a lot of little everyday events that you can relate too. I found them funny yet surprisingly on topic. The story topic is suppose to be about the aesthetics of a rogue hero, or the appreciation of the concept of a ""rogue hero"" and from the 12 episodes I feel I had great appreciation of what a rogue hero is. The only thing that could be better is if they move the main plot along a little faster but it is too hard to tell at this point to know if they are or not. Need to know how relevant the information they are showing in season 1 are to the plot to know for sure. open minded, serious, honorable and most important of all selfless.

(At the time my thoughts were ""OMFG did the anime really just drop dead somewhere in the middle/beginning of the story?"") Luckily there is some of the translated light novel on baka-tsuki if you like reading.The second most important thing is that it is certainly an ecchi anime. There were so many bras, panties and breasts that I\'m amazed it\'s not hentai.StoryI initially thought that it was solely a parody show making fun...stories that start with a hero being summoned to another world (it also included the stereotypical Demon Lord too). Beyond that parody the premise seemed interesting and the story might have been able to develop further, but everything was thrown to hell after the anime\'s untimely demise at episode 12. I\'m still bitter and in a partial state of shock having had the anime end in the middle of nowhere.Art 7/10The art can be divided into three different types.Scene 1: Underwear, Girls trying to hide their naked bodies, Akatsuki(MC) doing lewd sh*tScene 2: Glowing magic circles for casting spellsScene 3: Akatsuki punching things or whacking things with his hefty DemonlordswordSoundAfter listening to the soundtrack the music was pretty well done. The quality was consistent throughout the entire show. My favourite song was Kichiku Panic from the beach episode. I recommend listening to a few songs from the soundtrack on youtube. Usually, anime beach episodes are a sin against all people with functioning brains, but it was probably the best beach episode I have seen.CharactersThe characters are rather mediocre except for Ousawa Akatsuki (Protagonist) who managed to dazzle me with his outrageous testosterone infused muscles, friendliness, kindness, and diabolical ecchiness. If Akatsuki wasn\'t such a nice guy at heart and rippling with composed bold style I would condemn him to hell for his crimes against defenseless girls. He isn\'t the retarded silly type of pervert that is the norm for ecchi shows. He\'s some kind of frightening, diabolical, ecchi, domination machine that girls can\'t escape from.The females are just typical weakly manufactured harem girls that didn\'t get enough development because the anime ended so suddenly.The males all received less character development and are very shallow/static.EnjoymentEnjoyment is the ultimatum I suppose. The enjoyment that I take away with me after having completed 12 episodes are the following few things(1) An interesting premise to think about(2) A few decent small battles and action scenes(3) A new perspective on ecchi protagonists and some laughsThe anime did leave me wanting more, but there is no more.

There are ton of anime out there, that can give better enjoyment then this anime could dream to. To sum it up what this anime has to offer is basic borderline hentai and some RPG elements. The fan serves is horrible , I usually don't mine it at all but in this one it take way from what little story this anime has to offer....Characters, I'll give that the main was some what interesting but rest of the cast has been seen and done, nothing special or interesting about them. I really had hard time watch this one all the way through, it's was pretty boring. But worst part of this anime is plot. The person who wrote must of been going for dual story with fantasy world plot and real world plot. Which would been fine they choice focus one at time. When I watch the first episode I felt throw into story, which would be fine if they had give some explanation later into story but that never happen. When you get to the part about the reason these kids end up into other worlds and how when they come back they are draft as student become soldiers. It this part of plot that is totally fuck up.

Next major issue is that anime can't seem to stick to the two major plot at all and seem to go through form one side plot that has no important what so every to story, to next meaningless plot. You have episode where he get motorcycle, that that point, so he can look cool not that actually important to plot. The series in last 3rd jump back into one of the major stories but at this point I could care less because they didn't build the character or the conflict for me to get behind it. So sum up the story was is basically role up piece of garage. Only reason I watch series all way through, so I could used the element I did like for re-wright in my head. From the original there was not much to go on. So over all this series has element that been done, useless fan serve, and can't seem make up mind about which plot it want you to fellow. In other words, this skip this anime. It doesn't deserve a second season. Total Bomb.

In other words, this skip this anime. It doesn't deserve a second season. Total Bomb."", 'Overview:""Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero"" should really be called ""Aesthetics of a Rogue Hero"", because that\'s exactly what the series values above all else- aesthetics. It does a fine job at using style to make various things about it seem very impressive, but when you look deeper, you realise that these things are nowhere near as great as they appear at first glance, and other than a fairly unorthodox protagonist (which isn\'t necessarily for the better), there isn\'t all that much that separates it from other anime of its kind.Story (6/10):The series is set in an alternate version of Earth that runs parallel to a...fantasy world called Alayzard, where people are frequently spirited away to and those who survive are granted magical powers. One such person is Akatsuki Ousawa, a young man who has recently slain the demon lord Garius, becoming the titular ""rogue hero"" as a result. The twist is that right before he died, Garius trusted Akatsuki with his only daughter Miu, who he brings back with him to his own world to ensure her safety and allow her to live a safe life. Assuming the identity of his little sister, Miu and Akatsuki begin to attend a private school own by the international organization Babel, where those who have returned from Alayzard successfully are enrolled as students and taught to control their powers. From there, this unlikely duo meet new friends, train in combat and deal with various threats to their new lives.Does this premise sound like anything you\'ve heard before? Well, it should, because while the idea of a ""reverse isekai"" where the protagonist takes someone from a fantasy world to his world seems novel enough at first, that novelty quickly wears off when they get thrust into magic school, which as far as anime is concerned is an even more clichéd setting than any fantasy world. Sure, being clichéd doesn\'t automatically make something bad, but, as I mentioned above, ""Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero"" does barely anything to distinguish itself from other anime of its kind, which admittedly works in its favour sometimes, but not often. What\'s worse is that despite Alayzard being pretty much the catalyst for the entire plot, it never manages to be anything more than a background, as it\'s never focused on for more than one scene at a time. Instead, the story is pretty much entirely centred around Babel School and the various activities they get up to, some alright, others downright cringeworthy.Even so, the story isn\'t a complete failure altogether. In the final arc, we get some decent worldbuilding both for Alayzard (despite its lack of on-screen presence) and Aktasuki\'s version of Earth. Namely, we learn that being a hero like Akatsuki isn\'t quite as amazing as it\'s initially made out to be, and Miu merely moving to Earth doesn\'t mean that her problems are just going to go away, since there are plenty of people who want her dead simply for being related to the late Demon Lord and will do anything to ensure as much. This results in a number of surprisingly touching moments, some decent relationship building between the major characters, and a satisfying final conflict. All of that being said, while the story does have its high points, there isn\'t really anything that you couldn\'t get from a number of other, better shows, and the series ultimately ends just when things start to get really interesting.Art & Animation (8/10):On the surface, ""Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero"" seems to look well above average. The characters are very well-drawn, the art style is right up my alley and the animations and special effects are generally very smooth and believable. However, when you look closer, you realise that the series doesn\'t look quite as good as it does at first glance. For example, the female character models all have the same shape to them, with the only real differences between them being their hair, their heights and their faces, which often delves into uncanny valley territory. And, as it tends to be the case with ecchi shows, the fanservice is often in your face to the point that it completely kills the mood of a scene. Don\'t get me wrong, though, the visuals are still good. They\'re just not quite as great as first impressions would have you believe.Sound & Dialogue (8/10):There isn\'t all that much to say about the soundtrack, as I barely even noticed it a lot of the time due to most of the music being rather generic and forgettable. The only real exception I can think of is the opening, and even that wasn\'t fantastic. The voice acting is generally very good- Eric Vale and Felecia Angelle do a respectable job as Akatsuki and Miu respectively, and the series boasts a fine cast which includes Todd Haberkorn, Monica Rial and Alexis Tipton. That said, none of them gave what I would call their best performances and it\'s a real shame that Colleen Clinkenbeard and Christopher Sabat, arguably the two best voice actors in the cast, are relegated to characters that do pretty much nothing of significance. Overall, the sound design is nothing spectacular, but it does what it\'s supposed to do if nothing else.Characters (7/10):It’s obvious from the very first episode that Akatsuki is far from your typical harem protagonist. However, much like Kinji Tohyama in “Aria the Scarlet Ammo”, that’s a point that tends to work against him rather than for him. To put it mildly, Akatsuki is not a nice person. He may be the hero of the story, but he’s still perfectly willing to kick the ass of anyone who so much as annoys him and often takes full advantage of his super speed to snatch women’s underwear. I know a lot of people are tired of the “girl attacks boy for being perverted” trope, but Akatsuki frequently pushes the point where a good smack or two would be more than justified, especially since, unlike most protagonists, his perversions are almost always entirely on purpose. And yet he almost never gets punished for his frequent harassment, since nobody can do anything about him because he’s just too powerful, despite being one of the few Babel students who can’t use magic, instead relying on something called energy manipulation. But while he can be very hard to like at times, he’s certainly not without redeeming qualities, and the final arc in particular shows that for all his vices he could be a hell of a lot worse, though how much comfort that is will likely vary from person to person.The other half of the main duo is Miu, called Miu Ousawa in school due to her posing as Akatsuki’s younger sister. Even though Akatsuki was entrusted by Miu’s father to keep her safe, Miu starts off not liking him very much, which is understandable considering his rather unpleasant personality as well as the fact that he was the one who killed her father in the first place. Personality-wise, she’s generally kind but also very modest and shy, as well as often lacking in self-worth, particularly when it comes to how people treat her due to who she is related to. She’s also surprisingly intelligent and perceptive, having a consistently good grasp of battle strategies and being easily able to deduce people’s motives regardless of whether they try to pretend otherwise. Her fighting style is also more-or-less the opposite of Akatsuki’s- unlike Akatsuki, who will take energy manipulation over magic any day of the week, Miu has a natural affinity for all types of magic and can cast several types in quick succession, making her a formidable opponent, if not to the same level as Akatsuki (then again, that’s a really high bar to clear). Overall, while she doesn’t get too many chances to shine, I would definitely say she stood out as my favourite character, as she’s not only the nicest character in the series by a good amount, but also the only one who goes through any meaningful character development.Of course, Akatsuki and Miu aren’t the only two main characters in the series, and they meet several other notable characters during their time at Babel. Two such characters are fellow heroes and students Chikage Izumi and Kuzuha Doumoto, who quickly become good friends with each other and Miu. Initially, it’s out of their shared disdain for Akatsuki but overtime they become genuine friends who are always looking out for each other and will have each other’s backs no matter what. For their individual characters, Izumi is a tomboyish lesbian who enjoys getting intimate with other girls (though this is overall treated as a very small part of her character and is in no way offensive) and Kuzuha is a prodigy who skipped multiple grades, which is why she’s in high school despite being only 11. Both of them are also capable badasses in their own rights, with Izumi being a water magic-using archer and Kuzuha being an earth magic user who wields a hammer as big as she is. There’s also Haruka Nanase, the vice-president of the Babel student council who quickly grows to hate Akatsuki (noticing a pattern here?) due to his perversions and chaotic attitude and makes it her personal mission to keep him in line, often roping in the rest of the student council (besides the president) to help her. However, while her attitude towards Akatsuki is justified at first, she’ll often get on his case even when it isn’t warranted, like if all he did was step in to help with something, implying an unhealthy obsession with order. Overall, I didn’t dislike her, but she’s definitely the weakest of the main characters. Other than these five, there aren’t really many characters I consider worth noting. I can say, however, that the villain of the final arc is a surprisingly good one, being a credible threat to the main cast and having a comprehensible, if completely unjustifiable, motivation.Enjoyment (7/10):“Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero” is an entertaining series to be sure, with well-animated fight scenes and some genuinely funny comedic moments. Unfortunately, it does fall into the rather frequent trap of being ecchi for ecchi’s sake, and Akatsuki’s frequent perverted antics get old and annoying fairly quickly. The show can also be unexpectedly dark at times, particularly towards the end where we get the implication that neither world is as glamourous as it initially appears. Even so, the show never overdoes it and carries a hopeful tone even at its darkest, especially since that’s when Akatsuki’s noble qualities shine through the most.Overall:“Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero” is a textbook example of an anime that is neither a triumph nor a disaster. The story is rather underdeveloped, the visuals aren’t quite as good as they seem at first glance and the characters with the exception of Miu, can be quite unlikable at times. Nevertheless, the series does have its good points as well, and so long as you don’t go in expecting anything original, this is an anime that you may very well end up enjoying in spite of yourself.Score:6+8+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10 fantasy world called Alayzard, where people are frequently spirited away to and those who survive are granted magical powers.

This show is fine but its main character is not. I suspect the main character is the reason this show has garnered popularity but please listen to my points when I get to him.Story:Well as of right now there isn\'t too much to talk about here. The setting is decently original with people disappearing into fantasy worlds only to reappear with their powers intact. This part of the story is glanced over so I doubt we\'ll be going any deeper into this element of the show, which is a shame because it\'s really the only original...plot point the show has. The plot point itself is probably no less than an excuse to have people gain powers in the real world.Sadly nothing else about the story has remotely piqued my interest, which is not good for a series that\'s 6 episodes in. Generally a show should have some kind of hook on the first or even the second episode. Hagure Yuusha no Estetica is failed to deliver much plot substance at all and the hints it does drop are both uninteresting and half-assed.Art:The art is of course, great. Many shows today have really done a fantastic job with keeping all the different anime very appealing to look at. I can watch a few episodes and not notice any kind of glitches or hiccups which is nice.The spells are pretty generic, using the same spell circles you see very where now-a-days but it\'s not necessarily a bad thing. The effects that accompanies the spells are also very well done which at this point is to be expected.Sound:Sound is a very similar story to art. The standard for it is very high and most anime reaches it with Hagure Yuusha no Estetica being no exception. The sounds and music fits the scene nicely however I have yet to notice any particular tracks that I like.Characters:Now this is where it gets really frustrating. I know everyone loves the main character because he\'s the exact opposite of those wimpy characters we frequently get. I understand that completely, wimpy characters are unappealing and annoying. However this is NOT and excuse to do what Hagure Yuusha no Estetica has done.Akatsuki: To put it bluntly, he\'s a Gary Stu (if you\'re unfamiliar with the term, please reference Google). He\'s like an OC (original character) straight out of a bad fanfic. He is much too over powered for his environment which can sometimes be entertaining if handled correctly. It is not handled at all well in this anime. Akatsuki flaunts his power many times over the past 6 episodes, with every successive feat becoming more predictable than the last. Sadly this makes his antics boring and stale. He\'s a one-trick-pony that just mows through challenges which is boring to watch. Hopefully the fights will be less one sided when some stronger enemies come forth but this also brings up my next point.The show itself is a god damn love letter to Ousawa. The show basically just runs on scenes that make Ousawa out to be the mega bad-ass. A good example of this is*SPOILER*in episode 6 where he inexplicably appears out of no where on the roof top to save the little girl from the bad guy.*END SPOILER*We get nearly no exposition or any real form of explanation as to why he was there. The show just wants us to believe he either appeared from thin air or was somehow in the vehicle when it got on the roof. Like I said, no exposition. It was just an excuse to give Akatsuki another ""I\'m a good guy"" scene.The final point I have is that he lacks a strong personality. Sure, he can crush everything under his pinky, but other than that it\'s really boring. The only interesting parts of his personality are extremely rushed and very poorly placed. Examples of this would be*SPOILER*when he become the ""reverse"" bully to the red haired character (I\'m sorry, I can\'t seem to remember his name). The whole thing about him being this self imposed judicator would be a great character trait were it developed a little more. We know nothing of why he feels that bullies should be punished, which in turn makes it come off as a poorly chosen trait with the sole purpose of ""making him look cool"".Another example I will bring up is his anger towards the mentioning of his father. It comes out of no where, is only brought up for a second and does little to get me interested in the story of his father. Again this could be an interesting character trait if handled differently, like in a time where he really couldn\'t get something done. It would let us have at least a little bit of insight into why he needs to surpass his father and why we should care. But no, like everything else he just skips right through any sign of challenge. Which is another thing, we don\'t know why Akatsuki can ride the bike now or what changed except that he got slightly angrier. There was virtually 4 minutes of build-up and *boom* suddenly the thing that floored him 2 minutes ago was suddenly obeying his every command.*END SPOILER*In closing, Ousawa is much like what you\'d find a grade school student day dreaming about with his friends. Remember those conversations you had when you were a kid and trying to think of a ""cool"" character? ""He should have like these razor sharp teethe that can rip through anything!"" ""YEAH and he needs flames on his back that burn everything a mile around him!"" ""And then he needs these big spikes on his legs that are indestructible."" ""Then he needs red eyes that shoot lasers."" ""He should ride around on this hover board too which goes like faster than light."" That\'s generally how I assume the creation of Ousawa went, of course without the grade school ideas but with the same mindset.Kuzuha: By far my favorite character in the show. She\'s not only flawed in that she has emotional issues she needs to deal with, but her resentment of her situation is entirely understandable. These flaws make characters deeper the more a show wants to go into these ideas. In turn the character becomes much more interesting.Miu: She\'s your basic female protagonist, not that that\'s a bad thing. There\'s not much to talk about other than her troubles with her father and Akatsuki but I assume we will delve further into the topic as the series goes.Chikage: She\'s interesting mostly because of a certain scene (you\'ll know it when you see it). She\'s basically just there to promote the echiness of the series which is fine.Enjoyment:I really want to enjoy the series because it has potential but that main character annoys me so greatly. If he was handled at all better I\'d easily put this show as a favorite for the season, but otherwise my enjoyment of the show is greatly hampered.Overall:I can only give it a 6 because I do actually enjoy it but I notice myself clenching my teethe from time to time which is not a good sign. If you do in fact like the main character then that is up to you. Personally I just can\'t stand him. plot point the show has. The plot point itself is probably no less than an excuse to have people gain powers in the real world.Sadly nothing else about the story has remotely piqued my interest, which is not good for a series that\'s 6 episodes in.

There was virtually 4 minutes of build-up and *boom* suddenly the thing that floored him 2 minutes ago was suddenly obeying his every command.*END SPOILER*In closing, Ousawa is much like what you\'d find a grade school student day dreaming about with his friends. Remember those conversations you had when you were a kid and trying to think of a ""cool"" character? ""He should have like these razor sharp teethe that can rip through anything!"" ""YEAH and he needs flames on his back that burn everything a mile around him!"" ""And then he needs these big spikes on his legs that are indestructible."" ""Then he needs red eyes that shoot lasers."" ""He should ride around on this hover board too which goes like faster than light."" That\'s generally how I assume the creation of Ousawa went, of course without the grade school ideas but with the same mindset.Kuzuha: By far my favorite character in the show. She\'s not only flawed in that she has emotional issues she needs to deal with, but her resentment of her situation is entirely understandable. These flaws make characters deeper the more a show wants to go into these ideas. In turn the character becomes much more interesting.Miu: She\'s your basic female protagonist, not that that\'s a bad thing. There\'s not much to talk about other than her troubles with her father and Akatsuki but I assume we will delve further into the topic as the series goes.Chikage: She\'s interesting mostly because of a certain scene (you\'ll know it when you see it). She\'s basically just there to promote the echiness of the series which is fine.Enjoyment:I really want to enjoy the series because it has potential but that main character annoys me so greatly. If he was handled at all better I\'d easily put this show as a favorite for the season, but otherwise my enjoyment of the show is greatly hampered.Overall:I can only give it a 6 because I do actually enjoy it but I notice myself clenching my teethe from time to time which is not a good sign. If you do in fact like the main character then that is up to you. Personally I just can\'t stand him.', ""I've got to say that I really enjoyed watching the series, my only problem with it was that there were a few occasions that I found that the dialogue was a bit boring.The fight scenes were great! The main character is a real badass, and knows it!I'd really recommend others to watch it! "", 'Hi. Welcome to another round of Robert\'s Too Late Reviews! Today as usual we are working the dub version. I recently reviewed Chivalry of a Failed Knight, and bemoaned repeatedly the whole \'overpowered meek and humble hero\', well there is NONE of that to be had here! That and we are thrown some twists at the ending which I found appealing as well. Let\'s throw down this show and see what we\'ve got going!Story:7The story isn\'t anything to write home about. Little boy gets zaps into another world, lives there his whole childhood, gains superpowers and then returns. Not all that unusual there. His kicker,...as the synopsis mentions is that instead of a magic sword or treasure, he brings back the daughter of a Demon Lord he destroyed (with the Demon Lord\'s blessing oddly enough) and on returning to earth, passes her off (well to some people as his long forgotten sister. So we have him horndogging on her as much as possible, all while adjusting to a special school where these \'returned\' children use their magic or new found abilities for the benefit of our would.Of course our main cat hits everyone wrong, for the most part, but the sad thing is, he comes PACKING. He is overpowered on ALL levels and damn proud of it too. He\'s cocky, he\'s arrogant, and he immediately catches the eye of the sinister student council president and pisses the vice prez off to no end. He did not study magic but an energy manipulation technique that keeps all of his foes off guard, even the final big nasty doesn\'t get that much of a jump on him. He does what he thinks is right because he thinks it so. He\'s true to his moral center, even if that center skews in directions the rest of us wouldn\'t go.He pretends the woman he\'s meat to be with, the Demon Lord daughter is his sister for her sake, and also because he\'s not about to force her to care for him. He doesn\'t roll like that. Is he often that perfectly toned handsome smart powerful guy all guys want to beat to a pulp? Yeah, he is. But he\'s also cool, loyal, and never give in. This is not a story of the \'worst one\' who turns out to the best this is the story of the beset one who says \'hell yeah, who\'s your daddy?""Ton of action, comedy moments when the tho girls that friend \'sister\' realize he\'s more than that to her. Hilarity as the student council vice is bested by him at every turn and cannot believe it. Add to the that the menacing pres, a shadowy origination that is not explained hardly at all, and hits the big baddy was just a warm up, and things seem like they might be on track for a bit season two.o! But yes, ecchi tropes to be had, often.Art: 9Looked good, the fights were pretty awesome, the different power projected were varied and interesting. Detail was nice, though I didn\'t like the school uniform for princess girl, too much cleavage. Never thought I\'d say that before! Otherwise, everything looked right  on place.Sound:8The battle music worked well, nice clanks and weighty weapons sounds. The voice actors carried it but didn\'t oversell too much. The themes are nice, rock beat to them, but nothing too special. Voice casting was very well done. The asshole lead sounds like a self confident jerk (even if he has the right to be) the girls all held their own, and the student vice pres is a trip to listen to, loving that for sure.Character:8The characters can be a bit one sided in that OP guy is good hearted, but really has to wait till the chips are down to act. The girds that befriend little sister are honest and sincere enough, while the VP seems to have nothing on her mind than ways to destroy the main character. Some of it works, some of it is eye rolling.Enjoyment: 9. It was a nice change of pace to see a protagonist that says \'I\'m gonna bust you up, then you up, and then your granny too!\' even if he didn\'t actually mean it. He\'s full of bluster, but ultrapowerful so perhaps he\'s allowed? Not only that, but the end fight of the serious is STRONGLY hinted to be a taste of things to come. They set up season 2 hard and strong, hope they make it now. Was a damn fun show!. If you like Characters with swagger and the ability to back it up, this sis for you!Best Girl: Kuhuza! God I lover voice actor and love just about every work she\'s in!If you light it fast and furious, but WITHOUT a side of idiocy (Fairy Tail) give this one a go, it\'s a short sesious anyway, not going to waste much time of it does\'t grab ya!

Two Thumbs up!', 'Looking for a totally mediocre but enjoyable fantasy and action anime? well I think Hagure Yuusha No Estetica is for you!I went into this anime during the summer 2012 season with the normal expectation of a totally floppy and cliche harem and action anime...well it wasnt. In a way you had the makings of such an anime but in the end the main male protagonist and action scenes followed by a well thought out pacing for the storyline.The main attraction for this anime is the main male protagonist, Ousawa Akatsuki who is a badass , strong, pervert and invincible. basically he is a main lead...with a harem with enough backbone and ability to defend himself as well. He stands out from the normal wimpy and weak MCs with a harem.Throughout the anime , his heroics and basic ethics is something to be admired and enjoyed as he cruises through fights and challenges with a calm demeanor.His other quality would be his pervy side...where he can strip women of their underwear without them even realizing it. which makes him a totally pervert and entertain male audiences with all the ecchi element.The circles of girls in his *Harem* , though i would say the romantic hints in this anime is pretty few with only certain girls showing obvious affection for him, the most obvious of which is his little sister, Ousawa Miu( not blood-related) and the tsundere vice president, Haruka.The storyline is nothing really impressive...( you can read synopsis on MAL and you can guess the basic storyline once you start the anime). Like I said, the most interesting aspect of this anime is the Main star lead, Akatsuki and the pacing of the story. Every episode does just enough to let the story progress , though the occasional side episodes comes up, the progession doesnt really slows down to zero. The fight scenes were solid and well paced as well and most of all its BELIEVABLE and does not end off abruptly.Towards the end of the anime, you will see this anime is a genuine fantasy and action anime with a strong MC and would have found it totally enjoyable like me ;D though it would depend on your personal taste as well. with a harem with enough backbone and ability to defend himself as well.

This series has a lot of good sides.. Good animation, good girls, good story..I would like to comment on the following points that I noticed in the series..Story (8)This series has a good story.. It's a combination of school life, fantasy, action etc.. You know.. the generic genres in creating a shonen anime.. But, of course, this kind of elements will always be a hit..Even though the story was good.. there's this kind of boring parts in the series.. You know.. things that didn't really matter in the main story and stuff.....Overall, just finish it...Art (8)No question about the art.. I noticed that the Art style of this series is somewhat the same with the animation of Legend of Legendary Heroes.. The animation of Akatsuki and the other characters are good... Just saying..Sound (5)You know what.. I am a kind of person who likes songs that will make my heart jump or make my head bang... The theme songs of this series didn't gave me that feeling.. Well, it does not affect the main series after all.. Just saying..Character (7)I'm going to say that Akatsuki, the main guy, is awesome.. He is the type of main character wherein his power was established at the start of the series.. You can sense the awesomeness from it.. Aside from the awesomeness, there's this good looking aura that makes the character more suitable to the perfect hero type..Hmm... Then here comes Miyuu.. the so-called sister of Akatsuki wherein in reality sense they are not siblings (SPOILER ALERT: Miyuu is a daughter of someone whose identity is very great).. OK, I really want to voice out my opinions about this... If I'm going to recreate the story of the series, I will not make Miyuu the sister of Akatsuki.. Why? It's because of the potential love team that can happen between them.. That's what the poster is trying to tell us... Damn poster!! You did a good job of turning my head upside down!!Bottom Line is that, if there will be a Ecchi scene between Akatsuki and Miyuu, it is better to write that they are not siblings... AHAHA! Just saying...Enjoyment (8)I think I have 3 reasons why I enjoyed this series1) Action scenes2) Potential sequel season - Well if you finished watching this, you will definitely sense that there's more to it..2) The skill of Akatsuki - Akatsuki has a special perverted technique that utilizes the speed of hands.. That's great... Check it.. HAHAHAOverallI'm sure you noticed that there's more to the series... The series will give a lot of clues about what's going to happen next.. In my opinion, when I finished the series, there are things that didn't satisfy me.. Looking at the bright side of it, it awakened a sudden urge inside of me that I must watch the sequel... if there's a sequel.. The series did a good job of making me craving for more..I'm sure you're going to feel it..Well, that's allLightningSnow :) Overall, just finish it...Art (8)No question about the art..

Reviewed the review, and decided that I was too lenient on it.We\'ll get straight to the point here, I am somewhat tolerant of the MC.  Sure, he\'s on the far other side of the spectrum when it comes to harem mains, but that\'s not exactly a good thing either.  I\'ll get to that later:Story: 1There is no story.  If someone asked you what it was about, all you can say is this: Over powered main character literally plays with girls until episode 10.  That\'s it.  There is no overarching main plot, well...until episode 10, there are numerous subplots though.  Pathetic romance plots and one actually very notable inner conflict in the main girl (Miyu).  Other than that, it\'s the very definition of EPISODIC.  And it\'s not even good episodicP.S. They left room for season 2.  Which we\'re probably not going to get because the author is busy with Shinmai Maou no New Testament...or something else.Art: 3Nothing too good, nothing too bad.  Average.  Character designs are good though.  They do laze at some episodes though, lowering the detail a noticeable amount.Actually scratch that, the art is pretty bad.  It was one of the reasons I actually dropped the show after half way through the first episode.  Kinda wish I kept it dropped.Sound: 5Average.  No comment.  OP and Endings are what you would expect.Character: 3And probably my most controversial rating.  The characters.  They\'re all stock characters.  There\'s the tsundere, the easily embarrassed main girl, the perverted girl and the class president that is actually the most normal out of them all.  Then there\'s the main character.  He\'s actually a ""good"" main character, though I do have a few issues with him as a person, I won\'t let that affect my ratings (and so...his personality affected my ratings).  He\'s boring.  He\'s cool (arguably), he\'s funny, and he\'s BORINGLY over powered.  He gets no character development, he gets NOTHING.  He remains the same throughout the entire season.  And he\'s STUPIDLY strong too.  He\'s the type of strong that makes you go like, ""Yerp, he\'s going to win.  Oh, he\'s going to win again.  Yup...winning...again.""  That\'s how strong he is.  I would compare him to Saitama (OPM), but they actually make a joke out of Saitama.  He has ABSOLUTELY no reason to be this strong.Enjoyment: 6Despite the crap I said and the low ratings, I actually did enjoy this, a little.  The humor was nice even though it didn\'t make me laugh (I don\'t laugh to anime for some reason).  You\'d like the humor and the situations each character gets into.  It\'s actually the only reason I kept on watching.  The fight scenes however, they\'re something to be desired.  You never really care what happens to the characters in fights since - well - we all know what\'s going to happen.  MC somehow wins because plot armor and he\'s OP (even the OVA crossover with Queen\'s Blade illustrates this).Overall: 3There is NO story (until like...10).  The art is average.  The sound is average and forgettable.  The characters are stock and one Gary Sue.  We get a FAIR amount of enjoyment out of it, though don\'t expect much out of...well anything.  It\'s almost like a poorly written author self-insert when you think about it.  The type of situations you day dream.Overall, this show is crap.  After coming back and reevaluating my review, I can firmly say that this show is garbage and the author is right to keep it on hiatus and work on better things (Shinmai Maou). until episode 10, there are numerous subplots though.

That\'s all that needs to be said.But to add some more:Tired of all the pussy main characters?  Tired of authors redefining the main characters at whim?  Tired of nothing but boobs when you want action?Hagure Yuusha no Estetica is like a direct response to ""Hey we want something bad-ass for once!""  I watched the first episode and was hooked.Akatsuki is simply the man I aim to be.  Complete bad-ass-ery from start to finish in every single episode.  Another strong point is Akatsuki\'s power - while he is over-powered, he opted to train in a different fighting style...than the typical magic user.  It brought back some memories of DBZ, especially in fight scenes - which there was no lack of.The art is more than decent enough, same with sound.  All the characters were interesting and entertaining.The story was beautiful.  It\'s original, but unfortunately it does not look like we\'ll get another season.  It could have been better in terms of \'execution\' as other reviewers have said, though that does not take away from the fact that this anime was completely amazing and we could use a hell of lot more like this one.I definitely recommend any shonen lover to watch this anime.BTW, its nothing close to HighSchool DXD in terms of \'hentai\', I see the hints of it as testament to Akatuski\'s bad-ass-ery. than the typical magic user.

It tries to be funny but I didn't laugh once while watching the show. It tries to be action packed but the main hero is so overpowered it isn't interesting and you find yourself not caring about the outcome. This show also decides to be an ecchi anime, but the ecchi aspect of the show isn't the main point it  just ends up making the show worse. The show had an interesting concept, but it just ends up becoming a mess. The art was pretty good. The sound was fine nothing special but Funimation did...produce a good dub. The characters were poorly written and I didn't care about any of them. I really did not like this anime, but I don't think this anime is necessarily bad it's just about average. produce a good dub. The characters were poorly written and I didn't care about any of them. I really did not like this anime, but I don't think this anime is necessarily bad it's just about average."", 'Hagure is a ecchi-based action/fantasy for those tired of wimpy, ""nice"" male leads. However, it is also a series only for those who can tolerate thin character development and a story trying to foreshadow a second season so badly that you might as well just wait until the next season comes out.The story shares the dimension-travel theme of other shows such as Zero no Tsukaima and Astarotte no Omocha. The main difference being the lack of Rie Kugumiya and a much more blunt approach to the ecchi; the main lead here is strong enough not to be a victim of violent acts of retribution for...his openly perverse nature (though he displays it in a much more controlled fashion than the lead in Sora no Otoshimono). However, this refreshing change of lead personality is just wasted on a wish washy plot line full of inconsistencies, plot holes, and purposefully-unanswered mysterious questions. If you\'re looking for a stronger male lead who is not afraid to express his perverse nature, look to Onizuka. If you\'re looking for just a male lead that can stand up on his own, Campione gives this series a run for its money as well. If you do somehow decide to delve into this series, be prepared for a very lackluster story line.Animation:While there isn\'t anything atrocious here, the animation isn\'t what I\'d call good. The color scheme gives the series a slightly childish feel despite the story trying (at times) to portray a more somber mood. As for the characters, there\'s something about their facial styling that is off putting. As for ecchi, the main hero has the ability to undress female characters (almost similar to the protagonist in DxD\'s ability, though Akatsuki can remove articles intact). He also has the ability to control the flow of chi in people, and thus can basically ""control"" how people ""feel"". You can interpret that one as you see fit. Expect plenty of groping, bouncy parts, and panty shots.There is a decent amount of action in this series, but the choreography is average at best and there is neither seriousness nor gore (dragon implodes upon death? what is this Mortal Kombat Annihilation?). The majority of the fighting is analogous to laser spamming in certain Gundam series; basically you see large swaths of colored energy being hurled between contenders.Sound:The series has completely forgettable music all around. OP and ED are both action-sounding rock pieces, the ED being the slightly better of the pair. BGM has one or so unique pieces (for ecchi moments), but pretty much your standard fare.To be honest, the only reason why I considered watching this was the outstanding list of VAs. Also to be honest, I have no idea how this show got so many good VAs signed on, as the characters are so cookie-cutter that none of the VAs even had a chance to drive any life into their roles. Kana Hanazawa voicing a very quiet, orderly character? Ami Koshimizu getting virtually three lines in the entire series? Marina Inoue in a tsundere role is probably the only one that was a good fit.Story:As mentioned in the intro, this series\' setting is hinged on dimensional travel. In this case, kids are mysteriously transported to another world where they become RPG heroes, eventually returning to Earth with a wide variety of magical and physical abilities. These students are somehow gathered and placed in a school called Babel (of course we\'re not supposed to ask why or how). Our protagonist is one such student, who just returned from the other world having defeated the last demon king and taking ""ownership"" of the demon king\'s daughter (as the king\'s final request). The story follows Akatsuki as he and Miu adjusts to life at Babel.The best way to describe the story is that it is analogous to DBZ had Goku started out at Namek as a SS3. There\'s just no point to it as the hero is already so strong that there is nowhere to grow. All the character relations and ""important"" friendships are meaningless as the ""hero"" ends up saving everyone. Every. Single. Time. To the point where one asks ""why even bother?"" The show tries to keep the viewer interested by occasionally hinting that there is a secret organization with potentially other beings at Akatsuki\'s level, but nothing ever comes from it other than hooks to try to get you to watch the second season- but if the first series is any hint at how well the production will go for the second season, please count me out.The story starts out in a slice-of-life, episodic progression before moving on to the ""final"" arc starting halfway through the show. It builds to an eventual climax with an all-too-predictable outcome. The main plot line aside, there are just too many other subplots going on concurrently (the mysterious organization, occurrences in the other world, etc.) that are just thrown at the viewer as if we were some multi-core processor able to context switch seamlessly between subplots. Ranting aside, the execution of the story was overall significantly sub par.Character:To be honest, this ought to be a continuation of the rant from above, but I\'ll spare you and just say ""more of the same"". There are way too many characters thrown in seeming for the lolz, and the antagonist is so cliche that you\'d have thought he came from something over a decade ago. All the characters (Miu aside) lack any depth whatsoever, almost as if the show is purposely hiding details. Character relationships also feel shallow, the deepest probably being Chikage\'s yuri feelings towards Miyu. As mentioned in the sound section, the great VA talent is truly wasted on these characters.Value:Some may rate this series highly because of this section alone. I\'ll agree, the male lead is a refreshing change from the wimpy lot. However, he overshadows all other aspects of the show to such a degree that he single handedly undermines the story as well as the importance of the other characters. Watch this series only for the fan service; otherwise, be prepared to be disappointed. his openly perverse nature (though he displays it in a much more controlled fashion than the lead in Sora no Otoshimono). However, this refreshing change of lead personality is just wasted on a wish washy plot line full of inconsistencies, plot holes, and purposefully-unanswered mysterious questions. If you\'re looking for a stronger male lead who is not afraid to express his perverse nature, look to Onizuka. If you\'re looking for just a male lead that can stand up on his own, Campione gives this series a run for its money as well. If you do somehow decide to delve into this series, be prepared for a very lackluster story line.Animation:While there isn\'t anything atrocious here, the animation isn\'t what I\'d call good. The color scheme gives the series a slightly childish feel despite the story trying (at times) to portray a more somber mood. As for the characters, there\'s something about their facial styling that is off putting. As for ecchi, the main hero has the ability to undress female characters (almost similar to the protagonist in DxD\'s ability, though Akatsuki can remove articles intact). He also has the ability to control the flow of chi in people, and thus can basically ""control"" how people ""feel"". You can interpret that one as you see fit. Expect plenty of groping, bouncy parts, and panty shots.There is a decent amount of action in this series, but the choreography is average at best and there is neither seriousness nor gore (dragon implodes upon death? what is this Mortal Kombat Annihilation?). The majority of the fighting is analogous to laser spamming in certain Gundam series; basically you see large swaths of colored energy being hurled between contenders.Sound:The series has completely forgettable music all around. OP and ED are both action-sounding rock pieces, the ED being the slightly better of the pair. BGM has one or so unique pieces (for ecchi moments), but pretty much your standard fare.To be honest, the only reason why I considered watching this was the outstanding list of VAs. Also to be honest, I have no idea how this show got so many good VAs signed on, as the characters are so cookie-cutter that none of the VAs even had a chance to drive any life into their roles. Kana Hanazawa voicing a very quiet, orderly character? Ami Koshimizu getting virtually three lines in the entire series? Marina Inoue in a tsundere role is probably the only one that was a good fit.Story:As mentioned in the intro, this series\' setting is hinged on dimensional travel. In this case, kids are mysteriously transported to another world where they become RPG heroes, eventually returning to Earth with a wide variety of magical and physical abilities. These students are somehow gathered and placed in a school called Babel (of course we\'re not supposed to ask why or how). Our protagonist is one such student, who just returned from the other world having defeated the last demon king and taking ""ownership"" of the demon king\'s daughter (as the king\'s final request). The story follows Akatsuki as he and Miu adjusts to life at Babel.The best way to describe the story is that it is analogous to DBZ had Goku started out at Namek as a SS3.

There were gaps and holes and a lot of things i didn't like but i was thoroughly entertained the entire time! First I would like to say I haven't read the novels an all speculation is based solely upon the anime. What I can say from the start is it takes some getting used to knowing that there is this massive back story that we didn't get to see and that there could be enough content for a prequel season however after the fourth episode that stopped bothering me as some things were being explained. I liked...that they used flashbacks but didn't completely kill you with them. They were moderate and gave the info they needed to.The only thing I disliked about the anime was throughout the first half it was almost entirely fan service with only a little action. Sure one would expect it to have ecchi in it but i was expecting much more action. I dove into this anime expecting a lot of action and got a lot of boobs. Not that it is a major complaint since this was however satisfied very quickly after the first few episodes. the anime was a little spotty with the story, a plot never really made itself present. At points it seemed like we were getting glimpses of a plot but in then turned out to be miniscule with the constant revealings of other plot points.GOD FUCKING DAMN! Akatsuki's badass level is OFF THE CHARTS! I love this character quite a bit. He has amazing power and the author didn't screw up by making him overpowered because in fact the author made him unable to use magic bearing a weakness however he is just so badass that he turned his weakness into a strength. All the other characters are very well thought through although none are as captivating.They really did kind of force a second season and I really hope we get one! I don't necessarily like reading action light novels because much of it is visual so I hope the anime adaptation carries on. Many things were left lingering and I feel as though this season was barely scratching the surface because the only time a clear plot was in fact introduced was at the very end of the season. They left way too many things lingering but that's because they were probably just following the novels.

Story - The episodes are full of action, with plenty of funny moments and few dull ones. There is a little bit too much fan service in the show for me personally, but I'm sure others will love all the boob and panty shots. I think they expected this to go for several seasons, so much of the overall story is an unknown.2. Art - Okay, I thought some of the characters faces looked a bit too round and for some reason, whenever faces are like this, they seem lacking in detail. They also use hair colours like...pink and green.3. Characters - The protagonist Akatsuki is a cocky jerk, but still comes off as cool rather than a perverted creep. The lead female, Miu is a little whiny at times and she has ridiculous sized breasts. She doesn't seem to do much besides provide fanservice and need rescuing. Even so, I grew to like her character more towards then end of the story. The only other character of note is Haruka. Haruka came across as a bit of a bitch at first, which made it more fun watching Akatsuki mess with her. I grew to like her character quite a bit though.4. Overall - An enjoyable action comedy, marred by the fact it got cancelled after the first season.You will probably enjoy this if you liked High School DxD, Testament of New Sister Devil, Sekirei or Maken Ki. pink and green.3.

Definitely a strong male lead who isn't afraid of harassing the nearby girls.  However, it shoots itself in the foot as it feels like we've been shoe horned into a confusing plot line which is described as vaguely as possible to try and make the show look cool.The characters are definitely the shows most redeeming feature as the protagonist is the complete opposite of the shy ecchi harems you normally see.  He is portrayed as a panty snatcher, molester, and peeper in a good light....Its kinda hard to describe but the girl victims do the kya screams while believing that he isn't really a bad guy at heart.  However its merely a fresh twist on an old cliche to be honest.  As the show goes on you get somewhat tired of his antics.  Its like an original idea that was really poorly done to be honest.As far as the harem and ecchi bits go, its the picture perfect cliche of the harem/ecchi genres.  However like I said, the daring protagonist who openly gropes his harem girls to their chagrin does add a fresh twist to it.The art and sound is pretty standard.  Nothing particularly high tech, but nothing particularly bad either.  Basically very little is animated in each of the scenes.  Its an ecchi thrown out their because people will buy ecchis no matter what.The story is by far the worst part of the show.  The entire time I watched it I felt like they just threw out one half explained idea after another.  They throw in new characters who's back stories are left a complete mystery but they are treated like front row side characters.  They add in all kinds of weird plot elements which are never explained past being introduced.  The whole thing felt so sloppy I was tempted to drop it half way even though I consider myself to be a part of the niche audience this show was aimed at....

With a low bar for hit's, by this I mean that even if this show appeals to you, you'll most likely end up ratting it an 8-6 at best.Plot 4/10By far the weakest element here, the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I can tell they really tried to add a real story to this.

We try again to like another harem anime.I managed to marathon all 12 episodes in less than 2-days, which was fairly easy, because then I skipped most of the opening music, and closing music. All of which was really not very good. I even went against my own principles in marathoning the show, just to try to find good things about the show.As some of you know, I dislike j-pop hi-speed rhythm music. While theses musical pieces were made to sound reminiscent of ""Unbreakable Machine Doll\' the end product was not anywhere near as memorable. The singer for the opening theme song, was...quite good, and I felt sorry for her; as she was stuck trying to make something out of a song played more than twice as fast as necessary.There was actually a tune, and almost had some noticeable harmonies there, but most of the things I was willing to like about the songs, was hidden in all the screaming guitars, and hi-speed playback. It almost felt like the music composers and arrangers had it in their minds to hide the good parts intentionally. Oh well, these people that annoyed me, and my musical sensibilities should be horsewhipped, but I\'m killing too much time already in talking about the unmemorable music.I DID however like the soundtrack sounds and musical riffs. Not bad at all. There! I said it. Something good about the show.***Now I want to talk about the Story. I will save the characters for last. I know, that\'s backwards, even for me, but there\'s some bass-ackwards stuff in this anime anyways. And I\'ll get to that too.This story does have a few items that are clearly innovative. But the plot I wanted to see was the one they hinted at thru the whole anime, and we never got to see it. And we never will. Don\'tcha just hate that? We\'ll get to that, but let\'s get to the main story.Okay, I\'m not gonna get into a lot of story specifics, but I do want to mention a few basic ideas from the plotline, in passing, that I found interesting. Careful about the phrase ""May you live in interesting times. "" This was an old Roman curse. So careful what you wish for.Anyhow, we have a inter-dimensional rift story here, where people from other places come into a second place (always the same first destination), chase girls, sometimes even a queen or a princess or two (most of the new arrivals are male Americans, I love that (grin)), then they get bored and go home. No apparent offspring launched out at me as a viewer. So all is fun and games.And oh yea, when you\'re in this other land, you have to learn weird old english, in the floweriest of terms. If you don\'t speak as they do, they turn to their fellows and say things like; ""Avast, hast thy knave lost his reason, or mayhaps he is a stranger!"" Which of course confuses our visitor, and in the case of our main character, prompts hm to bash a fellow in the face, or strip a girl from her undies.Which they would not have been wearing in such a backward culture anyway.

But without the undies, we would have lost more than half of the fan-service. Which I like, as long as people don\'t get hurt from it, or gets in the way of telling the story. Which happens in this story. A lot!!!Let\'s describe the culture as best we can. I counted a lot of women in this show. And some fellows, but mostly women. After all, if one expects to have harems in any culture, you would want a culture that contains sufficient women that most men who want a harem can have one. Right?And not one of these women can be over the age of 22, and none of them can be fat, and they can only be flat-chested if they are under the age of 14. And the male population are inconsiderate bastards, almost uniformly; which these females mostly go head over heals over. Cool! There\'s reality for yah!Both worlds, Earth (maybe, just a guess) and this other place, operate in the above fashion, although the Earth demographic seems to be slightly more balanced. But not by much, barely noticeable.Look folks, I like a little fantasy as much as the next fellow, but this is stretching a lot of my ability to suspend disbelief.***Now I wanna talk about dialog. I like good dialog. But I have to say, when the male hero is talking his future girlfriend out of committing suicide, it is a good idea to keep one eye on that giant ***Dragon*** trying to fry you two to atoms. This is exactly what happened in one of many scenes, which began to resemble a Shakespearian rendition of Hamlet;""Alas, poor Yorick!

Prithee, Horatio, tellme one thing.""Meaning, in not to make too much a point on it, there was too much dialog, in about half the episodes. And the dialog was irrationally placed at points, where large speeches got in the way of timely and pressing events. Like big fights, or strong conflicted differences of opinion.***And now I get to the characters and their juxtaposition. What we have here is a form of double reversal of roles here.The male lead is Goku, from DBZ. I realize that is very brief, but there is literally nothing else. He even glows in the dark like Goku when he gets really, really annoyed. He postures like Goku. He has the bravado of Goku. He even yells often about needing \'more power\' or the lack of it, and makes insinuations that imply that it would be nice if he could strangle his opponent to death, it would make him quite happy, like Goku.The female lead, playing his non-related sister from the other world, plays a meek and mild little person, that before the end of the show grows into a person who isn\'t bashful about anything (she gets her fear muscle completely burned out of her by the events of the anime).Meanwhile, this little cutie is the biggest chested girl in the anime, of course; and shapely, quite pretty and has a nice little sweet name ""Miu"". Sounds like the cutest little lap-kitten on the face of the earth. And she becomes this little piece of heaven, as the show runs along.Mind you, she is the daughter of the nastiest Dark Lord and King of the dark and putrified forests of the other place. Yep, she\'s just gonna be sweetness and light, upon everybody she meets. I believe, I believe; yes I believe I will have another piece of pie. The authors have GOT to be kidding me.We have a lesbian girl who attempts rape of at least one girl in the locker room of their school, and everybody is just fine with that. Putting aside she\'s lesbian, that\'s still unwanted physical assault. Lemme try that again. That is unwanted physical assault. And should have gotten her expelled and jailed. If a fella had done that in the show, he would have had a wonderful view out his window at the graybar hotel.We have an entire student body government that behaves like the Nazi High Command. And that never changes through the whole anime, even when they begin to see reason. They\'re still rude, officious, crass, and generally ill mannered. Oh yea, I fergot. They lean towards dumb as lawn fertilizer, eventually taking all their productive leads from our main hero, with strong misgivings, and still blaming him for everything.****Were there things I liked? Yep! I liked that Miu was is a lovely sweet girl that can be talked into anything, because she trusts. A rare and pleasant characteristic. I didn\'t believe it for one second, but it was cute.I liked the artwork, most of which was the stuff which has become standard fair from Funimation, Lantis, etc.I liked that our crass and irritating super hero from the funny-farm does actually feel some responsibility for his actions. It\'s hard to find, and he wrecks havok upon all observers, including his own friends, by doing something really, really thoughtless. A lot! But if he wasn\'t that lovable guy we have known and enjoyed, hell most of that fan-service would never have got off the ground.Oh! I almost left out a complete thought. Shame on me. The hinted at subplot is the one I wanted to see. Not more of. It should have been the material for the entire main plot, and now requires a second season to actually do anything about. Which we will never get.That plot is the hinted at Star-Chamber, operated by Kyouya Hikami, a very potentially mean element, and subplotted again by  Motoharu Kaitou. Ostensibly these characters and others, are involved in silencing opposition to stable governments all over the world, via the use of their superior super-magic. The sub-text is one of domination of lesser mages, and the destruction of all forces that would contest their power.But we don\'t get to see that. And as I\'ve said, we won\'t either. Oh well, nuts.I give ""Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica"" a strong 6. quite good, and I felt sorry for her; as she was stuck trying to make something out of a song played more than twice as fast as necessary.There was actually a tune, and almost had some noticeable harmonies there, but most of the things I was willing to like about the songs, was hidden in all the screaming guitars, and hi-speed playback.

He even yells often about needing \'more power\' or the lack of it, and makes insinuations that imply that it would be nice if he could strangle his opponent to death, it would make him quite happy, like Goku.The female lead, playing his non-related sister from the other world, plays a meek and mild little person, that before the end of the show grows into a person who isn\'t bashful about anything (she gets her fear muscle completely burned out of her by the events of the anime).Meanwhile, this little cutie is the biggest chested girl in the anime, of course; and shapely, quite pretty and has a nice little sweet name ""Miu"". Sounds like the cutest little lap-kitten on the face of the earth. And she becomes this little piece of heaven, as the show runs along.Mind you, she is the daughter of the nastiest Dark Lord and King of the dark and putrified forests of the other place. Yep, she\'s just gonna be sweetness and light, upon everybody she meets. I believe, I believe; yes I believe I will have another piece of pie. The authors have GOT to be kidding me.We have a lesbian girl who attempts rape of at least one girl in the locker room of their school, and everybody is just fine with that. Putting aside she\'s lesbian, that\'s still unwanted physical assault. Lemme try that again. That is unwanted physical assault. And should have gotten her expelled and jailed. If a fella had done that in the show, he would have had a wonderful view out his window at the graybar hotel.We have an entire student body government that behaves like the Nazi High Command. And that never changes through the whole anime, even when they begin to see reason. They\'re still rude, officious, crass, and generally ill mannered. Oh yea, I fergot. They lean towards dumb as lawn fertilizer, eventually taking all their productive leads from our main hero, with strong misgivings, and still blaming him for everything.****Were there things I liked? Yep! I liked that Miu was is a lovely sweet girl that can be talked into anything, because she trusts. A rare and pleasant characteristic. I didn\'t believe it for one second, but it was cute.I liked the artwork, most of which was the stuff which has become standard fair from Funimation, Lantis, etc.I liked that our crass and irritating super hero from the funny-farm does actually feel some responsibility for his actions. It\'s hard to find, and he wrecks havok upon all observers, including his own friends, by doing something really, really thoughtless. A lot! But if he wasn\'t that lovable guy we have known and enjoyed, hell most of that fan-service would never have got off the ground.Oh! I almost left out a complete thought. Shame on me. The hinted at subplot is the one I wanted to see. Not more of. It should have been the material for the entire main plot, and now requires a second season to actually do anything about. Which we will never get.That plot is the hinted at Star-Chamber, operated by Kyouya Hikami, a very potentially mean element, and subplotted again by  Motoharu Kaitou. Ostensibly these characters and others, are involved in silencing opposition to stable governments all over the world, via the use of their superior super-magic. The sub-text is one of domination of lesser mages, and the destruction of all forces that would contest their power.But we don\'t get to see that. And as I\'ve said, we won\'t either. Oh well, nuts.I give ""Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica"" a strong 6.', 'As various others have mentioned, this anime has a main character who isn\'t wimpy, which is a great change from the usual. It\'s also the opposite of some fantasy stories where someone is thrown into another world and has to gain powers to save it. Instead, Akatsuki has already been through this, and is ready to return home after defeating a demon lord. What is more interesting is that this is a common event, and there is a school, aptly called Babel where people hone their skills from other worlds.The main character can\'t use magic, but can manipulate the ""energy"" of his opponents bodies,...which is also something new. He also doesn\'t give the speeches about friendship etc that other shounen heroes tend to give. He stands up for the weak, is a pervert and has power.The anime itself has elements of fantasy/magical/supernatural, ecchi, and harem. The harem part I usually hate, but it\'s not so bad here, if predictable. The ecchi is a bit pathetic in how they bring it up in most episodes. I usually love fantasy/magic anime, but I\'m still unsure about this one.I\'m beginning to think I\'ll be disappointed in the second half of the series.Story- 6After 7 episodes there still isn\'t much of one, but there seem to be some interesting developments thus far. It will either turn out grossly predictable, or will have some sort of interesting twist, hard to say so far.  There has been some interesting foreshadowing of events to come, and some characters who may not be all they seem, but the story thus far seems more ""how can we get Miu naked?""... I don\'t care about fan service most of the time, but to dedicate an entire episode to her picking out a bra and getting her breasts fondled by a shopkeeper and the guy who is posing has her brother... yeah, it\'s just pathetic. The most recent episode I stopped watching after the girls entered a contest of tag that results in removing someones bathing suit. It\'s just stupid to dedicate 2 episodes (thus far) out of 12 to fanservice. You have an interesting story, develop it! If you want fanservice, fine, but you can include it while developing a story...Character- 7The main character is a welcome change from similar guys in his position. However, he tends to rub me the wrong way sometimes. I still like him though, it\'s nice to see a main male character that\'s tough and has elements of fanservice. Little is known about him, thus far he has been revealed to be arrogant, strong, perverted and with some intelligence. But he has to be the one to save the day, which is a little too predictable.  Like in a recent episode where I thought we would get so see some different characters kick ass, out he comes, completely out of nowhere to save the day. You\'re allowed to have more than one kick ass character! He\'s the ""bad boy"" type, who secretly has a kind heart.Haruka is perhaps the most predictable of female characters. She\'s the bitchy annoying one that gets in embarrassing situations while having it in for the main character, but then will eventually develop feelings for him.The characters just aren\'t that great. I like the new blonde guy, because he seems to have his own agenda, but otherwise they are all pretty predictable.Art and sound are fine, the art isn\'t as good as many I\'ve seen, but not too bad either. As for enjoyment, thus far I\'d give it a 6, but I\'m hoping it will be able to change that in the second half! which is also something new.

And I\'ve seen LOT of them, especially from this genre.I like the story LOT, which is saying much because other anime have kind of always highschool bla bla meh stories. This one has a captivating story and I regret not knowing more of it because not much is shown as his life before the story this anime...is based on.He is perverted, honest, masculine and no pushover. He always knows what to do, when to do it and how to do it. Some critique though is that he is kind of a stone statue in some ways. He doesn\'t show desire too much and is kind of condescending if you dislike his attitude. But that\'s personal taste IMO.I desperately want more seasons, but I doubt they will come.I would DEFINITELY recommend it to people that like this genre. is based on.He is perverted, honest, masculine and no pushover.

Of course you'll probably forget about it after several months, but during show itself you'll have great enjoyment.Story and plot part were never strong sides of harems, same applies to this one. Story is fair enough to maintain interest. What is kinda unusual is strong main character, this is so refreshing after watching tons of harems with useless main male chars.If you want to watch another harem show with cool main male character, decent art and sound, fantasy background, then this show is for you "", ""If you like overpowered heroes and overpowering ecchi, you'll like this.  It has a lot of interesting pieces, but doesn't utilize them, instead focusing too much on the sex stuff.  A lot of parts can actually be considered softcore hentai in my opinion.I enjoy the overpowered hero genre, which is why I am disappointed in this.  The series sets up a number of possible plots that could fill a second season on their own, but it has never had a sequel and really doesn't deserve one.I would say it's worth one view and then can be forgotten, but...it's definitely not for everyone. it's definitely not for everyone."", 'Animated by Studio Arms, and directed by Kujou Rion, both of which have made nothing but porn-related works. This show is no exception; it is heavy on fan service, has ecstatic in its title, and the main picture shows one guy and many chicks. Plus it is the adaptation of a light novel, so it doesn’t take a genius to tell it won’t be a mature show about the meaning of life.Let’s start by something easy; the production values are average to bad for their time. Half the time I felt like I was watching a low budget hentai; dull animation and cookie cutter characters...defined only by hair colour and boob size. The soundtrack is also nothing but forgettable songs. There are supposed to be some famous voice actors in it but I sure didn’t give a damn if they all sound like retards with the material they were given.The story is about this guy who was magically transported to another world, where he became an RPG hero and defeated the king of demons even before the show begins. He finds a portal to return home but decides to take with him the demon’s daughter in order to protect her from all the people who would hold a grudge against her. Back in his world he is enrolled in the special school for all kids with superpowers and has the girl pretending to be his sister. And since this is a no-brainer show we are not supposed to ask why his parents didn’t run to see their son safe and sound or why is transportation to other worlds taken so lightly. As I said, it is a heavy on fan service show, so you must enjoy it just for that and not for anything else. All I have described above are just the excuse; they barely elaborate or flesh out the whole transport to other worlds theme. The plot is BS and all you get is basically excuses for the protagonist to look awesome while dealing with high-schoolers who are too high on hormones and keep looking for excuses to molest a girl or pick a fight with the protagonist.The protagonist is memorable for being a parody of RPG heroes. He has reached epic levels from his fight with the demon king and has learned some really ridiculous powerful skills, such as removing underwear from girls in a fraction of a second or making them pee for the lulz. He is not a wuss like most protagonists these days and treats women only as f**k holes. Other than that he is blunt, uninteresting, and named after the villains in that gay show called Naruto. The demon’s daughter is supposed to be a tragic character for having to hide her identity and rebuild her life, but as I said the show barely tries to flesh out the theme of the story. Thus she is treated mostly as a sperm bucket with a rack that never seems to fit in clothes. Thus it’s impossible to sympathize with her; plus her name is like the sound of a cat. The rest of the characters are nothing much; the girls are treated as cosplaying whores, while the boys are just jerks who want nothing else but to fight. Literally, there is nothing memorable about them despite the occasional sloppy attempts at drama and fleshing out.In a similar way every single thing that is going on in this show is just a poor excuse for fan service. Trust me when I say they are learning nothing in that school, the teachers are useless, and it’s just a bunch of horny teenagers finding pitiful excuses to blow shit up and molest others just for the heck of it. So basically every episode is about the protagonist shamelessly molesting girls who instead of reporting him literally fall for him, and boys who want to compare their peckers with the protagonist. Any drama or plot that sometimes tries to pop up is forgotten as soon as the next underwear flies off in the air. And the ending is not even an ending but rather a warm-up for a second season that never came. Yes, it was yet another infomercial for selling more novels instead of a proper adaptation.As a whole there is nothing to see here; just another forgettable no-brainer show. I must admit that it’s at least good for its fan service. It is bordering a softcore hentai at times, with a protagonist who is one step away from a rapist, and that makes it more interesting that the usual crap we get in harems. The boobs are never censored and there are even some scenes of sexual foreplay.

This is a contrast from Shinmai Maou no Testament where is of the female leads actually had skills that were needed and contributed to...the harem as a whole.If you've not seen Shinmai Maou no Testament yet, just skip this one and go watch the better story. the harem as a whole.If you've not seen Shinmai Maou no Testament yet, just skip this one and go watch the better story."", 'The scripting and voice acting for the dub are good, except for stretches in later episodes where a turn of phrase is used in nearly every line for every character, no matter how out of place. Still, one of the reasons to watch is the perky, comedic writing of the English dub over. Other reasons would be the genre fusion, random sex scenes, funny sketches, and self-insert chadly main character doing all the things you wish your virgin main character from those other anime shows you watch in your Mom\'s basement would do instead of being virgins.The premise starts with Akki the rogue hero who...has been Isekai\'d, saved that world from the demon lord, and is now actually coming back because he has ""responsibilities"" he can\'t just neglect despite the protests of his gf there. He enrolls in military hogwarts and begins to collect bra straps. His crew is a lesbian, a baby (okay she\'s probably 8, but skipped at least that many grades), and his sister who is actually the daughter of the demon lord he killed in the other realm. He seems to have a respect for and relationship to the demon lord he killed that motivates his actions. At military hogwarts, he sexually assaults women including the lesbian, little sister, and little girl in his posse nearly as often as they are on screen together. Can remove bras and panties by looking in their general direction, roughly 2000 bras and maybe ~500 panties are removed in total by the end of the show\'s run.As you can see, this show has a certain ""rogue aesthetica"".

It is a self-insert fantasy to an extent that is actually rare, which says a lot for an anime.More on the aesthetics - there\'s tits, ass, sex, and sexual assualt - but the girls like it, because it\'s not wrong if they like it right? Watching the one well endowed girl freak out over what to do with her enormous rack is hilarious. The gags are quite funny, the general level of the dialogue and open minded character interactions is high enough. The character designs and artwork are both passable. There is some mystery and grand narrative, the ending is fun.

Also, he steals all the bras and all the hearts and rides a supersonic motorcycle that would kill and has killed lesser men on contact. I prefer this to virgin protagonist, loser protagonist, boring protagonist, naruto protagonist, and so on.

The bad aspects would definitely be that the animation and sound were mediocre, the voice acting however was good. For an anime in 2012, and an action anime at that, the animation could have been MUCH better....more colorful, better fluid movements of the characters and so on, instead, it looked pretty much like a ""normal anime"" from 2006, especially when you compare the fact that 2006 brought out some good graphical animes (if i remember correctly). Another ridiculous aspect of the show was the nudity....the sheer amount of nudity was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. Even the fanservice...and ecchi scenes were overkill, yet at times important. I mean I get Akatsuki building character and relationships based on his EXTREME YET COOL pervertedness,  but the nude scenes were not necessary for any of them.Thing is though, despite the fact that the animation and sound sucked, the story was REALLY DEEP. It was INSANELY INTERESTING, whereby there is not only room for a prequel; but a sequel is ALMOST A MUST. I mean the reason this show MAY get a bad score by other reviewers is simply for the fact that ""IT ENDED WAY TOO EARLY FOR ANY RECOGNITION"". Its basically like watching one piece or naruto and ending it in the first 13 episodes.....with ONLY that much it basically crap. I\'m pretty sure that if this show continued, more people would see the worth of it; its story gives room for a BUNCH of arcs while centering around the main plot of well....real earth with its superpowered organizations. All in all, the story has a 10 point (out of 10) potential, which 12 episodes alone CAN NEVER BRING OUT. So despite the fact that the 12 episodes were NOT THAT GREAT, the potential WAS EPIC. That attributes to the high score that I gave this show.In terms of characters, well the class president was interesting, so was the lesbian though she wasn\'t THAT interesting, MIU was a typical idiot when she was ready but other than that there was potential for her, and the vice president was okay I guess, though she was USUALLY annoying throughout. The blonde hair guy (can\'t remember his name) was REALLY COOL and mysterious, and I really wanted to see more of him. AND THEN THERE\'S AKATSUKI........two words ""EPIC BADASS"". ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE LEVEL this guy was EPIC; in fighting he was SUPREME, in planning/strategizing/reading people he was EPIC, in his way to attract people was ALSO EPIC. This is the HERO WE\'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. I mean he is UNPREDICTABLY PREDICTABLE....what I mean by this is YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO WIN IN THE END, BUT HOW HE DOES IT IS LIKE ""DAMN DIDN\'T SEE THAT COMING"". He is simply EPIC and FOR him alone, the score for this show went up higher due to ""THE RULE OF COOL"". The ""RULE OF COOL"" states that when a main character is SO BADASS despite the show being.....okay.....the show gets a higher rating (past shows were cowboy bebop and trigun.....they were great shows but were even greater due to the main characters).....that said Hagure Yuusha is definately a WATCH, BUT only a BUY if the series actually continues, because if it does it would be MEMORABLE IF THE STORY IS TOLD RIGHT! and ecchi scenes were overkill, yet at times important.

He is simply EPIC and FOR him alone, the score for this show went up higher due to ""THE RULE OF COOL"". The ""RULE OF COOL"" states that when a main character is SO BADASS despite the show being.....okay.....the show gets a higher rating (past shows were cowboy bebop and trigun.....they were great shows but were even greater due to the main characters).....that said Hagure Yuusha is definately a WATCH, BUT only a BUY if the series actually continues, because if it does it would be MEMORABLE IF THE STORY IS TOLD RIGHT!', 'I am 7 episodes in. I have seen hentai with more plot. It is hard to understand what the point of the story is halfway through.This series is just lewd fan service. The main character is just some sort of ""perfect pervert"". Mr Nice Guy who acts like a knight in shining armour but also molests/steals the undergarments of the entire female cast. It is hard to even relate with the characters since they are basically just caricatures. The main character is just annoying. I won\'t even mention his ""sister"". She is even more annoying.I do not mind the occasional trash series that does not...take itself seriously. However, this one is just dreadful. take itself seriously.

Please treat me well.This could\'ve been good. This could\'ve been an actual honest-to-gods properly done good harem anime.... Where did it all go wrong???Story: 3This story had an interesting backdrop where a hero finished mopping up the demon lord and brought back his daughter as souvenir. So where did it go wrong?? Well first off, they started the series off right when he was leaving the fantasy realm after defeating the demon lord, therefore he was already immensely powerful, so powerful that he could potentially win every single battle, single-handedly. Here was an MC that could literally be god due to how powerful...he is. A good comparison would be to say that his rpg gaming level is 99. Or perhaps... ""Vegeta. What does the scouter say about his power level?"" ""It\'s over 9000!"" But seriously... It might as well have been that way. He may not be one of THOSE current conventional hero MCs, where they are emo edgelord ""badasses"" that they have a fancy sabers and wields lots of powerful spells making them pseudo mage knight or ""Hero"" class, because he can\'t use magic at all. But instead he got something else.... Something that renders magic almost completely obsolete. A martial arts ability called the Linked Energy Manipulation. Have you ever heard of the ""plot armor"", where a character can never truly die or know defeat? If you have, know that that ability that he wields is what I dubb with my own little coin term as the ""plot sword"", where an item/tool/weapon/ability is so powerful, it might as well be on the level of godlike ability that cannot be overcome. And that\'s exactly what that ability was. It made him... Nigh invincible. Able to perform feats that is almost on the level of Dragonball Z... So don\'t let that huge black sword on the cover shot of the series fool you. That\'s just the bait. And also despite its cool colors and whatnot, its design is pretty ugly in terms of badass looking anime swords... Anyways, his real power comes from that ability, which he even boasts it as such himself. And that makes him do a lot of things from swiping girls\' underwears without them noticing or feeling a thing or him giving the beat-down to every opponent he ever faces. So if you\'re expecting some kind of character development or progression by walking alongside him to his goal of fame and glory? Pft. Forget it. He was already there. It\'s like arriving late to a party while almost everything is gone. Now it\'s just the slight after-party you would have to settle for. And that\'s what this all was. There was no serious threat or overarching story. He just came back, got enrolled into a mandatory school, just so he can fight them? And they want to see if he\'s the so-called ""true hero""??? Anyways, this story was brought together all so poorly that when the ending came... One could be left wondering ""What did I just watch? And what can I take from all of this?"". Another sad thing was that he was mainly in a futuristic Japan setting where technology and society has progressed a lot esp when recognizing the existence of many other worlds/dimensions including the fantasy one that he conquered. Unfortunately the world he went back home was not much explored beyond his school. And the fantasy realm was almost left forgotten until the literal ""tune-in next season"" cliffhanger cliche at the end that foreshadowed its importance. But otherwise.... A complete mess.A good potential material of a backdrop plot, don\'t get me wrong. But it was all done SO poorly. I mean a powerful sentient bike where it only ever accepted his father, but somehow accepted him in mere seconds and off-screen no less? WTF????Art: 8The art was honestly VERY good. Everything looked bright and shiny as to give off some kind of majesty or high quality. Of course, it\'s not on the level of a AAA anime, but it got the job done. Even the ecchi scenes were very engaging. If you know what I mean.Sound: 4Honestly can\'t remember the music. And I just watched it for the first time few weeks ago. That should tell you how impressionable it was. The voice acting and sound effects were fine I guess. But nothing that stood out and made me say ""OMG!"".Character: 3Oh here we go. Other than the story, this is the main bread and butter.... And they utterly disappointed. His attitude is one of arrogance and confidence. But don\'t expect some development because he never gets into a vulnerable spot. Of course, that makes some Western audiences go all googly-eyes for a char like him that is not emo edge lord or a walking mess or sissy MC. But as such... He is not very relatable at all. He might as well be the Sylvester Stallone of anime where he can commando everything if he wants to and gets the girl in the end. Utter walking mass of muscle perfection. Which is a doubled edged sword, since not everyone is not looking for a male fantasy power trip or already perfected/flawless character. Then there is the main heroine. If you\'re looking for a character development there, then nope. She only falls for him like a good damsel in distress would. But she offers little to no help in terms of battles or overall plot progression. She tends to be more of a nuisance, like that the princess that keeps getting captured and you gotta go and reluctantly save. That\'s how ""good"" of a character she is. Otherwise she\'s worst than main heroine of other Yuusha anime, the one where the MC couldn\'t be a hero and instead had to get a job. Because as I said, she offers very little to the story since the MC is strong enough to protect her and save the world all in one day. So she\'s the titular damsel in distress while only being good for eye candy... Although she\'s pretty much the ONLY main eyecandy. Since like the other yuusha anime I mentioned, she shares same parallels with that main heroine Phino, where their tits are the only tits that matter. You can clearly see and witness all of the hugeness (since it\'s some kind of unwritten anime rule that main heroines gotta be busty as hell) and shape of their breasts, to even their nipples. But.... That leaves no room for other girls. Sure, there are other girls who get stripped, but nothing is shown that leaves less for the imagination. And worst of all is Kuzuha. She\'s barely to no reveal at all because of the nature of her character design (her being a small girl aka loli)And there\'s not much to say about other chars since they are usually pushed off to the sideline, while the MAIN FOCUS and treat that the anime is trying to keep pushing fans towards is the MH aka Miu....""Only Miu deserves your unworth eyes, peasants. Look upon her splendor!""-This animeSeriously, if you are looking for character development or plethora of nice girls being out on display as nice treats for your eyes? Too bad you only get Miu. This is not DxD or even Trinity Seven.Enjoyment: 2Story sucked. Character development was very little. Fanservice was so one-sided by favoring a lot towards MH. Honestly I had hoped to see more interactions with cute Kuzuha and pretty Haruka, but alas beyond that single ep of them being the main focus, it was not meant to be. And even in their ""dedicated"" ep, you could count on Miu to be there constantly to be the distracting main attraction that you just can\'t escape...Overall: 2Terrible... This could\'ve been so good! This could\'ve actually had a future more or less the same as Trinity Seven or even better. But it utterly failed...Sad too because this hero could\'ve prolly owned his own harem if he wanted to... If he stopped focusing too much on the MH. I mean I know they are MHs for a reason, but it give a break please. This is why anime harems are never a true thing and can never be truly realized as a harem. It\'s all a sham. After all, daytime/evening animes or non-hentai animes and games couldn\'t dare to show polygamy of all things. Therefore, stick with MH because.... They are the MH!Anyways, as I have mentioned how the MC is fist swinging terminator commando. He was like made for Western audiences. And as such him and his pathetic series did not fare well with our Japanese counterparts and thus bombed so bad that a 2nd season is nowhere in sight. And I for one say good riddance. Even though it left the series on a cliff-hanger, I don\'t have much hopes or expectations out of a series and MC that is just MH crazed and obsessed. This was one of those hopeful bets that you place on with all of your spending on because it looked so promising, but it quickly became a gut-wrenching train wreck or should I say a ""wrecking ball"" of an anime..... This is definitely by far one of the most guiltiest pleasure animes I have ever seen. And not necessarily a good kind either. If I had to compare it to a game, this wasn\'t God of War. This was Gears of War... That bad.So I suggest that whoever wishes to see a MC to not be a ssisy for once and take names and make all of the girls his hoes, then go ahead. But don\'t expect much beyond the MH, which he switches his laser targeting to, and any sort of good story. Because there is almost none. Just fanservice up the butt. And only plot to advance the story to make a cliffhanger to have people watch this and stay interested beyond the tits... he is. A good comparison would be to say that his rpg gaming level is 99.

Standard anime fare. Nothing stands out, other than female face design being a little ""off"" to my tastes....There\'s some solid boob action, including some nice fondling, but nothing more than that.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------Average again. Sound and music exists. Characters have voices.Story - 5/10-------------Mr. Chad Chaddington is one of the few people summoned to another world to be a hero. And a hero he does become. When he finishes his job, he takes the daughter of his final enemy and returns to his own world to be Chad Chaddington the student, with Demon Lord Daughter as his little sister.The entire anime is just the usual shounen ""school arc"", except the MC is in god mode and does whatever he wants, so we mostly just get slice of life with random action.There is an underlying grand story that is hinted, but effectively zero progress is made towards revealing it. Which definitely hurts the show as a whole, because it hints greatness but all it gives us is mediocrity.The final episodes try to establish some advanced story lines, but it just doesn\'t get enough time to go anywhere. Though I guess the anime did its job of trying to establish some interest in the source material. I just wish more anime shows would actually go all the way instead of being bare bones attempts of temporarily spiking source material popularity..Characters - 6/10---------------------The entire show is basically on the manly shoulders of mr. Chad Chaddington. He\'s a competent MC who showcases a pretty amazing balance of being a ""nice guy"" and being a total ""I do whatever the fuck I want"" delinquent.He\'s unbelievably strong and doesn\'t for a moment hesitate to show it off. The first bully in school that tries to mouth off, gets blasted through the nearest wall. The student council who tries to discipline him get similarly blasted. Chad Chaddington does not give a fuck.At the same time he is incredibly smart and thoughtful, and even sorta kind where needed. He\'s an absolute sexual stud not even slightly concerned about helping her fake sister find a perfect pair of bras and panties, flexing perfect knowledge of female anatomy and lingerie use. Similarly, dealing with her embarrassment by spreading it around amongst her friends, so that nobody is singled out.He\'ll run around having fun stealing bras off of girls, but never going further to harass them. It\'s all fun and games to him. He even helps a few of the girls deal with their emotional issues caused by the school system. And if a girl happens to shed a tear anywhere, he\'ll show up to save the day, because that\'s what being a Chad is all about.The rest of the cast unfortunately doesn\'t live up to his standard. It\'s cliche after cliche and trope after trope. Fake sister is a complete damsel in distress, other girls aren\'t really even worth mentioning, their personalities far too unexplored.It\'s simply a story about Chad.---Total - 6/10---It was a nice, short, fairly fun, action packed romp.

I mean, I know its a type of magic but like.. cmon, a little bit more context would have been nice. anyway, overall, I was confused 2 thirds of...the time and the only times I wasn't confused was when they got their dirty-dirty freak-freak on which I mean, I'm not complaining about at all (nicely done and much appreciated). Also, I absolutely loved the dialogs in it. Brilliant world views, ideologies. Very relatable. Which is why I'd have loved to see it fleshed out a little bit more. Overall it was a decent anime the time and the only times I wasn't confused was when they got their dirty-dirty freak-freak on which I mean, I'm not complaining about at all (nicely done and much appreciated). Also, I absolutely loved the dialogs in it. Brilliant world views, ideologies. Very relatable. Which is why I'd have loved to see it fleshed out a little bit more. Overall it was a decent anime"", 'Animated by Studio Arms, and directed by Kujou Rion, both of which have made nothing but porn-related works. This show is no exception; it is heavy on fan service, has ""aesthetic"" in its title, and the main picture shows one guy and many chicks. Plus it is the adaptation of a light novel, so it doesn’t take a genius to tell it won’t be a mature show about the meaning of life.Let’s start by something easy; the production values are average to bad for their time. Half the time I felt like I was watching a low budget hentai; with dull animation and cookie cutter...characters defined only by hair colour and boob size. The soundtrack is also nothing but forgettable songs. There are supposed to be some famous voice actors in it but I sure don’t give a damn if they all sound like retards in this type of show.The story is about this guy who was magically transported to another world, where he became an RPG hero and defeated the king of demons even before the show begins. He finds a portal to return home but decides to take with him the demon’s daughter in order to protect her from all the people who would hold a grudge against her. Back in his world he is enrolled in the special school for all kids with superpowers and has the girl pretending to be his sister. And since this is a no-brainer show we are not supposed to ask why his parents didn’t run to see their son safe and sound or why is transportation to other worlds taken so lightly. As I said, it is a heavy on fan service show, so you must enjoy it just for that and not for anything else. All I have described above are just the excuse; they barely elaborate or flesh out the whole transport to other worlds theme. The plot is BS and all you get is basically excuses for the protagonist to look awesome while dealing with high-schoolers who are too high on hormones and keep looking for excuses to molest or fight.The protagonist is memorable for being a parody of RPG heroes. He has reached epic levels from his fight with the demon king and has learned some really ridiculous powerful skills, such as removing underwear from girls in a fraction of a second or making them pee for the lulz. He is not a wuss like most protagonists these days and treats women only as f**k holes. Other than that he is blunt, uninteresting, and named after the villains in that gay show called Naruto. The demon’s daughter is supposed to be a tragic character for having to hide her identity and rebuild her life, but as I said the show barely tries to flesh out the theme of the story. Thus she is treated mostly as a sperm bucket with a rack that never seems to fit in clothes. Thus it’s impossible to sympathize her; plus her name is like the sound of a cat. The rest of the characters are nothing much; the girls are treated as cosplaying whores, while the boys are just jerks who want nothing else but to fight. Literally, there is nothing memorable about them, despite the occasional sloppy attempts at drama and fleshing out.In a similar way every single thing that is going on in this show is just a poor excuse for fan service. Trust me when I say they are learning nothing in that school, the teachers are useless, and it’s just a bunch of horny teenagers finding pitiful excuses to blow shit up and molest others just for the heck of it. So basically every episode is about the protagonist shamelessly molesting girls who instead of reporting him literally fall for him, and boys who want to compare their peckers with the protagonist. Any drama or plot that sometimes tries to come through is forgotten as soon as the next underwear flies off in the air. And the ending is not even an ending but rather a warm-up for a second season.Nothing much to see here; just another forgettable no-brainer show. I must admit that it’s at least good for its fan service. It is bordering a softcore hentai at times, with a protagonist who is one step away from a rapist, and that makes it more interesting that the usual crap we get in ero shows. The boobs are never censored and there are even some scenes of sexual foreplay. Other than that of course it’s total garbage and if you try to watch it for any other reason you are going to hate it.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (generic)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 1/2 (basic)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (lots of pretty colours)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (not great but fitting with the feeling of the series)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 2/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 0/2 (loose)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (only the protagonist is memorable and even he not much)Personality 1/2 (cheesy)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 0/2 (doesn’t exist)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch)Memorability 2/4 (the bold protagonist is somewhat memorable for his boldness but that is all)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Art 0/1 (looks lazy)Sound 0/2 (sounds meh)Story 0/3 (just an excuse)Characters 2/4 (the bold protagonist is somewhat memorable for his boldness but that is all)VERDICT: 3.5/10 characters defined only by hair colour and boob size.

The balance in this anime is bad. I guess to be able to enjoy it you have to see it as a comedy, or even a parody.Setting:Most of the setting takes place on modern Earth. At random moments, young men and women are randomly spirited away to the fantasy world of Alayzard. It’s never explained how or why this happens, because reasons I guess. Eventually, the spirited people return to Earth...with magical abilities. This isn’t explained either. Academies have been built around the world to allow these people to train and hone their new abilities. The setting, despite the lack of explanations, could hold potential, but fails due to poor pacing, horrible characters, plot holes, boring fight scenes, and bad story development.Characters:Akatsuki:The main male lead. He was spirited away from Earth and became the most powerful person ever. So powerful that he singlehandedly defeated the Dark Lord prior to the beginning of the anime. You know how shounen main protagonists tend to start off as weak and awkward, and then slowly and steadily become increasingly stronger and self-sure until they are ready for the final fight against the main antagonist? That’s not the case here. Akatsuki starts off with endgame powers and absurd amounts of confidence. He’s overpowered and cocky as hell, and that ruins both the character and the anime itself. He’s a boring Gary-Stu.Thanks to his ability “energy manipulation”, Akatsuki can do almost whatever he wants, such as getting superspeed, super durability, put up shields, cling to surfaces, walk on water, heal wounds, and make any girls instantly orgasm with a mere touch. No, I’m not joking. He’s like Superman except he can’t fly and has no weakness for kryptonite.He can’t be deceived or tricked. He can instantly see whenever someone is lying or withholding information. Whenever there’s a problem at the school or in town, he’s there to solve it. At one point there’s even a hostage situation in the city where a terrorist holds a gun against a hostage’s head. Akatsuki literally appears out of nowhere with a flying kick and defeats the terrorist, with no explanation at all of how he even got there. Someone criticizes Akatsuki for his reckless plan, as the hostage could have been killed. Does he care about what they say? Of course not, he just casually shrugs and maintains his cocky expression, saying that they shouldn’t complain because he saved the day. Akatsuki is reckless and breaks many rules at the academy, but he’s never punished for it. Actually, he can’t be punished, because there's no one at the academy powerful enough to do so! Whenever anyone try they just end up humiliated.His overpowered skills and abilities is one reason why he’s a boring and annoying main character. The other reason is his personality. He’s always seen with a cocky smirk. He never doubts himself and always knows what to do. He has no character arc or development at all. He’s the same character throughout the entire season. It’s hard, or impossible to relate to someone who is so overpowered and has no flaws.Miu:Miu is the second main character. As the daughter of the Dark Lord (Who Akatsuki defeated), you would think that should be something to give her some interesting character depth. That’s not correct. The anime makes it really hard to believe that she’s the daughter of the most evil person to have ever existed. For about 80% of her screentime, Miu’s purpose is fanservice. There are many scenes, camera closeups, and jokes regarding her large breasts.She’s the only girl who has big breasts at the academy. Her breasts are even so big that there are no school uniforms that fit her. If she breathes too deeply, she pops buttons and seams. Thus, she has to walk around with a massive cleavage window. Her personality is onesided. She’s timid and shy about her breasts. In nearly every episode, something happens or is said about her breasts that makes her feel embarrassed, usually making her yell “Kyaaaaaa!”As she comes from a fantasy world, you would think that she would have trouble fitting in and adjusting to a modern one in a whole different world. But no, there are no problems at all.Other characters:There’s a bunch of other characters, most of them being academy students. You never really learn anything about them or their backgrounds. The girls are pretty shallow and meant mostly for fanserivce, and to be groped, teased, and be given forced orgasms by Akatsuki’s magical touch. A group of characters from Alayzard are named and introduced, but they are completely irrelevant and a waste of screentime. There’s also a mysterious group on Earth, whose faces and names are never revealed. Their motives are never revealed either, only that they have evil plans and that it involves Akatsuki somehow.Pacing & story:A lot of scenes and entire episodes are spent on fanservice and to show off how awesome and powerful Akatsuki is. You don’t learn much new in each episode. Occasionally you get small glimpses of what’s going on in Alayzard and the mysterious villain group on Earth, but that doesn’t lead to anything. It’s only in the last three episodes that the anime starts to get a bit a little interesting, meaning you can pretty much skip the first eight or so episodes and not really miss out on much.Action:I found the action scenes to be disappointing, as they’re so short and few that they can barely be called “action scenes”. Akatsuki is in many of these. As you may remember, he’s so overpowered that there’s no tension or danger at all. No matter what attacks the enemies throw against him, he either casually dodges or shrugs the attacks off. His “aura” alone is so overwhelming that others abilities just stop working. Even when the main villain unleashes their most powerful attack, Akatsuki just takes it without causing him any injury or pain! All this happens while he maintains the same stupid, cocky expression. Sometimes he lets the enemies hit him and feigns damage just to play with them. At one point, an enemy manages to poison Akatsuki, and I thought that he was finally going to struggle a bit. But no, a couple of minutes later he’s restored, thanks to his self-healing.The only real fight is at the end, and it gets ruined by Akatsuki never getting hurt, always being so confident and cocky. Most other characters barely get a chance to show off their weapons and abilities. Some fights happen offscreen. For example, a few, elite Academy students draw their weapons and attack terrorists. You hear them slash (and probably kill) the terrorists, but you never see this.Music:Not much stood out for me. There were some cozy and soft piano soundtracks. The opening was kind of catchy and cool. with magical abilities. This isn’t explained either. Academies have been built around the world to allow these people to train and hone their new abilities.

It's like they decided to build a story around a character that can be likable but can also be despised all at the same time, but strangely enough it works and it is what really got me to enjoy this anime to begin with.This anime tells the tale of a character that at the very first episode he conquers and defeats a dark lord and fulfills a promise to the dark lord to look after his daughter. Once he returns to his home world he takes the dark lord's daughter back with him. This anime strictly focuses...on the antics of him and and the dark lord's daughter as they return to Earth and they get enrolled into this school because of their skills in combat and magic. Unfortunately things are never that simple and bringing the dark lord's daughter into another world brings its own share of problems.The story of this anime is forgettable because it leaves way too many loose ends and while by the end of it the main aspect of the story is tied up it does end on a cliffhanger without anything being truly resolved. All throughout this anime, it constantly builds toward a confrontation between two characters and unfortunately it this conflict does not happen. This anime literally leaves you with more questions than answers but ultimately it gives you one hell of a ride.I think the biggest thing working towards the enjoyment of this anime is the character development of the main hero. I'm so use to male and female protagonists being reluctant heroes and trying to find their place in the world that they are presented in. This guy however, knows he is strong and he is definitely one of the most pompous, arrogant, and egotistical heroes you'll ever meet and his fair share of overly perverted moments can make him a very despicable character. If you look past the surface of the main character you can see that his heart is in the right place because he truly does care about the people around him, he does take the burden of trying to do it all without putting anyone's life in danger, and he truly believes he is doing the right thing when it comes to protecting the weak. This anime has some pretty hilarious laugh out loud moment that revolve around our titular main character especially when it comes to him contributing to the fan-service of this anime.Unfortunately we come to biggest strike against this anime which is the uncomfortable amount of fan-service and its definitely not going to shy away from it. Can we please at least have one episode where any of the female characters aren't completely naked. The thing its totally expected to have a little bit of fan-service in most anime, but this one definitely has the most out of any anime I've watched. I think the worse thing is that it really straddles that line between something that is considered r rated to something that may be considered x-rated. It never goes past that line but it comes pretty damn close. If you like your anime with a lot of fan-service, than you'll get your fix with this anime.The main hero is the real strength of this anime because he parades around the story like an epic bad-ass and its actually a different take on a hero than most anime that I've seen and it does have potential but it never has the length to reach that potential especially with its story. With the humour and the majority of the action focused on this character, its interesting to have a main character in an anime that you can like and hate all in the same moment. I wasn't fond of the ending and opening songs of this anime but overall I did enjoy the action and the humour. Overall, sometimes all it can take is just one character to make an anime really enjoyable. If it wasn't for this character than this anime would of been an uncomfortable snore-fest. on the antics of him and and the dark lord's daughter as they return to Earth and they get enrolled into this school because of their skills in combat and magic.

For me, Yes so much so that over 5 years ive watched it 3 timesThats all I consider when watching a movie, tv series, doco, anime, was I entertained.This ones not the best ive seen nor is it one of the worst, but I found it entertaining.So nough said......Graphics are good considering some of the kid like graphics some of the current animes are coming out with, almost like there drawn by new studios or studios who dont have the budget for better graphics.Storyline, lets think about anime story lines, ive seen anime that have plots and story line better than some of the block buster movies that have been released. this one is ok, it moves along and theres not too many flash back scenes and they did include meanwhile over on the other world link so you get an idea of whats coming.Characters, I seriously dont care.. you either hate them, love them or your attitude to them is Meh... Yes they could have put more thought into the characters and how they project themselves in the story, but then you cant have the entire cast as the main character. So I take em as they come and how you like, dislike or Meh them is up to each individual.Entertainment, Yes I found it entertainingDid it bring me to tears like some other animes, well no but then I also watched it to the end and looked forward to seeing the next episode (unlike some animes that I just lost interest in watching). Did I laugh, yes I did laugh in a few places, chuckled and snickered a bit as well.Did I want to see another season, definitely do..Peace Out...

The background of the story is that there are many different ""other worlds"" that people from earth have been summoned into. In some of those worlds there are dimensional portals, allowing the ""heroes summoned from earth"" to eventually return and about half of them do. Furthermore, it seems that heroes who\'ve gained superpowers, be it super-strength or magic, get to keep them when they come back. There is a special school called ""Babel"", intended only for those returnees, which helps continue train them for... some purpose.Our story begins where your usual isekai story ends...- The hero\'s, named Ousawa Akatsuki, who, is obviously overpowered but also really perverted (with a signature move of stripping women\'s bra in a split-second without them even noticing), just killed the dark lord of a world called ""Alayzard"". Although the kingdom where he resided refused to let him go, he escapes and returns through the dimensional portal and not only that, he also takes a girl with him - Miu, who happens to be the daughter of the dark lord. Since people native to other worlds are not supposed to be able to use the dimensional portals and none ever has, Miu has to hide her identity and pose as Akatsuki\'s little sister as they both enroll at Babel. Meanwhile Akatsuki becomes one of the school\'s troublemakers, as he picks fights with delinquents, strips girls and becomes a target of the student council. Still, people realize that, as troublesome as he is, his powers are the real deal.This anime is anything but mind-blowing, but is a refreshing new aspect of overpowered isekai shows, making it fun to watch casually, but don\'t expect anything incredibly thrilling. The ecchi aspects are notable, making this show NSFW, but not something that the plot revolves around.Bottom line - This is the kind of anime I watch when I just sit casually in front of the TV and don\'t want to watch something ""deep"". - The hero\'s, named Ousawa Akatsuki, who, is obviously overpowered but also really perverted (with a signature move of stripping women\'s bra in a split-second without them even noticing), just killed the dark lord of a world called ""Alayzard"".

I really love the characters and the story is decent. It has epic powers and fights. The nudity in it was very sexy also. Another thing I like about it is some of the characters were voiced by some of the people that voiced characters from anime that I really love. The main character is such a bad ass especially with his fists. The anime has a good amount of comedy scenes. The only bad thing about it is how they ended itIf you want a great action anime with sexy ecchi scenes then this is the anime for...you. you.', 'Hey folks, this will be a review for Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica. This is one of those shows that seems like it would be an example of ""why anime is crap"". However the show is pretty enjoyable.The story is jumpy and rather simple feeling for how long they drag it out. People sometimes disappear into another dimension, which seems to be a fantasy world with demon lords and heroes. Sometimes the people that disappear return and are admitted into a special school to train them up to be used by the military. Our main character returns from this other world along side the demon lords...daughter and enrolls into this academy.From here the story seems to be mostly guess work. Hints are dropped about our main character. Side characters intervene and elude to some hidden and secretive society. The good news is that none of this really matters to what makes this show a fun one to watch.The art isn\'t bad, but not outstanding. There are echhi bits and breasts. Some of the soundtrack was actually pretty engaging but not much else to write home about.The characters are simply fodder for our main character to show off with. The demon lords daughter is a busty shy and simple girl, the class president is the smart grade school loli, and the lesbian tomboy girl is the third main side character. Most of these characters will have situations develop around them in which the main character can swoop in and save them from. Most of the saving I should point out is talking and being kind and bringing everyone together, with some naughty things thrown in the mix.Now I enjoyed this anime the first time I saw it and this time was also enjoyable. It wont win awards for story, or deep characters. People get to wrapped up in that stuff and don\'t allow for these simple shows to be entertaining.  Akatsuki(the main character), is the definition of OP, and manliness. Throw a situation at him and he will knock it out of the park in the simplest and most envy inducing way. Tsundere Vice president making your life difficult, steal her panties and shut her up. School bully making a fuss and interrupting your conversation, kick his ass and bully him for the rest of the show. Someone poisons you, heal yourself with chi. The list goes on.I like intelligent story and thought provoking characters as much as the next person. However its really nice to shut off your brain and have a show present itself without the normal tedious interruptions. A typical weaker MC would take 2 or 3 episodes to deal with a situation that might not even take Akatsuki 5 minutes. This show does suffer some big drawbacks. The dialog, pacing and general story telling are completely awful. However as mentioned above this show isn\'t about that. If your unsure about the show, simply watch the first episode and see what you think of the initial fight.TLDR: Stupid but fun show. One of the most op main characters of all time, doing things like an op main character should.

One main male character surrounded by a lot of different sized female characters. And of course at the very end of the show is a cliffhanger that you have to now wait to see more (which may or may not happen, even if the whole show is better of with more). Especially when the main characters teleport to a different land and rolls the credits immediately screams for...a fucking sequel! Which is most anime we don't really see more than one! a fucking sequel! Which is most anime we don't really see more than one!"", ""“Highness, Piccolo Daimaou has been defeated, we have found out his son has escaped to another dimension, he will not be able to return, we can now rebui...”“No”“Sorry sir?”“Bring him back to our dimension, we will sent our stupidly strong hero”“But sir, Piccolo Jr. is the only person that is capable of destroying our planet, he can’t come back on his own, why would we want such a dangerous person back?”...“So we can make him pay for his father sins, executing him and luring his remaining demon forces to defeat them”“But sir, why won’t we use that stupidly strong hero on demon forces, instead of potentially endangering our world?”I hope you didn’t mind this small dialogue much, but I had to write it, because it represents one of two biggest flaws of Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica: Story and characters.Anyway let's get into the review. I won't be rating how well Hagure Yuusha represents its Light Novel, this review is solely a review of Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica anime.\\\\Spoiler alert just in case//Art: 7/10Hagure Yuusha has normal looking artstyle, it is good quality for the most part, but I did notice some less beautiful scenes (or CGI) that really did stand out even for me and I am someone who doesn’t really have that big expectations towards anime artstyle.Characters: 5/10Our main character, Ousawa Akatsuki, is a sadly disappointing protagonist. He is a hero, who defeated a devil king and returned to his world with devil king's daughter Miu. He has a very relaxed personality, which is the type of persona I am usually enjoying to watch, but when it comes to his abilities, Akatsuki is like Sora from No Game, No Life. He can do anything, he’s stupidly overpowered, he expects you to do things at a certain time and even if someone secretly helps him from shadows, Akatsuki already knows about it, there is nothing that will throw him off his cool. He saves the day always and by always I mean always, even when it is not his fight and it is time for minor characters to shine, Akatsuki comes and steals the spotlight! His fight with Cockatrice was actually pretty good “last second” save, but from that point on you will start to notice Akatsuki is always in the spotlight, always saving the day, hurting other characters growth because they don’t achieve anything by themselves, their meaning to the story is literally holding up the villain, so Akatsuki can prepare to destroy him or to arrive on the scene.Our heroine, Ousawa Miu is also a disappointing heroine. Miu, same as Akatsuki, starts with a good premise. Miu is a devil king daughter, Akatsuki takes her on earth and begins to live with her, Miu’s father told if he is defeated, he wants her to live with the person he was defeated by, but if he proves unworthy, Miu would kill him, it adds very good tension to their relationship. her character is developed fairly well and it really shines with her fight with Cockatrice, but sadly it is the last moment Miu would really shine. From that point on Miu fades away and becomes ecchi material, existing for lewd scenes with her and Akatsuki to happen. This has to do with Akatsuki being always in the spotlight, Miu alongside with many other Hagure Yuusha’s characters has little to no time to shine and even when she is in danger, we aren’t really worried about her, because we already know that Akatsuki will save her 100%.There are 5 supporting characters worth a mention, 1st three Nanase Haruka, Doumoto Kuzuha and Izumi Hikage:At first sight I thought Haruka and her council would become sort of rivals to Akatsuki, but I got immediately proven wrong when Akatsuki made them a laughing stock. Haruka could have been a really good character, but she is in shadow of Akatsuki and when she and her council have an opportunity to shine, Akatsuki comes at the last second to steal their glory, making their effort in vain. Haruka is along Miu and other female characters becomes an lewd scenes materialKuzuha is class representative, she used to be often in a sad, distancing mood, until Akatsuki helped her with her issue, but from that moment on, she never really got any more spotlight to develop herself and was lowered to sidekick you won’t really notice.Hikage is introduced kissing and groping naked girl in gym storage.I did found it be quite interesting addition to Hagure Yuusha and I was interested if Hikage will try to advance towards Miu or other girl, but sadly her interest in girls has diminished over the course of 3-4 episodes and never really tried to approach other girl romantically.Remaining two characters are: Motoharu Kaitou, Hikami Kyouya. Both of them have mysterious backgrounds to them and are keeping Hagure Yuusha interesting. I thought Kyouya was the final boss of season 1, but sadly it didn’t happen, I was hoping Akatsuki would fight and lose to Kyouya, so we could have some real opponent to look forward to and an epic rematch.Character development: 5/10Almost every Hagure Yuusha character ends up in Akatsuki shadow and is left with little to no spotlight, most of them don’t grow. Motoharu Kaitou, Hikami Kyouya are probably the only ones that are worth following and there is something to their characters that is to explore. Hagure Yuusha is way too much centered on Akatsuki, putting him in everything that is happening.Story: 5/10Akatsuki has defeated the devil king and has returned on earth with his daughter. Both of them are trying to not attract attention to Miu, who Akatsuki introduces as his long lost sister in order to protect her true identity. Hagure Yuusha has two different story parts: 1st part are episodes 1-7.Episodes 1-4 have a direction of Miu and Akatsuki adapting to their new school and 1st 2 episodes serves as an introduction to Hagure Yuusha, which is pretty solid.Episode 3-4 has a terrorist attack as a plot point and is again handled well, but the confrontation with the main villain ends up as a disappointment and Hagure Yuusha’s quality worsened from that point.5-7 are side episodes. There is actually interesting “side quest” between episode 5-6, where Akatsuki gets a cool “magic” motorbike that chooses it’s wielders, but here as well with other occasions it proves no problem for Akatsuki, even though he gets shock from motorbike, it happens to him once and after that he rides it and has no problem at all, which kinda makes the point of motorbike shocking other people useless and it’s really plot convenient for Akatsuki to get that motorbike. Other things that happen in episode 5-7 is Miu picking her new underwear, hostage situation for Haruka to defuse, “swimsuit competition” and that’s it, but every single event I just listed has one thing in common, Akatsuki is in the or steals the spotlights. I know Akatsuki is the protagonist, but he’s literally in everything and not just like a supporting character to do some joke or something no, he must be the main character, even in Haruka’s case where she and her team saves numerous civilians and have one terrorist left to beat, but he has a hostage, so instead of letting Haruka or someone from her team using one some special technique, Akatsuki appears to save the day and steal the spotlight.8-12 is a promotion tournament and Akatsuki fights with Barnett Phil, a hero like Akatsuki sent from the other world to find and bring Miu back.I’ll try to cut it short. Akatsuki is on a team with the girls, they destroy every competition, Akatsuki repeatedly shows he’s absolutely op. Then we cut to the night and the Student Council challenges Akatsuki. They fight 3 v Akatsuki, but they get destroyed, then Barnett Phil appears, hunts Miu through the woods, has an actual fight with a bully Kenya Onizuka you probably forgot his name and tbh this fight was actually really good and I liked it, it’s only shame that last time we saw Onizuka (episode 4, now we are episode 9 or 10), he was an absolute jerk and we didn’t get to see him up until now. Phil catches Miu, then we get an SAO vibe for a minute, then Akatsuki appears.Fight between Akatsuki and Phil goes something like this: Akatsuki has an upper hand, puts Phil out of commision, but he contracts some super deadly poison, which turns out to be nothing serious for him to handle he will be ready to fight in few minutes, then we get to see pretty heartwarming scene when Miu tries to warm up passed out Akatsuki who is getting colder by using their naked bodies. But of course, this really emotional scene gets ruined when Akatsuki wakes up and says he was awake all that time they did it, emotional scene ruined just to get cheap laughs.Phil appears, transforming into a giant dragon, Akatsuki isn’t ready to destroy his opponent, so Miu, her friends and student council come out to stall up Phil. The fight has some really good action and I enjoyed the fight, but once again Hagure Yuusha has disappointed me, when Miu and friends had the upper hand, it seemed they were doing a lot of damage to Phil, but suddenly an explosion occurs everyone except of Miu is down and Phil reveals it was just an illusion and they didn’t do anything to him, making their effort worthless and demoting them to the type of character that exist only to hold the line for protagonist to have just enough time to come and save the day with no real influence on the battle. Finally, Akatsuki comes out, does some fighting and after a while, he destroys the dragon with one hit.After this we get an epilogue, where the queen from another world prays for Akatsuki to come back and save them from demon armies, so Akatsuki with Miu and her two girlfriends. Haruka and Motoharu go to the other world for some reason too, the end.To sum it up: Hagure Yuusha has some really good, cute, thrilling, heartwarming scenes and I can see it getting 8/10, but many of those scenes are ruined by wayyy overusing Akatsuki, little to no spotlight for other characters, underdeveloping them and putting unnecessary ecchi actions inside some of them.Story progression: 6/10Story is super easy to follow, you won’t get lost, but you will be disappointed with the fact, there is only one story and it is Akatsuki and Miu, other characters don’t really have any story going on for them and serves as a minor support to our duo and it is painfully visible they aren’t getting much attention (I don’t count ecchi scenes in just to be clear), unless they are villains or mysterious characters.Villains: 5/10Tanaka: 5/10  - Member of terrorist organization, he was pulling strings behind the scenes before getting confronted by Akatsuki, he had an upper hand over Akatsuki but was put down by Kyouya with ease and we never heard of him again from episode 4 onwards. Very disappointing conclusion, I wished he would escape and serve as a constant threat to school and Akatsuki.Barnett Phil: 5/10  - Hero sent from another world to catch and bring Miu back, he’s not really an interesting villain, his persona consists of calling others weak and pathetic. Phil is basically a powerhouse sent to serve as an excuse for Kyouya and Akatsuki fight we were looking forward to not happen in season 1.Girls: 7/105 girls (plus more in another world, but they didn’t really appear much in season 1) are worth a mention, so we have 1 pink haired big big breasted girl, 2 medium sized brunettes, 1 loli type and big breasted green haired girl. A bit better variation than in Hajimete no Gal in where I did give 6/10, so I will add a point here.Sound: 8/10Pretty good soundtracks and overall Hagure Yuusha sounds well.Overall rating for Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica is 6/10 exact. Hagure Yuusha isn’t a bad anime and it has a really good potential, but overly focusing on Akatsuki, always putting him in the spotlights, not developing other characters much and adding ecchi to scenes, which could have been really memorable just for a cheap laugh has really hurt this anime a big deal for me. “So we can make him pay for his father sins, executing him and luring his remaining demon forces to defeat them”“But sir, why won’t we use that stupidly strong hero on demon forces, instead of potentially endangering our world?”I hope you didn’t mind this small dialogue much, but I had to write it, because it represents one of two biggest flaws of Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica: Story and characters.Anyway let's get into the review.

Like most TV shows on my watchlist, I stumbled upon Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero while reading the filmography of some English voice actors, like Felecia Angelle and Alexis Tipton, I decided to give it a try. Was it good or bad? Well, let\'s hope on and find out, shall we?Spoiler alert!StoryThe premise of a Hero returning home after defeating a Dark Lord and saving a fantasy land...should provide for some entertainment, as long as it\'s done properly. This show adds the twist that Akatsuki, the aforementioned Hero, has brought the daughter of the Dark Lord he destroyed to his home so she could have a normal life. Why? I don\'t know. The show never really explores why would the Dark Lord ask Akatsuki to take his daughter with him or why would Akatsuki even agree to this request. Anyway, the world Akatsuki comes back to has been forever changed by the disappearance of children that become legendary heroes in other worlds, so a special school is established to train these children into becoming professional soldiers.Akatsuki and Miu\'s hopes of having a quiet and peaceful life are dashed by the pressures of this new school, some enemies from Alayzard following them and, well, the fact that Akatsuki is a huge pervert that constantly steals underwear from girls and touches their private parts. Not even Miu is safe from Akatsuki\'s skirt-chasing. The show derives a lot of humor in Akatsuki\'s pervertedness, even in situations where such attitude is highly inappropiate.The greater part of this anime is devoted to Akatsuki and Miu\'s attempts to navigate high school and live normal lives; well, as normal as their lives can be when they are superpowered fighters. It is only at the end where the anime develops some semblance of a greater story, with some troubles from Alayzard following our heroes. I admit I did find Alayzard\'s political turmoil more interesting than Akatsuki and Miu\'s high school experiences, and I wish the show could have devoted more time into developing that particular plotline. While there is potential for good storytelling in this show, only the bare minimum is developed to keep viewers engaged. (6/10)CharactersLet\'s start the character evaluation with our protagonist. Akatsuki is a disinterested, relaxed and overpowered guy who is never surprised by anything and has the right answer for every problem he comes across. He is buff and muscular, his weapon is a huge sword that would make Cloud Strife jealous and he even rides around a motorcycle. All of these are clear signs that Akatsuki is a badass and you shouldn\'t mess with him. It\'s as if the staff wanted to create the coolest hero around.Akatsuki is also a huge pervert who is not afraid to charm ladies, touch their assets and steal the undergarments, providing the show with plenty of opportunities for fanservice. Look, I like fanservice as much as the next guy, but Akatsuki\'s skirt-chasing tendencies become annoying at times and creates a huge tonal dissonance for moments that are supposed to be taken seriously. He even touches Miu in his sleep! If there is a chance to touch a breast or steal some bras, Akatsuki will take it. To be fair, Akatsuki is actually committed into being a pervert, unlike Issei Hyodo. Also, every once in a while, Akatsuki gets his comeuppance, so that balances things out.Akatsuki is also a beneficiary of what I call ""supreme protagonist power."" What do I mean with that? His plot armor is really tough, he is a much better fighter than his peers, he impresses even the veterans at his school (except Haruka) and the universe creates unlikely scenarios just to make him look good. His character development is non-existent. Nothing actually surprises him, he is always right and he is always vindicated. I think he only attends to this special school just to go through all the formalities needed to use his powers legally.Like any other protagonist of a light novel anime, Akatsuki gets his own harem of beautiful ladies. His fake sister Miu alternates between berating Akatsuki\'s lust and being his personal cheerleader. His young friend Kuzuha also takes a liking to Akatsuki for being nice to her. The princess Listy, much like Miu, dislikes Akatsuki\'s skirt-chasing but she secretly misses him for leaving her behind and has nothing but the utmost respect for him. There is also Chikage, but she is a lesbian, so she doesn\'t have any interest in Akatsuki.My personal favorite of this group has to be Haruka. Like all the other girls, she doesn\'t take kindly to Akatsuki\'s skirt-chasing, but unlike the others, she is actually proactive about it, constantly trying to enforce authority on him, but always failing, because Akatsuki is way more powerful and talented than her. Haruka proves to be a interesting foil for Akatsuki and she has good interactions with him. I wish the show devoted more time to their relationship, but because she is not the main heroine, that didn\'t happen.Akatsuki\'s harem is pathetically useless without him. Whenever a fight breaks out, all they can do is stall the enemy until Akatsuki barges in and takes the glory. The idea of a hero having friends is because they encourage him and keep him grounded, and unfortunately, the harem fails in this regard because, again, the universe creates unlikely scenarios just to make Akatsuki look good. Aren\'t these girls supposed to be legendary heroes, as well? Isn\'t that why they go to the same school as him?Speaking about enemies, they fail to do any significant damage on Akatsuki. The best they can do is take him by surprise, or scratch his skin a few times, or even poison him, but Akatsuki always turns it around and kicks their behinds. Even three members of the student council only manage a stalemate with him, and Akatsuki adapts to their abilities and the fight gets interrupted before he can actually win.While I do admit Akatsuki has the charisma and personality to carry the show, his flaws prevent him from fully becoming a protagonist worth getting emotionally invested into and rooting for. He is not bad, but he is not great either. He has no beginning, he has no end, he is just there. And the supporting cast is hardly any better. (5/10)ArtThe characters designs are fine, I guess. The action scenes are this show\'s meat and potatoes. I can tell a good chunk of the budget went to the fights. They aren\'t visually stunning but they get the job done. I liked the symbols and circles used to indicate the activation of magic and superpowers. Overall, the art is one of the better aspects of this show. (7/10)SoundThe sound effects are great. Nothing extraordinary, but they do succeed at enhancing the anime experience. The voice cast was highly enjoyable. Eric Vale does a fine job at conveying Akatsuki\'s ""cool"" attitude. Felecia Angelle has a sweet and tender voice, which she uses to great effect as Miu. She does a fairly good job, even if she could have been given better material to work with. Special props should be given to Alexis Tipton and Colleen Clinkenbeard, who deliver outstanding performances despite only having supporting roles. The opening and closing sequences are fine. They aren\'t great but they aren\'t terrible either. (7/10)OverallDespite my criticisms, I don\'t actually hate this show. There are enough redeeming aspects to make it watchable. Ultimately, I can appreciate this show on some theoretical perspective despite the problems I found with it. If you want a show that delivers plenty of action, fanservice and good visuals, this show is for you. If you want a show with an interesting story and likeable characters, I suggest you look elsewhere. (6/10) should provide for some entertainment, as long as it\'s done properly. This show adds the twist that Akatsuki, the aforementioned Hero, has brought the daughter of the Dark Lord he destroyed to his home so she could have a normal life. Why? I don\'t know. The show never really explores why would the Dark Lord ask Akatsuki to take his daughter with him or why would Akatsuki even agree to this request. Anyway, the world Akatsuki comes back to has been forever changed by the disappearance of children that become legendary heroes in other worlds, so a special school is established to train these children into becoming professional soldiers.Akatsuki and Miu\'s hopes of having a quiet and peaceful life are dashed by the pressures of this new school, some enemies from Alayzard following them and, well, the fact that Akatsuki is a huge pervert that constantly steals underwear from girls and touches their private parts. Not even Miu is safe from Akatsuki\'s skirt-chasing. The show derives a lot of humor in Akatsuki\'s pervertedness, even in situations where such attitude is highly inappropiate.The greater part of this anime is devoted to Akatsuki and Miu\'s attempts to navigate high school and live normal lives; well, as normal as their lives can be when they are superpowered fighters.

Well, this is one of the biggest pieces of crap I\'ve ever watched. Don\'t waste your time with it. There\'s no development, an overpowered character, full of scenes that could make this show a hentai, awful fighting scenes... every single second watching this was excruciating and painful. The problems with Hagure no Yuusha are infinite.1- THE STORY:Decades ago, teenagers from high school started being teleported for other worlds. Worlds of fantasy, with dragons and medieval kingdoms. The teenagers got powers after getting into these worlds and had the mission to defeat demon lords and save...their new worlds. After concluding their missions, the heroes would be able to go back to our world.The problems starts here: this is not explained trough the show. It\'s like a random info that we get in the first episode and after that, it\'s not mentioned again. Didn\'t anyone care enough to at least investigate this weird phenomenon? Like, scientists, governments and etc? These kids would probably spend the rest of their lives trapped into some lab with scientists making tests in them to discover their secret. But instead, in the anime story, those teenagers are put into a school called ""Babel"", built specially to receive the new heroes in our world again and keep control of their power (since once they come back they still have their powers of their previous world, like magic). So basically they receive autonomy to attend a school normally and train their powers even more. Haven\'t anyone thought that these students could use their powers to overthrown the government? Instead, Japan is going to make them even stronger by training their powers. In the world of Hagure no Yuusha, the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Japan are the biggest dumbasses of the history. And this could end up not being a problem at all, IF THE FUCKING ANIME EXPLAINED WHY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BUILT BABEL. But instead, it just throw the background in our faces at the first episode, with no further explanation until the end of it.2 - THE CHARACTERS:There are plenty of animes with overpowered mc. Specially in the isekai genre. And rarely doing that end up in a good anime. It\'s a very risky decision, because you basically sacrifice the whole development of the main character, which is essential for any story, wheter it\'s a book or a hollywood series or an anime. And although some few directors can make masterpieces with overpowered mc, this one failed completely. It\'s boring from the beginning to the end and the only person that can defeat Akatsuki, the president of the student council, barely shows up. He never accept to fight against Akatsuki, always remains in the shadows to observe him, instead fighting him. He tries to be the badass antagonist who is careful and do misterious acts, but instead he just acts like a fucking clown and never do anything useful for the plot. You could think that he\'s preparing his actions for the future, so he\'s trying manipulate the situations to create a perfect scenario where he can defeats Akatsuki and that would happen in season 2. But this anime was released in 2012 and now, 11 years later, there\'s no chance that we will have a second season.Also the main character is a pervert. Defeats anyone easily. Always messes with others. He\'s just superficial. And what about the other characters? The 3 other members of the Student Council are usuless and their own contribution to the story is being humiliated by the mc every time. Miu is just a scared girl, that flushes every time and act tsundere, although she is just a dead weight to Akatsuki (who always pose as the hero for doing the bare minimum and cliche by protecting Miu). Literally, her job in the show is being saved by the mc again and again and again. She\'s the daugther of a demon king, so she should be at least stronger than any monster, but she can\'t even defeat a Cockatrice (which is some sort of mix between a dragon and an eagle). Izumi and Kuzuha are usuless. Also 2 other people for the mc save all the time. Kaidou is another character that don\'t aggregate for anything in this story. It seems that he\'s involved with a organisation that want to fight against COCOON (for what I understood). But the anime didn\'t explain anything about it. They just throwed 2 random scenes of Kaidou talking to someone in the phone, with a mysterious voice, talking about the desire to drag Akatsuki into their organisation and fight COCOON, but both scenes were too fast and lasted 15 seconds each, so it\'s confusing because after that there\'s no further explanation. COCOON, btw, is the organisation that rules Babel and represents the interests of the heroes who came back to Earth. They basically rule the world since they have more power than any government and can even stop wars with their powers if they want. In the first episodes, the leaders of COCOON mention Akatsuki as potentially the ""True Hero"". What the hell being the ""true hero"" means? They don\'t explain what is the ""true hero"" nor the prophecies they mention about him. Literally, no explanation.Also, during the show, Akatsuki mentions he had a brother that apparently died. But in the last episode, it seems that his brother is alive and is part of COCOON. Again, no further explanations on this, it\'s just a 20 seconds scene.And to end this topic: who\'s Michael Arkwood? He\'s presented as the leader of COCOON and the only scene he show up, Akatsuki look at him with an angry face, something he rarely does trough the show (showing negative emotions in general). What does Akatsuki has against Arkwood and COCOON? The show ignores this completely.3 - IS THIS A HENTAI OR A TV SHOW?:The anime is marked as ecchi. Alright. I don\'t have any problems with ecchi itself. Breasts and butts flying everywhere, that\'s the kind of thing you expect. But this anime take this in a bizarre way and make the weirdest ecchi scenes I\'ve ever seen. Miu breasts are always growing, her clothes never fits in and her body is always exposed. And the way she feels uncomfortable with this is a real problem, because she doesn\'t wants to expose her body but she\'s forced to by the situations, always leaving her embarassed. This is not ok. Also, there\'s a scene where Akatsuki is sleepwalking and he almost rape Miu. How the hell someone who\'s sleeping tries to rape someone? Who was the genius that thought: ""oh this would be a great fan service scene""? The amount of nudity in this anime is really exaggerated. This is not the kind of ecchi with suggestive content and a good balance of fan service. This is all about Akatsuki abusing all girls he meets. He squizes the breats of Miu without her consent multiple times (AND SOMEHOW SHE ALWAYS ACCEPTS THOSE SITUATIONS), steals the underwear of any girl that challenge him, in one scene he left the VP of the Student Council completely naked on purpose, in front of other people. And in the last episode, when he\'s recovering from a huge fight, Miu takes her clothes off and his clothes as well, they\'re both naked and she uses her body to warm Akatsuki\'s body. And when this idiot wakes up, he squizes her butt and her breasts all over again, leaving Miu in an akward situation.In the same episode, in one of the last scenes, Miu is going to tell Izumi and Kuzuha the truth, that she\'s not human, but the daughter of the demon king from another world. But she gets nervous while trying to tell them, so to relieve her stress and help her talk, Akatsuki squizes her breasts AGAIN and SOMEHOW this make Miu get calm. How the hell squizing the breasts of a woman without her consent will make her more confident of herself? How does that even works?It\'s so absurd and these are things I can\'t accept.CONCLUSION:The anime is completely superficial, throws random (but important) information for the plot randomly in 15 to 30 seconds scenes and then don\'t make any further explanation about these essential things for the story, the characters are completely useless, the antagonists never make a real move and the main character defeats anyone easily. The ecchi scenes can\'t be considered ecchi, they\'re disgusting hentai scenes, that normalize sexual abuse and harassment. There\'s no development for the plot at all. Everything in this anime is completely awful. I don\'t recommend this show in any circumstances. It\'s the worst anime I\'ve ever watched. their new worlds. After concluding their missions, the heroes would be able to go back to our world.The problems starts here: this is not explained trough the show.

Highlander: The Search for Vengeance,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2178/Highlander__The_Search_for_Vengeance,"[""This is about the most american anime I have ever seen in my entire life.  It's so disgustingly terrible.  There were a couple reasons I watched this title.  The first, and biggest reason, was that I saw this as I was browsing amazon.  It got some nice reviews so I thought to myself &quot;hey, I should watch and then buy this.&quot;  Now I've seen two highlander movies and a good portion of the TV series and I can honestly say that this is the worst Highlander creation I've ever seen.Story: This is what happens when you get a writer who...is 1. subpar and 2. Not Japanese.  The writer for this has written for Highlander before, alot for highlander.  I think that he's written ONLY for Higlander.  The formula for this anime is VERY simple and yet incredibly complex.  Revenge.  I've seen revenge done before, and i've seen it done VERY well.  Highlander has a very simple revenge plot, it's so simple that it's insulting.  There's also the TERRIBLE sideplots....these were also insulting.  I'm not giving any spoilers, but really, even if I did, it wouldn't really spoil anything at all.  All the &quot;plot developments&quot; were predictable and boring. And i'm usually too busy paying attention to what's going on to think about what's going to happen.  But I was constantly thinking about what &quot;twist&quot; they were going to throw at me next.  Oh and the script is absolutely terrible.  If you can't finish 50% of the lines before the actors say them...then you're not trying hard enough.Art: For a terrible anime the art is pretty nice.  The art is very smooth, very crisp.  There are some really beautiful scenes, and then there are a bunch that aren't that hot.  The action scenes lacked flow.  They all seemed very static and choppy, very few seemed beautiful.  Someone compared this to Afro Samurai and mentioned that the fight scenes lacked intensity, which is exactly what it lacks.  This anime is meant to be all about action, and yet the effort put into these scenes seems so lacklustre. The art reminded me alot of Basilisk, and I'm not a huge fan of the style, it really doesn't suit the &quot;feel&quot; of this anime.Sound: All that was available for me was the english dub....which frightened me.  BUT I watched it. They got McLeod with a Scottish accent.......half the time.  Which is HILARIOUS when he drops it for a bunch of lines.  The english voice actors deliver every line terribly, it doesn't help that the entire script is riddled with terribly cheesy lines and ridiculous one-liners.  They had some ridiculous rock music for a bunch of it as well....that didn't help.Character: Oh man.  the characters here are absolutely hilarious.  You have the protagonist Colin, who's only dream is vengeance.  He wants revenge because some guy &quot;Markus&quot; killed his wife.  He's silent, angry, and incredibly powerful.  you have Markus, who's such a &quot;bad guy.&quot; you even watch his girlfriend kill some gigantic barbarian without breaking a sweat.  Then he makes out with her.  Oh yeah, he's bad.  Then there's the whore with an ulterior motive, who tries to sleep with Mcleod....but he refuses because he's faithful to some wife who died hundreds of years ago.  You have the annoying little kid with a dying sister who just HAS to join them because he has to save her from a virus that kills people.  *sigh* Just watching them hurts, trying to analyze them hurts even more.Enjoyment: No one should watch this.  For an anime, it didn't even feel like an anime.  This is probably the perfect example for anyone who hates how some anime become &quot;americanized.&quot;  This is an American anime...but it's not fun, it's not creative, it's not original.  Only a die-hard Highlander fan could stand watching this.Please.  Don't make the mistake that I made.  This anime is horrible, worse than an American B-movie.  Even in the first 10 minutes it's really easy to see that it's not going to get any better, and it doesn't...it just gets worse. is 1. subpar and 2. Not Japanese.  The writer for this has written for Highlander before, alot for highlander.  I think that he's written ONLY for Higlander.  The formula for this anime is VERY simple and yet incredibly complex.

But I was constantly thinking about what &quot;twist&quot; they were going to throw at me next.  Oh and the script is absolutely terrible.  If you can't finish 50% of the lines before the actors say them...then you're not trying hard enough.Art: For a terrible anime the art is pretty nice.  The art is very smooth, very crisp.  There are some really beautiful scenes, and then there are a bunch that aren't that hot.  The action scenes lacked flow.  They all seemed very static and choppy, very few seemed beautiful.  Someone compared this to Afro Samurai and mentioned that the fight scenes lacked intensity, which is exactly what it lacks.  This anime is meant to be all about action, and yet the effort put into these scenes seems so lacklustre. The art reminded me alot of Basilisk, and I'm not a huge fan of the style, it really doesn't suit the &quot;feel&quot; of this anime.Sound: All that was available for me was the english dub....which frightened me.  BUT I watched it. They got McLeod with a Scottish accent.......half the time.  Which is HILARIOUS when he drops it for a bunch of lines.  The english voice actors deliver every line terribly, it doesn't help that the entire script is riddled with terribly cheesy lines and ridiculous one-liners.  They had some ridiculous rock music for a bunch of it as well....that didn't help.Character: Oh man.  the characters here are absolutely hilarious.  You have the protagonist Colin, who's only dream is vengeance.  He wants revenge because some guy &quot;Markus&quot; killed his wife.  He's silent, angry, and incredibly powerful.  you have Markus, who's such a &quot;bad guy.&quot; you even watch his girlfriend kill some gigantic barbarian without breaking a sweat.  Then he makes out with her.  Oh yeah, he's bad.  Then there's the whore with an ulterior motive, who tries to sleep with Mcleod....but he refuses because he's faithful to some wife who died hundreds of years ago.  You have the annoying little kid with a dying sister who just HAS to join them because he has to save her from a virus that kills people.  *sigh* Just watching them hurts, trying to analyze them hurts even more.Enjoyment: No one should watch this.  For an anime, it didn't even feel like an anime.  This is probably the perfect example for anyone who hates how some anime become &quot;americanized.&quot;  This is an American anime...but it's not fun, it's not creative, it's not original.  Only a die-hard Highlander fan could stand watching this.Please.  Don't make the mistake that I made.  This anime is horrible, worse than an American B-movie.  Even in the first 10 minutes it's really easy to see that it's not going to get any better, and it doesn't...it just gets worse."", ""Im no Highlander fan, Im just a geek... I've never been interested in Highlander as a franchise,...let's just get it on.The story was pretty fair, there were no breath taking action sequences but even tho, it was enjoyful. It moves from the future to the past and back... simply to bring a little bit of complication in to it. Its all about revenge and hate , and anger, and how you cant win if those feelings are leading your way kinda thing. Im sure you know what I mean since weve seen it before...The Animation is really great,  everyone will enjoy the animations and...effects that this movie has. There are few really good gory scenes in which are used effects that are just marvellous, so there is something to look at.The music (rock or metal, sorry that I can't tell) is fitting but after a while you will concentrate on the fights and scenes so much that you wont even know that there was some background music, thats not a bad thing but I just feel like its a waste of efford in that matter. Sound effects are well done, everything sounds as it should, the metal chinging, bullet shots, explosions... all sounds just right.Higlander is originaly in english, the voice acting was fine, what was really great idea was that the accent of the characters was changing, in the past they were talking with a scottish accent and in the future it was american, nice touch there.Characters arent anything special, there was just nothing new what would make those characters unique. However it was a fair job nothing to be sad about.So dont fix whats not broken...I really enjoyed it from start till the end, I really think that this is gonna be enjoyful for Highlander fans (from what I hear) nothing to be crazy about, but if you want some serious sword action it will take you in but not as well as other titles (Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust). For those that are searching for a good lone hero adventure, you might have found your Jackpot but for most people its a One Timer at worst. effects that this movie has.

When you consider it was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (who as you know directed such classics as Ninja Scroll and Vampire D bloodlust) and the script was penned by one of the writers of the tv series, then I feel I was warranted in expecting a great film. Not to mention that Imagi and Madhouse did the animation.Unfortunately for me the Search For Vengeance was a bit hit and miss for me. While it ticks...all the boxes for what you would expect from a film in the highlander franchise it does little else beyond that.The film is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City where the protagonist Colin Macleod, Of the Clan Macleod (naturally) arrives and discovers that Marcus Octavius, who he has been chasing throughout time in a quest of vengeance over the death of his wife is the leader of this ruined city. Colin joins up with the local rebels of the town, reluctantly, to take down Marcus who is planning to wipe out the city’s population with a virus so he can build his new utopian society from its ashes.As you would expect from the talent on hand the film looks really, really good. The animation is top notch with some great character designs. I particularly liked the design of Dahlia who with her red hair and clothes is such a stark contrast to the dull and grey environment of this desolate New York. Colin is also well designed as looks like a badass action hero but not in a generic way. Where the animation really excels is in the action scenes and as you would expect from the director of Ninja Scroll the action is fast paced and enjoyable. The audio is quite solid too with a good soundtrack and all the voicework is top notch. Even in the flashbacks to Scotland the accents and the dialogue sound perfect.Unfortunately it is with the writing that my main criticisms lay. The writers clearly played it safe here and did not tinker with the Highlander formula at all, and beyond the highlander stuff the plot just has that “done to death” feel about it. Films set in a post apocolyptic world are nothing new and neither are stories of vengeance revolving around a murdered lover. As for highlander specific stuff as I said it ticks all the boxes: We get to see how Colin discovers he is immortal and we see plenty of other flashbacks from different points in history and each time the flashback is triggered by something in the present day. Colin has a love interest in the present day who just happens to resemble his one true love from the past. And this was my problem because all of this had either been done in the original movie and tv show and was just not that interesting to me. Now clearly they wanted to make a movie that fans and newcomers could enjoy and I respect that and that was probably the right way to go but as a fan of the franchise there just was nothing here I had not seen before. all the boxes for what you would expect from a film in the highlander franchise it does little else beyond that.The film is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City where the protagonist Colin Macleod, Of the Clan Macleod (naturally) arrives and discovers that Marcus Octavius, who he has been chasing throughout time in a quest of vengeance over the death of his wife is the leader of this ruined city.

Its not bad it is written well, thou you can tell where its going and how its going to end, it keeps your interest.-I'm glad the made a new character for the movie then using Connor or Ducan. Thou Colin is 'one character motivation'; to get revenge of his clan and dead wife, his determination keeps him going no matter how many times he gets killed.-The supporting cast done a good job as well, I'll admit I do like Dahlia as the main female character then the others in the movies and shows, I don't hate them they have improve themselves to be more the the love interest however Dahlia is more proactive in action department.-Marcus is a enjoyable villain, and not insane like some of the Highlander villains, *thou I do enjoy the villain in the first movie* and he did said the truth about the world and society, willing to change it to see fit *into his eyes thou* no complex, however he's very calm and collection villain.-The action is wonderful, the sword fights are fast-pace and get excited to see more, the animation is flowing and great, the landscapes and backgrounds are great and detail to show how a dis-utopia in the future is too.-The dubbing is very good, and the accents are pretty descent.I can't say anything about the negatives of the film; its a fun watch and if any fan of the Highlander or an Anime will enjoy it. and become involved.

I have to admit this was my very first exposure to the franchise, and up to this day I still haven\'t seen any of the films or TV series. I knew absolutely nothing about the story at all until I saw this anime feature, with that said, I really have no idea on what a fan of the series would be looking for; but I do have an idea on what an action oriented anime fan would be looking for, and I don\'t believe many of them will be too disappointed....Now for fans of the director, I recommend setting your standards a bit low here.The film moves at a good pace and delivers some decent action scenes mainly involving sword play. Since this film was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, those whom are familiar with his work should already know to expect some stylish and blood soaked battles. The man has proven to be a master of his trade. However, when compared to his earlier works such as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. He has clearly missed a few steps. The action scenes are clearly dumbed down and aren\'t very imaginative but they\'re still entertaining.For the most part this is your typical revenge themed movie, fortunately the story and plot isn\'t too paper thin. The world has been ravaged by man\'s constant destructive nature, plus there\'s an airborne virus killing off the remaining population in New York City. The people whom refuse to serve Marcus have retreated underground in vain with hopes of avoiding the sickness. Now with Colin\'s help, they attempt to invade Marcus\' fortress to find a cure.Unlike some of Kawajiri\'s works, Ninja Scroll & Wicked City in particular, the lead villain especially has some depth. There\'s a bit of background on some of the more important characters. The film also adds an interesting form of commentary. This is delivered through the personalities of Colin and Marcus, and it raises the question on who could be the worst of two evils. Could it be the mad demi-god, yet civilized Marcus vying for the perfect utopia? Or the near savage Colin, whom thirsts for revenge and can care less for anyone whom tries to befriend him? In any case, their centuries long feud provides a good amount of action and at times some laughs. The secondary characters serve small purposes, and surprisingly aren\'t present only for a lengthy body count. The main character, two secondary\'s, plus lead villain, also resemble characters from Kawajiri\'s past works. So, there\'s quite a bit of rehashing going on here.The production values are rather high. The animation is pretty fluid from sword clashes to burning buildings. The detailed artwork consisting of dilapidated buildings, ruined bridges, and ran down streets, tells the story that the world is hell. My only gripe concerning the visuals is mainly with some of the character designs. Marcus and Colin especially, resemble Gemma from Ninja Scroll a bit too much. They almost appear to be brothers from other mothers. The soundtrack is also fitting and has an epic feel to it. The voice acting is pretty solid packed with some profanity.I have several other gripes with the film. It almost appears that a new viewer to the franchise must have an idea on what\'s going on. It is explained what an immortal is and that they can only be killed permanently through beheading; but what isn\'t explained is what exactly is the ""Quickening"". From what I gathered, when an immortal is killed, the killer must have absorbed his powers or essence. The event is quite the spectacle consisting of a well animated light show. Another gripe I have is predictability. The characters actions were too easy to call a lot of the time, and another thing, mullets just aren\'t cool to me especially when they\'re on women.Now is Highlander: The Search for Vengeance a great anime film or a masterpiece? Not at all from where I see it, but it is a fun ride. I enjoyed the concept of it enough to give the rest of the franchise a try one day. I recommend this mainly to action fans, fans of the director, and perhaps to fans of the franchise as well.Highs: Crisp and clean artwork, nice animation, good battles, character backgroundLows: Kawajiri\'s usual formula but watered down, somewhat predictable, one too many mullets Now for fans of the director, I recommend setting your standards a bit low here.The film moves at a good pace and delivers some decent action scenes mainly involving sword play.

Marcus looked too much like Gemma. Clothing, backgrounds, weapons etc were all fairly detailed.Animation: Pretty decent. Fight scenes were fairly well animated, with some slow motion scenes here and there. Could have really done with some single-framed sword fights though, that would have been really awesome.Choreography: Bit too much sword bashing and sword breaking in this anime. I laughed when Colin\'s thin katana cut straight through Octavius\' thick sword. Sword deflecting bullets was really dumb as well. So overall the choreography isn\'t that great really. Certainly nothing breathtaking like Sword...of the Stranger or VHD:Bloodlust.Conclusion: The movie felt really disjointed. Like it was just a bunch of random unrelated scenes of two guys swing swords at each other. And I wouldn\'t have minded that if it was done better. Also Marcus not killing Colin when he had like 50 chances to do so was really dumb as well. The whole ""I know I have better things to do than chase the same faggot for 2000 years and repeatedly failing to kill him but I\'m still doing it anyway"" thing was also retarded. of the Stranger or VHD:Bloodlust.Conclusion: The movie felt really disjointed.

It\'s so ingrained into pop culture that even if you\'ve never seen it you know the basic premise and the classic line ""there can be only one."" It\'s also a very divisive film where you tend to either hate or love it and critics are largely in the former camp but there\'s enough of a fanbase that it spawned multiple sequels, several TV versions and an anime film. Which is what we\'re going to be looking at today. How did our old friends at Madhouse handle the property?Story:Colin MacLeod is one of the titular Highlanders. For...millennia, he\'s chased Marcus Octavius who crucified his wife, Moya, long ago when their tribe was routed by the Roman Empire. He\'s chased him through basically ever major conflict the writers could think of and far into the future.There are multiple problems with this film. First of all, the flashbacks lose their intrigue really quickly and the number of times Marcus almost finishes Colin permanently only to be stopped by Colin accidentally stumbling into holy ground or by some other interference gets pretty silly. The story f the film is also kind of boring in general. Colin wanders around, fights some things and makes his way to Marcus or we see a flashback where he got his ass beat by Marcus. Sometimes we see a spectre of an old man or hear the old man\'s voice lecturing him about the pointlessness of his long quest.Another issue with the film is that a part of its ongoing plot is the attempt to steal some vaccines to save some people who are sick with a serious virus. Why is this an issue? Well, to put it simply, vaccines are not useful for people who are already infected. You see, a vaccine works by introducing a weakened version of a virus to your system. This allows the immune system to dissect it, figure out how to fight against it and build up antibodies so that if it encounters the same thing in future it can easily destroy it so that the infected person only experiences light symptoms or has no symptoms whatsoever. But if a body is already infected and fighting against a virus, introducing a weakened version into the mix isn\'t going to help.Characters:Our main characters are Colin, Marcus, Dahlia & Kyala. Colin is a very flat character. Marcus is the typical smug variant of antagonist. Dahlia is the prostitute with a heart of gold. Kyala is the femme fatale character who serves as Marcus\' love interest. They\'re all really uninteresting and lack even the semblance of chemistry in their dynamics.Art:The art actually looks pretty decent. On the down side, the character designs have some of the dumbest attire around. I mean, Marcus and Kyala look like they\'re going clubbing at a bondage club rather than ready for action and Dahlia wears her working clothes for both infiltration and combat. Because fetishy leather is perfect for both those things. That being said the animation flows pretty well and there are some high energy action sequences.Sound:Madhouse actually did get some heavy hitters for this. Hayashibara Megumi, Park Romi, Yamadera Kouichi. The only main character I haven\'t heard in much is Oguri Shun but he still has some impressive credits like being Mario in Rainbow. However, in spite of the casts\' talent, they don\'t really showcase their skills here. It\'s yet another case where you take a talented actor and give them absolutely nothing to work with and this, somehow, results in a performance that\'s very much below what they\'re capable of. Just like when Hayashibara was in Evangelion and her entire job was to not emote under any circumstances. The music, what little there is, is definitely below average. They tried to copy the kind of shit you\'d hear in a Hollywood action movie where they couldn\'t be bothered to get a respected composer.Ho-yay:There\'s none to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. You need some degree of character complexity. Yes, the Highlander franchise is known for its action sequences more than its characters but part of the reason the original has a cult following is that they sympathise with Connor and find him quite likeable. They like Ramirez as a mentor figure and they like their dynamic. Going from that to fully relying on the action is never going to work.2. The flashbacks get far too repetitive. Colin chases Marcus. Marcus defeats Colin. Colin is saved either because of interference or he reaches holy ground. We could have had, literally, one flashback to explain why he hates Marcus and a brief montage showing him pursuing his grudge throughout history. Instead of spending half or more of the film on flashbacks.3. You can have characters change their outfits to be more appropriate for what they\'re doing. I know they understand this because, in the flashbacks, we see Marcus and Colin go through a variety of wardrobe changes but they need to apply it to the film\'s climax.Final Thoughts:Highlander: The Search for Vengeance is pretty bad. Bland, underwritten characters, flashbacks that drag, a plot that makes no sense. Even if you just care about action sequences there are a lot of better anime out there.

Yuk what a nasty and disgusting idea!!anyway I have a note for shounen fans, it’s related to this work and other one, the main idea of immortal guy that suffers continuously because of his lost of his lovers regularly for a thousands of years and because of his immortality and his enemy, was represented in Nanatsu no taizai, so we can say that Suzuki Nakaba had ripped off his tragic plot form this work.The ArtThe only thing that I liked about the whole work was the original character design, I love Hisashi Abe’s art style, his drawing is always complex and mature, the animation was good too, the backgrounds were average.The Music & The SoundsI didn’t hear any unique effects sounds, and the tracks were too dull and ordinary, because of that the acts are really cold and makes you feel sleepy while you’re watching. can make better than them, by the way the worst thing to me in the plot that the protagonist fallen in love with a hooker!!

Can\'t say I was disappointed in that regard. His films always have that distinct heavy shading style to them, with sharp jawbones that you could cut diamonds with. Which if you are like me and love watching anything with a cool artstyle, that\'s more than enough reason to give this a watch. The story and characters are probably even worse than Wicked City...or Cyber City Oeda, so if you didn\'t like those then certainly don\'t bother with this.Now that being said, the art isn\'t as polished as Ninja Scroll or Vampire D, nor does it have that atmospheric aura that Wicked City or even Cyber City Oedo had. It also has some ugly CGI, that while not totally offensive, is still a big step down from those films.Highlanders\'s visuals are still top notch, especially faces are what Yoshiaki\'s works are so uniquely talented at. The second you see even a single screenshot of them, you know who made them. Its very rare to find anything similar to it, maybe Redline comes close, but even then its just not the same (thankfully, its good to be different).Spoiler Territory:You know I like the idea of an immortal dude who fights his eternal rival for thousands of years... at least as a shounen battle tv series anyways. This movie is sort-of based on the live action movie (also callled Highlander), which I haven\'t watched - but I don\'t think you really have to since the stories are different anyways. The entire of this film\'s plot is a bit of a mess overall though, the worst aspect of the story was trying to tie into the Scottish highlander thing, where almost nothing about the Scottish highlanders was shown, and originally the MC was fighting Romans in Britain near Stonehenge anyways. One can only assume they made an effort to make this connection because of the film name and the live action version, but its just so rushed and poorly done that it shouldn\'t even be there. I\'ll explain in the next paragraph.So in this Scottish highlander section of the movie - a very small section might I add; you get a Scottish battle scene, a funeral because he died in that battle (Immortality brings him back always, but ""death"" knocks him out for unknown reasons.), he crawls out of his grave at night and is called a demon (A fair point, ""zombie"" would also do.), then suddenly his new love interest is there to defend him from his accusers - until they decide he has to leave because he just crawled out of his grave, and the show acts like we should really care that he is splitting up with his new relationship that we\'ve seen on screen for roughly 30 seconds. Its not the worst thing I guess (for this film anyways), except that the entire reason of him fighting for the past MILLENNIA is because he was fighting to have his revenge for his first wife\'s death. So he spent over 1000 years fighting tooth and nail, dying over and over again, bearing physical pains and horrors over the memory of his first wife, and yet apparently also just takes another woman while continuing that fight anyways? Yes, technically the story tries to justify it by saying that this was is his first wife reincarnated (also happens again in the future), which is not only stupid, but fails anyway since he himself states he didn\'t believe that to be true. Its just a half-assed story honestly, even Wicked City felt more put together and that was also just basically an excuse for some action and sex scenes.So yeah, a very long look into just one example of things not really being careful looked at in the story. There is a lot more to nitpick and dissect, but it\'s just that sort of story, its like porn stories - certainly its exists and could be looked at, but why waste your time when we all know what reason it really exists for? You get to watch a bunch of action scenes spanning different ages for shits and gigs, ignore it and just pay attention to the visuals since they really do stand up well.Overall: I didn\'t hate the film, but I\'ll never recommend it to anyone - unless they watched everything else from Yoshiaki, and if they\'ve done that then they probably don\'t need me to tell them to watch it. or Cyber City Oeda, so if you didn\'t like those then certainly don\'t bother with this.Now that being said, the art isn\'t as polished as Ninja Scroll or Vampire D, nor does it have that atmospheric aura that Wicked City or even Cyber City Oedo had.

Wholesome, the anime.Houkago Saikoro Dice club is not an anime that will blow you away in terms of quality, plot, direction, etc. However, what it excels at is being a very relaxing and enjoyable time, which is why it earns a 10 from me. I base my ratings on my overall enjoyment of a series, I don't care about super complex things that you may see in other reviews. Now that that's out the way, let's get into explaining the series.Dice club starts off with Aya having recently moved to Kyoto and looking for new friends, she ends up encountering...Miki, the MC of the series, who although a Kyoto native has struggled to make friends and connections. The two of them end of becoming friends and bonding, while out one day, they stop by a game shop to check out the contents of the store, due to this they become friends with Midori, the class rep and fall in love with the art of board games.Each episode follows the group as they hang out, go through school and find out about new board games. That's basically the plot so far, and while it may not seem like much, what I find really interesting and why this got a 10 from me, is the fact that i can learn about so many new games and hobbies through this series. I actually have got into playing shogi and cards as a result and as someone who has suffered through depression myself, enjoying a nice relaxing anime is such a cool change of pace.The art is gorgeous and really bright, music is well done, character designs are great, a lot better than the manga and overall I really enjoy the series. Think of this series as the senko san of this season, not much in the way of actual plot, but it's moe fluff, and if you ask me, we can all use a bit more of that these days.

Chances are that you played a tabletop game at least once in your lifetime, whether it’s between friends or family. Hiroo Nakamichi manages to create a manga about tabletop game culture and to my delight, this is a slice of series I can recommend to just about anyone.To start off, you don’t need to be a fan of tabletop games to really enjoy the show. I haven’t played tabletop games in a long time but had no problem...looking into interest from the very first episode. We meet Miki Takekasa, an antisocial girl who has trouble finding fun in her life. After meeting Aya Takayashiki and Midoro Ono, she discovers a world of fun and excitement with tabletop games. Welcome to the Dice Club. This club is more than just an experience at games. It’s a social connection that bonds together characters such as Miki.Indeed, character connection is an important element from the very beginning. Miki started off as being socially awkward but begins to grow out of her shell after joining the club. This is thanks to the friendly characters she meets including Aya and Midori. Both characters may be different but they manage to bring together the fun of experiencing with board games. From the show itself, we have cockroach poker, roleplaying tabletops, and even popular real world games such as Bunny Kingdom. However, it would seem a majority of the games are based on European tabletops than ones from North America. Ironically, a foreign character does later join in the show named Emilia. Known for her Irish descent, she brings in new excitement for her friends as she also experience the joy of board games. Like I said before, Houkago Saikoro Club delivers the social experience of people together rather than high stake competitions.As a slice of life, the story flows in an episodic structure without a complicated plot. Character development is minimal although Miki’s growth is exceptionally noticeable the more she plays with her new friends. Every episode introduces games with different rules to keep the show refreshing. Sometimes, we even get episodes taking place outside of the store such as at the beach or school. During these times, the club members experience the teenager dream – being able to hang out together as normal people and enjoying life. With the light comedy, the comedic humor is generally tame that’s usually based on character personalities than dry humor. That is to say, this anime isn’t trying to make you laugh. It’s here to show how board games can change people’s lives.Watching the series from start to finish, I do have to say that the male character cast is generally underwhelming. Characters such as Aoshima and Shouta are easily forgettable and fits the role of stereotypical school roles. The only guy in the show I commend on being noticeable is Kinjou Takeru, the store manager. With a bald head, apron, and intimidating sunglasses, you’d least expect him to be someone who would run the store. Thankfully, the anime also introduces Maki Kyouko. She may not be featured as much as the main cast but to me, she is a breakout character. From the moment she was introduced, Maki displays a free spirited attitude and loves making friends. In one particular episode, she and Aya goes on an outdoor adventure of their own to enjoy themselves. And that’s the same attitude you should have when watching Hokuago Saikoro Club. Enjoy this show with an open mind with a free spirited attitude.Hokuago Saikoro Club’s art style is very manga-like with the drawn characters. The anime brings their character designs in definitive form with enhanced quality. Every character in the show stands out with the vibrant look. Character expressions is usually demonstrated with interactions than reactions. It aims to show how characters bond together with a common interest in games. To my delight, studio Liden Films even manages to make impressive appeal to the board games themselves. With each game featuring unique styles of gameplay, the show itself looks and feels different every episode.I don’t think there’s much more need for a slice of life such as Hokuago Saikoro Club. From the very beginning, it knew what the audience wanted and delivered on almost every aspect of their goals. It seems nowadays, slice of life has taken on many forms. A show about a group of friends playing tabletop games together and experiencing the creative excitement is most welcoming. looking into interest from the very first episode.

There are lots of fun moments that can happen during a board game and the show does a good job of communicating these moments and showcasing the fun, glory, and growth that they get from playing these games.The characters in Saikoro Club are generally well developed and showcase a good example growth that is tied in well to the subject matter that is being focused on. In the case of...Miki we see a girl who is not only an introvert but is very shy from being bullied frequently in her youth. Her mental state reminds me of my own back in the day. She is hesitant to join with others and makes a beeline to and from school not stopping along the way. She is unable to bond with others, and has this feeling of loneliness rooted in her. But then she meets a friend. And along that she is introduced to the world of board games. The usage of board games both is nice as a tool to get her to open up and to be able to interact with friends, as well as use an activity that is able to provide group interaction while also allowing Miki to be her introverted self. The growth that we see from her is real and the games provide a good mirror as we see her grow in the action of the games. It's not as if she's not an introvert, she always is. But her timidness shrinks and the moves she plays in the games become grow bolder, showcasing her growth.In the case of Midori, we see someone who already enjoys board games a lot and already is more put together from the start. However she does have a dream, one that she has been working on for a while, but that was pushed more to the back-burner. I really enjoyed the development of her dream as she was pushed to continue it and go outside of her comfort level. It's nice to see her missteps guided through and the development that her dream goes through, as she tries to push it towards reality. There are choices that she makes that make sense in thought but actually negatively effect her dream and keep it in its infant stages without growth. I like how the show was able to call out these patterns and give better advice to fuel the dream and push for the best result the dream could have. Not only did the advice and path make perfect sense to me, as the information given was all correct, but it was nice to see this growth and showcase the common failings that can happen in the path of making a dream a reality. While this dream is specific to the focus of the show I think there are good parallels that can be made with many dreams, and provides general good advice for dreams. I liked how the show didn't just make the dream happen but managed to have realistic set backs that I think are common for many people to go through even outside of the medium that Midori was focused on. It's a nice change to shows that focus more on overly dramatic roadblocks rather than the more real roadblocks we push ourselves into.As a fan of board games myself it's fun to see the board games played out. I think the explanation of the games is excellent. Especially with how well they're able to explain the base rules, have it still be entertaining, and not have it take too much time. I have been introduced to a lot of new games and have had to bare through a lot of awful explanations. So to see good explanations for these games and to not be bored is quite a boon in my opinion considering how boring (at best) they can be in real life. The games themselves were fun to watch. It was cool seeing games that I had played before being played in an anime. Some of the games looked quite interesting too and made me want to play them myself. While how well the show was able to showcase the game being focused on varied from episode to episode the bulk of the games were fun to watch and had nice interactions between the characters. In particular the game in episode 2 was fun to watch as you could see the character's naivete and lack of skill very prominently which led to very funny results. These moments in playing board games are highlights of them and can be quite fun to watch and see.The graphics and sound quality of the show is a much more mixed bag. The show isn't wowing it with its production, although it doesn't have any quality issues either. It's very average to the point of being exceedingly average, if that's even possible. It looks fine. Never great but never awful.Overall Houkago Saikoro Club is a great anime that is able to use it's subject matter and give good development and growth based off of it. It has the heartwarming interactions and fun that is needed of a CGDCT, and never fails to be a fun little ride. It's a modest show but it fits together really well.

A simple concept of board games can be real interesting.Again, it could be just tastes. But this is a lot better than the rating it is given. The characters are rather cute with how their portrayed and look. With relatable characteristics you see in every day life honestly, that aren't annoying in any stretch that could ruin the experience. As it doesn't here. From shy and timid, to one that is energetic and so on. Great characters overall.It...also has a great way of how the story is told through playing these games, and how the characters develop through playing these games together. It's a real heart warming feeling and I love it.The games themselves shown in the show are rather interesting too! I'd love to play them myself! From just a simple fun card game, to a simple board game that honestly looks a world of fun. I'd honestly play them with my friends and family if I could haha. After all, who doesn't love a good board game.The art of the characters and games is very pleasant and well done. It's a great looking anime. From the detail on character looks, to the covers of the games themselves. To even the pieces in the games. It's well done.Should you watch it? I'd say yes. While the concept of playing board games might not sound interesting. But it's the way it's done that is really enjoyable.

Thankfully, Houkago Saikoro Club was closer to the first one here. It wasn't the best but it was still a very good watch.I really liked how the anime presented psychological issues even if it didn't necessarily deal with all of them. The fact that it had characters talking and experiencing very heavy stuff like the feeling of being left out, fear of the future and the fear of having no dream or passion in anything is something that...I don't think I saw in many/any anime before. And although we didn't get to see solutions for some of these, we still got some hints that made you think that everything will hopefully pass by alright.One the best things about this anime was the representation of the games. The mangaka was able to choose lots of great games and it was very enjoyable exploring different unique game and watching a great presentation for each of them which made it easy for me to understand what the game was about.I also really liked the voice actors, specially Aya's and that was understandable after seeing the other roles she had before. Her voice is really charming and pleasant to listen to.The characters themselves were great. The variety and uniqueness of every character combined with very well-fitting voice actors was a great match. The development each character had was also very good to watch.The art, animation, OSTs, ED, OP and overall atmosphere of the anime was great to help you relax and enjoy yourself.Overall I would give the anime an 8/10.Would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a fun anime about games or board games to be exact.

I mean, I get it. If the show was only about girls playing board games and nothing else, you’d probably get pretty board of it early on, right? Okay, that was a bad one…But, anyway. It isn't, it's better than the usual ones. And I’m here to briefly convince you guys that it is. So let’s jump right into it.As the synopsis mentions, Houkago Saikoro Club begins when three girls meet and come together by chance to start...playing the one thing they have discovered to love – board games. A new game is introduced pretty much every episode and the rules are clearly explained each time, allowing us viewers to understand the game well, as though we were playing together with the characters too. Over the course of the series, the girls play several different games, through which they have meaningful interactions with other characters. Certain events and conflicts arise, and the characters resolve them through playing games (Oops, that sounded like something out of Yu-Gi-Oh…). As a result, the series is by no means episodic; the characters do not simply get together, play games, then forget all about it and go back to their own daily lives. Instead, the interactions and process of playing the games help to drive the series forward and bring about the development of the characters. The pacing really hit the spot for me, and it fit the genre of the series. Nothing was rushed, the game playthroughs were well-directed and neatly integrated, and the heart-warming elements with regards to the story really took this series a level higher than the average ones.The characters also played a major part in making this series so enjoyable. All the characters, especially the main group, have different personalities which are easily likeable. These personalities and attributes of the characters are expressed not only through the story but also through the game playthroughs. While the characters play the games, you can tell what kind of person they are from the decisions they make or the things they say. As the series progresses, you’ll find that no one character is perfect and they all have their own flaws, thus making their personalities realistic and relatable for viewers. I would say that there is a high chance of you identifying with at least one of the characters or, at the very least, knowing people in real life who share similar personalities with them. One thing of note is that the presence of the male side characters really added to the enjoyment of the series. They could have easily made the girls come from an all-girls school like what most series would have done and have the story focus on the interactions between these girlfriends. But no, they added male students into the mix and have them interact together with the girls. This, in another way, made the feel of the series even more realistic and allowed me to identify even more with it. It made me think, “Ah, this really is a show about high school girls going through high school lives, and not just a show about girls doing girls’ things.” With that being said, I do wish that there was more character development, especially for those side characters, although I understand that resources may be limited considering it’s a one-cour.Another thing to commend about the show would be the music and soundtrack. First and foremost, the OP is sung by Tomita Miyu, a young seiyuu on the rise who has already voiced characters from various renowned recent series. The catchy OP is also her first single as a solo artiste. Of course, she also voices one of the main girls in the series itself. In general, while the cast is not exactly star-studded, they fit their roles really well, even though some of them had to adjust in order to accommodate the accents their characters speak in. The soundtrack was beautiful, the music suited the mood of the scenes and added to the emotional element of the story. I will definitely be listening to the OST when it releases, if it does (to date there still has been no news of an OST release).The reason I wrote this review is because I felt the series is criminally underrated. In a season in which there are plenty of big-name series and sequels, it doesn't surprise me that this one would go under the radar. But I assure you, it's not all that bad. While the story is not exactly unique and compelling, the series makes up for it through its other components. It won’t be keeping you at the edge of your seat, but it may allow you to sit back and relax while watching people play board games, occasionally hitting you in the feels. Who knows, it may even light a spark within you and encourage you to start getting into board games or to go out to find your very own definition of ‘fun’.Houkago Saikoro Club is not a complex story, it is simple and straight-forward and therein lies its beauty. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish, and I sincerely hope this review has done enough to convince you to give it a try as well. playing the one thing they have discovered to love – board games.

She has little in the way of friendship but this changes with the arrival of Aya. Later Midori and Emilia join the fold too. They all share a past time going through the series with analogue games. Miki the introverted girl meets various people and solves a few misunderstandings with some pointless romance devices shown. Pointless because they are barely touched, they could have been not shown and the show would hardly change.Initially, I thought this would be a hidden gem, however, I,...unfortunately, was mistaken.

For the past 5-6 years now I've regularly hosted board game nights at home with my former high school classmates and it's one of our most regular ways to hang out and reasons to meet. Board games are a great way to interact with each other in a fun, intelligent and rewarding way which also offers flexibility and versatility, and just in general it's one of the most social experiences you can have. I just wish...more people gave it a chance because it sure beats going out clubbing, I'll tell you that much.In case it wasn't obvious, Houkago Saikoro Club is a slice of life anime about exactly that: board games and the social experience that they provide. Despite the cover, it is not really a cute girls doing cute things kind of show, because while the main cast is primarily female, there are also numerous male characters in this show and more importantly it never really tries to go too excessive with the moe. Instead it focuses more on the actual games, and this is something I very much appreciate. You see, the games they play in this anime aren't just random made-up ones, but rather all 100% real board games that you can likely find in any sizeable store that sell these types of games. Even the ones you see in the background on the various shelves that are never actually used or even mentioned in the show are all real too. I've played several of them myself and even own a handful so for any fan of the medium then it's also a show which is packed with relatable references in that sense. It's almost like an easter egg hunt for trying to see how many of them you can find.On the downside, I guess for anyone that doesn't play board games themselves and/or is relatively unfamiliar with them, I think a lot of the intended appeal of this show goes out the window. If you're solely trying to watch it for the cute girls factor then... you'd probably be better off watching an anime more directly dedicated to that end goal, because again that isn't really what Houkago Saikoro Club is about. Don't get me wrong, the girls in it are likeable enough as they are, but I wouldn't really call them outstanding either.Overall, it just feels like an anime made for people that are fans of board games, and for those of us at are it's a very relatable, realistic and enjoyable watch. But for anyone else, they'll probably miss the point of the show to some extent. That doesn't make it bad, but it definitely makes it niche.

Thing is: ‘topping off’ at the 4th episode, why isn’t this show garnering more attention and reviews further than that? I’m very confused by this, and you can bet I’ll darn-well explain why:So, firstly, I don’t expect my review to change between this point in the season and ‘by the end of the season’. It has been extremely consistent and, frankly, I’d almost bet my life that it’ll continue to uphold its standards of storytelling, animation, (mediocre) sound design, whatever...else, and just its overall feel. (I’ll edit this bit and the intro out when the show is done since, lel, I’m certain it will be a “keeper” for me).I’m sure I’ll rewatch this show for funzies when I’m in the mood to re-live my “newbie” passion for board games - something I’ve only ‘cracked the surface of’ (Dungeon Pets is my intro to board games :3. Check it out! It’s a top 10 of sorts, ya know!) whilst refuelling my ambition to play board games with more people!Thing is: I can relate to this show quite a lot. I’m an older guy (urgh... 25+, k?), and having moments of ‘intellectual connectivity that’s “inconsequential”’ is really fricking hard to come about in normal ‘attempts at “bonding”’. ... Board games are something special here. They are an ‘inconsequential, intellectual activity’ for adults to ACTUALLY ENJOY. ... Board games are MASSIVELY underrated!I’ve talked enough about the setting if this review—so let’s talk about the actual show/anime.50% of the show is about board games and their ‘novel poetic-complexities’—the other 50% is about showing the beauty, the artistic zeal, and the compatriotism you feel during an ‘intense board game’ as you slowly become familiar with the personalities of those who you are “sharing the experience with”; you see, the ingenuity and limitations of ‘board games’ leave an opportunity for your ‘own’ personality to leave its unmistakeable mark! Houkago Saikoro Club gets the core facets of this hobby across to all those uninitiated in the drunken nature of ‘imagination’ + ‘innovation’ + ‘limitation’ that a board game carefully guides you upon. So many times whilst watching this did I want to order whatever game they were playing (especially ‘The Island’ in episode 7).Houkago Saikoro Club is more then just an advertisement of Board Games. It’s a love-letter to the hobby that SIMULTANEOUSLY deals with the stigma AND ‘common stereotypes’ of those who play/would enjoy board games.Well: though I phrase it like that, our Main Character is very real and isn’t all that “tropey”. I really like this as she grows in an acceptable manner (that’s a total plot twist for a show meant to be just about ‘board games’) as she finds herself through the relationships and interactions she forms through these board games. It’s extremely unexpected that any character participating in such a show would have sooooo much depth—I mean, I did say it was 50:50, right? That’s the point: if thus show is that dedicated to ‘showing its art’, then just imagine just how much time we get to see each and every character grow alongside each other. :3Thing is: I have a personal agenda to talk up the ‘board game’ aspect—however, the character-‘personal and meaningful’ prospect of Houkago Saikoro Club takes the spotlight over the board-gaming side... Even if I’m super proud of how they’ve addressed the ‘art of boardgames’, the characters are ANYTHING but ‘last-minute throw-ins’! Heck, even though our MC is but 1 character to experience growth out of the many that do: the board games are ‘literally a supplement (of many kinds) of growth’ towards our angelic protagonist - which is so extremely well-devised by the author(s)/screen-writers that I’m extremely disappointed by how many people aren’t moved ~like I~ by this precise work of art!Fact is: the quality is consistent, the character-building is continuous and unpredictable, the artwork is very fair and pleasing, the ‘messages’ are wholesome and realistic (philosophically speaking!), and the show builds up from simple games to hard games, but also from simple relations to complicated relations - all which involve the growth and self-discovery of our main character.Seriously: how is this show not an utter ‘cult-masterpiece’?! 9/10 - only because it is, technically, ‘inspired and unique, as well as perfectly arranged and presented’, but... it isn’t a ‘masterpiece of the ages’ if I’m to compare it to other ‘blockbusters’—however: it never intended to be this, and it was always in a different ‘zone of ambition’; so, in other words: for what it tried and wanted to be (aka probably a ‘7/10’), to narrowly miss the criterion for a 9/10 (for how well it culturally supported and propelled its medium - board games), it’s absolutely incredible what Houkago Saikoro Club has managed to pull off! ... Be it an 8/10 or a 9/10, I very-much have to gift it ‘bonus points’ for accomplishing something that none of its ‘competitors’ could hardly ever come close to...Rightfully so: 9/10. This won’t change. An amazing show that’s absolutely ’inspired’ from beginning to end! Well... How’d you feel now for a game, perhaps? :D else, and just its overall feel. (I’ll edit this bit and the intro out when the show is done since, lel, I’m certain it will be a “keeper” for me).I’m sure I’ll rewatch this show for funzies when I’m in the mood to re-live my “newbie” passion for board games - something I’ve only ‘cracked the surface of’ (Dungeon Pets is my intro to board games :3. Check it out! It’s a top 10 of sorts, ya know!) whilst refuelling my ambition to play board games with more people!Thing is: I can relate to this show quite a lot. I’m an older guy (urgh... 25+, k?), and having moments of ‘intellectual connectivity that’s “inconsequential”’ is really fricking hard to come about in normal ‘attempts at “bonding”’. ... Board games are something special here. They are an ‘inconsequential, intellectual activity’ for adults to ACTUALLY ENJOY. ... Board games are MASSIVELY underrated!I’ve talked enough about the setting if this review—so let’s talk about the actual show/anime.50% of the show is about board games and their ‘novel poetic-complexities’—the other 50% is about showing the beauty, the artistic zeal, and the compatriotism you feel during an ‘intense board game’ as you slowly become familiar with the personalities of those who you are “sharing the experience with”; you see, the ingenuity and limitations of ‘board games’ leave an opportunity for your ‘own’ personality to leave its unmistakeable mark! Houkago Saikoro Club gets the core facets of this hobby across to all those uninitiated in the drunken nature of ‘imagination’ + ‘innovation’ + ‘limitation’ that a board game carefully guides you upon. So many times whilst watching this did I want to order whatever game they were playing (especially ‘The Island’ in episode 7).Houkago Saikoro Club is more then just an advertisement of Board Games. It’s a love-letter to the hobby that SIMULTANEOUSLY deals with the stigma AND ‘common stereotypes’ of those who play/would enjoy board games.Well: though I phrase it like that, our Main Character is very real and isn’t all that “tropey”. I really like this as she grows in an acceptable manner (that’s a total plot twist for a show meant to be just about ‘board games’) as she finds herself through the relationships and interactions she forms through these board games. It’s extremely unexpected that any character participating in such a show would have sooooo much depth—I mean, I did say it was 50:50, right? That’s the point: if thus show is that dedicated to ‘showing its art’, then just imagine just how much time we get to see each and every character grow alongside each other. :3Thing is: I have a personal agenda to talk up the ‘board game’ aspect—however, the character-‘personal and meaningful’ prospect of Houkago Saikoro Club takes the spotlight over the board-gaming side...

This is Houkago Saikoro Club ( Afterschool Dice Club ), an anime about high school girls playing board games!As simple as the anime may sound. After School Dice Club actually holds a strong sense of Slice of Life despite not being categorized as one. It could also be reckoned as a CGDCT & Soft Yuri due to how much moe and insignificant teases the show gives off in spite of the fact that the characters look mature and ""friendly"".This anime shows...you a variety of board games from reality. Some of them are even recognizable if you\'ve ever played them with your friends and/or families. An example would be something like Cockroach Poker. Other than the group of girls playing all sorts of games, the anime also teaches you through the basics of how to play the representing games. Each episode they would play at least two games. The games are clearly explained using simple terms so that it could be understood by everybody.After School Dice Club also gives off a sense of reality. It teaches you about things such as board games being replaced by technology games nowadays, in addition to them being unpopular in Japan and so forth. Aside from things regarding board games, the anime also symbolizes strong friendship externally - the strong bonds of friendship that can carry one\'s life into a better, the feeling of not wanting to ""lose"" ( I don\'t mind if you misinterpret this and I\'m not going to clarify it ), the joy of sharing happiness with each other.[ OPTIONAL ] Precaution ( Issues Regarding The Anime That May Trigger Fans ) : The voice acting and the ending. Alright I\'ll be honest. The Kyoto accent doesn\'t really trigger me much, but it probably would for a lot of people since it sounds so ""unique"" and ""unfamiliar"". The other problem is the ending which in fact was expected and unexpected at the same time. The realism packed within the ending might hit home for some introverts, up until the point where you\'d probably end up getting depression rather than happiness. So all the joy you built up from 1-11 might go to waste.Now you probably wonder why I am giving this anime such a high rating regardless of the fact that this show\'s rating is 6.77. Well let me tell you something. This show was amazing, and it was either botted or people don\'t understand how great board games are because they\'re fortnite fanatics. This anime is one of the best anime where you can just unwind and watch in peace without thinking much about it.Incredible anime. Subarashi 10/10.

Recommended to those seeking for something relaxing to watch.', ""Houkago Saikoro Club, or After School Dice Club, was a refreshing anime, and an overall nice change of pace. I love serious animes with life or death stakes, as much as the next guy, but, I loved having a show this season where the biggest stakes at hand, were simply who would win the board game the girls were playing that episode.Past that though, Koukago Saikkoro Club is something more, there appear to be a lot of life lessons embedded within the simplistic nature of this anime, leaving you feeling good and refreshed, and even at times, looking up from something that might be bothering...you in your real life.You see, Koukago Saikoro Club, takes you on a journey of growth, and not just from one of the girls either, but all of them. The board games are generally speaking, both physically present, and metaphorical, or therapeutic in a way, as they generally help one or more of the girls deal with something going on in their life.Aya, Midori, Miki, and Emilia, are all dealing with their own struggles, and each step of the way, you see the girls confront them, with a helping hand from their friendship, and the thing that brought them all together, board games.Sure, this anime wasn't the most exciting show ever, but, it did certain things well, and as a result, was super enjoyable. This was a nice anime to have in my Fall repertoire, as it was a nice change of pace, with some of the crazy, and nonsensical animes that I was watching this season. you in your real life.You see, Koukago Saikoro Club, takes you on a journey of growth, and not just from one of the girls either, but all of them.

Next up think of Pollyanna the most optimistic girl in the world, toss in Louisa May Alcott\'s little women blend a little, dumb it down, toss in some  do your best to overcome obstacles messaging, last a little gaming and you have After School Dice Club. If you think you would want to watch something like that Dice Club might be for you. The rest of this review is about why it wasn\'t for me.First up, I don\'t think I have ever seen anything aired that had so...little dramatic tension and left me so unconcerned about the characters as Dice Club did. All their problems/challenges are so easily and neatly resolved that it\'s impossible to generate any concern.  Especially after you go through the cycle of problem, be cheerful, problem resolved a few times.  It\'s literally enough to put you to sleep. No worries though you\'ll never notice if you miss an episode or two.Next up is the dialog. It\'s awful the tone is just incredibly flat. It\'s like listening to crazy people trying to act happy. Even the nominally depressed and insecure character can\'t manage to convey despair or melancholy, she just comes across as limited and boring.Third there is the subject of the dialog. The series has this incredibly annoying way of having the characters describe what the animators have drawn and animated in front of you. YOU CAN SEE IT !!! there\'s no need for the characters to ramble on endlessly about it. It also undercuts anything that might be conveyed by animation. A touch of the hand or a smile does not need to be elaborated.Lastly there\'s lots of continuity/plot holes in the story.  Just as an example Emmy\'s father runs a gaming cafe, but there\'s a point in the story where she mentions her family may have to move to Germany because of his job. WUT ??There were a couple of ways Dice Club could have redeemed itself. There was the gaming angle. It\'s a big topic with plenty of room to explore. It\'s just handled really poorly. The games are meant to be keystones to emotional growth or character connection but it fails. The messages are conveyed by the show talking about them instead of bringing the viewer into the game. You get stupid lines like ""The game is called Blockus, but the best strategy for victory is not to block players but let them in"".  That line is given by a guy who might as well be standing at parade rest. Just a complete disappointment.Borrowing a game term, the show\'s last lifeline was the romance element. Best I can say is MEH didn\'t care. How can you, when you have characters you can\'t connect with, dialog and pacing that\'s uninteresting, and a plot that doesn\'t hang together.To stick with how Dice Club did things: Final Verdict: Thumbs down, uninteresting, waste of time, The only winning move is not to play. little dramatic tension and left me so unconcerned about the characters as Dice Club did.

And the answer appears when she comes across Aya and Midori, two girls who will eventually join the main cast.I felt immersed in the games many times during the course of the work, trying to understand how the game worked as if I was waiting for my turn to play.From episode 6, the anime unfortunately...ends up getting a little lost with the main objective of the work and with the presentation of a new characterThe end is also a little rushed, I believe it could be 24 episodes and it would fit perfectly with the story's purpose.The characters are shallow, but enough to make you care about the main cast.A fun anime that held me from beginning to end, even with its small mistakes.---------Pt/BrQuem diria que um anime sobre amizade, felicidade e jogos de tabuleiro me divertiria durante 12 episódios inteiros.Um anime simples e talvez com o objetivo de popularizar comercialmente os jogos de tabuleiros, Houkago Saikoro Club explora a aventura de Miki, uma garota que busca encontrar e entender o que significa felicidade, e a resposta aperece ao se deparar com Aya e Midori, duas garotas que eventualmente participarão do elenco principal.Me senti imerso dentro dos jogos muitas vezes durante o decorrer da obra, buscando entender como o jogo funcionava como se estivesse esperando minha rodada para jogar.A partir do episódio 6 o anime infelizmente acaba se perdendo um pouco com o objetivo principal da obra e com a apresentação de uma nova personagemO fim também é um pouco rushado, acredito que poderiam ser 24 episódios e encaixaria perfeitamente na proposta da história.Os personagens são pouco aprofundados, mas suficientemente para que você se importe com o cast principalUm anime divertido que me prendeu do inicio ao fim, mesmo com seus pequenos erros. ends up getting a little lost with the main objective of the work and with the presentation of a new characterThe end is also a little rushed, I believe it could be 24 episodes and it would fit perfectly with the story's purpose.The characters are shallow, but enough to make you care about the main cast.A fun anime that held me from beginning to end, even with its small mistakes.---------Pt/BrQuem diria que um anime sobre amizade, felicidade e jogos de tabuleiro me divertiria durante 12 episódios inteiros.Um anime simples e talvez com o objetivo de popularizar comercialmente os jogos de tabuleiros, Houkago Saikoro Club explora a aventura de Miki, uma garota que busca encontrar e entender o que significa felicidade, e a resposta aperece ao se deparar com Aya e Midori, duas garotas que eventualmente participarão do elenco principal.Me senti imerso dentro dos jogos muitas vezes durante o decorrer da obra, buscando entender como o jogo funcionava como se estivesse esperando minha rodada para jogar.A partir do episódio 6 o anime infelizmente acaba se perdendo um pouco com o objetivo principal da obra e com a apresentação de uma nova personagemO fim também é um pouco rushado, acredito que poderiam ser 24 episódios e encaixaria perfeitamente na proposta da história.Os personagens são pouco aprofundados, mas suficientemente para que você se importe com o cast principalUm anime divertido que me prendeu do inicio ao fim, mesmo com seus pequenos erros."", ""When you have an anime about a club or sport, there are in general, two ways to go about it. Have it be focused on the sport in terms of competitiveness (Ex: kuroko no Basket) or have it be about more of the character interaction and in a club/sports environment (asobi asobase, Sket Dance, etc etc).This anime obviously takes the latter route. However, it stands to my attention that this show has absolutely no good character development, personalities, and to pair it off, pretty terrible dialogue and story arcs.It takes a lot of basic and archetypal characters, and does not do a lot with them....They almost always behave very predictably and their dialogue options are not varied. They try to compensate, or perhaps mask their lack of any substance by adding new characters and different board games each episode to try making the anime interesting.It doesn't work. It's fine to also just focus on the board games themselves. But honestly, the board games are visually very lame in the anime medium. I'm sure that the original manga was much more interesting to look at compared to the lame anime depictions of the board games.And also, another note: when I think of board games, I think of immersive fantasies such as Warhammer, Dnd, etc, where you use imagination and each game is different because of the different players playing it, making it an overall great experience. This could have been done in this anime, where character interaction is focused upon. Why not have them play on something like Dnd, where a lot of the game depends on the characters themselves? Wouldn't this be a very fun experience? Maybe have a few different campaigns throughout the season. This way, you would be able to develop characters more, while having the board game actually being relevant. You could also just animate the characters inside the board game setting, thus utilizing the anime medium. But even if this anime did not want to go in that direction, because apparently it loves playing European titles, that is ok as well. Why not depict those board games in the board game setting? Anime is a great medium because it allows people to be creative with their depictions. Something as mundane as moving a piece on a board could be depicted on the screen as the player actually moving in the board game. You know, simple stuff.Overall, just a very bland cash grab. It's just got no redeemable or unique traits  at all. With everything on par or sub-par, you get something unmemorable and overall unwatchable. Poor character development and interaction stints this show along with its terrible use of the anime medium, as well as its uninspired story arcs.

Wouldn't this be a very fun experience? Maybe have a few different campaigns throughout the season. This way, you would be able to develop characters more, while having the board game actually being relevant. You could also just animate the characters inside the board game setting, thus utilizing the anime medium. But even if this anime did not want to go in that direction, because apparently it loves playing European titles, that is ok as well. Why not depict those board games in the board game setting? Anime is a great medium because it allows people to be creative with their depictions. Something as mundane as moving a piece on a board could be depicted on the screen as the player actually moving in the board game. You know, simple stuff.Overall, just a very bland cash grab. It's just got no redeemable or unique traits  at all. With everything on par or sub-par, you get something unmemorable and overall unwatchable. Poor character development and interaction stints this show along with its terrible use of the anime medium, as well as its uninspired story arcs."", 'Asobi Asobase\'s more tame Board Game variant.Houkago Saikoro Club is by the by a very wholesome anime about an afterschool board game club, wherein Miki Takekasa voiced by Saki Miyashita being extremely shy and anti-social due to a childhood trauma keeps to herself, until Aya Takayashiki voiced bu Marika Kouno sweeps her away as she befriends Midori Oono voiced by Miyu Tomita the class rep of their class and works at a board game shop. With these three they inadvertently play games after school and deepens friendship with board games.Houkago Saikoro Club does two things, character growth and board games. So first let\'s talk about...the characters.Well with the core cast, Midori Oono is the stern but holds-no bar when coming to games even with newbies, her passion and dream is to become a board game designer. Miki has the typical shy girl mannerisms, however she at the start wants to be kept to herself, but once Aya comes into play and plays in the board game club, she naturally finds through board games that having friends is fine, she a bit different in which is doesn\'t want to stand out because she\'s soo shy, she wanted to be kept alone but she just naturally finds herself opening up and not ""wanting to stand out"", quite different for a shy girl archetype. Aya is the typical genki girl AND..though she picks up board games off the bat, she\'s quite bad in board games as a result...she does get an episode to herself concerning her father but LA sees her as the least developed of the core cast.There are other supporting characters like the owner of the board game shop Takeru Kinjou voiced by Takaya Kuroda, Miki and Aya latter gets love interests that of Ryuuhi Yoshioka voiced by Shun Horie and Shouta Tanoue voiced by Kouhei Amasaki to Miki and Aya respectively while the next person inadvertently becomes one for yuri undertone for Midori that of Emilia voiced by M.A.O who later joins the club and is the typical ""foreigner"" archetype who takes a liking to Midori, only makes sense as they both have the same dream with games. Ohh and there\'s something about the vice president turned president of the student council who wants Midori to help her and she also is vehemently against the notion of games in general thus becomes an obstacle fo the club early on (she latter becomes tsundere about it due to the actual president of the student council comes in).On the board game side of things, we get a bit of a tutorial of games in each episode and sometimes the games have a certain plot point concerning a character, mainly Miki and Midori to develop them. The board games shown are REAL by the way so this anime is even an advertisement for some really niche board games that are not Monopoly and the like. For that, Houkago Saikoro Club intertwining board games with it\'s characters is actually quite well done, wholesome, yes, but almost cheesy sometimes, but mostly wholesome.Yes the narrative focus of the anime is towards Miki as her opening up through games, but the focus changes as Midori gets into the limelight and her wanting to achieve her dream in getting a game published but this anime does one good thing and that\'s synergizing it\'s character development with board games, weird thing to say but it\'s what levitates the cheesiness of some of the episodes\' as all three soon to be four core cast to develop with the games they play, Miki with gaining friends, Aya and Emilia for having fun and Midori making games.The animation done by LIDENFILMS is mostly decent from the crisp character designs to even some of the alternative style in animation when tutorials in some of the games comes into play. But other than that, the animation done by LIDENFILMS was decent to a bit above average in all cases.The voice cast is pretty decent and moe to be expected from a ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime. Saki Miyashita as Miki has a monotoned but moe cadence in voicing the shy loner type to the expositionary Miyu Tomita as Midori whilst Marika Kouno is the genki Aya and finally the funny foreigner but not M.A.O as Emilia. For the most part the core voice cast was moe yet decent let alone not grating as you\'d expect either. MVP?....do you even need to ask?, Miyu Tomita as Midori.Houkago Saikoro Club does have a few flaws LA can note from all this though, like LA mentioned before the wholesomeness does sometimes lead into cheesiness at times with the dialogue as genuine as it does get, Aya is the least developed out of the core three and she just sticks to ""rich aloof genki girl"" archetype but other than that, Houkago Saikoro Club\'s flaws aren\'t that bad and you know what your getting yourself into so this anime can\'t even dupe you even if it wanted to.Houkago Saikoro Club is just the wholesomeness anime of Fall 2019 all things considered, from how the characters interact and play the games and makes us the audience get into it at some points, the characters are well developed and sometimes the games are intertwined and develop characters, sure the anime does have some flaws, as the wholesomeness can sometime veer into cheesiness, Aya ALWAYS loses let alone her characterization is the least developed but LA still enjoyed watching Houkago Saikoro Club with all it\'s flaws and all but the one thing this anime is is...it\'s wholesome. the characters.Well with the core cast, Midori Oono is the stern but holds-no bar when coming to games even with newbies, her passion and dream is to become a board game designer.

I wish a lot of people had seen this to make the company have a will for making a second season of this! especially since the manga gives the enough story to make 2-3 more seasons.So many things good about this anime:1. the characters! I loved the characters.-Even though there were some that I didn\'t like, it was me not liking them for a good reason. For that reason, I like them in their own way, also. All the characters have a purpose in the story.2. The story!-The story in general was really...nice.-I feel like that they also captured the emotions of the how the world views board games quite accurately. I work at a local tabletop game store where I live. Everyday, I get a classmate of mine, or a stranger, question games and question why they are still a thing. Question how we\'re still in business and how games like Warhammer, D&D, etc. are still big and growing even bigger every day. So, I feel like they definitely captured everyone\'s emotions about their first interactions with these games quite well and the story premise is just good overall.3. I liked the attention to detail in the store background and the explanations for some of the games.-Again, I work at a game store, and I know every single game in the background. It was fun trying to take the time to also look in the background and go, ""we sell that game, too!"". And they were pretty accurate with the explanations with some of the games as well.Not only that, but they did a good job making it fun, and enjoyable, to watch the characters play these games together.The only thing I didn\'t like about the anime, was how it was 12 episodes. Because it was only 12, and the company isn\'t doing a 2nd season, some parts of character development was a tad bit rushed.- It\'s understandable because of the amount of episodes, the amount of people that watched the anime when it was ongoing (not many), etc. just made the company feel like a second season wasn\'t worth it... especially since the company they chose isn\'t known to make second seasons, from what I\'ve read.It\'s just, I guess I wish there was a 2nd season cause I loved it so much and I wanted each character to get longer attention for development.But, thanks to this, I\'m definitely going to read the manga and see what is supposed to happen next. If they do, for some reason, end up making a second season, I will definitely watch it! 9.5/10. nice.-I feel like that they also captured the emotions of the how the world views board games quite accurately.

Having said that, this also appeals to me on a personal level, as such this review may be very biased in it's assesment.Plot, Characters, Music and Animation: There is not much to speak about in terms of Plot, this isn't plot centred. As for characters, apart from the Arakawa family, cows and dog, there is the only the editor Ishi. Music and animation: Both are appropriate for what this is.This is an Anime, loosely based on the life of farmers, especially of the master mangaka Hiromu Arakawa, who as you...all know used to be one of the milk farmers, born in a family of milk farmers in the cold Hokkaido region. It is educative and fun watch providing a close perspective of the farming life, and strange incidents that Arakawa encountered.The main pull of this Anime is however the humour, and the short life stories of Arakawa as a farmer. Having spent a large part of my own childhood in almost similar places, this Anime fills me with particular joy and happiness. I don't know whether it'll appeal to others, but the humour is certainly on point which should be enough for just about any one.Please give it a try for something light, fun and informative, especially for those who have some experience with the farming life. all know used to be one of the milk farmers, born in a family of milk farmers in the cold Hokkaido region.

Ikkitousen: Great Guardians,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4196/Ikkitousen__Great_Guardians,"[""As a guy who have watched all three seasons of Ikkitousen (also wrote review for each of them), I will be briefly going over a few pros and cons about this third season, named Great Guardians (GG).Unlike the previous seasons which focused greatly on the story of Romance of the Three Kingdom, GG was different (primarily due to the apparent defeat of Sousou in Dragon Destiny). As some of you may already know, GG is completely original (*I treat it like a &quot;filler&quot; series*). So not much previous knowledge of the first 2 seasons are required in order to understand GG.Story:The story is very weak...in GG. It is basically one random event follow by another until half way through the show. As mentioned above, since GG did not follow the Romance of the Three Kingdom, the story is bound to &quot;suck&quot;. And the fact that the &quot;villain&quot; is a villain because of such trivial matters doesn't help the story either. As mentioned in the discussion board by some viewers, the director basically &quot;reset&quot; everything back to the way it is at the end of DD (with the exception that Toutaku is confirmed alive).Art:The overall animation isn't bad though not much improvement when compared to DD...and ecchi guys will like to see the occasional nude Hakufu etc.Sound:The sound for this series is actually quite outstanding especially when compared to the previous seasons. Both the OP and ED received good ratings from fans as well.Character:It was nice to see for a change that they focused a bit more on character development rather than just introducing tons of characters that just show up for 30 seconds before getting killed. There is basically just two new characters added to GG so that might explain why they have the spare time to develop the characters more than the prior series.Enjoyment:It was very enjoyable for the most part for someone who have seen Ikkitousen's all three seasons. The only department that was really lacking was battles. There just weren't any that can be compared with Dragon Destiny's.Lastly I would like to comment on the name. I know this will be quite debatable, but in my opinion I don't see how the name relates to this series at all. But since I am not a picky person with names, I'll let it be and it didn't affect my grading of the show &gt;&lt; in GG.

Instead of yet another thirteen episodes connected by some sub-par plot on ancient warriors reborn and duking it out, we get a plot device that is mostly there to have good girls do bad deeds in a ridiculous and consciously self-mocking fashion. It's actually a rather fun ride - if you don't mind the occasional badly animated bared breast.As Ikkitousen: Great Guardians follows on two earlier anime the show assumes that the main characters and their general...situations are known. In this review, I will assume the same. This means that there will be spoilers for those unfamiliar with the previous two series.Ostensibly, the plot of Ikkitousen: Great Guardians (hereinafter, Guardians) focuses on the character of Saji/Zuo Ci, who has been out of the limelight for most of the two previous seasons. Set shortly after the defeat of Sousou/Cao Cao, with Nanyou/Nanyang and Seito/Chengdu still at peace, Guardians involves far less actual serious combat than the previous two seasons. Instead, about half of the show catches the characters in the trappings of a standard romantic comedy series, portraying them having a picnic, going to the beach, etc.Early on, yet more characters are introduced, among which the long-lost sister of Sonsaku/Sun Ce, though more important than any of these is the return of an old fan-favourite, Ryofu/Lü Bu. Her mysterious re-appearance is only the prelude to a story that focuses more heavily on toying with the characters than having once more some high-powered enemy appear.As said, though, any pretence of an actual story is discarded very quickly. Only a few references are made to the ‘warrior’ nature that was so prevalent in the previous two seasons and the connections between the characters and their 3rd century Chinese counterparts. Instead, the story toys with the characters, having them act against their usual natures and setting the stage for quite a few scenes wherein all the protagonists can appear at once. In doing so the story is to be able to pit the entire female cast against each other, showing us what would happen if Ryuubi/Liu Bei went against Kan’u/Guan Yu, for instance. Of course, the entire reason for any of this is to have well-endowed girls in various states of undress duke it out in as overblown and ridiculous a manner as possible. Far more so than the two previous seasons, Guardians wholly embraces that premise, in the process consciously making complete clowns out of most of the characters, thereby declaring that none of it should be taken seriously.Those characters remain as simplistic as ever and, as always, their defining traits, such as Sonsaku’s lack of brains and Kan’u’s shyness in expressing herself, are used for crude jokes. To the already rather large cast of characters a few new names are added, but as always it isn’t by their names or characterisations that one remembers them, but by their gadgets, so to glasses-and-books and eye-patch are now added quoting-Sunzi and traumatic-past. Did the previous two seasons here and there pretend to have some real character development, Guardians blatantly throws the concept out and works with these distinctive traits, mostly for comic effect.It is also quite apparent that the makers of the show have opted to include as many elements favoured by the fans as possible. Kan’u’s romantic fondness for Ryuubi is used more often and openly, and a few more liaisons between the girls are thrown in to make more of it. Having Ryofu return is, in itself, a fan pleaser, and she is used quite openly to spice up the goings-on.As a result, the actions of all characters are, by and large, highly predictable, but as the show doesn’t aim for them developing and surprising us, this can be forgiven.The art is most likely the worst aspect of the show. Whereas the story and characters lack any real plot or development by choice, much would depend on the art to make up for it. The animation almost seems rather dated, however. Backgrounds lack details, with people added that do not seem to be alive or really doing anything. Little use is made of different shades of colours, setting the different elements of the landscape even more strongly apart from each other, while the characters, far more brightly coloured, often seem strongly superimposed on the background. More damning is that, for a fighting series, the animation is somewhat sloppy. Character movement is at times somewhat stilted, while quite a few fighting moves appear as stills on empty backgrounds.Character designs haven’t changed since the last season, nor is there any more detail added to these generally rather bland designs. Intriguingly, only the ending sequence shows a new graphical take on the characters, and a very interesting one at that.And then, there is the fanservice. As with the story, in the art as well the creators of Guardians have dropped any pretence. Much of the previous two seasons were all about showing as much skin as possible, with the DVD extras receiving an R+ rating as they showed the bared breasts of many of the girls. Realising full well that this seemed to be what the audience wanted more of, the makers of Guardians have few qualms with showing full frontal nudity even in the main show. The result, though, is ridiculous, defying both gravity and human anatomy, with the plainly drawn bared breasts having a life of their own.However, the Ikkitousen series form one of the best examples of a franchise that uses fanservice in its more narrow sense (showing as much skin as can be allowed) in the way it was originally intended. No matter that almost every second shot is constructed in such a way that underwear or skin is showing: compared to the hundreds of other shows that try to captivate an audience by exposing their leads, there are very few shots indeed that are added for no reason but pleasing the fans. In Ikkitousen, the shot itself remains an integral part of the ongoing action and would have remained fully functional if the fanservice were to be removed, making it truly an extra service.There is nothing about Guardians that can be critically acclaimed. But then, it does not opt to be considered highbrow. It knows its fans and what they want to see, plainly giving it to them. What the show lacks in substance it also lacks in juvenile humour: in openly displaying what it is about it is essentially self-aware and does not even try to hide its clownesque antics behind a plot. The entirety of Ikkitousen should be approached as the light-hearted diversion it is and savoured, not with wine and blue cheese, but with salted peanuts and a beer cap. In its self-mocking ridiculousness it is a fun ride and truly a guilty pleasure. situations are known. In this review, I will assume the same. This means that there will be spoilers for those unfamiliar with the previous two series.Ostensibly, the plot of Ikkitousen: Great Guardians (hereinafter, Guardians) focuses on the character of Saji/Zuo Ci, who has been out of the limelight for most of the two previous seasons. Set shortly after the defeat of Sousou/Cao Cao, with Nanyou/Nanyang and Seito/Chengdu still at peace, Guardians involves far less actual serious combat than the previous two seasons. Instead, about half of the show catches the characters in the trappings of a standard romantic comedy series, portraying them having a picnic, going to the beach, etc.Early on, yet more characters are introduced, among which the long-lost sister of Sonsaku/Sun Ce, though more important than any of these is the return of an old fan-favourite, Ryofu/Lü Bu. Her mysterious re-appearance is only the prelude to a story that focuses more heavily on toying with the characters than having once more some high-powered enemy appear.As said, though, any pretence of an actual story is discarded very quickly. Only a few references are made to the ‘warrior’ nature that was so prevalent in the previous two seasons and the connections between the characters and their 3rd century Chinese counterparts. Instead, the story toys with the characters, having them act against their usual natures and setting the stage for quite a few scenes wherein all the protagonists can appear at once. In doing so the story is to be able to pit the entire female cast against each other, showing us what would happen if Ryuubi/Liu Bei went against Kan’u/Guan Yu, for instance. Of course, the entire reason for any of this is to have well-endowed girls in various states of undress duke it out in as overblown and ridiculous a manner as possible. Far more so than the two previous seasons, Guardians wholly embraces that premise, in the process consciously making complete clowns out of most of the characters, thereby declaring that none of it should be taken seriously.Those characters remain as simplistic as ever and, as always, their defining traits, such as Sonsaku’s lack of brains and Kan’u’s shyness in expressing herself, are used for crude jokes. To the already rather large cast of characters a few new names are added, but as always it isn’t by their names or characterisations that one remembers them, but by their gadgets, so to glasses-and-books and eye-patch are now added quoting-Sunzi and traumatic-past. Did the previous two seasons here and there pretend to have some real character development, Guardians blatantly throws the concept out and works with these distinctive traits, mostly for comic effect.It is also quite apparent that the makers of the show have opted to include as many elements favoured by the fans as possible. Kan’u’s romantic fondness for Ryuubi is used more often and openly, and a few more liaisons between the girls are thrown in to make more of it. Having Ryofu return is, in itself, a fan pleaser, and she is used quite openly to spice up the goings-on.As a result, the actions of all characters are, by and large, highly predictable, but as the show doesn’t aim for them developing and surprising us, this can be forgiven.The art is most likely the worst aspect of the show. Whereas the story and characters lack any real plot or development by choice, much would depend on the art to make up for it. The animation almost seems rather dated, however. Backgrounds lack details, with people added that do not seem to be alive or really doing anything. Little use is made of different shades of colours, setting the different elements of the landscape even more strongly apart from each other, while the characters, far more brightly coloured, often seem strongly superimposed on the background. More damning is that, for a fighting series, the animation is somewhat sloppy. Character movement is at times somewhat stilted, while quite a few fighting moves appear as stills on empty backgrounds.Character designs haven’t changed since the last season, nor is there any more detail added to these generally rather bland designs. Intriguingly, only the ending sequence shows a new graphical take on the characters, and a very interesting one at that.And then, there is the fanservice. As with the story, in the art as well the creators of Guardians have dropped any pretence. Much of the previous two seasons were all about showing as much skin as possible, with the DVD extras receiving an R+ rating as they showed the bared breasts of many of the girls. Realising full well that this seemed to be what the audience wanted more of, the makers of Guardians have few qualms with showing full frontal nudity even in the main show. The result, though, is ridiculous, defying both gravity and human anatomy, with the plainly drawn bared breasts having a life of their own.However, the Ikkitousen series form one of the best examples of a franchise that uses fanservice in its more narrow sense (showing as much skin as can be allowed) in the way it was originally intended. No matter that almost every second shot is constructed in such a way that underwear or skin is showing: compared to the hundreds of other shows that try to captivate an audience by exposing their leads, there are very few shots indeed that are added for no reason but pleasing the fans. In Ikkitousen, the shot itself remains an integral part of the ongoing action and would have remained fully functional if the fanservice were to be removed, making it truly an extra service.There is nothing about Guardians that can be critically acclaimed. But then, it does not opt to be considered highbrow. It knows its fans and what they want to see, plainly giving it to them. What the show lacks in substance it also lacks in juvenile humour: in openly displaying what it is about it is essentially self-aware and does not even try to hide its clownesque antics behind a plot. The entirety of Ikkitousen should be approached as the light-hearted diversion it is and savoured, not with wine and blue cheese, but with salted peanuts and a beer cap. In its self-mocking ridiculousness it is a fun ride and truly a guilty pleasure."", ""Most of the Ikkitousen series is a nightmare. But since season 3 feels like it completely abandons its old dry plot, there's almost a whole new story that is actually bearable and decent. With a much better story line, the fanservice now becomes worth it. That being said, Ikkitousen does a great job upholding the ecchi tag. So if you're a titty-hatin' queer, go ahead and move on. Additionally, this season features a ton of god's gift to anime, Ryofu. Season 3 has a few good battles to offer as well. All in all, this is the best Ikkitousen has to offer. "", 'Great Guardians is apparently the third in the Ikkitosen series. However, I\'m reviewing this one fresh to the franchise.First off, I have no idea how these girls move around as they must have an incredibly huge burden on their shoulders. Other than that, expect unusually weak clothing that must be made out of thin paper. In any case, if you\'re at all sensitive to ecchi series, high levels of fan-service, or full frontal nudity I\'d recommend you steer clear of this.It you are able to handle these, then Great Guardians offers you a modest story line with some interesting characters. The series is focused around...fan service and battles. Character development and romance are far from the standouts in the series.Animation:The animation is good though female characters are a bit over proportioned in areas already noted above. Battle sequences are well done but abnormally high levels of ""battle damage"" in certain areas probably detracts some from the enjoyment.Sound:The OP/ED aren\'t that great, way too fast in any case for any Karaoke usage. The BGM is decent though not outstanding. A few tracks are pretty good but the overall thing isn\'t that memorable. VAs are good, esp. the lively Hakufu.Story:People with special earrings are modern reincarnations of warriors during the three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. They have great strength, high stamina, and special attacks (which are never explained... probably already done in preceding series).This particular series is a bit of a toss up as the under workings of the plot are hidden up until the very last episode. The series will keep viewers guessing what\'s happening and who is ""good"".Though it is somewhat of a slice of life, it definitely goes beyond the boundaries of that genre. In all, the battles are a bit repetitive but the ending redeems the series somewhat with a final grand battle.The series has a fair resolution with the possibility of further continuations (series four?).Character:With a high female to male ratio, it is typically the case that the main male gets a lot of attention. This isn\'t really the case here as Kokin is pretty much shelved for the significant battles (and obviously no ""attractive"" battle damage for him). The main delight here is the hilarious and lively Hakufu who helps bridge the gap between battles with comedic humor and fun idiocy.Overall, there could have been more development but the focus is obviously on the girls engaging in clothing-tearing battles.Value:This is definitely not a show to take with to work. In any case, it\'s a decent watch if you have time to kill, though I can\'t really find the point to it; likewise I can\'t comment on how important it is in the entire series franchise. That said, it is definitely filled with an overabundance of fan service and dribbles of humor and action. There\'s also a 6-part OVA which is pretty much just additional fan-service with no real further value. fan service and battles.

I liked that for the most part, the story felt a lot more grounded and simple and it embraced a lot of a goofiness afforded by the setting. I hate when shows with such a clearly stupid premise start trying to take themselves too seriously, so it was nice that the first half was pretty lighthearted and focused on slice of life character stuff. That said the second half did start to drag a bit as more and more characters fell prey to the same mind control shtick, they probably just did it one...or two too many times.Overall for a show that usually just prides itself on fight scenes that exist solely for the purpose of ripping the clothes off the female cast, I think this season did a pretty alright job telling a cohesive story and being engaging enough to not put me to sleep. 7/10 or two too many times.Overall for a show that usually just prides itself on fight scenes that exist solely for the purpose of ripping the clothes off the female cast, I think this season did a pretty alright job telling a cohesive story and being engaging enough to not put me to sleep. 7/10', ""O.k to start off with I didn't watched all of this series, so just letting you know first off.I got to say the synopsis for this one is really misleading about what the story is about, it makes you think that the whole thing is about Hakufu when it's not. Now the part where she finds out about her sister is true and is centered around her, that really one of the only things accurate about it.Now the reason I didn't watch this all the way through is because the first half (mainly the first 5 episodes) are all actually kind of enough...able. They feel more like a series of OVAs that connect, now there are parts that hint to an plot between points, especially when a certain Ryofu is seen in a bed with amnesia and somehow surviving blowing herself up in the first season.

Any long story short, this is more of a filler series, and I can say that most of this won't be noticed in the fourth season so I would suggested skipping this one, unless you're that sure of yourself  or you just want to watch the first 5 episodes. able.

Kaleido Star: Good da yo! Goood!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1501/Kaleido_Star__Good_da_yo_Goood,"[""Being the third installment of the Kaleido Star OVAs, you may be surprised that its all done with CG (computer graphics) animation. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical upon going into it, but your doubts will soon vanish once you do.All characters shown in this OVA (Sora, May, Layla, Ken, Rosetta and Marion) all keep their personalities from the series. There are a total of three skits that take place in it; May cooking, Rosetta showing Ken how perform her Diablo act, and Marion juggling with Sora! Each ark is kept silly yet entertaining............not to mention its cuteness at its best! Some...fans might be disappointed that not all the supporting cast members (such as Fool, Leon, Sarah etc) make an appearance in this title though.Sound wise? Hey its Kaleido Star, so you know the music is going to be the same charming and catchy beats the show is known for. You even get a cool (and full) opening j-pop theme called &quot;Yakusoku no Bashoe&quot; sung by the entire Kaleido Star cast. Even the ending is great, because along with the closing  theme &quot;Sora no Theme,&quot; you also get a cool hand-drawn art skit showing what the characters did after their performance skits.The chibi CG art was an interesting choice for them to go down, but it is pulled off nicely. While the characters can be somewhat stiff compared to their traditional anime counterparts, they are also surprisingly spry! With colorful well detailed graphics, it will definitely appeal to fans and non-fans alike. Still, the colorfulness could be considered a double edged sword, as some fans might find the over all color schemes to be a bit too much for the eyes to take. Me personally though, I found it charming!Being that its only 1 episode long there really isn't much else to say. If your a fan of Kaleido Star then this OVA should not be missed. If your not? Then you should definitely still check it out, as it will more than likely make you want to get into the series. (which runs 51 episodes long) It makes me wish they would make another season with this style of art and comedy, I think it could bring more people into the franchise. fans might be disappointed that not all the supporting cast members (such as Fool, Leon, Sarah etc) make an appearance in this title though.Sound wise?

Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49385/Kaijin_Kaihatsu-bu_no_Kuroitsu-san,"['Watching many anime over the years, I have come to the conclusion that there are two types of hidden gems. One type are hidden gems that should remain hidden for people to dig up and come across their value themselves. The other hidden gems need to be exposed so that everyone knows and appreciates them as much as possible. In my opinion, Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san, or in English, Miss Kuroitsu from the Monster Development Department, belongs to the latter. It is clearly one of the most, if not the most underrated anime this Winter 2022 season.So the story is about Touka Kuroitsu, a monster...development researcher for the evil organization Agastia. Alongside her senpai Hajime, she, well, develops monsters to fight against ""heroes,"" and in Kuroitsu\'s case, she fights against Blader. When I tried recommending this to other people, some of them kind of brushed it off as a mere Kamen Rider parody, which it is, don\'t get me wrong, but of course I\'m not reviewing this anime if it\'s only just that. Moreover, we also have mahou shoujo, so to dismiss this as a mere Kamen Rider parody is not good and it totally undermines this anime\'s true potential. To be totally honest, my childhood is more on Power Rangers, which is basically the same series, but I\'m not really a big fan of either so this anime\'s connection to Kamen Rider is not that significant as to why I loved Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san.We don\'t have an exact story or a deep plot that involves something like Agastia totally ruling over the world, even though that\'s their ultimate goal. Instead, we have a slice-of-life story that still manages to fit in an episodic story, like your regular superhero series back then, that totally captures the essence of what ""Kamen Rider""-esque series should be. But it\'s not all just fighting. There are also wholesome moments that, once again, make this anime deviate from being just a simple Kamen Rider parody. Yes, people dismissing this anime like that makes me salty. Very salty indeed.Then there\'s the comedic parts that make this anime stand out and in my opinion is its strongest point. One of the things that I would especially like to point out is that while I do not think that the trope about ""evil organizations"" actually being not really that evil and sometimes even law-abiding not uncommon in fiction in general, I think it\'s really rare for anime and no matter what, I do not find myself getting tired. Most of Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san\'s comedy stems from the fact that Agastia, dubbed as the leading evil organization, is actually a pretty chill company. They pay their workers well with good benefits, and the work environment is comparable to normal jobs. It\'s written so well that I wouldn\'t mind another anime with this kind of trope in the future.Next up would be the art. While I can\'t say that the art has been consistent throughout, the art from each new monster and character per episode clearly checks out. Perhaps you can call me out for having a little bit of bias towards anime waifus because it\'s very true. The best thing I can praise this anime for is for its character designs that are most oddly the most emphasized. For example, Kuroitsu is somehow still too pretty despite her job in a laboratory—especially in a laboratory where literal biological monster… uh… things are developed. Just imagine the stress and the complicated chemicals that are involved in the process that are almost guaranteed to have a negative effect on a person\'s face. Nevertheless, real world logic doesn\'t really apply to anime, so I\'m not going to cry on spilled milk much further.In terms of character design, some of the ""monsters"" like Wolf Bete and Hydra are just so cute and endearing. The same is also true for Agastia\'s CEO, Akashic, (fbi open up) and the magical girls. As for the Kamen Rider parody characters like Blader and other evil organizations\' nemeses, their variations are actually quite good to see, reminding me of the sheer number of Power Rangers and Kamen Rider variations within its years of existence. While I say that I don\'t like people dismissing this anime as a mere Kamen Rider parody, I still give props to how it pays homage to it which contributes to this anime\'s goodness.For sound, I\'m only going to critique the opening and ending themes, which are so good that I keep singing their tunes. The opening theme ""Special Force"" by AXXX1S reminds me of your usual shounen theme, but still hits hard. Not to mention that banger of a refrain!""itsumo BA-RI-BA-RI-BA-RI tachimukatteGI-RI-GI-RI-GI-RI kuishibattekimi wa “zettai akiramenai”sore ga chikara sa taisetsu na Special forcekyou mo BA-RI-BA-RI-BA-RI tsukisusundeGI-RI-GI-RI-GI-RI norikoeteikou yo Strongerkimi no utsukushii Special force""Utterly splendid. The abrupt one-and-a-half beats between the lines are so hard to keep up which makes it even better to sing. Moreover, I never thought I would be hyped up with a boyband like this. As for the ending themes, there are two, both by the idol group Maybe Me, which alternate between episodes. First one is ""Destiny,"" which kind of sounds like an opening, especially with its very upbeat introduction to a mellow strophe, which is staple in J-pop but still is nice.""Tomose yuuki wo sono yaiba deKotae naki michi wo ittou ryoudan mirai heAno koro yori mo tsuyoku natteru hazuHashiridase yo fuan wo kette""Then there\'s ""Aimai Identity,"" which I feel is better than the other because of its easier and clearer lyrical structure. There are almost no accidentals that force the singer to speak an excessive amount of syllables within a set amount of beats like the previous song. Moreover, that refrain! It\'s the best out of the three songs!""Doyagao de TRYPonkotsu de CRYRiaru wa choppiri sechigaraiKiseki wa matsu mono janaiJibun no te de tsukamu monoAkiramenai maketakunaiDakeredo ganbaritaku ha naiKonna watashi mo watashi na noAimai IDENTITY""Time to become a Maybe Me fan!The main character, Touka Kuroitsu, is a hard worker whose goal is actually to become an Agastia executive staff member, so she does all she can to impress them. This actually allows her to have a motive to be such an impressive and quite sassy character which makes it hard to get annoyed by her potentially annoying personality. Instead, it draws you in, because not only does she have the confidence, she has the skills and kindness to back it up. Ironic for an evil organization to have a majority of kind and caring staff, but once again, that\'s what makes Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san a good anime in its own right. I\'d also like to mention Kuroitsu\'s right hand, Wolf Bete. She, well, he was supposed to be male, but was given a female body. As such, her, uh, his interactions with other characters are more interesting which really gives me a laugh whenever it comes up.But out of all characters, my favorite one for this series goes to ""Camula,"" the head of Agastia\'s Pluripotent Cell Department. Her dominant personality was enough to hook me on her from the first frame she appeared, and the fact that she has her gap moe of being an idol fan is truly adorable. Also, Ayana Taketatsu as her voice actress? No surprises there.Like I said earlier, this anime is a hidden gem that should be known to everyone. This anime is simply not a Kamen Rider parody, and it is utterly preemptive to just dismiss it as that. It is a unique anime in its own right and is an unexpectedly enjoyable masterpiece. Watching the ending episode was also one of the most hyped I have been that not even Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to has given me. And like many anime that preceded it, I want a second season of Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san. development researcher for the evil organization Agastia.

And like many anime that preceded it, I want a second season of Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san.', 'Another anime that will goes to my “Guilty Pleasure” list.Tokusatsu inspired story ?POV of a villain ?Genderbend main lead ?Oh boy this is like my wet dream.I’ve always wanted a Tokusatsu based anime with the villain group as the main lead and this anime pretty much it.Sure it’s not a serious and grim action anime and more of a comedy anime but altleast it’s still funny and entertaining.Im also pretty sure that this anime is gonna be full of fanservice which perfectly fine for me since the “female” chara is pretty cute,I probably would never bored seeing the fanservice that involving “her”.Genderbend is also...a theme that quite crucial…? In this anime and eventhough there’s already like two anime that adapted genderbend as it’s main plot but this anime can still hold itself out since the story is fresh cause there’s not a lot of anime that use Tokusatsu and Kaijin as it’s main plot.As for the music, I love the opening,it has that 2000s Kamen Rider series vibe to it which is pretty good considering the tokusatsu theme and I probably wouldn’t get bored by listening to it over and over.As for the animation,it’s quite good.It’s not the best animation quality in this season but for me it’s already slightly above average.And now for my favorite part,the characterI love them all,from their design and personality.Megistus has a very cool design as Kaijin boss,usually kaijin boss looks terrifying and ugly like yuumies from 000,Starfish Hitler from Kamen Rider X (yeah,that’s exist) and Another Rider from Zi-O series but Megistus is just cool AF,in fact he looks more like a kamen rider rather than a kaijin boss,despite the fact that he is a villain,he still show how much of a comic book relief character he is.Kuroitsu and Professor Hajime is supposed to be a mad scientist type of villain but turn out our MC is another clumsy and funny character and it should be since this is a comedy anime.And there’s Wolf,first I just wanna say that “she” is ADORABLE,”she” sounds adorable,”she” acts adorable,and “she” looks adorable,making me forgot that “she” supposed to be a man.Out of the Genderbend MC this season,Wolf definitely takes the crown here.Overall,one of the hidden gems in this season,I totally recommended this to those who interested to tokusatsu and comedy just as much as I do.The story is also quite original and somewhat refreshing and it’s absurdity is definitely will get your attention (I mean there’s a chicken kaijin using revolver in the opening,how absurd is that)so give it a try. a theme that quite crucial…?

Add on to that a show that actually shows the perspective of the typical evil group of monsters found in toku shows with a female mc from a comedic perspective? Conceptually it’s brilliant, but execution of it is…actually pretty decently good and surprised me in a few ways. Whether you’re a comedy or toku fan, there’s a pretty enjoyable show here.The story is relatively simple enough. Kuriotsu is a researcher in the monster development department at the secret, evil corporation of Agastia. It’s...her job along with the main head of the department Shinya to create various monsters to tackle our hero of the story, Blader. Of course being a comedy, the story leans heavily into parodying the genre applying real life work culture, budgets, deadlines, etc. to making these monsters, which is in part where some of the humor comes from. The story doesn’t just follow her though, you’ll see side stories following some of the various monsters, a couple of magical girls that treat it more as a job than actual heroics, a girl just trying to live paycheck to paycheck via being a costumed goon for hire for various toku villains that aren’t Agastia, etc. Blader himself gets a good amount of focus too of course being the main hero, and even he has to work a 2nd job to make ends meet on top of being a hero in almost a Spiderman-esque situation.One minor note, I will say is that the series is full of references and cameos of various toku series both popular and niche. You get anything from Ultraseven being the narrator of one episode, or various animated appearances of real toku chars/heroes that are on air in Japan. You don’t need to know any of this stuff and the series certainly doesn’t rely on fanservice to be successful, but it’s a nice extra thing to have for hardcore toku fans.As a comedy, I found the jokes to be kinda hit or miss. I did enjoy the series overall as it doesn’t just rely on comedy, but the actual jokes sometimes rely too much on common anime tropes. There’s a solid dozen boob jokes in the series, and the milage you get out of Wolf’s whole running gag of having a guy brain but being in a girl’s body may vary. Largely, I don’t care about that kinda humor, but they’re not the only type of jokes the series does. The parts that did hit often were the parody of toku tropes, office humor, or just various one off gags that worked well.Something that did surprise me about this show was that it actually has a good level of worldbuilding. It explores considerably how society looks at monsters and how both Agastia and other evil corporations operate in the world, but never to the point it felt too serious, dark, or nonsensical. Y’know how I mentioned how the show doesn’t just focus on Kuriotsu and Blader? Well yeah, often those parts of the eps that focus on the other chars help flesh out the world, and I’d say it makes the series as a whole more appealing.The characterization is good enough. There’s definitely better characterization in comedies out there, but you’ll still find a likable cast here. Kuriotsu is a determined young woman, and honestly one of the better female protags I’ve seen in anime. She’s got great leadership skills, looks out for her fellow employees/comrades, is actually pretty strong combat wise, has plenty of tenacity, but still has a cute, relatable side to her. Wolfy is to an extent the deuteragonist of the series, but they have similar qualities to Kuriotsu with a somewhat more aggressive, tsundere side to them. The side cast in general gets alright development, outside of a few I’d say barely any are just one note chars that are just there for some gag. Blader himself gets a good amount of development too, though I’d say it’s sort of just your usual shonen mc development. I’m not sure I’d say its anything unique, outside of him technically being the antagonist.Animation wise, the show is above average. Characters are certainly expressive, and the visual gags hit well. Otherwise though, I’d say the animation is comparable to your average isekai. I guess one highlight is that I recall there being pretty much no or barely any CGI, so I guess that’s one positive. I think the character designs in general are pretty strong, even if some of the faces on the girls look a bit samey.Voice acting is fine, I don’t have any complaints here. Standard acting for these sort of comedies. Music I actually quite enjoyed. The OP is bombastic and gets you into the action, and you get 2 EDs one being a hotblooded theme song for Blader, and the other just being a silly ED about Kuriotsu. The general soundtrack I liked, but didn’t feel was very memorable.Overall, this was a good show. I wouldn’t call it great, but again I think it's highly enjoyable as a toku fan, and still a nice watch for comedy fans.

It's obviously a parody of sentai shows such as Power Rangers and Ultraman. I've never really watched those types of shows, but they're ingrained enough into even American pop culture and have enough similarities to American superheroes that you'll probably get it anyways.

It can be pretty comedic at times, and I find the concept to be very novel, however I find the treatment of the ""genderbent"" character (wolf-kun) who is literally made in the wrong gendered body to be very bad.

There doesnt seem to be any progress with other characters listening to or accepting them and it seems to all be punching down for laughs.

Yes, sadly that is why I cannot enjoy this because the creator or producer or whoever of this anime decided it was ok to make fun of transgender folk. This starts in episode 2 with Wolf-kun and each episode there after (I only saw 5 and dropped it) has at least one instance of someone making fun of AND disrespecting Wolf-kun with female pronounces, sexual...harassment and the misuse of the Japanese honorifics system to boot. Maybe the Dub will handle this better (Doubtful for episode 2) but I somehow doubt it. If you're going to make someone whose transgender in your work, then you NEED to show them the PROPER respect they deserve, no matter what being you created them as, we ALL are beings who deserve respect!

The characters, minus any instances of making fun of Wolf-kun, are actually ok to good.

Anyway, if the mistreatment of someone whose transgender wasn't mistreated, then this anime would most likely have been rated a 7.0 by me and not dropped, but it's not and I cannot overlook (nor should you) and move past this when it happens in each episode.

You don’t necessarily have to sit down and watch all of it, but you might find a hidden gem. A show that flies under the radar that you may not have considered watching. This is more important than ever this season because with the amount of shows you look at once and then never touch again, you may have not given this one a chance. Well I’m going to tell you why you should give this one a check.Sit back, relax and work on your awesome Tokusatsu intro...as I present to you the anime review for Miss Kuroitsu from the Monster Development Department. Let’s begin.Story: 8.5/10“As long as good exists in this world, so, too, shall evil thrive. But behind this eternal clash of good and evil, there is another battle that goes unseen.”Which usually leads us to our main protagonist, Touka Kuroitsu. Touka is part of the evil Agasita organisation and works for the branch of developing monsters to beat the various Tokusatsu heroes scattered around Japan. However, the team struggles to develop a monster capable to defeat the hero “Kenshin Blader.” So Touka is determined to develop a monster that will defeat Blader and get what she desires the most. A promotion to the executive branch.What I like the most about this show and becomes more obvious as time goes on is that this show likes to wear multiple hats. What I thought was going to be a simple parody of the Tokusatsu genre from the villains perspective turned into more of a parody of common, Japanese businesses and shows off multiple instances where it can give workers headaches. Budget costs, compromises, working and agreeing with other departments, presentations, both planned and emergency, recalls and executive meddling. It all happens across the series and manages to blend well with the evil organisation part of this show. It was what kept me interested in the show and see what they were going to do next. Sure, the villain perspective of the Tokusatsu genre was pretty interesting, but it was this added element that made the story as enjoyable as it was. It isn’t so obvious at first but once you start to realise that it is a parody of Japanese businesses, it changes your perspective of this show because they are doing more than they could’ve done. They could’ve just poked holes at the tokusatsu shows (and trust me, they do), but this addedd element to the story makes it more engaging to watch and was the highlight of the whole show for me.There is also a couple of side plots as well that were pretty interesting and connected nicely to the Japanese business elements of the story. There is one side plot following Karen Mizuki as she takes temp jobs working as evil henchman that usually happens at the end of each episode. Then there is another subplot for a couple of episodes following a rival evil organisation, Black Lore (which I believe is making a mockery of a Black Company, aka bad company) and how they treat their workers more poorly compared to Agasita where they treat their workers with care. While they don’t influence the main plot, they do act as nice compliments towards the main themes of this show.Also, because its more of parody, it doesn’t take itself that seriously and as such, is relying on its comedy as well to keep the viewer engaged. To which I think that they did a pretty good job. Sure it wasn’t always “haha” funny, although it did have some scenes that made me laugh, there were plenty of chuckle scenes that made me amused at the situation. It helps alleviate the truth about how these businesses work but it doesn’t muddle them down to the point where it doesn’t make it believable (well as believable you can get with an evil organisation).Characters: 7.5/10This is one of those cast of characters where they don’t generally stand out much but it would feel like the cast was lacking if they weren’t included. That might sound like a “What are you talking about?” moment but hear me out. This cast of characters is very solid by the fact that they all carry their own weight and play their own part and use that to help elevate the cast around them. When the majority of this cast is doing that, it elevates the cast of characters as a whole and as such, making this cast of characters more likeable.Now there are some characters that do slightly stand out from the rest for me. Touka does do her role well as the main protagonist and acts as the determined worker to do her best to get that promotion. Though, she is never in your face about it and is just trying to do her best which is nice that we don’t need to be constantly reminded. Megistus is probably my favourite supporting character. Second in command of Agasita, Megistus looks like someone who would throw you across the room if you did something wrong. But instead, he is a man who’s best interest is the care of his employees and to make sure everything is running smoothly by taking care of their interests and do what is best for Agasita. He is the kind of person who actually runs the company rather than Akashic, the leader of Agasita, who just uses her position for her best interests, hence where the executive meddling comes from. There are other characters like Cannon Thunderbird, Wolf and Camula but it is the fact they all hold their own weight that makes this cast of characters as a whole likeable and fun to watch. Do I wish some of these characters stood out more? Sure, but they are recognisable in their own way that makes them likeable.Animation: 6/10Animation is fine. I would say it is slightly above average because it doesn’t over rely on still images and does animate alright. Really, the standout bit is the character designs as I do like them. From the monster girls to the hero costumes, they look thematically appropriate for the genre we are parodying here, especially the monster girls because you can tell the Akashic has had her executive hands all over them to make then cute. Also, give credit to Megistus to keeping his mask on and still rock wearing a business suit every now and then. For a debut title for Studio Quad, it’s an alright first attempt.Sound: 6.5/10I actually do like some of the soundtracks in this show but once again, it feels thematically appropriate and only really enhances the scene. Some parts of the soundtrack are simple to go with the light hearted tone and don’t really offer much but some of the more action scenes have a soundtrack that helps get in to the mood that this is also a Tokusatsu show. Although I do like that all the heroes have their own little theme song.The opening is very upbeat with a very nice rhythm to it as well. Called ""Special Force"" by AXXX1S. The lyrics and visuals help give a nice motivation that no matter how hard the challenge, If you give it your all and persevere, you will come out better on the other side. It also acts a nice quick intro to get a glimpse of this large cast of characters. It is a rather underrated opening in my opinion and really helps get into the mood of the show. It being catchy as well also helps.Now there are two EDs in this show and one is better than the other. ""Aimai Identity"" by Maybe Me, just feels like an inferior version of “Special Force” as it gives off the same vibes but isn’t as done as well, although I do like the visuals. Rather, I prefer ""Destiny"" by Maybe Me because it pretty much acts like Kamen Rider’s intro sequence if he had his own show and will change from time to time, depending on what other hero show up near the end of the episode. It certainly captures the vibe the Tokusatsu shows present and it just makes me laugh as how this show just embraces it and this ED is the cherry on top.Conclusion:Trust me when I say this that this show offers a lot more enjoyment than it initially seems. The heart and soul of this series is its corporate working predicaments disguised as a Tokusatsu series and it does that so god damn well. It is also complimented by a fun cast of characters and a good art style that help make this show that much better. I would say this show is my sleeper of the season. The show’s good writing and characters make this show a really good time and I think it offers something different that should have made it stand out.This season has been weak on good shows to watch with only a handful that are worth watching besides sequels. This is one of those shows as it offers something different that it executes really well. So between generic shounen against Daemons, an unexciting, extreme Baseball series or another mobile game anime featuring cute girls, I do recommend that you give this one a go and please don’t let it fall under the cracks.My Personal Enjoyment: 8/10Overall Score: 7.3/10 Recommendation: Watch It as I present to you the anime review for Miss Kuroitsu from the Monster Development Department. Let’s begin.Story: 8.5/10“As long as good exists in this world, so, too, shall evil thrive. But behind this eternal clash of good and evil, there is another battle that goes unseen.”Which usually leads us to our main protagonist, Touka Kuroitsu. Touka is part of the evil Agasita organisation and works for the branch of developing monsters to beat the various Tokusatsu heroes scattered around Japan. However, the team struggles to develop a monster capable to defeat the hero “Kenshin Blader.” So Touka is determined to develop a monster that will defeat Blader and get what she desires the most. A promotion to the executive branch.What I like the most about this show and becomes more obvious as time goes on is that this show likes to wear multiple hats. What I thought was going to be a simple parody of the Tokusatsu genre from the villains perspective turned into more of a parody of common, Japanese businesses and shows off multiple instances where it can give workers headaches. Budget costs, compromises, working and agreeing with other departments, presentations, both planned and emergency, recalls and executive meddling. It all happens across the series and manages to blend well with the evil organisation part of this show. It was what kept me interested in the show and see what they were going to do next. Sure, the villain perspective of the Tokusatsu genre was pretty interesting, but it was this added element that made the story as enjoyable as it was. It isn’t so obvious at first but once you start to realise that it is a parody of Japanese businesses, it changes your perspective of this show because they are doing more than they could’ve done. They could’ve just poked holes at the tokusatsu shows (and trust me, they do), but this addedd element to the story makes it more engaging to watch and was the highlight of the whole show for me.There is also a couple of side plots as well that were pretty interesting and connected nicely to the Japanese business elements of the story. There is one side plot following Karen Mizuki as she takes temp jobs working as evil henchman that usually happens at the end of each episode. Then there is another subplot for a couple of episodes following a rival evil organisation, Black Lore (which I believe is making a mockery of a Black Company, aka bad company) and how they treat their workers more poorly compared to Agasita where they treat their workers with care. While they don’t influence the main plot, they do act as nice compliments towards the main themes of this show.Also, because its more of parody, it doesn’t take itself that seriously and as such, is relying on its comedy as well to keep the viewer engaged. To which I think that they did a pretty good job. Sure it wasn’t always “haha” funny, although it did have some scenes that made me laugh, there were plenty of chuckle scenes that made me amused at the situation. It helps alleviate the truth about how these businesses work but it doesn’t muddle them down to the point where it doesn’t make it believable (well as believable you can get with an evil organisation).Characters: 7.5/10This is one of those cast of characters where they don’t generally stand out much but it would feel like the cast was lacking if they weren’t included. That might sound like a “What are you talking about?” moment but hear me out. This cast of characters is very solid by the fact that they all carry their own weight and play their own part and use that to help elevate the cast around them.

Hell I didn’t even know what any of that was until after finishing the show. So I ended up learning something from a show I thought I could otherwise turn my brain off while watching. And with that said, you don’t even need to know any of that stuff either to enjoy this show. Would it help further your enjoyment? Yeah sure, especially with the last episode and all the narrators/cameos for each episode, but not necessary in...the slightest. In short this show pays tribute, homage, and respect to shows of the tokusatsu genre, featuring live action characters and colorful special effects, and are aimed at children. Super Sentai airs alongside the Kamen Rider series in the Super Hero Time programming block on Sunday mornings. In North America, the Super Sentai series is best known as the source material for the Power Rangers series. Got that? K, good. Now local heroes are fictional Japanese superheroes created to represent a particular region of Japan, such as a prefecture or city. They are typically themed after the locale of their creators, and often perform in special martial arts stage shows, and serve to teach children about certain things such as road traffic and food safety.This show builds its identity and theme around those concepts. Again, all of which were foreign to me before starting the series. So my first impression was that this was going to be a comedy series that relies on being a monster of the week sort of deal, in the most literal sense. And I would’ve been content with that, as the first episode left me in stitches at a time I was really down on my luck. And also in an otherwise mostly sol, isekai/fantasy, romantic filled season. Now sure there were other comedies airing around the same time too, but I wanted something that was more comedically barebones and didn’t rely on the romance or fantasy aspect for the source of its comedy. So I picked up this series solely based on the poster and positive but small reception it was getting on /a/. And boy am I glad I did, this show was the highlight of my week. It was unpredictable but not lol so random, it had critiques of the japanese work environment without getting its head stuck up its ass, and it did the impossible and got me to genuinely fall head over heels for an idol character.Speaking of which, all characters in this series are a riot. Wolf-kun, Kuroitsu-san, Canon(a badass bird who can defeat just about anyone except for blader, despite his non-intimidating and feathered exterior), long ranged uncle, the jobber friends, mummy-chan, the magical ‘girl’ duo, and possibly the most awesome of all, Megustas! I could go on and on about the characters and what they bring to the table in terms of jokes and variety. I wish the series focused on certain characters more like spider-chan and the leader, with her room of maidenly conditioned love. But I admire how the series is able to have a large cast, yet retain its focus on the handful that matter. And it’s a good thing that these characters are as likable as they are.The story usually pertains to how they’ll be able to defeat their rival, local hero Blader! But will sometimes divert from the main plot to focus on other tasks such as job interviews, going to the beach, getting approval from other higher up executives to create a new monster, and even discussing work with other evil companies. The plot is interesting and more than serviceable as a means for the jokes. And while the animation is never stellar, there is a noticeable dip in the quality around the last few episodes, save for the last bit of the final episode. But the show isn’t trying to win you over with its beautiful and articulate backgrounds or animation, it just wants to make your day brighter and give props to all the heroes old and new. This series didn’t nearly get the credit it deserved and was probably my personal highlight of the season even if others seem to disagree, and if there were objectively more well made shows. If you liked Samurai Flamenco, you just might also fall in love with Kuroitsu San.> the slightest.

Nobody around me watched Miss Kuroitsu from the Monster Development Department, and the discussions were low and barely had. Right from the start I felt this was going to be my personal anime of the season and I was right for once.Uniquely, the story revolves around the villains rather than the heroes. Agastia is a secret evil organization that specializes in creating monsters to take over the world. Because of the harsh and rather ridiculous corporate politics taking place behind the...scenes, the monsters they create are often laughable and defective. Trying to make this realistic in a series is clever in that it becomes comically absurd. Even though they are evil, they have high morals when making decisions, because this series does not take itself seriously at all and makes fun of everything in it that it can. Off the clock, these are decent people. From absurdly long episode titles, awkward timing between scenes done on purpose, ridiculously cheese hero lines and moments, random jokes thrown all over the place, a giant cast of characters with many based on real life local heroes from Japan, an android with an absurdly overexaggerated robotic voice, it's impressive how creative this series is and how it all blends in.My only real complaint is that the animation implodes and falls apart in the last two episodes. That doesn't take away the fact it had a great grand finale and more.Agastia is going up against Blader, the comically overpowered hero that stands in their way. As schedules run tight, budgets run low, and bugs and glitches emerge during production, Miss Koroitsu tries her best to create the right monster to defeat him. At the same time, her attitude towards this makes it look as if she isn't very serious about it and failure feels like something she just gets used to. As a result, a wide cast of colorful monsters appear. My favorite is Cannon. A monster that during development had a fearsome giant design with all sorts of horrifying powers. However, after some help from the clumsy Leader with strict budget limitations taken into account, the final product ends up being a big goofy bird with a scouter and handgun. Just writing about this still makes me laugh.This series treats it's characters well, and even minor characters come full circle and become relevant. As comical as this series is, and as huge as it's ocean of corny hero lines are, this can still feel inspirational with it's messages of defying evil, refusing to lose, and carrying out your destiny with an unshakable will. The cast's job of creating monsters can be difficult, lots of obstacles get in the way, and the amount of overtime can be exhausting, but they don't give up and keep going. Combined with this is a great soundtrack, one of my favorite Ending Sequences, and clever humor I cannot get enough of.At first it seems Blader and Kuroitsu are just fighting a simple war. Then it's shown there is much more to them off the clock, as they are much closer than they think. This goes along with the ridiculous plot twists in this series that usually had me laughing.Megistus is definitely my favorite character. He is the mind of the organization and chief strategist. His character is interesting in that despite the organization being evil, his code of conduct is very honorable, and his treatment of his subordinates is comically compassionate. He's serious, but feels as if he is just messing with everyone with the politics of his organization. It's funny to see him be the most professional of professional and ideal boss of an evil monster developing organization wanting to take over the world.After a very satisfying ending, it surprised me that I was not even close to being the target audience for this, and missed a barrage of references. Still, I can't deny this one was special, and worth the watch. scenes, the monsters they create are often laughable and defective.

Overall this is a slice of life seinen comedy with workplace and super hero humor. It seems they included a lot of existing Super Sentai/Power Rangers heroes into the series which I found to be quite endearing. Kaijin Kaihatsu focuses on the villains however, and it does a great job in doing so. To be more precise it focuses on developing all the strange monsters normally featured in Super Sentai type shows. It also includes power ups, giant robots, all the usual Japanese Super Hero...stuff. It is a great series to watch and fun to see the villain side and efforts put in to create their ""evil"" monsters.The workplace humor is quite great and had many amusing moments. The titular character Kuroitsu is also a great character. There\'s a lot of modern humor featured as well but with the Japanese anime style comedy. Basically if you like anime style comedy, this show is likely for you. The modern gags I personally believe were well done and achieved creating a fun modern comedy show. There\'s also little bits of lore here and there for many of the characters. The entire evil company featured in the show was completely filled with great characters too.Overall this show is very good in general to relax to. It is a modern Super Sentai from the point of view of the evil side, endearing characters all over, and it is a show that is also mostly a comedy anime. stuff.

Most of the theme-specific comedy bits hit quite well. I wouldn't say it's very funny as I don't remember laughing out loud once but, there are a lot of brilliant comical Tokusatsu genre references. My only nitpick is that at some point, they started loosening the concept and started doing some basic work-life bits instead of villain organization work-related bits. But overall, this is a good Parody Anime entry. I'd watch the 2nd season if there'll be one. Hopefully, with more comical situations involving Super Sentai characters.STORY (5/10):The story didn't really have any worth-it payoff, even for comedy Anime...standards. The Agastia's Monster Development Division's main purpose is to make monsters, which they did make a lot earlier on. But in the end, the final project that Miss Kuroitsu made was a Super Sentai armor which helped them win the battle. The point about treating the created monsters right wasn't really pushed enough. Other than Wolf Bete, we don't really get to see much love for the other monsters as we only get to see them during some filler comical episodes doing non-monster-specific gags. The only ones that really contributed something to the theme are Cannon and Hydra's snake sisters, and the Anti-Blader turned Idol for one episode.There's also the side-story about the odd-jobber girl that kept getting herself hired to do dangerous goon jobs by her supervisor. I thought that was gonna end up playing an important part in the finale but, it had a disappointing conclusion.The dynamic between Kenshin Blader and Kuroitsu meeting in person on regular days unaware of each other's secret identities was the only one that has a payoff in the end. That was fun to see but, at some point, Kenshin Blader wasn't really on screen much so, it didn't hit hard in the end. Still a good moment though.CHARACTER (5/10):There are lots of them, but most of them we don't really get to see much substance from. Not to say they were unlikeable. They just weren't fleshed out enough.Wolf immediately took the spotlight after appearing. Some noteworthy characters for me are Hydra's Snake sisters, Megistus, and Uncle Long-range. Karen and her supervisor Heike also did a lot of end-credit skits which was fun while it lasted. Kenshin Blader could've been fun with a little more of his normal life bits but there wasn't enough. So other than Kuroitsu and Wolf, the rest are mostly just one-offs.Hopefully, if there's gonna be a 2nd season, we get to see characters be involved in situations where their character-specific gags will shine.ART and SOUND (5/10):Character designs are good. But art quality is definitely low and inconsistent.The only thing I scored for SOUND is the OP theme. It's too catchy for me to ignore (*SPECIAL FORCE!!!*). The ED was generic. And it's so forgetful that I had to listen to it just to remember how it sounded for this review. VA's wasn't that impressive as well. No one stood out as a unique character voice.OVERALL (6.5/10):I still enjoyed it even with all of my nitpicks but, my expectation for this wasn't really that high in the first place. All I wanted from this was for them to properly deliver the Tokusatsu-parody concept, and for me, that they did. At least for the most part. And credits to them for not pulling too much ecchi stuff. I'm not sure if I want to recommend this but, all I know is that I quite had fun with it. Maybe put it on your list if you're a fan of parody/spoof, sketch-based genre, and give it a try when you're in the mood for it. standards.

But art quality is definitely low and inconsistent.The only thing I scored for SOUND is the OP theme. It's too catchy for me to ignore (*SPECIAL FORCE!!!*). The ED was generic. And it's so forgetful that I had to listen to it just to remember how it sounded for this review. VA's wasn't that impressive as well. No one stood out as a unique character voice.OVERALL (6.5/10):I still enjoyed it even with all of my nitpicks but, my expectation for this wasn't really that high in the first place. All I wanted from this was for them to properly deliver the Tokusatsu-parody concept, and for me, that they did. At least for the most part. And credits to them for not pulling too much ecchi stuff. I'm not sure if I want to recommend this but, all I know is that I quite had fun with it. Maybe put it on your list if you're a fan of parody/spoof, sketch-based genre, and give it a try when you're in the mood for it."", 'Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san has a really fun and interesting premise. A comedy based on the classic evil organization vs hero trope. No, this isn\'t one of those anime where the MC is OP and decides to join the evil organization to get revenge on the hero party, nor is it the type of anime where the MC decides to introduce technology from their home world to get an edge on their competitors. This is a show that focuses on the worldbuilding and slice of life of a ""realistically"" depicted evil organization that fights against heroes in conquest for ""world domination.""I say ""realistically,"" but the...show obviously is still comedically focused, but the worldbuilding does show its charm and is the reason I stuck out with it all the way to the end. How does monster development logistically work, and how do they churn out the monster of the week for the heroes? Take a look into the inner workings of evil organization, Agastia. Complete with merit based promotions, company compliances, deadlines, and budgets, the show does put the effort of making an evil organization into an actual company.How do monsters get developed to fight the heroes? Of course, through research. Whether this be functional capabilities in the brain, designing the perfect cellular structure, and the whole beaucracy of juggling between different research departments to meet the demands of the design of the customer, there are a lot of factors to creating a monster, and is what this show is all about. Of course, this also creates the fun slice of life for the show. What happens when a monster that is created loses to the hero? Well, you\'re going to have a bunch of interactions with all of the monsters that have been created and how they integrate to modern life. One of the main characters is a wolf monster that got completely remodeled to have a female body due to a last second whimsical decision by the organization head, and is forced to work as a research at the monster development team.Yes, you have all of the process of creating the monster, as well as their subsequent interactions later on, but you also have a wide range of characters that the show never gets stale, focusing on one thing. You have distinct executives of other departments, rival company research departments, the erratic and playful leader, as well as the cool-headed chief of staff. All of these bring a large array, but not too overwhelming set of charactersThis show hones in on the monster development department, but it also touches base with all of the other endeavors of Agastia, like other investment ventures, recruitment, and its relationship with heroes, which is more of a work relationship than a ""killing each other at all costs"" one. Evil organizations are for profit, after all. The heroes, too, are depicted as part of the world building process. Magical girls, small time heroes are shown to have their own network of heroes to fight off all sorts of evil organizations, and what they\'re like when they\'re off the clock.Overall, a show that has variety, showing things like making a valentine\'s themed monster, how contractors work as evil henchmen for various organizations, or the painful beaucracy of getting the signature of all executives for approval of a projectAnimation-wise, the show is also below average, as indicated with the cutting corners of all fight scenes, usually being abstracted in some shape of form. But I\'ll be honest, the fight scenes are the least relevant thing in the show, and is not the focus at all, so it didn\'t really hinder my viewing experience.It seems like I\'m singing only praises, and that my score does not reflect this review. That much is true, and that\'s because despite my love of the show and how much I enjoy the world-building, the comedy-a major aspect of the show is lacking. The comedic timing and execution does not match the fun worldbuilding that the show introduces.

If you don't like those, you're not gonna like this show. I love those, so I like this show a lot.Art is subpar, yes, but it gets the job done, and even if this show had Fate Zero style fight scenes, the shounen watchers would complain that this show doesn't take itself seriously, that the...plot is nonexistent, the jokes are occasionally cliche, and the character design is predictably boring.The show is _actually_ funny if you like watching Kamen Rider without context clips on youtube, or if you liked akibaranger, the live action super sentai spoof show. It's not as good as say Full Metal Alchemist Fumoffu, or Ghost Stories dub but it's better than Desert Punk dub. It's probably about as good as Inferno Cop or Panty and Stocking dub.I looked forward to watching this show as I was going through it (I can't say the same of many shounen/seinen that I've seen, particularly fate or re:zero), and the dialogue was actually _not_ terrible because of how accurate/intelligent it was. For example, there's an idol episode, where a mute girl wants to become a singing idol, but she literally does not have vocal chords. There's a fast paced series of actions that supporting characters do to actually do a small debut at a mall, and it wraps up rather cleanly, but the logistics of actually doing the event are somewhat explained.Oh and the final episode is literally about how mergers and acquisitions from giant corporations are flawed when it comes to actually delivering product in a reasonable fashion.

Things like Ore Twintail or Samumenco, or even Sentouin Hasshin Shimasu. For some reason, tokusatsu anime works really well when paired with another genre, and in the case of Kuroitsu-san, that other genre is a work comedy.I hadn\'t even known such a manga existed before this, but I have been a big fan of the author ever since his doujin days as Suichuu Hanabi, even buying some doujins personally from him at Comiket, and I\'m happy to...report that Kuroitsu-san is very much evocative of his style of work, his style of comedy that I have been in love with since many years ago. This show has made me feel a sense of nostalgia that is very personal to me as someone who is very familiar with the author\'s work, so please do excuse me if my biases leak out in the following review.Kuroitsu-san is at its heart a work comedy with the skin of a tokusatsu show. The kicker is that the company Kuroitsu-san is working for isn\'t a ""black company"", but one that seems like a decent place to work for with supportive bosses and only the very occasional workplace bullshit that is depressingly resonant with reality. Work comedies need to straddle the line in finding the right place to mine its comedy without reminding the viewer of the soul crushing realities of the workplace. If the show can\'t achieve this balancing act, you\'ll end up with something like Senko-san where it\'s genuinely difficult to sit through without being reminded of overtime and all the nights spent in the office. Kuroitsu-san, thankfully, successfully provides a reliable and comfortable watching experience every weekend.Reframing the whole tokusatsu genre itself as a work comedy does lend the show some very interesting topics. Concepts like supply and demand get reframed as building monsters for the consumer (hero) to defeat, or how evil companies like Agastia still has to go through proper compliance and regulations. It\'s often very fresh to see how these tropes so common to the genre get reimagined in a different context, and each week provides something new to look forward to.Production wise the show is very rough. The animation is generally passable but, especially towards the end, it does deteriorate, though not to the point of any glaring animation issues. The voices for the main duo are kind of bland and do not grow on you, where it\'s clear a good chunk of the budget is dedicated to the supporting cast instead.The show does contain anime original moments where local tokusatsu heroes guest star in either cameo roles or very minor arcs with Mizuki\'s side of the story. These were all really nice though it does wear out its welcome by the halfway point where the schtick gets kind of old and you realize they\'re not doing anything significant. I do like Mizuki\'s arc though, it\'s developed well and is also a nice reference to how some actors start out as bit roles before finally branching out into something major, and it\'s still framed in that wonderful workplace theme I mentioned earlier.Overall, while I very much do like this show in spite of its faults, I feel like a show like this would only appeal to someone like myself. Strange weird comedies like these are sadly often overlooked, and especially ones with its humor pulled from two very disparate sources. Still, if you\'re up for something that\'s really different, or if you\'re like me and have a penchant for tokusatsu AND work comedies AND have your childhood be defined by the 2000s, then this show is tailor made for you. It even has not one, but TWO gender bending moments.

The sentai aspects and moster-of-the-week nature really play second fiddle to a relatable office comedy that is definitely worth a watch. The animation and art are not impressive, but they are serviceable. It\'s a low-budget show, sure. However, in my experience, budget has relatively little to do with the ""fun"" factor of a show. This one has heart put into it, and that makes it leagues better than a show that is technically impressive, but uninspired. It\'s a good laugh and definitely worth your time if you...enjoyed last season\'s ""the vampire dies in no time"" and ""my senpai is annoying"". These shows had similar humour, and ""the vampire dies in no time"" in particular feels like it pulls off the same ""low budget but solid comedic chops"" move that ""monster department"" is aiming for.It might look average from the outside, but for my money, this show is more than the sum of its parts. I would definitely recommend giving it a watch before writing it off, because you might just find that you really enjoy it. enjoyed last season\'s ""the vampire dies in no time"" and ""my senpai is annoying"".

It's a total Frankenstein of a TV show and yet for some reason it just works. The show is both an advertisement for IRL prefectural sentai mascots and a satire of Japanese work culture.

Kikou Senki Dragonar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/865/Kikou_Senki_Dragonar,"['With the success of Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and to some extent, ZZ Gundam, Sunrise decided to create a new mecha series since they felt that Gundam was getting too old and thus created Dragonar, a potential sucessor to Gundam and a reintroduction of mecha anime to potential new fans. Even though it was a fairly popular when it aired in 1987, it is a fairly obscure mecha anime that only few fans will hear about and is  main reason why no proper subs exist for it.Being a ""remake"" of Gundam 0079, the plot bears a lot of similarities to it. Dragonar...takes place in 2087 where Earth is engaged in a war with the Giganos Empire who seeks to dominate the planet and establish a ""rebirth"" of mankind. Three teenagers stumble upon three prototype mecha called the Dragonars and are thus forced into the conflict. Due to the fact that Dragonar was also made right after ZZ Gundam, it is less serious than the show it was based off on and has a more comedic and lighthearted tone similar to ZZ. The characters in Dragonar also share many similarities with their 0079 counterparts with Kaine being a goofier version of Amuro Ray, Rose Pattenton being a direct reference to Fraw Bow, Linda Plato a homage to Sayla Mass and Meio Plato resembling Char Aznable completely (with the only difference being that his signature color as an ace is blue, not red).Even with these similarities to Gundam, Dragonar still manages to be a rather entertaining (if not a bit generic) mecha anime. Its starts up fairly similar and ends fairly similar to 0079, but the main difference between the two series is that Dragonar\'s main focus is not the mecha battles (even though there are a ton), but rather the romance that develops between Kaine and Linda, along with how Kaine and his two friends, Light and Tap becoming increasingly more important to the Earth Federation. The story picks up and becomes more engaging once the cast leaves space and enters Earth, but the introduction of Gon Jem and his lackeys around the mid way mark of the show results to a somewhat weaker second half. Gon Jem\'s resemblance to a goat man on steroids,who is supposed to be a feared commander, is simply hard to take seriously as a antagonist. His subordinates with the exception of Min and Zin are also incredibly annoying, but thankfully most of them are gone by the finale. This arc is also one of the silliest, with examples such as Kaine seeking out a one armed martial artist in China in order to learn a technique that can help him beat Gon Jem. Thankfully the last arc of the show is able to turn things around and ends with a satisfying (if not slightly rushed ending), but you will feel that it could have been handled a bit better.If you\'re a fan of mecha, Dragonar is worth checking out even though it might not be as good as the anime it was ""based"" off one. Sadly as mentioned before, there are no completed fansubs for this show and it is thus only viewable with completed HK subs that are often very off in its translation and or in Chinese fansubs. But if you can look over this subtitling issue due to its obscurity, Dragonar is an anime that is worth your time. takes place in 2087 where Earth is engaged in a war with the Giganos Empire who seeks to dominate the planet and establish a ""rebirth"" of mankind.

However there were some original ideas in it that it could stand on it's own, however it's pretty much unheard of in the west. It would now be called dated even though it's animation was pretty much the standard for the time it was made, however being made after the success of Gundam took off it benefits from a better animation than the original Gundam.

It starts off as pretty good ""sister-series"" to Gundam ZZ, light hearted and enjoyable. But commits the cardinal sin of ""being boring"", as it starts to ignore the group dynamic of the main trio and focus either Kaine, or later in the show, a goofy Mad Max inspired enemy squad. This part was especially disheartening, as they had already introduced interesting foils in the  dutybound Char Aznable-clone Meio Plato and his group of loyal subordinates. These characters, as well as ongoings of the evil Giganos Empire, too is sidelined to make way...for the meaningless shenanigans with this squad.The show from the beginning had a lot of Gundam ideas copied over, but in the last couple episodes hits the viewer over the head with a lot of Zeon imagery while tension is low since the narration in plain terms tells the viewer that things are going well. Oh yeah, and the suit designs are overall middling.

Kidou Senshi Victory Gundam,https://myanimelist.net/anime/89/Kidou_Senshi_Victory_Gundam,"[""Story: Without a doubt, V Gundam is the saddest Gundam story to date. And before anything else is said, I think it's worth a mention to say that a lot of people die, and most of the time for no good reason at all. That aside, I have to say I really loved the storyline. However, some of the story arcs in the middle could have been left out, and the story would still be intact; a lot of the time during said arcs I found myself wondering why the characters were doing what they were doing. There's not a lot of narrative glue to...stick the parts together, and to keep one interested during some of the low parts. But, overall it's a nice story, with an emphasis on death, and at least during the last arc, a huge emphasis on the beauty of life.Art: Very good. V Gundam uses a very simple art style to convey the characters and the Mobile Suits; which is both good and bad. Most of the Suits are very similar to each other, and are very rarely any unique. Characters however, look very nice, and some are just too cool for words, while others are just meh. Battles are everything you would expect from a mecha show, and although somewhat exaggerated at times (or almost all of the time), they're mostly very good. The simple style works here to make the art very nice looking even today.Sound: Not much to say here. There's an excellent cast of actors working on the voices, and the mecha sounds are great, but nothing really stands out in this category.Characters: We've got a cast of mostly children and women, with the main villain and one of the main characters being male. The rest of the male cast are either lesser characters or very old men. I can't quite remember why the cast is like it is, but it brings a fresh look on what might be a stale storyline. It also has the effect of removing almost all romantic involvement between the main characters. There's a peace-loving-battle-scarred boy, a princess girl, and a group of what seem to be orphaned children. Interaction between them is what really pushes the story along. Without a doubt, Oliver and Captain Gomez were my favorite characters, both of which received little screen time, but both of whom were very central to the story.Overall: No where near as good as First Gundam, V Gundam is nonetheless a very nice looking, anime featuring a somewhat lacking storyline that'll get your emotions running if you're not prepared for it. Definitely recommended if you've seen the other UC animes, however, the story is completely separate from the main meta-plot. stick the parts together, and to keep one interested during some of the low parts.

Now don’t get me wrong, victory gundam has flaws that has garnered it...infamy, many of the negatives attributed to victory gundam come from its supposedly forced deaths and odd placement of goofy and absurd moments. And those flaws are sadly quite true as there are many deaths that frankly felt forced and didn’t need to happen in addition to some downright bizarre scenes that feel completely out of place with the show’s generally dark and depressing tone. However while victory gundam has its weak points I also believe it does so much right that it can outweigh its faults in the end, that is if one’s tolerances for what it does wrong is strong enough and this is going to greatly determine whether victory is for you or not.As unconventional and potentially dissuading as this may be its probably best to address the negatives of this series first before getting into what the show does right so try not to get dissuaded dead on arrival, Like I said I believe one\'s tolerance of the following things are really going to determine whether victory gundam is really for them and knowing what to expect is best in determining this:-Deaths: lets tackle this one right off the bat, victory gundam is billed with the largest body count in the franchise, and frankly there are quite a few deaths that didnt need to happen. Victory gundam has a bad tendency to introduce a character and give them focus for an episode only to kill them off immediately that same episode. Many of these deaths feel very formulaic and can create a disconnect in emotion the series should be conveying during these death scenes and instead makes them feel sloppy and lacking in impact. It really can make the deaths seem predictable and there are more than a few times where the reasons they die are completely avoidable. The worst case of this is a heroic sacrifice about halfway in of a semi important character up to that point where he/she kamikazes into a enemy to supposedly save another character....however the enemy is completely unaffected and the person they supposedly were saving was just fine without their sacrifice ultimately making their death needless.HOWEVER! Whilst victory gundam has its poorly executed deaths not all of them are bad, actually there are some truly well done and powerful death scenes. In fact most of the dumb and absurd death scenes are only done on really small and unimportant characters (admittedly sometimes as a result of the dying after being introduced complaint above) but whenever a generally major character dies (and alot of times even really minor one off characters) have some really impacting deaths. Its poorly done deaths are a big issue with the series but there is still really well done ones in there and Id actually argue there is more well done ones than bad and the good actually play a major part in developing the main character uso which ill get into in a bit. If you cant possibly forgive a series for dumb mistreatment of (mostly minor) character\'s mortality then victory gundam may irk you in the wrong way but if your willing to forgive the series in favor of the ones it does right than it may be more up ones alley-Absurdity: Victory gundam is a really dark series depicting the most brutal and at times disturbing imagery in the series; in some regards victory gundam is the most realistic gundam in the sense that the true brutality of war and the destruction these mechs are capable of causing are most accurately displayed in this series. And it’s for that reason these random absurd scenes can really hurt the show. Now you’re probably wondering what I mean by absurdity, what I mean by that is Victory gundam has a handful of really out of place goofy scenes that distract the dark tone of the show, worst of which is when the main character fights a squad of jetpacked bikkini soldiers who he unsurprisingly obliterates cause he is in a fucking mech (this scene is on youtube under the name ""Bikini Babe Assault in Victory Gundam"" if you don’t believe me). They are pretty rare but their appearances are memorable (but not in the good way) so that they will stick around in your mind and potentially hurting the series’ image. These scenes are generally pretty funny but when the show’s point is to be a dark and serious war drama being funny is not a good thing.Alright so if your still reading and shaking your head in disapproval from how I started off a review for a series I’m recommending by immediately shit talking it then its time to get into the part where I actually say why people should watch it. Victory gundam has its flaws but I believe victory also does much right:-Characters: This is by far the strongest part of victory gundam, for starters Uso erwin our protagonist has an instantly likable personality, to top this off the way his development is handled is truly excellent. His development is dependent on him coming face to face with the horrors of war and changing as a result of them ultimately becoming a scarred but matured character similarly to zeta gundam\'s protagonist Kammile Bidan. His character development was very visible and by shows final 10 episodes he felt entirely different than he did at the start. He was a character I really grew attached to and he showcases a real display of humanity, he’s a 13 year old boy experiencing true hell, many of his actions feel genuine like a 13 year old boy would do, he has his naive moments which may or may not be a turn off to some but that just makes him feel more genuine as when you’re young you are naive, To top this off the series isnt sugar coating his maturing nature as he shouldn\'t be maturing and experiencing what he is at his age, its the loss of innocence due to tragedy which really sums up uso\'s character as a whole. Out of all the gundam this kid probably goes through the worst experiences and that really is saying alot in a franchise like this, and this hell he goes through really makes him a compelling character.Uso is a strong pro but he alone doesn\'t carry the show, he wasn\'t alone in his likability as the entire supporting cast(minus the doa characters mentioned above) was generally quite lovable and also experience a fair share of development with interesting and enjoyable personalities. Victory gundam still has action every single episode like the ones before it but the show felt like it has more focus on slower and contained moments of characters just interacting and talking, this really helped make the cast easier to grow attached to. I legitimately gave a shit about most of the cast and this really is what made victory gundam for me. The relationships between characters were actually enjoyable to see interact. Shatki the series heroine will get some differing opinions depending on the viewer though, she makes a few dumb decisions during the series that have led to some people disliking her but if you take a step back from our perspective her actions are more logical in her shoes and to her knowledge than to us the viewer who see the entire picture, I personally really liked her just like the rest of the cast but I will not deny some will find her off putting. Marbet and Odello whom make up the guardian archetype and the best friend archetype respectfully to the protagonist uso are particularly really memorable and undergo quite alot of development themselves.-Pacing: One of the things I immediately loved about victory gundam was its pacing, not because it was always exciting moving from one event to another but rather the complete opposite. It was able to slow down instead of jumping into one traumatic situation after another. This is something that really helped me appreciate the world, characters, as well as made it less tedious as this made victory gundam feel more dynamic as a series progression wise. It’s not a super slow series but it has a good sense of when to slow down and when to speed up. Though it must be mentioned that the pacing in the first 4 episodes is off because they are told out of order due to a classic case of executive meddling, long story short the gundam originally wasn’t meant to appear until episode 4 and the execs didn’t like that so they placed episode 4 first in its broadcast with the 3 episodes before that being told in a “how we got there” type of story.-Sense of morality: to me gundam 079\'s greatest strength was is showcase of how both sides of a war have people just fighting for what they believe is right, they have their reasons for doing what they do as well as have their own loved ones goals and ambitions. This strong aspect of 079 was immediately discarded come time for zeta and ZZ in favor of inhuman and absurd villains of zeta’s titans whom lacked any sense of humanity while ZZ  was being....well ZZ. Victory gundam was a return to form for this theme and it does it extremely well. Just like 079 it does have a small number of ""hurr durr im evil"" characters usually as higher ups giving order but it does an exceptional job humanizing the enemy army regardless. You’ll see enemy soldiers talking about their families, showing genuine care for fellow soldiers and civilians, and one thing I absolutely adored me was showcasing how they also express fear of death as well. This humanization of the enemy is also the main reason victory gundam is such a heartbreaking series as the deaths of such enemies (as well as allies) only make it more and more depressing, which in turn I believe makes victory gundam truly sell the horrors of war more so than any other gundam (aside from war in the pocket). Though there is one elephant in the room I must mention while praising its depictions of morality. That elephant\'s name is katejina loos. Katejina is essentially evil incarnate and her reasons behind why she is such a disgusting human being isn\'t really touched upon aside from her relationship with one other major antagonist. To me she’s like ghilren zabi from 079, in the midst of this army that share humanity among its soldiers is this unnaturally evil and insane one that your just desperately waiting for the protagonist to squish them with their mech. At the very least she does end up being an entertaining and effective villain as her sheer brutality and unstable nature leads to interesting conflicts but I still wish they at least tried to give her some sense of humanity as there is another character that goes batshit psycho by stories end and acts similarly to katejina but was more a tragic outcome of his/her experience that made them what they were in the end, katejina is just a bitch.-Tone/atmosphere: Thanks in part to its absolutely excellent ost which utilizes alot more softer sounding string driven music (youtube songs like ""the white ghost"" and ""shakti"" to get an idea of its feel) victory gundam does a great job of setting its tone. It can create a very dire atmosphere as well convey the depressing nature of the series whilst also leaving room for a feeling like not all hope is lost. The soundtrack is beautiful and in part really makes the series itself feel beautiful. As stated before this will occasionally be thrown off by some absurd moments here and there but ultimately I felt like victory gundam continually retains its feeling of dire and depressing atmosphere whilst not losing the prospect of there being the possibility of a better future, and that itself leads into one last thing that really makes victory gundam for me…-Hope for the future: I think its ironic how victory gundam is frequently regarded as the most grimdark in the franchise when it has the most focus put on how there is a hope for a more peaceful future, it goes out of its way to try and say that all these sacrifices and horrors experiences are not all for naught. The series is depressing and has a body count through the roof but it goes out of its way to showcase how the possibility of a better life is not lost. The way it expresses this is through the idea of the younger generation being able to carry the future from the ashes of war which is the main reason the cast is made up of large portion of young kids. People are not dying for nothing they are dying for the prospect of a future where the next generation wont have to experience the suffering the current one has, it idolizes the idea of new life and really sells through how this isn’t some hopeless situation but rather an opportunity to help those in the future. One specific scene in the 2nd to last episode which gets its own insert song specially for this one scene is the best example of why this theme of hope for the future is so important to the series and also stands as one of the best scenes in the entire show.I am not going to say victory gundam doesn\'t deserve the flack it gets as I hopefully made clear it does do things really wrong and those that label it with such a infamous label are fairly justified, its not for everyone but I do truly believe there is alot Victory does right and even exceptionally, its just a matter if you can tolerate its shortcomings. Its got its faults that will ruin the experience for some but I believe there is truly a beautiful story to be found here for those that are capable of forgiving its shortcomings. Speaking personally victory gundam was a heartbreaking and powerful story that was able to evoke legitimate emotions from me and while yeah I really wish parts of it were better handled or cut entirely I cant deny that after finishing the series looking back on it there was just so much of it I appreciated and loved about it, and hopefully there will be others willing to give this a shot and experience it the same way I have. infamy, many of the negatives attributed to victory gundam come from its supposedly forced deaths and odd placement of goofy and absurd moments.

One specific scene in the 2nd to last episode which gets its own insert song specially for this one scene is the best example of why this theme of hope for the future is so important to the series and also stands as one of the best scenes in the entire show.I am not going to say victory gundam doesn\'t deserve the flack it gets as I hopefully made clear it does do things really wrong and those that label it with such a infamous label are fairly justified, its not for everyone but I do truly believe there is alot Victory does right and even exceptionally, its just a matter if you can tolerate its shortcomings. Its got its faults that will ruin the experience for some but I believe there is truly a beautiful story to be found here for those that are capable of forgiving its shortcomings. Speaking personally victory gundam was a heartbreaking and powerful story that was able to evoke legitimate emotions from me and while yeah I really wish parts of it were better handled or cut entirely I cant deny that after finishing the series looking back on it there was just so much of it I appreciated and loved about it, and hopefully there will be others willing to give this a shot and experience it the same way I have.', ""Renowned as being the most depressing Gundam show, Victory is an odd sort of a series. At times it evokes the bleakness of Tomino's older works such as The Ideon and Zeta Gundam, while at others it's a humorous space adventure with wacky kids in the vein of Xabungle.The art is similarly variable, with some episodes looking wonderful and others distinctly less so.The music is consistently good, however, with a full set of quality OPs and EDs, plus a brilliant, poignant insert song or two.Essentially, Victory picks up the UC storyline long after even F91 and Unicorn are done and dusted, with the Earth Federation...completely ineffective. Elements of the show work with this, such as the cameo appearance from a Salamis or two in some episodes, but it does stand alone in its own right.The main character is incredibly likeable - Usso gets on with it, does what has to be done and doesn't vacillate, whine or arbitrarily punch people for making fun of his name (too much.) He has a badass action Haro. He has a likeable dog which survives the whole series.Contrasting him is Shakti, who is useless and annoying for a good part of the series. The villains are similarly unimpressive, with the only really good ones being Katejina and a few of the minor Zanscare leaders. The rest are fairly forgettable rehashes of UC archetypes (Chronicle is one of the weakest Char analogues in the franchise, notable for being as much of a failure as Zeta Gundam's Jerid Messa)Mech design is all over the place, from the stylish and deadly V2AB to the plain insane Dodgore and Adastrea, which would be better suited to a super robot show. When it hits its stride, the results are spectacular but unfortunately that doesn't happen too often.In terms of serious military drama, Victory comes across as a slightly tasteless black comedy rather than a bleak space horror ala Ideon or a depiction of a morally bankrupt hellhole as shown in Dougram. The climactic moments when Usso loses someone close to him are rarely hard-hitting but often ridiculous - almost equivalent to a mecha version of the Saw or Final Destination movies in their overly elaborate and telegraphed natures.So all this criticism laid bare, what redeems Victory?Firstly that it's different to a lot of Gundam despite deriving from it. It's at times fun, at times kind of bleak and frequently unpredictable.Secondly, its likeable characters are really pleasant and nice to watch.Thirdly, while the pacing is a little wacky and sometimes not ideal, the ending arc is very intense and powerful. One moment, where the insert song is used perfectly to accompany a moment of sacrifice, will stick with you.By all means give Victory a good go before giving up on it. Just be prepared to accept it is very flawed. completely ineffective.

I\'ve always been drawn to the Mecha Genre, the newer series are usually awesome in sound/animation but that doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t give a chance to the older ones. Luckily for me Victory Gundam was actually enjoyable (unlike Z or ZZ)Story and CharactersStory wise, Victory Gundam follows the generic gundam story line. Young hero, happens to ""fall"" into piloting the ""latest and greatest"" suit. Gets conscripted into fighting for adults whether willingly or unwillingly. Grows up, finds his own reasons to fight/not fight which usually includes a love interest somewhere. Goes to space, comes back to earth,...goes back to space and there is the inevitable big battle to end it all.Victory Gundam succeeds for three reasons.First - the character development is very well done. Unlike some heroes, Uso is actually both identifiable and likeable. The supporting cast of characters all have their own storyline and despite the fact that there are a lot of supporting characters somehow you grow to know (like or dislike) each and every one of them even the dog and baby. That\'s a smart dog. I want one just like him. Throw in a Haro too while you\'re at it. By the end of the series the baby is actually walking and starting to talk. How is that for true to life?Second - This portrays war in a realistic manner. It isn\'t one of those gundam series where people escape death all the time in fact, if I were to give a tagline to this series it would be ""In War People Die"". I felt bad at 90% of the deaths and cried more than once. That is effective storytelling.Third - although there was the slow part, the story really picked up in the last 5 episodes and I probably enjoyed those more than the preceding 46. The ability to surprise, move the viewer and entertain at the end is the mark of good anime.Art/AnimationVery dated with a lot of frame reuse, so was ok for its time but compared to current anime it really shows its age. Nothing special here and one reason why I couldn\'t give this anime a higher score.SoundPretty average OP/ED songs although Shakti\'s song was very catchy and the sad music really works. Sound effects were ok also.EnjoymentI only had 2 issues with this anime. First - Katejina (ugh!). Secondly, why is it in every Gundam Series the adults are all too willing to give their latest and greatest suit to some young, irresponsible fighter pilot ace? Ok the second reason is applicable to all gundam series but seriously if I were a captain I would NEVER let them pilot those suits until they were mature.That being said, although it took some time to finish it I liked this a lot. Completionists should watch this series. goes back to space and there is the inevitable big battle to end it all.Victory Gundam succeeds for three reasons.First - the character development is very well done.

Completionists should watch this series.', ""Man this was a slog.  So many problems but I'm too tired to go into it all.  Scattered observations to follow:- The Music is legitimately good, and the cast is doing their best with a really bad script.- People talk about how brutal the deaths are in this show but they really aren't.  Like, there's nothing visceral in most of the deaths in this show (except maybe three or four, and most of those are confusing in just how much more violent they are that it doesn't work, it just shocks), and almost every death is telegraphed to shit and played up...for maximum emotional effect.  The problem is the characters just aren't written strongly enough or given enough time to live, so most of their deaths just do not matter to me, even some really major cast memebers.- Katejina's arc makes not a lick of sense and is by far the worst thing about this show.- Really wishy-washy characterization and many characters just make random ass decisions to give the plot a little extra zazz which makes many of them seem stupid or delusional and while there are good characters in this show, almost all of them get a turn to be massively unlikable or brainmeltingly stupid.  While Katejina is probably the worst character here, Shakti is easily the biggest victim of this writing tendency.- The show can't make up it's mind about what is and isn't necessary in war, what its function is, why people sacrifice so much for it.  The themes are really screwy here.- The show has a massive fucking woman problem and not to be that guy but like seriously there is so much gross shit in here it's wild.- Why do grown women wanna fuck Uso can we cut that out.- The show does not touch on earlier UC events like nearly at all so its inclusion in the UC is baffling considering Tomino and Sunrise would start doing AUs immediately after.- The characters and MS designs are all just kinda eh for the most part (though I do like the design of the V2), and while the animators stay on model like 95% of the time, they also use a lot of obvious shortcuts that make it look cheap even in comparison to earlier full-length series.Honestly if I wasn't trying to get through all of the series I would not have stuck with this one.  If you're not a completionist, skip it.  4/10: Ass. for maximum emotional effect.

Death is nothing new in the Gundam series but these were some pretty heavy killings and I wouldn't have much of a problem with it except for one thing which is that the main character Uso Erwin is only 13 years old, the youngest pilot at the time before Gundam AGE and all these things happen around him, its a little much for the series and of course the bath scene which I still find very unusual.The animation is nice and very smooth but for some reason, none of the characters or mech's have any shading, its a solid colour which didn't really bother me but it does stand out while you're watching the series.There are quite a few characters but I'll focus on the main 2 which are Uso and Shakti. Overall Uso is a likeable character with good traits and a skilled pilot, he does mature quickly in the series. Shakti however is probably one of the most hated if not most hated female lead because she constantly gets captured and actually sometimes goes to the enemy only for the league militaire to rescue her and suffer a casualty each time because of her.Overall the series pacing was pretty clustered at first but did have a good ending, the characters were likeable except 3 people overall and it did have a pretty decent Gundam. a beam saber, and crushing your skull.

I hated the narrative and plot of Victory Gundam. I hated the characters, aboustly despite the pacing, hated the lack of actual substance of the show where characters would die randomly for no reason in the show and I hated the visuals for Victory Gundam as it’s very poorly animated and lack any detail. Even if Victory Gundam had a great soundtrack I still despise it for being a poorly animated and written shit show where I thought Gundam Seed Destiny, ZZ Gundam, and Gundam Build Fighters Try were...better written then Victory Gundam. That how much I despise it.However as soon I went to Gundam forums and facebook groups and I declared that Victory Gundam was the worst Gundam show ever made I got a lot of blackish from many hardcore Gundam fans who actually thought Victory Gundam was a good show. Many fans of the show thought me that I didn’t understand the show because the creator and director Tomino was going through depression and I should feel bad for him. Honestly I felt bad for Tomino that he was going\xa0 through depression but at the same time I thought Tomino should have abandoned the show halfway through and let another director take over the show because the show could have been a lot better and tolerable if the show changed directors halfway through but history is history and we cannot travel back in time to 1993 and change things around.As people continue to blackish me for my opinion of Victory Gundam as well them telling me to re-watch it again my friend contacted me about my opinion my Victory Gundam and he told me to come to his house to get his Victory Gundam Blu-Rays that were released by Nozomi Entertainment in the US. Since I live in the UK I had to borrow his small Region Free Blu-Ray player that allows Blu-Rays from the USA to be played. I ended up borrowing his Victory Gundam Blu-Rays and the Blu-Ray player for a month and when I was not busy with personal life I sat down and watched the whole thing in 5 sittings and by the end of my re-watch I was honestly I liked it the second time watching. Don’t get me wrong I don’t think it was a great show but at the same time, I don't think it was a bad show and am going to tell you why.Hello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Mobile Suit Victory Gundam and with that out of the way let’s get started.Story.It is the year UC 0153 90 years since the One Year War, 60 years since Char rebellion and 30 years since the Crossbone Vanguard the earth is still lossly controlled by the greatly weakened earth federation who are under attack by the BESPA the armed forces of the space colony-based Zanscare Empire. Only a ragtag resistance movement, League Militaire, stands in BESPA's way as they swiftly conquer much of space and start their invasion of Earth, with the advanced\xa0mass-produced\xa0mobile suit, the Victory Gundam, as the League Militaire's secret weapon. However, BESPA's power continues to grow, using violent means, including public executions with guillotines, to strike fear into those living on Earth.The story follows a 13th-year-old\xa0Uso Ewin who is living peacefully on earth with his childhood friend Shahkti in the Eastern European town of Kasarelia. However, the peaceful days would come to a end where they are thrown into a conflict when they encounter with they encounter ace BESPA pilot Chronicle Asher. Soon, Üso finds himself joining forces with Marbet Fingerhut and the rest of the League Militaire, Now Uso must pilot the Gundam so he can fight against the BESPA as well discovering the true horrors of war.The story of Victory Gundam begins in a very odd way because episode 1 is actually episode 4 while the episodes 2 to 4 were actually episodes 1 to 3, however, there was a reason for this awarkawd start. Around this time Bandi brought the rights to Gundam as well as Studio Sunrise and needless to say director Tomino aboustly hated it. The main reason why episode 4 was showed first instead of the actual episode 1 is so Bandai can promote the Victory Gundam mobile suit to increase model sales.The one thing that should know that Victory Gundam is easily the darkest Gundam show to date even surpassing Zeta Gundam and this is mostly due to the fact that director Tomino was suffering from depression where if you know the man well it leads to a kill them all series.Besides that what do I think about the story of Victory Gundam? Honestly, I thought it was just decent for the most part.For starters, I really like the tone of Victory Gundam for the most part as it perfectly captures the atmosphere of war in a more darker manner. Unlike all of the Gundam shows before and after\xa0 Victory, this one is mostly dead serious in terms of tone as it rarely has any lighthearted moments.I also really loved the themes that were explored in Victory Gundam such as betrayal, death,\xa0immigration, peace, and insanity and the show did a pretty great on exploring it' themes without being too preachy about it.The final 12 episodes were Victory Gundam were pretty awesome overall as it was well paced had a lot of great elements which I won't mention due to spoilers, good writing great battles and the ending for Victory Gundam was great as it perfectly concludes the series in a sad but satisfying way.However, Mobile Suit Victory Gundam has a lot of problems.The first problem I had with Victory Gundam is the pacing. In terms of pacing Victory Gundam has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in a Gundam show and while it’s not as bad as Wing and especially in Seed Destiny it’s still a big problem due to how nothing really important happens in the middle portion as it’s only featured a lot of repetitive fights in space.The second problem I had with Victory Gundam were the deaths themselves. While I liked of how Victory Gundam explored the theme of death the problem is the execution at times for example characters who got little to no screen time until that point suddenly become the focus of the episode have the audience to get attached to these character for they respective episodes only them to be killed off by the end of the episodes. The was okay in the beginning but it really got annoying and predictable as the series went on. Honestly, what is the point of putting characters in the spotlight if they are going to be killed in the end?This is just subpar writing and it really just toys with the audience emotions.The third problem that I had with Victory Gundam is how women were portrayed. I understand the writers tried to make Women as ruthless as men in a war setting however they writers really jumped the shark here because all the women in Victory Gundam are either ineffectual or unexplainably psychotic and because of that they were all really hard to sympathize with which is a huge problem in terms of characterization.The fourth and final problem with Victory Gundam was the despite being a dark Gundam series it was way unnecessarily over the top for its own good meaning the show would be too flashy about the deaths and other stuff in the show. It wasn't so bad in the first half but the second half really got carried away with it’s over the top nonsensical deaths to some of the cringe-worthy stuff like the Lupe bathtub scene in episode 29 which completely screwed up the tone of the series greatly.Beside those shortcomings, I thought the story for Victory Gundam was okay that had a lot of good themes and elements.6/10Characters.Like with the story the characters in Victory Gundam were decent for the most part.Uso is pretty good Gundam protagonist. Despite being the youngest protagonist in Gundam he maturely says otherwise as he develops as a very compelling character to struggles to prevent the death of his friends and comrades but can never keep people from dying no matter how very hard he tries not to mention he is a greatly skilled pilot.Shakti is probably my least favorite character in this show. While she was a decent chararter in the beginning but once she started to reach Lacus, Marina and Relena levels of annoyance and preachiness I started disliking her greatly.The characters in the league militare were decent and enjoyable characters overall however apart from Odelo who was a good character they were all pretty underdeveloped.While the Zanscare Empire as just as ruthless as the Titans in Zeta Gundam however unlike like Titans in Zeta Gundam where some of the characters were actually likable every character in the Zanscare Empire minus Cornicle and Katejina were lackluster.Chronicle Asher is the char clone of the series but is honestly not a good one. While he, not a good char clone I thought he was still a pretty decent chararter overall and I really liked his sympathy where he doesn’t like to target non-combatants but instead he rather order civilians away from areas of danger.Katejina is a pretty interesting character because she is probably the character that I enjoyed the most in this show. Yes, she did some unspeakable acts through the series that would make anyone angry but think I enjoyed about Katejina was her journey to madness. She went from your typical spoiled rich girl who worried about Uso safely due to he being young in the League Militaire to an utter psychopath where she switched sides with the Zanscare Empire after being captured by Chronicle.While I personally don’t like Katejina as a person thanks to her unspeakable acts I still liked how the show did with Katejina.Overall the characters in Victory Gundam were decent but enjoyable for the most part.6/10Visuals.For a show made in the early 90s, I thought the visuals of Victory Gundam were alright.The character designs were pretty good for the most part and I really loved of how the show was able to showcase different skin colors instead of the usual white skin characters that we all seen before in many. It really gives characters more diversity in terms of how they looked.As for the mecha designs, I thought there alright. I really loved the Victory Gundam and V2 designs as there were both original and great designs not to mention I really liked thy feature that they have such as V2 Wings of light.The mobile suit for the Zancare Empire were pretty weird of Gundam standards. While I give them points for trying to be original but some of them were outright ridiculous like the\xa0Gedlav.As for the actual animation, I thought is alright overall. While the show has no stock footage used and some of the fights were well animated I thought at times the show can get pretty choppy at times with its animation.6/10Sound.The soundtrack is great as it perfectly fits with the dark tone of the series.Both the opening and endings themes were pretty great overall yes they are very light-hearted compared to the rest of the show but I thought they were all great and catchy.The Seiuyuus did a great job with the roles that were given so I have no complaints whatsoever.Unfortunately like with ZZ, Turn A, and X victory Gundam does not have an English Dub.Overall the soundtrack and voice acting for Victory Gundam were pretty great.8/10Final Thoughts.So after re-watching Victory Gundam for the second time what I think about it?While I personally thought it wasn’t an amazing Gundam show by any stretch of the imagination I also thought it was not that awful. While I prefer to watch most of the other Gundam shows that came before and after it I find the experience of victory to be pretty enjoyable for the most part. It still has a lot of problems in terms of the story and characters but it wasn’t an insulting pile of shit like ZZ Gundam, Build Fighters Try and Seed Destiny was. I thought Victory Gundam was a decent Gundam show that had a lot of good things in it but it does it have the problems that prevent it from being one of the good ones. \xa0 The pacing was way too slow for its own good at times, it was way over the top with its themes at times and dark nature and some of the characters were not that good.Victory Gundam may get a lot of hate from non-UC Gundam fans and for very understandable good reasons mind you but I must remind you all that Victory Gundam wasn’t a total disaster. Victory Gundam had to potential to be awesome but sadly it was mismanaged and toyed with for the most part and because of that, this show ended up being a decent at best.If you haven’t seen any Gundam show before I recommend you to avoid it until you have seen most of the U.C Gundam shows that came before it in the timeline.After Victory Gundam was done director Tomino would be kicked off from the team and Victory Gundam would be the last U.C Gundam show from the timeline and for what it was I thought it was a decent end to a great timeline.Final Score 6/10 better written then Victory Gundam. That how much I despise it.However as soon I went to Gundam forums and facebook groups and I declared that Victory Gundam was the worst Gundam show ever made I got a lot of blackish from many hardcore Gundam fans who actually thought Victory Gundam was a good show. Many fans of the show thought me that I didn’t understand the show because the creator and director Tomino was going through depression and I should feel bad for him.

Honestly, what is the point of putting characters in the spotlight if they are going to be killed in the end?This is just subpar writing and it really just toys with the audience emotions.The third problem that I had with Victory Gundam is how women were portrayed. I understand the writers tried to make Women as ruthless as men in a war setting however they writers really jumped the shark here because all the women in Victory Gundam are either ineffectual or unexplainably psychotic and because of that they were all really hard to sympathize with which is a huge problem in terms of characterization.The fourth and final problem with Victory Gundam was the despite being a dark Gundam series it was way unnecessarily over the top for its own good meaning the show would be too flashy about the deaths and other stuff in the show. It wasn't so bad in the first half but the second half really got carried away with it’s over the top nonsensical deaths to some of the cringe-worthy stuff like the Lupe bathtub scene in episode 29 which completely screwed up the tone of the series greatly.Beside those shortcomings, I thought the story for Victory Gundam was okay that had a lot of good themes and elements.6/10Characters.Like with the story the characters in Victory Gundam were decent for the most part.Uso is pretty good Gundam protagonist. Despite being the youngest protagonist in Gundam he maturely says otherwise as he develops as a very compelling character to struggles to prevent the death of his friends and comrades but can never keep people from dying no matter how very hard he tries not to mention he is a greatly skilled pilot.Shakti is probably my least favorite character in this show. While she was a decent chararter in the beginning but once she started to reach Lacus, Marina and Relena levels of annoyance and preachiness I started disliking her greatly.The characters in the league militare were decent and enjoyable characters overall however apart from Odelo who was a good character they were all pretty underdeveloped.While the Zanscare Empire as just as ruthless as the Titans in Zeta Gundam however unlike like Titans in Zeta Gundam where some of the characters were actually likable every character in the Zanscare Empire minus Cornicle and Katejina were lackluster.Chronicle Asher is the char clone of the series but is honestly not a good one. While he, not a good char clone I thought he was still a pretty decent chararter overall and I really liked his sympathy where he doesn’t like to target non-combatants but instead he rather order civilians away from areas of danger.Katejina is a pretty interesting character because she is probably the character that I enjoyed the most in this show. Yes, she did some unspeakable acts through the series that would make anyone angry but think I enjoyed about Katejina was her journey to madness. She went from your typical spoiled rich girl who worried about Uso safely due to he being young in the League Militaire to an utter psychopath where she switched sides with the Zanscare Empire after being captured by Chronicle.While I personally don’t like Katejina as a person thanks to her unspeakable acts I still liked how the show did with Katejina.Overall the characters in Victory Gundam were decent but enjoyable for the most part.6/10Visuals.For a show made in the early 90s, I thought the visuals of Victory Gundam were alright.The character designs were pretty good for the most part and I really loved of how the show was able to showcase different skin colors instead of the usual white skin characters that we all seen before in many. It really gives characters more diversity in terms of how they looked.As for the mecha designs, I thought there alright. I really loved the Victory Gundam and V2 designs as there were both original and great designs not to mention I really liked thy feature that they have such as V2 Wings of light.The mobile suit for the Zancare Empire were pretty weird of Gundam standards. While I give them points for trying to be original but some of them were outright ridiculous like the\xa0Gedlav.As for the actual animation, I thought is alright overall. While the show has no stock footage used and some of the fights were well animated I thought at times the show can get pretty choppy at times with its animation.6/10Sound.The soundtrack is great as it perfectly fits with the dark tone of the series.Both the opening and endings themes were pretty great overall yes they are very light-hearted compared to the rest of the show but I thought they were all great and catchy.The Seiuyuus did a great job with the roles that were given so I have no complaints whatsoever.Unfortunately like with ZZ, Turn A, and X victory Gundam does not have an English Dub.Overall the soundtrack and voice acting for Victory Gundam were pretty great.8/10Final Thoughts.So after re-watching Victory Gundam for the second time what I think about it?While I personally thought it wasn’t an amazing Gundam show by any stretch of the imagination I also thought it was not that awful. While I prefer to watch most of the other Gundam shows that came before and after it I find the experience of victory to be pretty enjoyable for the most part. It still has a lot of problems in terms of the story and characters but it wasn’t an insulting pile of shit like ZZ Gundam, Build Fighters Try and Seed Destiny was. I thought Victory Gundam was a decent Gundam show that had a lot of good things in it but it does it have the problems that prevent it from being one of the good ones. \xa0 The pacing was way too slow for its own good at times, it was way over the top with its themes at times and dark nature and some of the characters were not that good.Victory Gundam may get a lot of hate from non-UC Gundam fans and for very understandable good reasons mind you but I must remind you all that Victory Gundam wasn’t a total disaster. Victory Gundam had to potential to be awesome but sadly it was mismanaged and toyed with for the most part and because of that, this show ended up being a decent at best.If you haven’t seen any Gundam show before I recommend you to avoid it until you have seen most of the U.C Gundam shows that came before it in the timeline.After Victory Gundam was done director Tomino would be kicked off from the team and Victory Gundam would be the last U.C Gundam show from the timeline and for what it was I thought it was a decent end to a great timeline.Final Score 6/10"", ""WOW!!!! victory gundam talk about a tear jerker. well in this gundam series there was a lot of adventures and non-stop action. at first glance you'd think this was a kiddy show but once you watch it'll surprise you. the downside to it is alot of tregedy's. but i think they ended The UC era with a bang i was actually satisfied when it ended. "", 'Victory Gundam is another Universal Century chapter in the Gundam franchise, only this one takes place years after the events of Char\'s Counterattack. The series effectively blends ideas from older UC titles that aired up to that point featuring a guerrilla faction opposing the powerful dictatorship (Zeta Gundam), a young boy forced to confront the realities of war (Gundam 0080) and the usual conflicts of war that arise between humans living in space and on Earth. The series expands on the ""youth forced to confront realities of war"" plot element with Uso and other children seen in Victory Gundam joining up in League Militaire\'s efforts...and coping with the merciless and crude situations faced by adults in fighting various deadly battles. The series explores the efforts of both League Militaire and the Zanscare Empire showing both sides to have their sympathetic and corrupt elements, especially as you come to learn more of the inner workings of Zanscare that rely on deception, manipulation of the masses via spiritual ideology and fear to maintain their society. With Yoshiyuki Tomino in the helm as Victory Gundam\'s director, the series is infamous for having the highest kill count among his direction of titles in the Gundam franchise and it shows as many among both warring factions in this series get killed off throughout the show\'s run.The series isn\'t without its rough elements for quality. The earlier episodes of Victory Gundam have some awkward structure in their narrative which mostly stems from Bandai\'s influence to introduce the titular Gundam of the series much earlier than originally planned for advertising reasons during the time it aired in Japan. There were also occasions when Uso would grate on my nerves for his angsting over fighting Zanscare forces, especially during heated moments when he is in the middle of battle and shouting at his foes while fighting. Victory Gundam also brings back the absurd Core Fighter concept used from the original Gundam series where the Gundam unit is divided up into head, torso and leg parts that it can assemble together while in midair. While this element has its unique moments where mobile suit pilots will abandon damaged parts to prevent the entire unit from being destroyed or implementing their divisions for battle tactics, suspension of disbelief is pushed a bit in seeing mobile suits fully assemble their parts in the middle of heated battle scenes.The visuals to Victory Gundam are standard for the time period that the series aired having subdued color tones, decent details on scenery and character designs, mobile suit designs looking a bit rough with drawn details and animation shortcuts being the norm for battle scenes. The insert music for the series does its part to compliment peaceful and tense moments seen throughout the show, but doesn\'t have anything memorable that stuck out for me. I did personally feel though that the musical choices for Victory Gundam first OP and ED sequences were a bit too upbeat and energetic with the type of plots that the Gundam franchise was known to depicting up to the point Victory had aired.Despite having its rough moments though, Victory Gundam made for a solid continuation of the Universal Century continuity of the Gundam franchise exploring Uso\'s involvements with League Militaire and coming to grips with the harsh realities of war as he deals with conflicting ideologies, betrayal and the loss of comrades. It is definitely worth a look if you are a fan of the Gundam franchise. and coping with the merciless and crude situations faced by adults in fighting various deadly battles.

It is definitely worth a look if you are a fan of the Gundam franchise.', 'Victory Gundam is just one of the numerous shows in the Gundam franchise, but has the notable distinction of being the last television series to take place in the Universal Century timeline. While this is the same universe that iconic Gundam characters like Amuro and Char lived in, it is so far in the future that there really isn’t a need to be familiar with earlier Gundam shows (although you may get a little more out of it if you have seen previous UC shows).The show stars Uso Ebbing, a 13-year old boy who lives in Europe and is suddenly brought into the conflict between...the Zanscare Empire, a powerful military force that originates from the colonies, and the League Militaire, a small resistance force from Earth. As with any other show from this franchise, Uso’s claim to fame is piloting the hero’s powerful mobile suit, the Victory Gundam and helping defend his friends and allies from the Zanscare Empire.The show is a mixed bag for many. I’ve heard some people who think it’s one of the franchise’s best shows, I’ve heard others who think it’s among the worst. It is definitely one of the show’s most polarizing. The show is known in particular for two things, its absolute brutality and the sheer absurdity of some of the show’s sequences. An often-said rumor on the web is that director Yoshiyuki Tomino was really upset at the time over the sale of Sunrise to Bandai, so he purposely made the show really ridiculous and over the top in an attempt to kill the franchise. I wouldn’t be surprised if said rumor has no facts behind it (as most web rumors), but does the show often come off as one where the director had that mentality? Yes.A common theme of UC Gundam shows is the effects of war and how rough it can be and this show is constantly pummeling you with that theme. Only a few episodes into the series an enemy soldier finds out that he’s been fighting the 13-year old Uso. He’s so upset that the war has forced little kids like him to fight that he pulls out a grenade and blows himself up. There are a group of characters introduced into the show with the express purpose of being killed one after another, often right in front of Uso. Episode after episode ends with him sobbing over the latest horror that has occurred. To make it even worse, the show frequently has a character die only to work into the storyline something that makes their death pointless. There’s a particular moment in the show when there is a major death which is done in the most brutal fashion imaginable. As if this isn’t enough, they reveal moments later that there was a cease fire declared and if things just happened slightly differently, it never would have happened. The moment in question is arguably the most brutal in the entire Gundam franchise and I’ve known of people that have thrown up their hands and quit the show in response.From the opposite end, the show has several scenes in it that can only be described as complete absurdity. Two scenes in particular are really famous among the fandom; the first being when an enemy soldier tries to interrogate Uso by getting naked and going into a bathtub with him, and another when a group of women in bathing suits are sent to attack Uso while he’s in his Gundam and are promptly killed by him. Both scenes are completely nonsensical yet somehow made it into the show without ending up on the cutting board floor. There is a lengthy set of episodes where the Zanscare episode are using giant wheel themed ships which are among the strangest designed in the franchise and a style we never really get again in Gundam. These are just a few examples of the absurdities that this show throws towards us.The show has its share of both strong and extremely annoying characters. Uso is a likable protagonist and you really feel for all the things he goes through. Uso’s friend Katejina undergoes a transformation into one of the most heinous villains of the franchise and her character is one of the highlights of the show. On the other hand another friend of his, Shakti, often makes mind boggling decisions and you often get very frustrated with the character but know that she is so critical to the plot that she will continuously be there and there’s no avoiding her.Story-wise, the show is pretty strong but takes a while to get going. The first 10 or so episodes should have been greatly compressed. You also run into a problem in that the first episode should technically be the fourth, but the sponsors forced the show to move around the order to get the titular Gundam in the first episode, making the start of the show very confusing to watch. But once you get beyond this the pace is usually pretty quick. Neither the animation or the design is a big highlight; the show is the first in the Gundam franchise to lack the interesting character designs of either Yoshikazu Yasuhiko or Hiroyuki Kitazume. The often insectoid-type mecha are a bit different than Gundam shows past, but at the same time it is hard to think of many mobile suits that are memorable, whereas I consider there to be many from earlier shows. The show has several strong opening theme songs although they kind of mask just how rough the show really is.I think the show leaves a big emotional impression on you, and is generally worth a viewing for that reason alone. Other than being probably the darkest and most brutal show of the franchise, there aren’t aspects that I can say that single this show out as one that you have to see above all the others. It is more accessible than other Gundam shows but is likely to not be a good choice for your first Gundam show. It’s a memorable show for me, but I can see that many may not feel the same way. the Zanscare Empire, a powerful military force that originates from the colonies, and the League Militaire, a small resistance force from Earth.

This would be the last main universal century title to come out, and tomino last gundam show for a while before coming back but on a different project. The reason i’m putting Tomino in such high regard is not because he was the director, but also the writer for all the early main gundams. To the point that his very being is integral for him making these shows. With each passing title it’s easier to see the motifs, tropes, and cliches...that people like tomino continually implement in their shows that give them their very own signature feel. The problem is that their not always good and victory gundam exemplifies all the good and bad qualities of a gundam show. Even without the meta-understanding of the series the show by itself has many problems.The problems with the show are apparent as soon as the first episodes, as the way it was structured is shaky at best.  The show has two timelines, while it really isn’t that confusing, it really offers nothing interesting that couldn’t have been done by going in a linear fashion. the only reason this could have been is to show off the gundam early so that people aren’t confused they are watching the wrong show since it would have taken several episodes for the iconic mech to appear. The show does pick itself up after a few more episodes and it becomes easy to notice how the show is very similar to many of his previous gundam works. While it doesn’t inherently make the show bad it does make it difficult to watch something that has been done before. Thankfully the show does add a bit to the show starting with the setting initially taking place on earth and being presented more as a historical work than a Sci-Fi as there are many historical analogs depicted in the factions. It also tries more to depict the Minutiae of battle to a certain amount of extent than its predecessors. Yet despite all this the show quickly falls on its face again and this becomes a common cycle throughout the entire show.The most noticeable failing would be the character deaths mostly on how the characters were handled, and their are a lot of named character deaths. The trend shows itself early on after the introduction of the shrike team as many of them are killed off with only a smidge of personality. Their deaths may have been fine just as that, but the show makes a grand deal about this with the way it was shot, the blaring sad music, and the crying characters. While it may be tragic and could be argued that it’s in service of the characters that are still alive, it still does nothing for the viewers. While there may be sympathy for their deaths the fact that they don’t have enough development of being actualized tangible characters makes it difficult to empathize or reach a higher level of emotional investment. This doesn’t happen all the time as it’s more of a hill and valley situation but it’s still a lot of character deaths, and as more time progress after each episode it’s easy to realize how forgettable many of the character deaths are.As the story continues with the cast moving into space, and back to earth there is some credit to be given as there are some refinement to the formula of the show. While the plot make sometimes feel a bit erratic with sudden shifts in objective it still manages to keep a sense of cohesion that was lacking in the previous shows. The show also has a bit more downtime between the action so that the show doesn’t just feel like a sporadic mess of mech-battles. The shame is that they are never used to their fullest extent to develop the characters which the show really needed. So while not perfect there is a clear sense of progression even if it wasn’t handled that well.As the show started to head towards its final act there was one word to describe this show with Katejina being a prime example, and it’s that the show is very abrupt. There are times when there are transitions that make no sense and it takes time to get my barring of what was going on. While there may have been logic behind what was happening there was never a follow through before it happened that destroys the flow of the story. The reason katejina is the example is her entire betrayal to the zanscare empire. While there may have been some logic to it the way it transitioned her character was terrible with it being mostly a few throw away lines before we see her again fully changed. It’s parts like those where i feel like a miss something and when going back i find nothing at all, and it was just a sudden change and makes the show more difficult to follow with.Victory was made during the cusp of the japan bubble burst that hampered their economy and i feel that it may have affected the quality of the anime. The show feels like a regression of art style as it’s quality feels like something that would have made between 079 and Zeta. it doesn’t have the cartoonish characters or plastic like mechs of gundam, but it also doesn’t have the more detailed look of the character and mechs of zeta. Still that character designs for many of the characters are still appealing and the mechs look decent even if some of them are dumb like the insect themed bespa suits. The animation for the show is good enough as well but there are noticeable dips with obvious tricks to give a sense of movements and many stilted frames that feel jarring to watch. The audio for the show is decent with the voice acting and sound effects being passable less because it’s bad performance, but because it may have been recorded on a poor device. Still the soundtrack is good with the orchestrals adding more thrill to the battles, and overall bringing some emotion to the show.While the show may be over hated, i do see the reasons why. From it’s abrupt plots and character development, mostly shallow characters, and seemingly poor production quality.Not to mention watching this after more than 3 main series with the similar formula ,and the refinement of the repetition not being substantial enough to really warrant watching this. Victory just ends of being an ok-ish enough show not worth remembering. that people like tomino continually implement in their shows that give them their very own signature feel.

It consists of 51 episodes, and was directed by Gundam creator Yoshiyuki.Victory Gundam is set in UC 0153, and succeeds the Federation and Crossbone Vanguard conflict of Gundam F-91. Therefore, it takes place well after the events of the Earth Federation versus Principality of Zeon conflict (which could be said to have ended with Char's Counterattack).The greatly weakened Earth Federation comes under attack by the BESPA forces of the spaceborn Zanscare Empire; only the AEUG-like League Militaire stands in their way. The mass-produced Victory...Gundam is the League Militaire's secret weapon against the invading BESPA.I watched most of the gundam series there are and i must say its not high up my list. And im a kind of guy that likes nice graphics and this series is a bit older,so its not very good in this aspect too. I watched it because i ran out of Gundams to watch.

Watching what came before Victory was highly enjoyable, and I love so many of the characters and other series, but Victory wasn\'t anything like the ones before it.Story -- 3/10 (poor)For being a Gundam series, the story was driven by the MC piloting the Gundam, and stopping the enemy, which is every series\' base plot. Why I didn\'t rank it higher was due to specific characters and influences in the show. The entire plot...was not very cohesive and left me wondering really what was happening at some parts. I know that the MC is supposed to develop, but the story made him (a 13 yr old kid) into a man way too fast.Art -- 3/10 (poor)The art was well, very lacking. For most other series, the artwork and backgrounds, and even the facial features are conveyed so well, but in Victory Gundam, everything seemed too rushed and simple, like they didn\'t even care - and it shows.Sound: 5/10 (mediocre)As much as I enjoy the OSTs of the other series, this one didn\'t have that much, save for a noted battle theme, and a few character themes sprinkled throughout, as well as the 2 OPs and 2 EDs, which are highly misleading for the series as a whole. The strange feeling of silent scenes was very apparent here.Character -- 4/10 (decent)Here we go. The only reason why I marked this section as a 4 is due to only two characters. One is Odelo, a supporting character who enriches the MC with his upbeat and often love-struck personality, and the other is Chronicle, the main antagonist to the MC and Victory\'s ""Char"" model. Though I enjoyed those two, I\'ll first touch on the few ""bad"" characters I disliked.The MC, Uso Ewin, is only 13, I repeat, ONLY 13. (Probably the youngest pilot?) and his introduction is well enough okay for the series beginning, but as we get further, he experiences things no child/young teen should ever go through. (though, this is a Gundam series so it\'s inevitable) He watches one of the people responsible for him piloting the Gundam die, as well as other ""fodder"" characters die, and this is a stupid attempt at making him grow by experiencing loss in order to become the man the show needs him to be. The deaths are so dumb, and you can tell when a character is going to die due to certain scenes, and words reflected in their actions, and it becomes stale and unenjoyable after the third death.A supporting character, Shakti, was obviously someone Uso had ties with, as a friend. But did she have to come along on the ship? NO, she didn\'t -- but she was used as a driving force for Uso to accomplish the goals needed to move the plot (or what little plot there was). She was very annoying with her attitude of ""no fighting needs to happen if I can just talk with the enemy."" and she\'s often kidnapped to force the Gundam team to fight. Honestly, I hated her and just wished she\'d die.Enjoyment -- 4/10 (decent)As much as I was ready to go into this thinking it was great, I was misled. At first, I enjoyed it and then seeing the enemy mobile suits made me think twice, but both I and my partner sat through the most unsurprising 51 episodes and are glad it\'s over. My partner even walked away at the few recap episodes, and I almost skipped them myself. It was all over the place, and the only real sense of enjoyment came when Odelo was on screen.Overall -- 3/10 (poor)Even if you\'re a hardcore fan, please don\'t expect this show to be anything like its predecessors or even what comes after. You\'ll be let down and underwhelmed. It has the Gundam name, but not the quality we\'ve come to expect.

Victory Gundam is one show I\'ll likely never watch again.', ""After watching the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Ideon, Zeta, ZZ, and Char’s Counterattack, next came Victory Gundam. I wondered how Tomino and the staff would approach this, seeing as though they’d have to bring something new to the table. I was not disappointed, and impressed with the amount of fresh ideas that were poured in. This is the culmination of his work up to this point, as it follows a similar story behind a prodigy pilot, and is a critique of war as in the original, has some comedic moments that reminded me of ZZ, and mystery as in Ideon.Taking place several decades after Char’s...Counterattack, the Earth Federation is now under attack by the newly emerging Zanscare Empire. They use old execution methods, such as the guillotine, to send a message of fear into the public, and want to take over space. Their religious leader is not a bad person, though others in the upper crust of leadership have different intentions and use for her. Also leading them among the ace pilots if Chronicle Asher, who despises the corruption of the Earth, and though he is part of this wicked Empire, his motivations are for the best of mankind.Uso Ewin is the young protagonist, who finds himself in the beginning forced into the war, and becomes Chronicle’s rival as a result. Uso himself stands out on his own compared to previous Tomino protagonists, such as Amuro, Cosmo, Kamille, and Judau. As the others, he is critical of war, and also critical of himself. The war in Uso’s head feels more brutal than the war on the battlefield at times. One of Uso’s greatest strengths, is his improvisational and unorthodox style of combat. It is amusing and fascinating to see how creative he gets with the Victory Gundam, and resorts to many brilliant strategies that often perplex his opponents. It’s a breath of fresh air that deviated from keeping the fighting repetitive and predictable when compared to the earlier works.The large cast of characters grow to love each other, and struggle together to defeat the empire. One by one, many begin to take up the Gundam. Shakti is Uso’s childhood friend, and often worries not just about the war, but about Uso as well. She sees the effect war has on him, and worries that he will be consumed by it and lose himself.Uso becomes the hope against the empire. The adults, as shameless and useless as they are, are self aware that mere child is fighting the strong fight for them. As Uso struggles, the war continues to expand with all sorts of wonderful new ideas, that make Victory great and unique on its own. By the end, I placed it in my current top 5. There is also something else that Victory Gundam does that makes it it’s own. It’s what I have not mentioned yet. It’s own unique interpretation of something Tomino is known for doing in his work.Victory Gundam Deeply and emotionally breaks it’s own characters. Uso painfully learns what loss means, as he sees his precious friends obliterated, often in needless ways. There are times you’d think he’s had enough and is ready to check out, but he keeps going. There are many episodes that focus on his tragic feeling of loss. Characters don’t just appear for the sake of it and die, there is meaning and value behind their circumstances and choices that leaves an impact on the viewers. The effect on the viewers can invoke bleak feelings of depression at times from how morbid Victory Gundam can be.As Uso fights, he shows what I love about Tomino protagonists. Too many times, main characters are cowards that rarely ever grow or go anywhere. I can understand why. Instead of being a pathetic excuse of a main character for people to relate to, Uso is a character to aspire to be. Uso carries the fire of the protagonists before him, and fights in such a brave manner that it’s inspiring to watch. I always appreciate the short, passionate, and blunt comments Tomino protagonists make as they fight, and their analysis and realizations of war that give the viewers much to think about. Uso is also on the search for his parents. This leads to an interesting connection between him and his Gundam, that is very similar to the connection between Shinji and his Eva-01 unit from Neon Genesis Evangelion.As the war rages on, there is an interesting focus on love on the battlefield, all too tragic to the reality that many times our significant others don’t make it. Victory Gundam interprets this as painful as it will come to show.As Uso fights, and tries his best to overcome the reality of war, he becomes the new Newtype prodigy. As he fights on, the other characters grow with him. Some for better, and some for worse. Some characters, such as Katejina, fascinate me with some of the most interesting writing and twists.Uso has the same curse that Yang Wen-li has from Legend of the Galactic Heroes. They are both outright critics who despise war, and yet, they appear to be as if they are the best suited for it because of their skills. Uso, however, gets put in situations where he could almost be genocidal, and the most kill hungry protagonist I’ve seen in Gundam thus far. There are times he loses control. Times he gets ahead of himself. Times where he kills, and starts enjoying it too much.Despite this, You cannot carry out fundamental change without a certain amount of madness. In this case, it comes from nonconformity, the courage to turn your back on the old formulas, the courage to invent the future. Besides, it took the madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today. Uso is one of these madmen. To the extent that he resists his enslavement is the extent to which he is free.As much as the soldiers try to arrest the people on Uso’s side, and try to blame them, it’s clear that Individuals do not create rebellions; conditions do.The new mobile suit designs in this add to how unsettling this series can get, and it can get very unsettling. Many of the enemy mobile suits look like insects, in such a way, that they look intimidating; almost as if they were organic. At one point there is a centipede type mobile armor, and a giant serpent type. It feels as if this had to inspire the maverick designs in Rockman x3. Still, I appreciate the demonic like presentation in the designs of many of the mobile suits in Victory Gundam.The animation does have some problems. There are a few odd slideshows that remind me of the production issues in Super Dimension Fortress Macross. There is reused animation that was very noticeable to me during the re-watch. Because of the lack of shading, some of the characters’ noses can look strange. Overall, however, the art and animation is very enjoyable, satisfyingly expressive, and horrifying when it needs to be.The soundtrack is fantastic. The usual tracks played during battles and build ups are iconic, and can really help in setting the tone. The insert songs help make some of the best moments in Victory Gundam. If you are looking for a great finale, the last 2 episodes of this series ascend it to a different level.Something about Victory Gundam that is interesting is it’s approach with Newtypes. Yes, you should watch the previous Gundam entries before this. If you don’t you’ll miss the history, context, and breakdown of what the Newtypes are. That is because this series never explains what they are. As a result, those viewers not familiar with the older entries may get confused on what a Newtype is. For viewers like me that did the homework and learned the history with the older Gundam entries, I felt a lot of appreciation for what this series does with Newtypes. Towards the end, it becomes even more important to know the context, as Newtypes start emerging everywhere.To me, Mobile Suit Victory Gundam is a dark, yet beautiful story that is surprisingly hopeful despite the reputation this has with some viewers. It's tragic to see Western anime websites and viewers hold almost no regard to it. To me, this shows that Tomino, and the staff, were able to take Gundam and take it somewhere new in a wonderful way. At this point in Gundam history, and as much as he may not agree with it, to me, Victory Gundam is Tomino’s victory.

It’s a series that at times feels like an unnecessary addition to the UC timeline mostly retreading old ground with a rather cartoonishly evil at times group of villains. Other times it is incredibly well written showcasing tragedy and empathy for your fellow man even in war times very well. In general, it is very much one of Tomino’s dark series and brings with that for better or worse his general insanity and sometimes just unintentionally, hilariously, bad writing too. Despite all this though, I very much enjoyed V Gundam for the most part.The story is...your typical Gundam one of a small, guerilla-esque force that is rebelling against some oppressive government. The stakes in general are handled well, and it always feels like there’s some threat for our protags. The whole idea of Mariaism is a bit silly and not really grounded in any real ideology like Zeon somewhat was, and ultimately is just a way for Zanscare officials to manipulate the queen and do le corrupt/bad things.  There is also a LOT of death in this series, and usually I didn’t really find them sad or engaging. I did find the characters reacting to the deaths and grieving to be extremely well done, and it feels like sometimes poor boy Uso just lives to suffer. Pacing is goodish overall, sometimes it definitely felt like it was dragging for the sake of hitting that four cour goal, but overall it feels engaging. There’s a lot of repeated stuff and ideas here that aren’t entirely as well executed as previous Gundam series, but the story still keeps the heart of what makes Gundam special for the most part. Also unimportant, but I want to say I find if funny and unique just how useful Haro is here. The little ball bot actually saves the lives of our cast more than once, and overall actually has a presence in this series compared to others where their just sorta there to be cutesy mascots.Characters are a mixed bag writing wise. I think Uso is genuinely very well written, and is very high on my list of fave Gundam protags. He suffers and goes through so much, but still refuses to not see the good in people or hope that his enemies and humanity can change. He ends up probably having the highest kill count of any pilot at the end of the series, all while being the youngest Gundam pilot still as of right now. Man will probably have trauma and PTSD for years, but ultimately he gets a happier ending than other Gundam protags.The side cast and antagonists range from solid to kind of bad. Shakti I want to like, but she feels like a plot device at times. Marbet is a good char overall, and is a great motherly figure. The Strike team is…ok ig overall? Most just felt like they were there to pad the roster, and their uh “development” was pretty predictable. Odelo is a nice older kid type char who keeps Uso and the other kids in check, while still needing to be put in his place by the adults sometimes. The rest of the side cast is ok, I don’t have anything really to say about them.The antagonists are very much mixed. Chronicle is basically Jerid 2.0, I like him well enough. He’s kind of a loser rival a bit, but he has some good moments. Faula I thought could be a good Haman-esque char, and then she’s just wack later on. Katejina is just chaotic evil hoe that is amusing, but ultimately not that well written of a char imo. Lupe is laughably bad, and the rest are mostly just cartoonishly evil. However, something you’ll notice through V Gundam is that it’s really good about having certain soldiers that will be around for 1-3 eps tops. However what the story does with them is excellent as far as war being a horrific, tragic thing, and there’s often inevitable but touching scenes with them that Gundam is known for and V Gundam delivers well on that.Both OPs and EDs are pretty catchy, and general soundtrack is nice. Uso was Daisuke Sakaguchi’s breakout role, and he really does an excellent job voicing Uso here. The sheer emotional range he has works very well. The rest of the cast is voiced well, and I’d like to specifically mention Chronicle’s va being Tomoyuki Dan who did a great job as Chronicle, but unfortunately passed away back in 2013.The art and animation overall is actually pretty consistently nice. I noticed less reused stock footage overall compared to other Gundam series of its time, and the art has that timeless 90s look to it. Character designs keep the classic feel of Gundam series before it. The mech and ship designs are…oh geez where do I even begin lol. The wheel mechs and suits are very much an acquired taste, but I think they’re so dumb and silly they loop around to being interesting and most certainly unique almost in a G Gundam sense. The V Gundam itself being a combiner mech makes for some interesting combat situations, and the V2 is very nice looking. The V2’s wings of light I loved a lot specifically. Grunts suits work nice, and in general V Gundam has some of the most odd but truly unique suits in the franchise.V Gundam, like its wheel mechs, are very much an acquired taste. You might have to stick with it for a while before you truly like it. Yes there’s a few really bad eps writing wise, and in general the writing quality isn’t as good as the Gundam shows that came before it. However, it still has a lot of what makes Gundam good and I’d rec any Gundam fan to still check it out. 7.5/10.

Stand up to the Victory baby.', ""Another gundam anime, where we see almost the same story. A young protagonist who for one thing or another has to fight in a war. At the beginning of the anime, the protagonist does not want to fight or kill people, this decession makes him one of the protagonists most committed to peace since in the other series everyone is as good as war if not I kill they kill me. There you realize the ability they give to the protagonist of the series, he is also a very sentimental person that I liked because it breaks with the gundam scheme of the flying ace...killing everyone. It is also quite dense to see how it says I do not kill the enemies and for not killing them the consequences are worse. The animation is fine for the time it was made but it is not the most attractive to see. Character development is very confusing, as with some you don't understand why they do one thing, it's like they don't give a justification, it's only like this to help the plot. In all, it is a good anime of mecha where you play a lot with politics and between sides. Like almost all gundam anime it has a very correct level in all aspects. I didn't like the ending and I liked it at the same time. In other words, there are things that I liked and others that I did not. I feel like the character they had to kill was not killed. Also at one point I feel that they were inspired by the Macross franchise since well I am not going to spoil it but you will notice it. I recommend it if you want to see gundam but it is not even close to the best series. Entertaining but I can't recommend it.En español:Otro anime de gundam, donde vemos casi la misma historia. Un protagonista joven que por una cosa o por otra tiene que pelear en un guerra. Al comienzo del anime el protagonista como que no quiere pelear ni matar gente, esta decesion lo hace uno de los protagonista mas comprometidos con la paz ya que en las demas series todos estan como bueno es la guerra sino mato me matan. Ahi te das cuenta de la habilidad que le dan al protagonista de la serie, tambien es una persona muy sentimental eso me gusto porque rompe con el esquema de gundam del as de vuelo matando a todos. Tambien se hace bastante denso ver como dice no mato a los enemigos y por no matarlos las consecuencias son peores. La animacion esta bien para la epoca en la que se hizo pero no es lo mas vistoso de ver. El desarrollo de personajes es muy confuso como que con algunos no entendes porque hacen una cosa, es como no le dan una justificasion solo es asi para ayudar a la trama. Dentro de todo es un buen anime de mechas donde se juega mucho con la politica y entre bandos. Como casi todo anime de gundam tiene un nivel muy correcto en todos los aspectos. El final no me gusto y me gusto a la vez. O sea hay cosas que me gustaron y otras que no. Siento que el perosonaje que tenian que matar no lo mataron. Tambien en un momento siento que se inspiraron en la franquisia de Macross ya que bueno no voy a hacer spoiler pero lo vas a notar. Lo recomiendo si queres ver gundam pero no es ni por cerca la mejor serie. Entretenida pero no la puedo recomendar. killing everyone. It is also quite dense to see how it says I do not kill the enemies and for not killing them the consequences are worse. The animation is fine for the time it was made but it is not the most attractive to see. Character development is very confusing, as with some you don't understand why they do one thing, it's like they don't give a justification, it's only like this to help the plot. In all, it is a good anime of mecha where you play a lot with politics and between sides. Like almost all gundam anime it has a very correct level in all aspects. I didn't like the ending and I liked it at the same time. In other words, there are things that I liked and others that I did not. I feel like the character they had to kill was not killed. Also at one point I feel that they were inspired by the Macross franchise since well I am not going to spoil it but you will notice it. I recommend it if you want to see gundam but it is not even close to the best series. Entertaining but I can't recommend it.En español:Otro anime de gundam, donde vemos casi la misma historia.

To keep it simple, I would only recommend this to people who are all in on Gundam.The animation is inconsistent, and the plot has no idea where it\'s going, it just knows that it wants to talk about the weakness of  women and their power over men.There are positives though, the show starts off very interesting, and has some unique mobile suit designs. Uso is also a very cool Mc who has to struggle with a lot of things despite...being only 13. The OST is also godly (the track \'Victory Gundam\' is likely the best BGM created for an individual suit ever. Sorry Z Gundam). Unfortunately it seems that they used up all their creativity on the few good ones, as they seem to not have enough tracks to use; silent battles or happy music playing during a serious scene occurs often.Gundam fanatics will likely find the weird sinilarities to titles like ""Turn A Gundam"", ""Reconguista in G"" and ""Gundam AGE"" fascinating. The ultimate plan of the evil Zanscare Empire also immediately clicks once revealed, fitting perfectly as a unfortunate result to the events of Chars Counterattack and Unicorn Gundam.A shortened version of this show would do wonders for it, as the episodes 31-40ish had little consequence. Maybe someday a movie remake will be announced. being only 13. The OST is also godly (the track \'Victory Gundam\' is likely the best BGM created for an individual suit ever. Sorry Z Gundam).

Because I purchased tje dvd boxset off eBay, back in 2012. And I literally just finished watching it. So, it took me eight long years to watch this anime and I ended up watching the entire series on my amazon firestick. So, thus begins my review of the series. It's the second gundam series that I have watched that had to do with the whole crew being young children. This gundam series in fact, the entire crew may have been a...lot younger then the other gundam series that I watched that had nothing to do with the universal century timeline. But, this was a pretty amazing series with the main character being the youngest newtype I have seen by far ever to pilot a gundam. And his ability to adapt and overcome every obstacle in his path truly astonished me. I really enjoyed this gundam series with parts even almost making me tear up. So, there were parts that were obviously very emotional for me. I really liked this series. Even though I thought some parts were childish, but it had some comedy to make up for that lack of maturity. Overall it was a boy's journey into manhood. lot younger then the other gundam series that I watched that had nothing to do with the universal century timeline.

I've also watched most of the shows in the UC timeline and I have to say that Victory Gundam is the worst one that I've watched.  At this point, the plot feels the same as some of the previous UC entries with nothing really to offer with forgettable characters and a forgettable Gundam.  I can't really say much about how the series is in the middle or end as I only watched about three or four episodes when I got...bored.

In spite of its otherwise childish tone and visuals, literally no one is safe, so be sure to lock up your waifus and children. This is called ""the most depressing Gundam"" for a reason.To qualify this review, going into this I\'ve watched basically all of Universal Century Gundam back to back in more or less chronological order, and this was the last one on my list. And boy was this an interesting one.There is a lot to like (and a lot to dislike) about this show. In...many regards, it could be argued that this is a more polished and ambitious version of the original Mobile Suit Gundam animé, and I do give it high praise for that, because it was attempting to go in new and interesting directions.The opening (which spans four interlinked episodes) is probably the strongest beginning to any classic Universal Century Gundam show, and it also features (in my opinion) one of the best and most likeable protagonists, Uso Ewin.So the question is, why have I rated this show a 3, which is LOWER than I rated the original? Well, in short, Gundam of Thrones reaches for the heavens, but lands with a resounding thud.THEMES (2/10):It attempts to play with some interesting themes (matriarchy, mind control, life, death, rebirth, and of course the horrifying nature of war, all packaged in a French Revolutionary aesthetic), but they are almost always handled clumsily, and many lines exploring such themes are delivered bluntly without any subtext, like a bad infomercial.ART & FIGHTS (6/10):The art is simple and colourful. They sometimes refuse to draw noses properly and intentionally choose not to shade anything unless the light is particularly dim as part of their aesthetic, but otherwise it is perfectly serviceable.Although the Mobile Suit fights are nothing special in terms of animation, and most of the designs for mobile suits are iterative and samey, they do make a conscious effort to consistently up the anti by adding in new tactics and weapons for both heroes and villains to use, which is very satisfying and again, is one aspect of the show that deserves a lot of praise.CHARACTERS (3/10):While it has the large ensemble cast that Gundam is famous for, which had a lot of potential initially, this show ultimately spreads itself much too thinly, I\'d argue significantly more so than any other Gundam (including the original, Zeta and ZZ), which ensures that we get very little meaningful development of anyone other than Uso (and even then, if I am entirely honest, it is not much deeper than ""his life is filled tragedy and he perseveres in spite of it all"").Characters frequently make grand heroic sacrifices, but this is rendered meaningless most times because we simply haven\'t spent enough time with any of them, sometimes you get a hint that there is more to their character prior, but none of that is ever explored.The Char-analogue, Cronicle Asher, while again promising at first (with subtle signs of morality and heroic traits), becomes a bland villain without any coherent motivation by the end, as does another character I shall not mention (as it would be a spoiler), who becomes a complete raging psychopath for no logical discernible reason. Oh, and yet another villain also goes from interesting and somewhat reasonable to laughing like a total murder-clown for their final appearances.For all intents and purposes, the villains mentioned above might as well all be different characters entirely, which renders their early appearances worthless in terms of character building. And you end up shouting at the screen alongside Uso, demanding to know why on Earth they are acting like this, while receiving no intelligible answers.Lastly, an honourable mention must go to the best villain of the piece, Duker Iq, who is by far the most respectable, wholesome, competent, and memeworthy villain in the show. The lack of people picking him as a favourite character is deeply saddening to me. Please do your part to correct this injustice, as I have.PLOT AND WORLDBUILDING (2):Characters frequently make bizarre decisions that undermine the storytelling. And given the ultimate goals of the Zanscare Empire, their actions for the middle arcs of the show make actually no sense, it is simply a complete waste of their time and resources, it\'s just there to fill screentime really.The political situation is arguably at its most unclear in all of UC Gundam, while also having an uncharacteristically clear-cut ""good side"" and ""evil side"", which again limits the investment you can have in the show. (Yes, I am a Zabi-Zeon apologist. This next part isn\'t a spoiler btw, as it is literally in the first few seconds of the opening of the original MSG series; sometimes your colony drop accidentally misses its original target, splits into three, and one of those pieces happens to hit Asia. I mean, of course half of the world\'s population is going to die if THAT happens, so cut them some slack, okay? You can\'t diss a whole society based on a few bad apples and bad luck).And to cap it all off, halfway through the show, they suddenly introduce the idea that Mobile Suits go full nuclear bomb if hit by anything other than fists or beam sabers (even though this isn\'t how they\'ve worked in past series of Gundam, and isn\'t even how they\'ve worked for the entire first half of THIS series) just to try and up the stakes, but it is so hard to take seriously.There were ways they *could* have justified it (for instance, enemies deliberately using experimental unstable reactors to discourage direct attacks against them), but none of that is implemented. They also do not talk about the consequences of the radiation released in these explosions, which I see as a missed opportunity. Perhaps there are effective ways to treat it in the future with super-medicine, but the implication being that it\'s rationed primarily for the military, or something. Not that this show needs to be more depressing, but you know.IN CONCLUSION (TL;DR):Diehard fans of classic Gundam will probably get reasonable enjoyment out of this show, which has many great aspects to it, but just as many serious drawbacks. It is a diamond in the rough, but it is primarily going to be enjoyed for its sentimental value rather than its market price.I certainly did enjoy my time with it, arguably more so than with Stardust Memory and a number of others. However, my rating of 3 represents the very significant and often immersion-breaking issues with the show, especially in how it stacks up against other animé in general.Strangely, the more modest and less ambitious storytelling of the original MSG show actually counts in its favour, as that show manages to competently hit the targets that it sets for itself, rather than making a pig\'s breakfast of everything like the more ambitious MS Victory Gundam does. many regards, it could be argued that this is a more polished and ambitious version of the original Mobile Suit Gundam animé, and I do give it high praise for that, because it was attempting to go in new and interesting directions.The opening (which spans four interlinked episodes) is probably the strongest beginning to any classic Universal Century Gundam show, and it also features (in my opinion) one of the best and most likeable protagonists, Uso Ewin.So the question is, why have I rated this show a 3, which is LOWER than I rated the original?

Do you like bike wheels so much you wish they could fly? What about if they could tread the ocean surface and act like whimsically half-rotated UFOs swarming about the seas? And how about if they were the entire bottom hull of a ship, like one massive tank tread - big...enough even to squish your mom? Or dare I say, would you like them if they spun about, rotated, and generated motion in space? You do? Well then, do I have the show for you.Hey there, reader, do you like fan service? Do you like harems of girls in your anime shows, void of a reasonable explanation but bountiful in the voluptuous department of volume? Do you like entire companies of soldiers clad in nothing but bikinis for the sole purpose of trolling the protagonist? Do you like your main character to be suggestively dominated and put in inexplicably compromising situations with women twice their age? Boy, do I have the show for you.Hey, reader, do you like popcorn blockbuster action movies? Do you like action scenes with completely unrealistic outcomes, where the Hero performs stunts that make Tom Cruise look like a girl scout scared of knocking at the neighbor\'s door? Do you like when people parachute onto buildings and objects from impossible heights, with no realistic chance of survival, yet done with such impeccable grace as to seamlessly move on with no comment to the next insurmountable feat? Well, you guessed it, I have the exact show for you.And that show is: Victory Gundam. Put your grievances aside. The plot is impressively terrible. The characters are surface-deep at best, inscrutable at worst. The ending makes absolutely no sense. The entire 3rd arc of the story is a ramshackle-monstrosity of motifs coagulating into a climax of needless death and seemingly random conclusions to arcs we didn\'t know existed until but an episode prior.But that doesn\'t matter, because you know what does? Victory. Victory is what matters, and our boy, -the- boy, if you will, Uso, is going to achieve it. By God, he\'s going to achieve it even if Shahkti has to walk into the enemy encampment a thousand more times. He will achieve it so hard, every girl on Earth and in space is going to be \'miring so hotly that the Char Aznable of the story will actually disappear from the story for no good reason other than that we are simply too busy admiring Uso from the perspective of literally every female character in the show. Mission achieved, Victory accomplished.Plot holes? Yes, those exist - in fact, if you look closely, you can glance through the swiss cheese of the show and stare into the realm of what could have been, and with that glimpse, great sadness will creep upon you, wondering what actual heights our Victory could have risen to. BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS, because we have Victory. And Victory is sweet, if not a little bitter at times.Still, you might ask, what will Victory get me, in the end? Will Victory be worth it? Victory, with a visually augmented and stunningly clear capital \'V\', is not only worth it;  it\'s so worth it, you might find yourself wondering what else is. For instance, is a coherent story worth it? If we can just enjoy unique artwork and oddly captivating hand-drawn combat scenes of giant mechs delivering ultimate annihilation, do we really need any characters to make actual sense? Apparently we do, because Uso is that character, and for the better part of the story, you will be fooled into thinking that Victory is the development of this young boy into a war-torn but headstrong soldier, overcoming all odds and miraculously accomplishing the impossible, all to finally save the day.But, FOOL that you are (for taking popcorn action too seriously), none of that matters, because you will undoubtedly find that true Victory, and incidentally the actual best case I can make to watch this show, is found in the hearts and souls of us all. We all share a passion for life and love that Uso and crew serve up in spades across the breadth of the story, making it real even when it\'s absolutely, certifiably, nonsensically surreal. These genuinely human moments, while fleeting, recapture the heart-wrenching success of the whole Gundam universe, despite taking place in a surfeit of flimsy plot developments.In all seriousness, the real Victory is getting through this series without saying ""huh?"" once, but if your faith holds fast and you remain constant to your beating heart, to that undying, innate dream to live and love beautifully this one life we have, you may find you actually enjoy this wonky ride for what it is: a winning excuse to spend some time with Gundams, those beasts of burden tearing our hearts and souls out over endless, wanton strife.Oh, except for Katejina. She has no soul.10/10, would never watch again. 7/10, if you choose to take this show seriously (if it wasn\'t clear by now, you shouldn\'t). enough even to squish your mom?

Long Riders!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30652/Long_Riders,"[""There are many anime about girls doing some specific activity, with that activity being just excuse to show cute and heartwarming moments. While Long Riders! doesn't lack those aspects, in my opinion it's first and foremost sports anime and should be treated as one - more about it later.Story is as simple as it gets. It follows Ami as she starts her adventure with cycling and slowly gains experience and becomes better. There are many cute and relaxing moments, there is comedy too, but main focus is cycling itself. It's exactly why I see it as a sports anime: Long Riders! puts heavy focus on...bikes and cycling. It does excellent (and I mean it) job at showing emotions one feels during their adventure as a cyclist: first bike, feeling of freedom, first 100km and so on. This anime also surprised me with how accurate it was about technical side of cycling. Every episode shared information that you usually learn yourself over time - and managed to keep it natural, without turning into some trivia show. I'm sure person who wrote it had personal experience with bikes - he wouldn't be able to share it so perfectly otherwise.Sadly, characters are weak point of this anime. While they fulfilled their roles, there was nothing interesting about them. Ami was the only character that got some development. I found all girls rather bland and uninteresting. If this was purely cute girls SoL that'd be a deal breaker.As a side note: despite being college students they felt like any other group of highschool girls.I have mixed feelings about art. Backgrounds were really pretty and seeing those bikes made me pause to look at details, but animation, especially moments of mixed CGI and normal animation, was lacking. Character design seemed slightly weird at first, but after getting used to it there were no problems.And surprisingly there was pretty much no fanservice. Unless, like me, you get turned on by bikes.Being cyclist myself I really enjoyed it and expect to rewatch it multiple times. Outside of things mentioned earlier, I also found Long Riders! to be very inspirational. I can't imagine any fan of cycling that wouldn't want to stop watching and go for a ride.Now, I doubt someone not interested in cycling would enjoy this anime. I'll repeat myself here, but it's not exactly CGDCT SoL show. If you came here for cute moments, then I'm afraid you will be mostly bored with all the bike talk. bikes and cycling.

I can't imagine any fan of cycling that wouldn't want to stop watching and go for a ride.Now, I doubt someone not interested in cycling would enjoy this anime. I'll repeat myself here, but it's not exactly CGDCT SoL show. If you came here for cute moments, then I'm afraid you will be mostly bored with all the bike talk."", ""This is an anime that you would watch before sleep, it is soothing and gives you really relaxing vibes.

It actually describes pretty accurately what you can expect from Long Riders!With beautiful visual, relaxing atmosphere and cute girls this anime promises you a trip around the beautiful Japanese landscape.  The story primarily focuses on giving you the best introduction to what cycling for fun is like and it did it pretty well at least in my opinion. I enjoyed the hell out of this anime.You can actually call an anime successful if it gets you interested in the topic it presents - this time it is cycling and to be honest...I actually am currently pretty interested in riding long distances just because of this anime. With a concept I am so familiar with I didn\'t actually think much of Long Riders! when I first saw it nor did I expect to learn so much about bicycles and cycling in general. I Thought this anime as more of as an side dish alongside the other seasonal shows but it actually turned out to be one of my favorite shows of the Fall 2016.

The main character is Ami Kurata, a college student who is a complete newbie at biking.First off, I want to make a distinction between what I think the type of anime this is and slice of life. Slice of life in my view are basically open ended short stories with an artistic real world view of the story. The type of anime this is, that I am somewhat interested in, are basically showcasing a particular hobby or lifestyle and the life of someone who may start as a beginner...and becomes more and more professional throughout the story. They are based on a real skill, and lean more towards realism. These are typically longer form than a typical slice of life.Stories such as Hikaru No Go (Go board game), Yowamushi Pedal (Road bike racing), Honey and Clover (art), March comes in like a lion (shogi), and Bakuon!! (motorcycles) are a few examples. If you are not familiar with Hikaru No Go, it is an anime that famously started an exciting revival with kids playing and learning Go.If you enjoy lifestyle anime like I do, this should be enjoyable also. It's all in the title, endurance road biking, which basically showcases a lot of the experiences you can run into while doing so yourself. A lot of it is about the experience of going places on your bike, and becoming a better rider. The scenery you get to enjoy differently than when in a car, the food that tastes so much better in the middle of a ride, the exhausting hills, the exhilarating descents, the joy of riding with a group and in an event.However, if you live in a part of the world like I do where car drivers typically aren't used to road bikers, then this is basically an idealistic view which might be realistic for parts of Japan, or maybe the Netherlands. Situations that come up in my area that aren't really discussed in the show are: riding at night, getting caught in weather, collisions and near collisions with cars and people, dangerous roads to bike on because of traffic, turning at intersections, being visible (wear bright reflective clothing), pot holes, loose dirt on the road, grates, other bad road conditions, more weather, angry car drivers who think you don't have a right to the road, getting doored, having your bike get stolen, bike laws, etc. I live in the US and we have a long way to go when it comes to many areas not being bikeable by regular people.If you have a bike trainer, go ahead and ride while watching -- road biking is probably the only type of lifestyle anime that you can participate in while watching!This anime is available to watch for free on Daisuki.net, which is a bit of a hassle for me since I watch most of my anime on Crunchyroll. and becomes more and more professional throughout the story.

The views in here are amazing, the explanation about bikes like what's good about them what you need during the night,...what bike is recommended etc and whatnot are there so may or may not like it. Art style and animation still looks good for its time, we can see how these girls ride their bike to check out places together while having fun.

Seems to be a recurring thing with Studio Actas from what I\'ve seen from them with Regalia being the last I saw from them, halting the production too. But now...it\'s done so I can talk about it.Plot/Characters:When it comes to plot in a bicycle comfy SoL show there really isn\'t much to say that doesn\'t combine it with the characters as it\'s all about the characters and their motivations or well...mostly just our protagonist motivations. We follow the newbie Ami who always had an interest in cycling but never really dared to get into it until it kinda randomly happens in the first episode with her already experienced bicycler friend, Aoi deciding to help her out with Ami\'s decision to get into bicycling. And then on from there it\'s kinda just all about Ami learning new things and what to buy, meet more bicyclers that then teach her even more new stuff to improve etc.The thing is that this is a comfy SoL so there really is not any competitiveness since Ami is new to all this and is learning throughout all the season as a hobby atleast at the start, so which is why there really is not much to say about the plot in this, there is basically none. It\'s mostly just info dump after info dump and hell even I learned about a lot just watching this actually. On that front it\'s great and you see Ami definitely develops into a great character by the end of it, loved how it all came back together at the end with everything she learned.Even though I like Ami and her learning and me myself as a viewer on that, here is what\'s really worst about this show. The supporting cast, they are basically just pure info dumps characters with no development whatsoever throughout this show. They all have their cliché trope personality like the short abrasive blonde and her mature busty ""ara ara"" friend and then later on another black-haired character that looks way too much like Aoi so I mistook her several times.... they are all just sorta there giving info and there was no ""breather"" episode where they didn\'t bicycle and just talked and get to know each other much on a personal level, I found it kinda baffling how they would just help each other out so much given how little they really knew about each other. It was obvious though they wanted Ami to get all the focus and develop her the most since she was the most inexperienced. But they most likely would have given the supporting cast more personality and background if they got more episodes than 12, assumingly.Animation & Sound:Well like I mentioned at the start of the review this sure had a lot of struggles, this could only look decent at best but those best times didn\'t happen much even after those two delays around the start and the middle parts. The funny thing is that they put out a recap episode of SoL show with no plot like that would ever be needed. Anyways the eyes could look real derpy sometimes so they sorta looked cross-eyed or that the lip-syncing was not all there and looked weird etc. And the 3DCG elements which they used from time to time when they were bicycling looked real choppy like 10-15 fps which still not many can make smooth these days. So lots of awkward scenes like that but I will give them this, the last two delayed episodes did look great, I didn\'t spot any awkward animation even with the 3DCG moments so good on them really using that time to make it look good.To round it off I consider the last two episodes to be the best out of the whole show both animation wise and how it ended, too bad the quality wasn\'t like that throughout and it probably won\'t get a second season, oh well I did enjoy it for what it was even though it lacked on several levels. Solid SoL and CGDCT. it\'s done so I can talk about it.Plot/Characters:When it comes to plot in a bicycle comfy SoL show there really isn\'t much to say that doesn\'t combine it with the characters as it\'s all about the characters and their motivations or well...mostly just our protagonist motivations.

Solid SoL and CGDCT.', 'Ummmm Long Riders, LA thinks Bakuon!! will like to have a word with ya.....Ok so right off the bat, LA thinks to compile how LA feels about Long Riders is through it\'s strengths and flaws, like typical LA?...shall we?Long Riders\' strengths have alot what usual slice of life, ""healing"" animes partakes in but under a complete amateur by the name of Ami Kurata voiced by Nao Touyama wanting to learn about biking and later on marathon runs for biking. As much as Long Riders\' characters aren\'t the best connected, they still have their camaraderie through their running gags and their conjoined interests in biking. The...running gags aren\'t that bad in terms of comedic stance either. Such running gags as Ami spending ridiculous amounts of money to buy ""upgrades"" for her bike, Hinako Saijou\'s secret part-time job, Saki Takamiya\'s almost bottomless stomach and finally Hinako and later on Saki\'s teasing to Ami about more ""advanced"" marathon biking, the running gags are slightly overdone but they DON\'T overstay their welcome. The animation quality can be dodgy at times but the beautiful scenery of Long Riders is decent at best (not Amanchu! material, but still beautiful scenery of Japan\'s many landscapes nonetheless) The final strength to Long Riders would easily be Long Riders being a biking ""healing"" anime can quite easily be one of the more relaxing anime out there but with one little catch, but LA will be talking about that right now.Ok, now flaws, LA will immediately talk about Long Riders\' constant delays when it was released in Fall 2016, in which LA can\'t even see HOW they got into constant delays, quietly annoying LA in the process (3 times in total with the final delay of the final 2 episodes delayed til the first quarter of Winter 2017), next flaw is the god awful implementation of 3D CGI on both the models and the bicycles at the same time, sure LA ignored them at first, but further down the line the CGI became BLATANT and worse to the point of being unnecessary of even having the CGI as the traditional animation transitions were better quality in certain frames than the CGI\'d frames which brought focus to the awful CGI. Next is well, characters, sure as a group, their camaraderie and friendship is ok, ok when their talking about biking and whatnot, but their friendship outside of it is minimal at best resorting to again the running gags and their love of biking LA said above. Ami is your ditz, Yayoi is your ojou, Hinako is your genki yet slightly brash one, Aoi is your caring one and Saki is your aloof one...wait those are the main characters from K-On!-!?...well these kind of archetypes are to be expected in these kinds of anime. Finally, Long Riders\' BIGGEST flaw is that Long Riders is a certain case of curing your insomnia considering how extremely slow pace and how they portray their biking. LA isn\'t kidding, there were many cases where LA felt like dozing off. LA knows that healing anime can brighten your day up by showing typical day to day activities of the character\'s hobbies and whatnot.....not darken your day by closing your eyes because Long Riders was ridiculous in this. Worse yet it that due to LA\'s thinking and to the point of making LA sleepy when watching this anime, it felt like this anime didn\'t have much to unpack considering it\'s lacking content and it\'s narrow focused narrative. However to defend the insomnia-curing pacing a little is that, LA can guess some of the audience might actually enjoy the slow pacing and LA was one of them but later on it just kinda hit LA and LA started to notice it through LA dozing off...to each their own with this flaw is all LA is gonna say.Even though LA already talked about the characters in the flaws sections, LA does kinda want to get into more detail about them. Ami Kurata is LA\'s favourite character for one all due to her infectious enthusiasm towards her liking to biking and she is your audience stand-in due to her being a newbie to biking, add with Nao Touyama\'s vocals and you have LA\'s favoruite character, thankfully she does bounce off well with Hinako Saijou voiced by Rumi Ookubo, usually since she too is the genki yet more abrasive one compared to Ami but has some good comedic moments together with the rest of Fortuna (the main cast\'s biking group name). Aoi Niigaki voiced by Hiromi Igarashi along with Yayoi Ichinose voiced by Yurika Kurokawa having the most limited screentime individually all due to the fact that Yayoi is the satellite character to Hinako and Aoi to Ami, they both do have their moments though. Finally we have Saki Takamiya voiced by Yoko Hikasa, the aloof ""expert"" of the group who arrives much later and was already friends with Hinako and Yayoi, also her appetite is essentially her quirk as she talks about great food or is eating in most of her screentime outside biking and Saki is the embodiment of the great food you\'ll eat if you want to marathon bike in Japan. Dynamically, the Fortuna group is somewhat loose with their friendship all due to the anime\'s narrow-focused mindset on biking through giving Ami LOTS of obstacles in her wanting to really get into biking (from her lacking stamina and needing upgrades for her bike) and everyone being absent-minded to Ami until she gets into trouble which allows the rest of the Fortuna group to expound on more biking facts and tips and all this compensates with the characters\' running gags which is decisive if it works or not. As for LA, LA just didn\'t mind the characters and their running gags that much but they weren\'t the best dynamically-close net group and individually they are lacking a bit more personality besides their character archetype and their love of biking.In terms of animation by Actas and LA already said about the awful 3D CGI as well as the  stunning backgrounds in which the characters are technically rewarded with it as well. The character designs are expected moe though slightly bland at times (LA saw Ami\'s character designs as well as Hinako\'s to be the most defined with Aoi and Saki\'s character designs being the most similar to each other though easily known who\'s who by their hair style and what\'s in front of them) the non-CGI biking scenes aren\'t that bad either as they are technically in constant motion and all and there are some blend to CGI with that but even those moments are ok animation, but coupled that with awful 3D CGI animation (to the point the 3D CGI almost looked like early PS2 smooth animation which isn\'t a good thing by the way). Overall Actas did a mediocre job for LA, LA didn\'t hate it as it compensated both ways but not giving it too much grace to completely ignore it\'s flaws.In terms of voice acting, well here comes the obvious again but LA\'s favorite voice actor went to Nao Touyama in making a typical ditzy character somewhat endearing and for a typical genki character, Nao Touyama definitely had RANGE making for great comedic timing and sometimes outlandish genki moe vocals work, Yurika Kurosawa had tendency to be even more high pitched like Nao Touyama and it\'s her default ojou vocals at that but it wasn\'t to the point of annoyance. LA found Rumi Ookubo, Yoko Hikasa and Hiromi Igarashi\'s vocals to be decent at least and the entire cast\'s vocal chemistry made the vocal cast pretty well done (if you can manage the squeak from Yayoi, bit from Hinako and Ami anyways).Long Riders being a slice of life healing anime, LA can be lenient to this anime from it\'s simple plot of a girl wanting to learn biking and later on gather a group to do it with her to it\'s lacking character personalities, Actas\' constant delays to this anime and LA likes this anime for doing what it\'s suppose to do, to ""show that biking is a fun thing to do, to explore, to eat and just take in the sights"" just with a *ahem* small fee for bike upgrades and it IS relaxing HOWEVER not to the point of insomnia curing pacing, disjointed group dynamics within the characters AND it\'s awful and awkward 3D CGI animation. Long Riders isn\'t a horrible anime per say as LA makes it out to be, flaws and all. It just became mediocre at best by the finishing line with it\'s strengths and flaws and just how LA felt about this experience as a whole and is what unfortunately how Long Riders just turned out to be. This coming from a person who initially really liked Long Riders for the better part of 6 episodes and wanted to see a decent slice of life healing anime about biking. Long Riders isn\'t horrible....boring sometimes maybe, but mediocre at best.Anyone want to watch Bakuon!!? running gags aren\'t that bad in terms of comedic stance either. Such running gags as Ami spending ridiculous amounts of money to buy ""upgrades"" for her bike, Hinako Saijou\'s secret part-time job, Saki Takamiya\'s almost bottomless stomach and finally Hinako and later on Saki\'s teasing to Ami about more ""advanced"" marathon biking, the running gags are slightly overdone but they DON\'T overstay their welcome.

Overall Actas did a mediocre job for LA, LA didn\'t hate it as it compensated both ways but not giving it too much grace to completely ignore it\'s flaws.In terms of voice acting, well here comes the obvious again but LA\'s favorite voice actor went to Nao Touyama in making a typical ditzy character somewhat endearing and for a typical genki character, Nao Touyama definitely had RANGE making for great comedic timing and sometimes outlandish genki moe vocals work, Yurika Kurosawa had tendency to be even more high pitched like Nao Touyama and it\'s her default ojou vocals at that but it wasn\'t to the point of annoyance. LA found Rumi Ookubo, Yoko Hikasa and Hiromi Igarashi\'s vocals to be decent at least and the entire cast\'s vocal chemistry made the vocal cast pretty well done (if you can manage the squeak from Yayoi, bit from Hinako and Ami anyways).Long Riders being a slice of life healing anime, LA can be lenient to this anime from it\'s simple plot of a girl wanting to learn biking and later on gather a group to do it with her to it\'s lacking character personalities, Actas\' constant delays to this anime and LA likes this anime for doing what it\'s suppose to do, to ""show that biking is a fun thing to do, to explore, to eat and just take in the sights"" just with a *ahem* small fee for bike upgrades and it IS relaxing HOWEVER not to the point of insomnia curing pacing, disjointed group dynamics within the characters AND it\'s awful and awkward 3D CGI animation. Long Riders isn\'t a horrible anime per say as LA makes it out to be, flaws and all. It just became mediocre at best by the finishing line with it\'s strengths and flaws and just how LA felt about this experience as a whole and is what unfortunately how Long Riders just turned out to be. This coming from a person who initially really liked Long Riders for the better part of 6 episodes and wanted to see a decent slice of life healing anime about biking. Long Riders isn\'t horrible....boring sometimes maybe, but mediocre at best.Anyone want to watch Bakuon!!?', ""Story: i mean there really is no story honestly to this anime ami is walking to college one time when she sees a random person riding on a bike and then she gets the sudden will to try and start cycling and after that she will easily learn about how to maintain a bike and certain stuff about bikes and stuff like that and that's about it.Art: Ok so ill first start and say that the CGI here isn't the best but it isn't that bad either could have definitely been a lot better (even though i don't care how the art looks) but still...it good have been better as for the art overall its really good and not the bad or terrible.Sound: now ill say here (before i say something about the OP and ED) the Voice actress here were really good here but i could see how they could kinda be annoying (with the characters not shiting on the voice actress at all) but some of the character can kinda get annoying but not to that point but yeah as for the Op and Ed they were both good but nothing id download though.Characters: Yayoi is one of the main female leads and well like what someone said she pretty much the large breasted girl here in the anime she (like most to all the girls in the anime) have the happy attitude to them. Ami is another of the female leads (considered to be the actual legit main) is well a pretty happy go lucky but is usually overwhelmed a lot and what not when she learns new stuff about bikes and what not basically ami in a nutshell. Aoi is another female lead and well again mostly happy and go lucky and Ami's best friend (she of course gets more friends but at the start of the anime she is probably her only friend) again like most she does kinda get embarrassed here and the like all the girls here but again all of them are good. Hinako is another female lead and well she can kinda be abrasive (its not the bad but like to a extent she can be) and like the rest just a happy go lucky person. Saki is the last female lead and well she is a pretty hungry person and (and also shows up a little later in the anime) again another happy person nothing more.Enjoyment: What i liked: i mean the comedy is here (not as much) but when it was it was really good and also the for being enjoyable it was really (even though i don't cycle it was still enjoyable to watch) also learning about different stuff when it comes to bikes and how to be prepared for certain stuff when dealing with your bike was really interesting. What i didn't like: ok so the comedy here wasn't really there if at all again the few spots it did have comedy it was really good but again comedy wasn't there as much and also the CGI isn't the greatest either here probably my only real complaints with the anime.Overall: im giving this a 7 ( i probably would have giving this a 8 if the comedy here was there and was really good) but again comedy is decent at best also if your into cycling or not you'll still enjoy this anime as did i its a anime that is worth the watch for sure. it good have been better as for the art overall its really good and not the bad or terrible.Sound: now ill say here (before i say something about the OP and ED) the Voice actress here were really good here but i could see how they could kinda be annoying (with the characters not shiting on the voice actress at all) but some of the character can kinda get annoying but not to that point but yeah as for the Op and Ed they were both good but nothing id download though.Characters: Yayoi is one of the main female leads and well like what someone said she pretty much the large breasted girl here in the anime she (like most to all the girls in the anime) have the happy attitude to them.

Here are my thoughts:Overall low-budget visuals. Which is kind of a shame because this is the kind of show that would benefit tremendously from high visual production value. Crude CGI is frequently used during the biking scenes, and in general there are many 'quality' moments. For the record, I watched the Blurays.I was happy to see that a decent amount of attention was paid to technical aspects of biking. It did feel like the creators actually did cycling as a hobby. That kind of authenticity is a major plus in my mind. Serious performance cycling has always seemed like an interesting...hobby to me, so naturally I was interested in watching this anime. I was glad that it took the hobby seriously and made it a significant focus of the show, instead of just using it as a superficial excuse for another cookie-cutter CGDCT anime.The characters are very bland, but it's a non-dramatic sports show so I didn't expect otherwise.This anime pretty much did what I expected. It's basically a biking-with-friends simulator. It was fairly comfy. Aside from the biking theme, which I did enjoy, it felt like a generic anime with no other noteworthy qualities.OST and voice acting were unremarkable. I liked the OP song though. The various subtle sounds of cycling were handled alright as well.Road cycling in real life terrifies me for safety reasons even though I enjoy biking in general. It was nice to live vicariously through this anime, even though it was kind of mediocre.My personal overall rating: 6/10It was adequate. From an artistic perspective this anime is bad, but it does a good job of exploring the cycling theme in an authentic way. My enjoyment was mostly derived from using this anime as an activity simulator.If you're looking for an anime that genuinely focuses on the activity that it's supposed to be about, then Long Riders might be worth your time. However, if you're looking for memorable characters, or a good story, or nice audiovisual production, then you're better off looking elsewhere.I ship Ami and Aoi together. The naive girl and the mature girl together is an appealing character dynamic.I liked this anime more than its motorized counterpart, Bakuon. Long Riders was comfier whereas Bakuon was filled with unfunny comedy and didn't focus on actual (motor)cycling enough. hobby to me, so naturally I was interested in watching this anime.

Makai Senki Disgaea,https://myanimelist.net/anime/860/Makai_Senki_Disgaea,"[""Ohayoo! This is my first anime and my english is bad , so excuse me for my \\'lame\\' writing...I\\'ll review this anime with the 6 elements available.First comes the story: As we all know the set is from the PS2 game. The plotline its easy to understand and very enjoyable to watch closely, but it\\'s nothing special afterall.Art: Ok, here comes the great dilemma - the 3d is great integrated in the TV series, the character art is great, the landscape is very good, but i think something is missing. Maybe if there where more details i guessThe sound is average. Its pleasurable, i...can\\'t say anything else. Laharl (about him later) is casted by Kaori Mizuhashi - woman, how do you like that :D (don\\'t get me wrong- she\\'s a proffesional in voice-acting :))The main stage Characters in the anime are Laharl, Etna and Flonne. This is the best element in the anime.One of my favorite characters is Laharl - the brutal evil male demon who\\'s obsessed, like a true demonish character, for power,money and ultimate control. A deep development in his emotional level through the anime. A GREAT \\'against the grain\\' character - one of those evil ones who are always on Backstage , but in Disgaea he\\'s the primary evil dude who\\'s pulling the anime score up. Just superb! One of the coolest personages i\\'ve ever seen :DEtna is one of those cute and helpless girls, on the first look,  but is much like Laharl - she\\'s his servant,but there\\'s not enough \\'screen light\\' on her like Laharl.

A very lovely angel, who\\'s always gabbling about love to Laharl :D She\\'s also cute, but not like Etna ;]The Enjoyment of this anime is Very Good indeed. The final feeling is that you havent wasted your time with this title. The anime has a strange sense of humour, though... I\\'ve started to laugh at 7-8 epz. But indeed i have a hearty LAUGH with Laharl and the others.Overall: don\\'t hesitate to watch this - it\\'s not one of the \\&quot;Must watch!\\&quot; but if you want you can watch it only for Laharl sake.

(The ending is still very much similar, but how they get there is different enough)The story, in large part is very episodic, so a lot of the time &quot;real&quot; character development doesn't happen. There are, however, a couple of parts where there's some &quot;real&quot; development, generally in the beginning and end, I would say. Though it's generally lighthearted, it has its serious points as well.The characters, I think, are pretty lovable. Ok, not Gordon.

Didn\'t drag on too long, but didn\'t fall short.', 'The Disgaea franchise is, generally speaking, fantastic. They\'re RPGs with a strong sense of humour & endearing characters. Sort of like another RPG franchise that I reviewed an anime based off of. The anime for this came out in \'06 from OLM. That\'s right, the Gunsmith Cats, Steel Angel Kurumi 2 & Pokemon studio. Let\'s see how they managed with this one.Story:we open with an angel, Flonne, faffing about in the underworld to assassinate its king. She comes across the king\'s son, Laharl, who was poisoned and left in a casket. She heals him and the pair swiftly learn that his father died while he...was snoozing. After some confrontations with other demons, and finding a companion in Etna and her Frobisher... I mean prinny squad,\xa0 they decide to head for the castle so that Laharl can claim the throne.The biggest issue with the narrative is simply that it\'s extremely abridged. Things like strong pacing, atmosphere building and some of the more amusing but frivolous dialogue get tossed out in favour of trying to hit all of the major plot points from the game. To be honest, I\'m not sure it was the best way to go about it. It might have worked better if the anime was slower and only covered a quarter or a third of the game.I will give the anime credit for fleshing out the Big Sis Prinny reveal a bit better than the game did. And that\'s literally the only thing I\'ll credit it with over the game. It is also kind of nice to see the big scenes in a fully animated form, even if they are shortened in order to cram it all into a twelve episode series. And I\'m kind of glad they don\'t use the game\'s best ending since it gives viewers more incentive to actually play it.Characters:The major characters are pretty decently represented in this series. They don\'t have all the development they get in the game proper nor do they have all their best lines but, for a short series that\'s trying to cover everything, they do a pretty good job. And it does feature one of my favourite aspects of Disgaea. Demons with a lot of redeeming qualities and angels who are kind of scumbags. Call it heretical if you like, but I enjoy the subversion and I like that the execution in this franchise is a bit more nuanced since the characters are fleshed out enough that the angels do have positive traits as well, Flonne especially while the demons are significantly flawed.My biggest issue is that the anime might be too heavy handed with that aspect. The game was better about putting it in and not really drawing a huge amount of attention to it whereas the anime feels the need to shove it in your face.Art:The series looks good. They captured the game\'s aesthetic nicely. Unfortunately, the animation is pretty lazy. There are a lot of scenes where someone talks and their mouth doesn\'t move or where an action scene starts and ends very abruptly and I\'m not sure whether it\'s because they were ""hard to animate"" or because they were just rushing to get to the next plot point. Either way, it\'s not a good impression.Sound:This is one aspect where I can give the anime full credit without any ""but..."" involved. Mizuhashi Kaori, Hanba Tomoe & Sasamoto Yuuko are all fantastic. The soundtrack is really damn good as well. The sound design is just on point all around.Ho-yay:There are, maybe one or two scenes where Etna & Flonne read as having tension but it\'s not exactly a significant thing.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, this anime has its strong points. The sound is fantastic, the characters are close enough to their game versions to have a lot of the endearing factors intact, the story has its moments. But its pacing and atmosphere suffer from being too abridged, the big subversion is too heavy-handed, the animation is lazy and it ultimately ends up being an inferior version of the game\'s story with some changes that do work and others that don\'t really matter. I give the anime a 6/10. It\'s decent enough and it might be worth watching if you love the game or if you\'re on the fence about trying the game and you want something that can give you a good idea of whether or not you\'d like it. Because if you enjoy this anime well enough the chance of you enjoying the game is very high. Next week, Ninja Batman.

The game was better about putting it in and not really drawing a huge amount of attention to it whereas the anime feels the need to shove it in your face.Art:The series looks good. They captured the game\'s aesthetic nicely. Unfortunately, the animation is pretty lazy. There are a lot of scenes where someone talks and their mouth doesn\'t move or where an action scene starts and ends very abruptly and I\'m not sure whether it\'s because they were ""hard to animate"" or because they were just rushing to get to the next plot point. Either way, it\'s not a good impression.Sound:This is one aspect where I can give the anime full credit without any ""but..."" involved. Mizuhashi Kaori, Hanba Tomoe & Sasamoto Yuuko are all fantastic. The soundtrack is really damn good as well. The sound design is just on point all around.Ho-yay:There are, maybe one or two scenes where Etna & Flonne read as having tension but it\'s not exactly a significant thing.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, this anime has its strong points. The sound is fantastic, the characters are close enough to their game versions to have a lot of the endearing factors intact, the story has its moments. But its pacing and atmosphere suffer from being too abridged, the big subversion is too heavy-handed, the animation is lazy and it ultimately ends up being an inferior version of the game\'s story with some changes that do work and others that don\'t really matter. I give the anime a 6/10. It\'s decent enough and it might be worth watching if you love the game or if you\'re on the fence about trying the game and you want something that can give you a good idea of whether or not you\'d like it. Because if you enjoy this anime well enough the chance of you enjoying the game is very high. Next week, Ninja Batman. Because I\'ve looked at a few Marvel anime already and it\'s time to give DC a chance.', ""A light-hearted story of an angel in training, a devil heir to the throne, and his &quot;servants&quot; who don't exactly serve him the best they can. It's comic and cute, and with a minimal amount of innuendo, Disgaea is suitable for most audiences. If you want to pass some time with a fun, enjoyable anime, this is certainly the one to watch. "", 'This is an anime based off a video game. It likely isn’t as good, but I still enjoyed it as an anime only viewer.Although the story isn’t the best, it is clear and somewhat interesting. It’s about an angel who has a task to reform the demons who live in hell, but it’s clear from the start that they aren’t as bad as they’re made out to be. The story around the Prinnies, why they exist, and why they work so willingly for something the demon characters seem to have so much of is also interesting.Like most video game adaptations the character designs...in this anime are really well done. The main character is a blonde girl, but unlike most anime blondes she isn’t a Westerner, although she technically still is a foreigner. Although the series is set in hell and is about reforming demons the pace of it feels more slice of life so there isn’t much fighting. This isn’t to say the animation isn’t good, but the place where good animation really shines is missing. All of the characters are well animated and the area they live in is well designed for what it’s meant to be, although seeing as it is hell there really isn’t too much going on and everything looks very samey. Although it is sort of an adventure anime the scenery looks fairly boring. The waddle that the Prinnies do is kind of fun to watch and adds a little something to the show.I watched it dubbed so I can’t really comment on the seiyuu performance, although the dub wasn’t bad so I’ll give it that. As for the theme songs the opening was very unmemorable and although the ending is better it still isn’t very good. I saw this anime a long time ago so I don’t know what say about the soundtrack other than the fact that I can’t remember anything about it.The personalities of the characters was surprisingly good for this otherwise underwhelming anime. The heroine was given an understandable task to complete and the others have good reasons to not cooperate. The Prinnies which are originally seen as some sort of worthless slave race are later shown a much more interesting reason for existence. I actually found their tale to be more interesting than that of the protagonists.I watched it on a bus so this was more or less just an easy way to pass the time, but it does a good job with that. It might not be too good of an anime objectively, but it made for a really fun watch. It has a lot of unique attributes.If you’re looking for a fun way to pass the time this would be a good choice. However, if you care about depth or don’t want a cheesy story about how people who look evil aren’t that bad then you might to give this show a pass. in this anime are really well done.

It’s not a deliberate, focused exercise in style or cliches. The only idea behind it is to deliver a simple adventure about becoming an overlord. This form will never die and that’s okay. You can fit many ideas into it. Somehow, Disgaea manages to get it right without fitting any ideas.Other great works in this style – JoJo and Kill la Kill – have a bigger purpose than simply telling a story. One was about testing the limit of how macho you could get. The other...comes from the head of Imaishi, and that guy never stops hallucinating. After all, we’ve seen this pattern of Hero Defeats Enemy plenty of times. Relying on it means falling back on cliches, and cliches are always terrible when they’re crutches.Disgaea has no such lofty ambitions. It doesn’t push the monomyth further, or tries to get more steam out of its formula. In fact, it has no ambitions besides telling a fun story about an exciting adventure. Unambitious anime are rare, and often terrible. Plenty of time anime fail despite having big aims and trying hard. There was a lot less effort put into Disgaea than other shows, but the result is great.That’s because telling a simple story isn’t that hard. You just need to remember your story is simple. The problem with doorstop fantasy series and long-running anime is that their size comes back to bite them in the ass. If your story is only about adrenaline and a few oddballs, why stretch it to be as long as life itself?Free of these limitations, Disgaea lets loose with its wacky world. How it compares to the original game, I have no idea. As an anime, it gets everything right. The focus is both on memorable characters, unique set-pieces and a story that’s bigger than its initial premise. Although it’s mostly comic and light-hearted, it has its powerful emotional moments. It’s another anime that proves that if you make your characters feel alive enough, we’ll be swept away by their troubles.The characters of Disgaea aren’t psychological. They’re of the grand-mythic type, but even there it’s in a basic form. A megalomanic, a pure-hearted angel and a conniving demon. These templates still work because the characters have an inner drive. Each of them reacts to the situations in their own unique way. Even if their personalities aren’t the most original or developed – they’re never as bizarre as Kill la Kill – they’re still lifelike.The wacky nature of the world adds excite to the adventure. It’s a free-form world. There’s no internal logic to it. Hell is a bizarre place where weird stuff happens. If that makes the world shallow, these lone set-pieces still achieve the lifelike quality of the characters. The pacing is focused. Each episode stands on its own and has its own arc.It’s important for your story to consist of such arcs. Stories that only build up put all their eggs in one basket, and can easily fall apart (Especially if your adventure goes on for a lifetime or two). Disgaea‘s adventure is fun because every moment is meant to be fun. In fact, the series often puts its big climax on the afterburner. It’s more focused on what happens now.These set-pieces are often bizarre and silly, but why shouldn’t they? Adventure stories are that their best when they’re wild. We’re attracted to adventures because the events are often bizarre in exotic places. The silly nature of Disgaea‘s world makes it both more lifelike and more immersive than any WHOA WORLDBUILDING work by Western fantasists. Sure, Maritn filled with world with details and names. He never made something as attention-grabbing as the Prinnies.Looking back, the expansion of the climax isn’t so unexpected. The hint that the show is more than Laharl becoming overlord are at the very beginning. It’s still a great decision. When the climax arrives, it’s huge. One climax leads right into another, but it never overloads. Every episode has its own inner story. Thus the climax doesn’t explode from too much content. Rather, it’s divided up and allowed to build tension.While it gets the basic formula right, Disgaea is still an unambitious anime. That’s the flaw that follows it in every episode. It doesn’t feel like only an advertisement, but the art and the basic nature of things point to an unambitious team. The art is great, but the animation quality is fairly low. It’s not a minimalist art style yet the lack of details in the background make it feel like the creators didn’t think it deserved it.The character design is also great, but everyone on the side is piss-poor. One episode has a one-time antagonist that looks like it was designed in one minute. The creators are clearly capable of great character design and good background. The visuals drastically improve in the climax (The Prinny redemption episode is especially beautiful). Until then though, it looks so basic and uninspired it takes you out of the anime. Animation quality isn’t everything and art style is far more important. Here, though, the animation quality affects the art when the character design is boring and the backgrounds aren’t as wild as they should be.The story is also, in the end, about nothing. As the mighty Digimon Tamers proved, an adventure story can definitely be full of meaning. Disgaea doesn’t even try although it’s capable. The Prinnies are a brilliant creation. They’re hilarious and an episode proves they can be emotionally powerful. The series never plays around that. The series never pays too much attention to Laharl’s psychological development although it could. It’s not pretentious. It simply doesn’t try to add psychological depth or even cover it up. I don’t know what is worse – not trying, or covering up.The flaws prevent Disgaea from being great, but it’s highly enjoyable as a light adventure. Many anime can still learn from this – the characters have inner drives, each episode is focused on a single arc and the climax is bigger than the synopsis says. There really isn’t much to dislike here, although some will be turned off by the lack of ambition.3 Prinnies out of 5 comes from the head of Imaishi, and that guy never stops hallucinating.

On one hand the anime manages to stay true to the source material both thematically and in regards to character development - on the other hand what the anime adaption chooses to supplant the original story with isn\'t particularly interesting.The anime decides to introduce most of the key characters from the video game\'s story in the first episode.

Lots of comedy, great characters. The anime is just as great!Although it is shorten to only 12 episodes, You got to admit it's great. Plus it tells many stories that you won't be able to see in the video game. Now I must admit it's really cute. You might say it's cute with a little dark tiwst to it.It includes all the characters(well most of them.) along with some other characters as well. I not going to tell you about any of the new characters since I'm not allow to show spoilers.If you like the Disgaea series, then give...this anime a shot. this anime a shot."", 'This review contains spoilers, read at own risk. Skip to the end for a summary.Fair warning, I\'m an avid fan of the Disgaea series, and have played the game this show is based off of multiple times, and so I will be drawing some comparisons here and there, but I will keep the focus on the show itself.The story is, on a surface level, not particularly unique; a king dies and a successor must take his place, but not before going on a path of self-discovery. Nothing groundbreaking, but Disgaea likes to put its own unique twist to it. A large helping of comedy, action,...plot twists and compelling characters helps turn this time-old setup into a truly unique story.Having been adapted from a video game that\'s meant to be played for anywhere from 40 hours to 400 hours, being a 12 episode anime really cripples the show\'s potential. It\'s forced to alter or omit certain segments from the story and often feels rushed, and will likely feel that way even for someone with no knowledge of the game it\'s based off of.On top of this, the anime seems to stretch out certain segments and make use of filler, which hurts with its already short running time of 12 episodes. The most blatant example of this is the episode that focuses entirely on the uncertain swordswoman, a character who has no relevance to the overall plot and appeaared as a mere joke boss in one stage in the original game.Its saving grace, however, is the writing. Comedic, tastefully cheesy at times and clearly holding that unique Disgaea charm. If you\'ve played the games, it\'s very obvious that they had the same writers on board. It\'s witty, funny, and silly, but can be serious when it needs to be.Having a unique artstyle based off of that from the game, with the eye-catching and varying landscapes of the Netherworld and incredible character designs from artist Takehito Harada, Disgaea is a visual feast, and prior to the recent remaster, actually looks better than the game it\'s based off of. Each character, main, side, or background, has a memorable look that sets them apart from one another. No two episodes look the same. Many different backdrops are used, all complimenting the visuals well. While not as polished as more modern anime, Disgaea stands out even today.A lot of the music is borrowed from the game or is given a nice little update. Tenpei Sato\'s work adds a lot to the charm that makes Disgaea what it is, and that\'s no exception here. You\'re bound to get at least one tune stuck in your head by the end. There\'s also the original piece made specifically for the opening which, trust me, you won\'t be skipping. Fantastical and catchy, it fits perfectly with the visuals of the opening to make for quite the memorable opening sequence.The main trio of Laharl, Etna and Flonne are the selling point of this show. Each one unique in their own ways and much funnier than they have any right being, a lot of the character development and arcs are skipped in favour of the main character, Laharl.Laharl: Snarky, bratty and selfish beyond belief, Laharl is the last person you\'d expect to be the protagonist. Laharl has a specific view on what a demon should be and what a demon can and can\'t do, which shapes his actions and causes him to mask any feelings that go against those beliefs. Over the course of the story, those beliefs are challenged (primarily by Flonne) and both Laharl\'s outlook and behaviour begin to change. At the start of the show, Laharl is a selfish brat who would make for a terrible overlord, and by the end, he\'s a good leader and caring friend who tries to mask his good deeds and positive feelings under a facade reminiscent of the average tsundere.Etna: Lazy, self-obsessed and underhanded, Etna is anything but the ""humble vassal"" she introduces herself as. Caring only for herself and her own goals, showing little care for any harm or destruction caused, Etna is what most people would see the typical demon as. Unfortunately, her character arc and development from the game is almost entirely absent, which can make her feel rather one-note in the show. On top of this, for whatever reason, the anime has a running gag of Etna being afraid of Laharl(\'s power), whereas in the game, Etna fears no soul and inversely is the one to instill fear in Laharl. (Just an odd change I felt the need to point out.) Despite all this, a first time viewer is still bound to fall in love with her snide, cutting wit and badass charm.Flonne: Cheerful, optimistic, and incredibly dimwitted, Flonne serves as the moral anchor of the group, when she isn\'t serving as comic relief. The sole fact that she tries to preach peace and love to demons says more about her character than I probably ever could. The driving force behind Laharl\'s change and arguably the love interest, she\'s often butting heads with him in an effort to make him behave more righteously. Through Laharl, Flonne learns that even demons can show love and kindness to one another.A special mention goes out to Vyers as well, as although he mostly serves as comic relief being the infamous ""Mid-Boss"", he\'s eventually revealed to be the reincarnation of King Krichevskoy, testing and overlooking Laharl on his journey until eventually revealing his true identity and fading away with the spirit of Laharl\'s mother. He comes off as a joke, only to surprise you with a hidden depth, and to me, that\'s something special.Fun fact: In Hour Of Darkness, once Laharl calls Vyers ""Mid-Boss"" for the first time, the game permanently changes his name to Mid-Boss. I\'m serious.SUMMARY: A visual and audible treat for both fans and newcomers alike, Disgaea delivers a short but sweet tale of growth with a generous helping of comedy and mirth that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Suffering from its short runtime and unnecessary use of filler, Disgaea has some lost potential, but could definitely work as a gateway into the series for those interested. plot twists and compelling characters helps turn this time-old setup into a truly unique story.Having been adapted from a video game that\'s meant to be played for anywhere from 40 hours to 400 hours, being a 12 episode anime really cripples the show\'s potential.

On top of this, for whatever reason, the anime has a running gag of Etna being afraid of Laharl(\'s power), whereas in the game, Etna fears no soul and inversely is the one to instill fear in Laharl. (Just an odd change I felt the need to point out.) Despite all this, a first time viewer is still bound to fall in love with her snide, cutting wit and badass charm.Flonne: Cheerful, optimistic, and incredibly dimwitted, Flonne serves as the moral anchor of the group, when she isn\'t serving as comic relief. The sole fact that she tries to preach peace and love to demons says more about her character than I probably ever could. The driving force behind Laharl\'s change and arguably the love interest, she\'s often butting heads with him in an effort to make him behave more righteously. Through Laharl, Flonne learns that even demons can show love and kindness to one another.A special mention goes out to Vyers as well, as although he mostly serves as comic relief being the infamous ""Mid-Boss"", he\'s eventually revealed to be the reincarnation of King Krichevskoy, testing and overlooking Laharl on his journey until eventually revealing his true identity and fading away with the spirit of Laharl\'s mother. He comes off as a joke, only to surprise you with a hidden depth, and to me, that\'s something special.Fun fact: In Hour Of Darkness, once Laharl calls Vyers ""Mid-Boss"" for the first time, the game permanently changes his name to Mid-Boss. I\'m serious.SUMMARY: A visual and audible treat for both fans and newcomers alike, Disgaea delivers a short but sweet tale of growth with a generous helping of comedy and mirth that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Suffering from its short runtime and unnecessary use of filler, Disgaea has some lost potential, but could definitely work as a gateway into the series for those interested.', 'Disgaea is simple, yet well made fun! If you like cute stuff and a good story? Then this is for you (and me!). Watch the short into video ""Welcome to Netherworld"" for an excellent, no spoilers look at what you\'ll get.Etna is really the central character, but all 3 MC get plenty of air time and development. If you find Etna adorable? You\'ll love this show!Story: Seems simple to begin with, but grows in depth and complexity. The finale is terrific, bringing everything to a logical and satisfying end. Except: 12 episodes is too short! But there\'s no sense of rushing, just a wish we...could see more!Art: Pretty basic, it may turn some away with its age & cartoon-ish style.Sound: Is good, and the English Dub is terrific! The OP and ED are catchy and well made.Characters: While not much can be done in 12 episodes with 3 main and 6+ secondary characters, and the Prinnys! Dood! There is both depth and development that is really well done. If a bit simple.Overall it was great and I highly recommend it to both new anime fans and veterans. For kids too? Mostly, there\'s nothing like pantsu or gore, so probably yes. The only thing that stops it from being a 10 is the basic art and it\'s too short! A solid 9.5 for sure. could see more!Art: Pretty basic, it may turn some away with its age & cartoon-ish style.Sound: Is good, and the English Dub is terrific!

The first half was okay, but at a certain point I must admit there were moments that I thought MSD was a bit boring, and in the first episodes not much happens, or at least not much very exciting stuff. I kind of missed the ""deeper meaning"" of the story... But the last four episodes were quite different! From episode 9 on I started to enjoy MSD much more because it gets more interesting and the...series finally start becoming ""deeper"". But I won\'t get into details, so you should just go and watch it for yourselves ;D Overall, a 7 because it was close to a six in the beginning, and close to an 8 in the ending :) If you want a ""light"" anime that is easy to understand and enjoyable I would recommend MSD to you, but if you\'re looking for an anime with a more complicated plot then MSD is probably not interesting for you. Here just a short point by point review:Story: Good. Like I said, in the beginning it was quite plain, but towards the ending it got more of a deeper meaning.Art: Great, beautiful character design, and the computer images really fit in perfectly and all the effects are wonderfully done!Sound: Very good. Overall the sounds and music really were suitable for the story though some scenes could do with a change of soundtrack and there were also scenes that the music just brilliantly intensified your emotions.Character: very good. Overall the characters are quite stereotypical, but especially in the last few eps you really notice their character changes, which makes the story better and more interesting.Enjoyment: Good. Like I said, in the first few eps, it wasn\'t really particularly enjoyable, aside from some funny (visual) jokes. In the last few eps it becomes more enjoyable, though most of the jokes remain plain and not very spectacular in my opinion. series finally start becoming ""deeper"".

Hardly anything. Is that a bad thing? Not really.The story of anime diverges heavily from the very beginning: Flonne finds Laharl sleeping in a garbage dump, far away from the castle. However, this allows watchers already familiar with the source material to discover something new, albeit unexpected, given that the trailers promised a more faithful adaptation. However, seasoned players will get...exactly what they expect: more of the characters they've grown to know and love.Makai Senki Disgaea is heavily episodic with little interaction of individual plot points up and until the ending, which is a good suit; the show, as does the source, relies heavily on quirky humor delivered in a lighthearted style. The changes made to the overall storyline thus does not affect enjoyment in the least. While delivering new content is one of the strengths of this anime, I cannot help but feel that character development was rather lackluster. This was balanced out, though, by the three final episodes stringing the way to the ending beautifully.Despite the lack of development, the cast is and stays unique, which is partially owed to the source material providing a fantastic point to start from. The most memorable exchanges between the characters have been kept. It is most difficult for all but the most demonic of watchers to not feel any connection to the characters and not getting dragged along for the ride.Surprisingly, the potential for fan service was barely harvested, which is a nice touch; jokes just cannot be delivered as well if there are panties on-screen every few minutes. However, if were to make you think that the show takes itself too seriously, I must disappoint you, as the animation suggests otherwise. Horribly clunky and off-model visuals for even the lowest of low-budget anime, the interaction between characters, which is the heart of any comedy, can only be described as an accident. The less-than-stellar animation did not ruin any scenes per se, yet it is noticeable enough that it is at times detrimental to the overall experience.Good though the art style may be, which was a straightforward copy of the design in the game with more color to it, the contrast with the backgrounds is insurmountably large. At times, a truly beautiful view, albeit not even close to scenery porn as seen in Aria: The Animation, causes a jarring contrast to the protagonists' actions. This stark difference in quality is further amplified by the soundtrack, which consists of remixes of tunes heard in the game and a few well-made original pieces that did truly help the visuals along and set a fitting atmosphere at all times.The soundtrack deserves far more recognition than it does – it is difficult to obtain by now, but every single track is worth finding someone still selling the soundtrack CD. While the voice acting was neither remarkably good nor bad, it was good enough to go under the radar and the seiyuu did fit their respective roles; the opening and ending are standard “show the characters off and promote some J-Pop band” tunes with visuals that any seasoned anime watcher could expect.Once one is able to see past the glaring problems with animation, however, Makai Senki Disgaea presents itself as a light comedy. Unfortunately, this means that those who were looking forward to great fighting scenes will be disappointed; seeing some battles is a reasonable expectation if one keeps in mind that the source material is heavily based around combat. The few scenes of that kind are short and use sub-par special effects to make up for the visuals, which is a failed attempt at damage control.The anime is a must-watch for anyone already familiar with the source material and everyone looking for a one-cour show to watch between seasons, though it is not worth your time when you already have a long plan-to-watch list. However, once all the gags have been delivered, watching the series for a second time will be quite boring as the novelty of it wears off quickly.

I started with Disgaea 3 until I went back to play its previous predecessors, I started to appreciate the 1st game's plot a lot more than most of its newer games. The anime did an ok job with its adaptation, the comedy at least. This is an honest review with Disgaea. For those who had played this game assuming most of its viewers did, would enjoy it for what it is (like me). However, for those who haven't played the game would probably not like it, not like the person...reading this would care actually. So I'm going to be brief.The art is good for its time I guess, the sounds were alright, there was some character development mainly for Laharl that one would not expect when they are first introduced to Disgaea. My enjoyment for the anime is indifferent. The comedy was rather unique for its time as well.Overall, it just brought a nostalgic feeling in my childhood. If I were to look at it in an unbiased honest way, overall it was ok. I recommend the Disgaea games way more than the anime itself. The anime adaptation for games isn't the exactly the greatest nowadays.I would rate the anime 6 out of 10 prinnies. Loved for its comedy, but recommend 100% the games instead.9 out 10 prinnies for its game's unique rpg mechanics and tradition grinding. reading this would care actually.

Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38778/Midara_na_Ao-chan_wa_Benkyou_ga_Dekinai,"[""Imagine a teenage girl so traumatized by her perverted father that she develops a phobia of males. This girl is brave enough to transform that fear into a positive motivation - to attend an elite college and obtain an independent career where she can support herself in the absence of family.But Ao-chan is not allowed to have that level of agency. Her ambition is instead made secondary to a forced, awkward, unnatural relationship with a popular teenager of unreal pureness who is a continual source of anxiety. This is to the detriment of her studies that are sacrificed at the altar of fickle teenage...romance. The more she participates in romance, the lower her ambition to establish independence becomes.It is problematic that this anime presents Ao as a character who must change herself to accept that men are a necessary component to happiness as a teenager. As if a boyfriend is something that she needs to obtain in order to be whole, when in reality nothing was really missing to begin with. She just wasn’t ready for a relationship at her age, and that’s fine. But according to this anime that is not fine. So we’re subjected to misunderstandings about phallic instruments, forced and awkward sexual tension, extreme anxiety and hyper-erroticism that is skewed towards the male gaze.Some of the greatest romantic narratives feature partners who are equally prepared for a relationship and have as much to lose or gain as the other party does. There is then a mutual level of understanding between them and they grow through their experiences with each other. But in this narrative Ao is very clearly the one changing the most as a result of her relationship, undeniably for the worse, while stale male kun is for the best. He gets to date the super sexy socially awkward virgin girl who only shows her fun side to him. She is sacrificing her academic career to the extent of failing every single subject while stale male kun is shown to have no such decline.Perhaps I would be willing to forgive this push for Ao to sacrifice her studies if the anime were entirely satirical of romantic pitfalls and never took itself seriously. I am not an unfun curmudgeon who doesn't appreciate humor -  for some episodes that were entirely silly and focused on secondary characters (such as the sardonic best friend Miyabi) I was able to forget how offensive the premise was and chuckle at the absurd situations the characters found themselves in. But when the tenor switched to being dramatic, or the comedy was at the expense of a teenage girl who wants to be free of her family, is when I was reminded of the reality that Ao is actually being pushed by her degenerate father to hook up with an unknown boy before she’s emotionally or mentally prepared for it at the sacrifice of future outlook. More creepy than it is cute or funny. romance.

Some people have experienced this and teenagers are in this complicated situation.Is the Japanese anime industry in a crisis?  To be honest, I also don\'t know about this but there are several factors that can prove the truth of that opinion.  If from my point of view most Japanese anime has a theme that is so simple.  What I mean here is why don\'t they make a masterpiece with a story full of drama?  Forget about that, now the anime world...mostly has a romance comedy theme because the two themes are popular with various groups.  One of them is ""Midara na Ao Chan Benkyou ga Dekinai"" Having an honest comedy romance theme, this anime is perfect, but there are several factors that make this anime even more perfect.  The jokes followed by the ""ecchi"" genre make this anime even better.  The excitement and funnyness of this anime from each episode is very interesting why is that?  There is no doubt that the three genres have proven how interesting this anime is especially among men.Focusing on a girl named Ao Horie who lives her daily life just by learning but one day her classmate named Takumi Kijima changed Horie\'s daily life, which at first only studied now became diverse.  In each episode they do things like high school students in general but these things will definitely lead to a misunderstanding.  Don\'t think that this anime is similar to the one outside because if you look at each episode that is displayed it is very interesting and makes you not feel bored.It doesn\'t matter how good the storyline is, but it is like a spoon and fork if the storyline is not balanced with good image quality, it will be one-sided (come on, this is an anime).  Did the anime industry experience that path?  I don\'t know why such questions are still imagined in my mind but as an audience I honestly do not care about the problem that I am concerned is whether they can still continue the work they are working on on their own?  It\'s not just being abandoned.  This time the presentation of the manga, I honestly do not know the ins and outs of this one anime, for some reason I did not find in some websites, but Silver Link made a bold decision because they have adapted a manga that is rarely highlighted to become famous.  This studio has done a lot of various anime made famous by him and with the name of the studio maybe their sales also go up.  The art here in my opinion is standard and as usual there is nothing special.When compared to art, maybe this is equally important as a car, if the animation interpreter is a machine then this is the wheel.  The voice actors are very good because they try to make sounds that are different from the age they are playing and in my opinion it is an extraordinary thing.  But what stands out most in this section is the opening theme of the anime itself, how does the opening theme become an example of an anime.  Having an opening theme that is liked by various people is a difficult job but here they get it. It is proven that the songs sung by Edoga Sullivan managed to seize the attention of many anime lovers.Love?  Actually it is a complicated expression of feeling even though the word consists of only two words but it takes a lot of effort to say it.  Who should express these words?  Is a man?  Or girl?  I don\'t think that is an important thing, as long as one of them succeeds in saying these two syllables, I am sure they must understand a word that covers everything.  Expecting something after saying these words is of course a natural thing and in my opinion it is a reward for having made a hard effort.  This story illustrates this where they expect each other but the hope contains only nonsense but they try to cover up the shortcomings.  No wonder having shame and anxiety because their hopes are only nonsense but this is a characteristic of each character.  Ao is a girl who is perfectly smart and also beautiful but she has shortcomings in love, while Kijima is also like that even though he is not how smart.I can feel everything from sadness to happiness here.

I won\'t make any arguments.Story 9/10: The story is quite attractive. I promise you all ecchi fan. This is going to be fun. But, sorry there is no extreme fanservice there. It\'s all about one natural born hentai dere girl who meets the kindest boy ever. I can\'t say he is a man because he is too stupid to become a man. You\'ll know what I mean.Art 7/10: Seven is my average score. Nothing problem.Sound 9/10: OP and ED was catchy as hell. My most favorited song this season.Character 8/10: In the most of ecchi anime...you may got this kind of cliche; ""lucky bastard boy MC"", ""fake-innocent boy MC"", or ""real pervert  boy MC"" who will always get paired with one or more beautiful innocent/deredere/mature/thot girl. What people usually say to them is; ""the MC is trash"", ""this show is garbage"", etc.Here we have the kindest boy in ecchi anime ever with adorable and cute Hentai dere girl. I bet you won\'t be able to hate the boy MC (except for being too pure lol). Unconsciously, you\'ll ship them.Enjoyment 9/10: This anime is very enjoyable. Thanks to 12 min duration. If this anime have longer duratuion, i highly doubt it would be enjoyable.I\'d love to give 10 for the score but i\'m afraid it could be overrated so 9 is fair for me.

Show ‘em your A-O-face!“Meow…meow?” — Ao Horie“Nice…” — Harrison Yates, South Park copHow simple misunderstandings evolve into salacious predicaments.  Although, Ao-chan’s suspicions could precipitate from a subconscious desire that wills her into suggestive positions, despite her conscious rejections.  Considering that she routinely thinks about embarrassing scenarios involving Takumi Kijima, it’s likely she secretly longs for a lustful relationship with him.  Whatever the case may be, “Ao-chan Can’t Study!” is quite amusing, in spite of its childish, unrealistic antics.The humor relies on Ao-chan’s wild imaginations and awkwardness.  Essentially, Ao-chan overanalyzes her prearranged plans to ‘break-up’ with Takumi to the...point of flustering herself with nervous anticipation.  Invariably, this leads to erotic gaffes where Ao-chan ‘presents’ herself to Takumi; which, surprisingly — at least, to Ao-chan — he implores her to exhibit modesty.  Yet it doesn’t derail Ao-chan from holding inconsistent beliefs that Takumi is a devious, sex-crazed individual who aspires to get into her pants.  Hence, the inadvertent eroticism serves as a perpetual gag for the writers to reuse (sometimes ad nauseam).Entrusting the success of a comedy centric show to a singular setup is risky business, but “Ao-chan Can’t Study” succeeds more than it fails.  Particularly because it captures the essence of teenage angst in a manner that is palatable to the audience.  Laughter permits openness to subjects that can be considered ineffable in the high school milieu.  Thus, allowing the viewer to establish a connection with Ao-chan and understand her inner tumult.  And while the situations themselves are artificial (for the sake of the ‘joke’), they resonate with the viewer because every person has experienced the discomfort of saying or doing the ‘wrong’ thing.  Because of this ‘connection,’ the jokes feel intimate.  Which makes them all the more hilarious, save for a few duds every now and then. point of flustering herself with nervous anticipation.

Hence, the inadvertent eroticism serves as a perpetual gag for the writers to reuse (sometimes ad nauseam).Entrusting the success of a comedy centric show to a singular setup is risky business, but “Ao-chan Can’t Study” succeeds more than it fails.  Particularly because it captures the essence of teenage angst in a manner that is palatable to the audience.  Laughter permits openness to subjects that can be considered ineffable in the high school milieu.  Thus, allowing the viewer to establish a connection with Ao-chan and understand her inner tumult.  And while the situations themselves are artificial (for the sake of the ‘joke’), they resonate with the viewer because every person has experienced the discomfort of saying or doing the ‘wrong’ thing.  Because of this ‘connection,’ the jokes feel intimate.  Which makes them all the more hilarious, save for a few duds every now and then.', ""I have watched tons of slice of life and many romcoms and this one is WAYY better than most out there. I'm grinning ear to ear and laughing at this show the overwhelming majority of the time I'm looking at it. The way MC thinks and the fact she thinks all men are trash makes this show a lot better and sets it apart. Watching MC figure out about all these unknown things is great and made a lot funnier because of what she expects.

It is about Ao-chan, the tsuntsuntsundere daughter of an erotic novel author, who wants to live alone for university and thus needs to study hard. But, a kind handsome fellow in her class has fallen for her, and is distracting her from studying.The majority of the show is basically one long misunderstanding. Ao has deep-seated psychological problems. She misunderstands and/or makes assumptions about her courter (Takumi) constantly, is usually wrong, and never learns from it. Furthermore, she assumes that he is thinking a certain way, repeatedly castigates him...for it (wrongly and incorrectly), and YET in multiple situations, she EXPECTS him to act/think that way - and castigates him for NOT doing so. Essentially, she is a classic tsundere, but with an extra dose of hypocrisy and an inordinately impressive ability to avoid expressing her actual thoughts/feelings. You just feel pity for the poor man: his behaviour is almost entirely above reproach, and yet he is constantly being rebuked and rejected. She wants to reject and throw him away - and then she wants him; she wants him to leave her alone - but then gets unhappy when he does; she wants him to make a move on her - yet reacts negatively when he does; she clearly likes him and he has clearly stated his feelings for her - but she refuses to express her feelings in spoken words. This is asylum-worthy behaviour.Separately, some people seemingly found the dad annoying, but he was alright. Certainly less annoying than the WTF behaviour of his daughter. Why is he a micro-chibi gnome-like creature (a fact that no one seems to comment on)? No idea. As for the male man, I actually liked him; he seemed like a nice guy. I even sympathized a little with Ao\'s friend-enemy rival, who directly tells her how annoying her behaviour is (lol), though she is kind of a weirdly cardboard character. It kind of felt like she was there just to make Ao feel superior (since Ao can have everything she wants, with no effort - but doesn\'t even care about it).Anyway, here\'s my classification:- Moe: sometimes Ao is a kawaii but this is drowned in instability and tsun- Comedy: moderate- Drama: plenty- Action: none- Romance: that\'s the story- Harem: none- Ecchi: littleI will say that there were plenty of moments where I laughed, so the comedy is not a complete fail. And, if Ao actually acted like a reasonable person to the poor guy, she could have been a very likable character. Her art and design (and basically nobody else\'s) were very well done, I think.I\'ve placed the drama high because the story introduces characters to get in the way of the mains (partly via misunderstandings of course), and just generate jealousy between them, in addition to Ao\'s unpredictable moodiness. One thing that surprised me was the lack of ecchi - calling this a shounen, ecchi anime (as MAL has placed it, genre-wise), is honestly inaccurate. Just because a show has erotic themes and premises, or discusses such subject matter, does not make it an ecchi show: ecchi usually implies light-hearted visual fanservice, and erotically but not emotionally charged situations. Adult anime with straight-up $ex scenes are not necessarily ecchi anime, for instance. While this show does have some ecchi elements (mostly in Ao\'s fantasies, which she wants to come true but also doesn\'t[??]), they are usually extremely short-lived scenes or even just briefly flashed, literal still images. Ao gets into a bikini and a tight ""teacher\'s cosplay"", but this fanservice is quite short. I think it would be easier for this show to go a bit further and simply be a hentai, than it would for it to be classified as ecchi, to me personally. But no doubt many would disagree. (I might just be spoiled by all the great ecchi fanservice shows I\'ve seen over the last several years.)I should also mention that there is significant character and relationship progression during the show, especially for Ao. However, she never really fixes her severe personality flaws (of which at multiple points in the story she herself is aware). The male main doesn\'t change much, though our perception of him does.Overall, while this is an amusing show with nice art that I got a few laughs out of, I wouldn\'t rewatch it. Ao\'s tsun personality, her forced drama-inducing behaviour, her constant unpredictable emotional seesawing, her borderline abusive treatment of someone who loves her... I suspect this show is either written by a woman or aimed at women who like to fantasize about having a kind, handsome man who only cares about her and doggedly pursues her, no matter how much she rejects and slaps him away (even while other, less abusive women aggressively pursue them). There\'s nothing wrong with that, of course, it\'s just that you should know what it is before you watch it! It is certainly not the simple ecchi comedy I was hoping for. It is closer to a romantic drama with a female high-tsun-low-dere main, plus some comedic elements. I also noticed the show tries too hard (especially near the beginning) to be ""realistic"", raunchy, and edgy, which was as cringy as the forced drama and teen angst to me. I guess I just don\'t find that kind of thing interesting or funny, but I suspect there are many who might enjoy it. for it (wrongly and incorrectly), and YET in multiple situations, she EXPECTS him to act/think that way - and castigates him for NOT doing so.

It kind of felt like she was there just to make Ao feel superior (since Ao can have everything she wants, with no effort - but doesn\'t even care about it).Anyway, here\'s my classification:- Moe: sometimes Ao is a kawaii but this is drowned in instability and tsun- Comedy: moderate- Drama: plenty- Action: none- Romance: that\'s the story- Harem: none- Ecchi: littleI will say that there were plenty of moments where I laughed, so the comedy is not a complete fail. And, if Ao actually acted like a reasonable person to the poor guy, she could have been a very likable character. Her art and design (and basically nobody else\'s) were very well done, I think.I\'ve placed the drama high because the story introduces characters to get in the way of the mains (partly via misunderstandings of course), and just generate jealousy between them, in addition to Ao\'s unpredictable moodiness. One thing that surprised me was the lack of ecchi - calling this a shounen, ecchi anime (as MAL has placed it, genre-wise), is honestly inaccurate. Just because a show has erotic themes and premises, or discusses such subject matter, does not make it an ecchi show: ecchi usually implies light-hearted visual fanservice, and erotically but not emotionally charged situations. Adult anime with straight-up $ex scenes are not necessarily ecchi anime, for instance. While this show does have some ecchi elements (mostly in Ao\'s fantasies, which she wants to come true but also doesn\'t[??]), they are usually extremely short-lived scenes or even just briefly flashed, literal still images. Ao gets into a bikini and a tight ""teacher\'s cosplay"", but this fanservice is quite short. I think it would be easier for this show to go a bit further and simply be a hentai, than it would for it to be classified as ecchi, to me personally. But no doubt many would disagree. (I might just be spoiled by all the great ecchi fanservice shows I\'ve seen over the last several years.)I should also mention that there is significant character and relationship progression during the show, especially for Ao. However, she never really fixes her severe personality flaws (of which at multiple points in the story she herself is aware). The male main doesn\'t change much, though our perception of him does.Overall, while this is an amusing show with nice art that I got a few laughs out of, I wouldn\'t rewatch it. Ao\'s tsun personality, her forced drama-inducing behaviour, her constant unpredictable emotional seesawing, her borderline abusive treatment of someone who loves her... I suspect this show is either written by a woman or aimed at women who like to fantasize about having a kind, handsome man who only cares about her and doggedly pursues her, no matter how much she rejects and slaps him away (even while other, less abusive women aggressively pursue them). There\'s nothing wrong with that, of course, it\'s just that you should know what it is before you watch it! It is certainly not the simple ecchi comedy I was hoping for. It is closer to a romantic drama with a female high-tsun-low-dere main, plus some comedic elements. I also noticed the show tries too hard (especially near the beginning) to be ""realistic"", raunchy, and edgy, which was as cringy as the forced drama and teen angst to me. I guess I just don\'t find that kind of thing interesting or funny, but I suspect there are many who might enjoy it.', ""Ao-chan can't study anime review.The series is about Ao who wants to get into a good university so she can move away from her father. Her father is an incredibly popular Erotica novelist and has no intention of hiding it anywhere. As such learning at a young age that her name A comes from apple and O comes from Orgy might not be such a great thing.Now as a highschooler she goes around hiding that whilst also having a cold atmosphere. She becomes a loner type person that gets really high grades. You've watched anime, you know the type. And this popular boy tries...to talk to her. So you have this relationship of a quiet girl and a forward boy (who's a virgin).Now due to her father she basically thinks all men are sex filled creatures and as such is a source of pressure in the relationship. She even doesn't like her own father and frankly neither do I. Her father is easily the worst character in the series sexually harassing his own daughter for a gag. It kinda sucks to be honest.The male lead is surprisingly different. He's popular for one thing. He's not an uber over the top nice guy. He's just him, and i like that. He feels a person in the series. It's not someone i can relate with, but he gives off a different enough vibe. Especially near the ending.Because of the female leads upbringing she basically is the one that's thinking of sex all the time. Or thinks that sex is all the boys are thinking of all the time. A lot of the gags base around her delusions and her being horny or her thinking everyone else is horny. And its funny. Some of it isn't. Some of it is great. It's like seeing a meme you know. Like definitely warrants some air through the nose and what not.The series also temporarily turns into Kaguya-sama for a second. Where the Male lead is desperate to making the female lead fall in love with her. The female lead is desperate to show that the male lead only wants her for sex, so he should do that so she can reject him. Those episodes were pretty funny.The romance of this series is also surprisingly fun. The characters are less infuriating than the average romance comedy.I think despite the relative fun i had for the series i don't really consider it anything special. Maybe after i finish reading the manga this could be a must read but as far as anime goes this falls into the fun watch but not must watch section. Which kinda sucks.I think with more variety in comedy and bolder characters this could've been something real special but your not missing anything if you don't watch this series. Which might be a bit harsh for the series considering i did call the characters non infuriating like most romcoms, but to be fair., most romcoms kinda suck ass anyway.

It was honestly closer to real situations than I expected so it is fair to claim that the fiction caught up reality.I absolutely need to cover one major point : the first episode clearly features a kind of ecchi show, which makes you think that the whole anime will be some sort of cute & perverted comedy with a background of love story. It won\'t......unfortunately the love story takes the role of major element while the sexual/pervert thema gets relegated to the very secondary elements. So basically if you wanted to watch it for all the sexual allusions or the perverted situations, please think twice.Though Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is not a complete love story show, it keeps the tiny ecchi mood and leaves some embarrassing situations or misunderstandings. But they all serve a purpose : demonstrating how it is easy to figure out things in your head while the reality in much more different.It somehow proves that your mind aren\'t as strong as your heart, despite all your efforts to restrain what you think is right for yourself.I honestly recognize that the love story meets a satisfying ending for the viewer but it still leaves me a taste of frustation. Indeed, most episodes are quite similar in their progress, with Ao-chan (the female protagonist) refusing that Takumi dates her despite his very positive aspects (a patient person, really heartful, honest etc). Claiming studies are her priority, she always rejects him & then regrets or hesitates about her own actions or feelings.The ending was really expected but the whole show always makes you wondering ""when do they finally kiss each other"". I mean, you know from the start that it\'s going to happen, but during 11 episodes you see Ao-chan denying the reality, hiding her true feelings, claiming her high-school studies are more important that real life events... I have met people like that and their lives looked so blank despite the studies.

Well, Kijima is not an example of a character, he is slow, half-assed, but hopelessly in love with Ao, the problem here is his lack of attitude, causing Ao to create expectations that will not be met, situations.

I think everyone who watches romance animes should definitely give it a go!', ""Ao-chan Can’t Study is the epitome of a romcom in a short series format done right. Even though it's a gag show that hinges almost entirely on slapstick comedy to stitch it's cliched plot threads together, none of its jokes run the risk of sounding repetitive or overplayed. While it is by no means a revolutionary romcom, it might well be the first in the realm of short, fast-paced comedy that doesn’t trade in length for substance.But what sets Ao-chan apart from the dumpster pile of typical romances? Allow me to demonstrate by using a scene from the series. In one episode, Ao’s father complains...about why his daughter has only served him a bowl of plain rice for dinner. Ao dismisses him, and begrudgingly reaches out for a packet of MSG, then sprinkles it over his sad excuse of a meal. Her father’s eyes twinkle in excitement, and he wolfs down his “dinner,” visibly satisfied.The takeaway: sometimes, all that’s needed to make a story work is to use what’s available, often hidden in plain sight. The answer lies in our female protag, Ao.Some might argue that having a female MC in a romcom doesn't count as a refreshing change of pace (we have the likes of Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun and Konobi, after all). But to be served up a romance from the POV of a girl who’s a lowkey perv isn’t only refreshing — it almost feels like a rebirth of the genre itself.Be that as it may, I’d like to point out that just like Ao’s packet of artificial flavoring, any improvements to the show are a cheap, last-minute recipe idea and fall short of delivering real romcom umami.STORYAo-chan Can’t Study revolves around its titular character, Ao Horie, the daughter of a renowned erotic novelist. She’s named after a Japanese sex pun (aokan translates to “outdoor sex”) and the sound a woman makes when achieving an orgasm.In a brief flashback in the opening scene of the anime, Ao shares this erotic tidbit of info as she introduces herself to her grade school classmates. She ends up teased by everyone in school and Ao throws herself into her studies, hoping she can one day enter a prestigious university far from the ridiculous antics of her father. Fast forward to the present day, and lo and behold: Ao is a straight-A student and misguided misandrist (“guys only want one thing and it’s freaking disgusting!”), who would much rather study than mingle with the pretentious crowd of “normies.”Everything changes when she’s approached by Takumi Kijima (Ao labels him “King of the Normies”), who takes a genuine liking to her. But Ao’s cloistered and misinformed upbringing lead her to believe that he wants nothing more than to get in her pants. It doesn’t take very long for Kijima’s kind nature to melt Ao’s jaded outlook on men, and she starts developing a distracting crush on him. And this brings the primary conflict into play: the actual title of the show.On paper, Ao-chan Can’t Study sounds nothing more than a generic plot tainted by idiocy. In fact, some may immediately write off the series as another sorry excuse for hypersexualized fanservice. I won’t lie, Ao-chan Can’t Study is plagued with light ecchi scenes (it’s what I dislike the most about this show, to be honest), but it manages to turn sex into a relevant plot point by exploring its impact on two curious teens without any experience in bed.Had this been any other anime with a standard length of 20 minutes per episode, I would have given this show a harsher score. But since Ao-chan only has a brief, 11-minute runtime, it deserves credit for successfully balancing script, pacing, and character development into a fairly entertaining story. In particular, it uses its compressed episode length to portray Ao in relevant (sometimes naughty) situations that challenge her to identify the difference between lust and love.The humor in this show is constructed around Ao’s knack for grossly misunderstanding the concept of sex and how it works, which she uses as a gauge to determine her compatibility with Kijima.In the second episode, for instance, when Ao hears a “big hands, big dick” rumor in school, she automatically assumes that Kijima’s athletic persona is enough reason for him to be XL-sized. Later on in the episode, she accidentally grabs Kijima’s hand and realizes how big it is. In a fit of self-consciousness, Ao tells Kijima that her downstairs department simply lacks the space for the size of his crotch. Without chemistry in bed, she claims that they should dash all hopes of their “relationship” working out as early as now. But Kijima assures her that it’s natural for people to have apprehensions about sex, and shares that he has insecurities of his own.The rest of the series follows a similar pattern of plot unraveling by way of busting “sex myths”, which serve to bring Ao and Kijima to a closer level of intimacy. The slapstick humor takes Ao’s ignorance lightly, and her overblown and eccentric reactions end up being legitimately funny.Score: 6/10CHARACTERSThe story unfolds from the perspective of Ao, who has lived her life covered by the white noise of eroticism. Her father’s career as a distinguished sex novelist has made her develop a cynical outlook towards men, which she views as mindless creatures driven solely by carnal lust. Even though she distances herself from the “normies” and has no interest in pleasantries, Ao is an object of curiosity among her peers, not disdain. In fact, her classmates look up to her because of her high grades, and this is exactly what draws Kijima to her in the first place.As a foil to Ao’s hardened, cynical nature, I found Kijima rather bland in comparison. He’s soft-spoken, good-manned, and too nice for his own good — basically your typical, lovable jock. It’s standard romcom fare, nothing new to see here.The distinct contrast in Ao and Kijima’s personalities work, and it makes sense that they’re attracted to each other. But Ao’s persona drastically changes after Kijima tells her that he’s a virgin.She automatically uses this grand revelation to her tactical advantage, convincing herself that she has gained the upper hand in their relationship. All of her repressed sexual desires from her childhood come bursting at the seams, and she turns into a sex-starved teen awash with delusions of erotic grandeur. She conjures up images where she subjects Kijima to her wildest fantasies, and devises all sorts of ways to seduce Kijima to get into bed with her. During a study session, she suggestively draws a curved graph in Kijima’s notebook resembling her tits, convinced it would turn him rock hard and go down on her.In other words, she turns into the very thing she hates: one of the “normies.”I consider Ao’s sexual awakening a double-edged sword. Even though it has given her an obvious confidence boost, it has turned her into someone who looks down on other people simply because they are a virgin. It doesn’t matter if she grew up in a toxic household — virgin shaming is virgin shaming. And it needs to stop.Don’t get me wrong: I have nothing against a perverted female lead. It’s exactly what makes this show so much more refreshing than your typical romcom. But an overactive libido and looking down on someone who chooses to abstain from sex (by a potential love interest, might I add) are two completely different things. So different, in fact, because even though we’re a slave to our urges, we can most definitely control how we react to them. And for as long as the world is round, shaming someone for their sexual choices will never, ever be acceptable.But for all my frustrations in Ao-chan’s virginity shaming issues, it still can’t hold a candle to the blazing conflagration that is Ao and Kijima’s chemistry. I’ve seen quite a number of romance anime, and there’s no couple as cute as these two (horny) lovebirds. Ao and Kijima are aware of their attraction to each other, and they share a mutual eagerness to please each other in bed. Despite Ao’s raging libido, however, they never really decide to casually hook-up because they’re sensible enough to acknowledge that neither one is emotionally and mentally prepared to take that next step in their relationship.Even though the story is rather rough around the edges, Ao-chan still manages to keep the narrative cohesive and well-paced. In fact, the series has a proper conclusion, and it doesn’t leave you in thematic limbo where you have no other choice but to track down the manga to find out how the ships sail.Other supporting characters include Ao’s father, who hilariously shifts from a careless, high-pitched voice during casual conversations with Ao to a mature, deep tone when dishing out sex advice to anyone within earshot. The rest of the other folks at school are forgettable, save for Ao’s childhood friend Miyabi who only exists to throw herself at Kijima and cause minor trouble.Score: 4/10ARTThe art in Ao-chan Can’t Study is amazing, and it's animated by Silver Link. The only other anime I’ve seen by their studio is Bofuri, and I was similarly impressed by its colors and designs. Each frame in this show bursts with color, giving the dull school scenes a vibrant, upbeat atmosphere.But what really makes the art stand out is its realistic and powerful depiction of facial expressions. The art isn’t carelessly done like the brief, comedic chibi inserts in Food Wars, which look like they’ve been drawn at the end of a weekly deadline. A lot of careful detail went into the show’s portrayal of character expressions. And rightfully so, as Ao-chan relies heavily on slapstick/reaction humor for its gags.As for character designs, Ao is best described as Sakura Matou from Fate: Stay/Night with better eye art (for real, I only picked up this show because I mistook the poster for a Sakura Matou spinoff). Meanwhile, Kijima reminds me of Mafuyu Satou from Given (seriously, put them side by side, there’s no difference). But despite their similarities to other characters, Ao and Kijima manage to stay distinct in their own right.The design for Ao’s father deserves a paragraph of its own, however. Unlike the rest of the characters, he’s portrayed as a funny looking, wide-eyed midget, and the way he’s drawn sticks out like a sore thumb. He sort of reminds me of Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura, but there’s nothing about him that’s funny or cute. He looks ridiculously out of place, and it cheapens the gravity of Ao’s childhood trauma caused by his perverted eccentricities.Despite the design inconsistencies, I’ll have to give points for how well-animated and thematically congruent the OP is to the overall theme of the show. Despite its short series format, the OP isn’t just some lame slideshow of its main characters (looking at you, JC Staff) and it succeeds in setting the right tone.Score: 7/10SOUNDThe OST for Ao-chan is bubbly and bright, as is expected from any romcom that we aren’t meant to take too seriously. During romantic scenes, however, it shifts to somber, acoustic medleys to set the right mood.But the best part of the sound is the show’s opening theme, which is a fucking banger. You know what, I encourage you to stop reading and listen to WONDERFUL WONDER by Edoga Sullivan. It’s addictive and catchy, and I’ve lost count of how many times I had to rewind the OP just to listen to the song. It’s currently my third favorite romcom OP after Rent-a-Girlfriend and Kaguya-sama: Love is War. The ED isn’t quite as good, but it’s just as upbeat as the OP.Score: 8/10ENJOYMENTAo-chan Can’t Study was a truly entertaining watch. It’s the perfect show to binge on a weekend, and gives me hope that not all short-form anime lack substance or any real plot. If only more shows followed its no-frills storytelling approach by using its limited runtime to its advantage, then I’d have significantly less shows on my on-hold list. Far too many shows drag on with needless exposition and character drama.With that said, I’ll be prioritizing other shows by Silver Link on my PTW just to gauge its ability to churn out quality content, regardless of genre. We need more shows like this.Score: 7/10FINAL VERDICTAo-chan Can’t Study is a short series ecchi romcom that uses its short length to deliver relevant gags that prop up Ao and Kijima’s love-lust relationship. It explores how sex influences the the dynamic of fresh-faced lovers without experience, portraying their apprehensions in an exaggerated yet realistic fashion.While ecchi scenes pervade the narrative, it shouldn’t put off viewers simply seeking fluff. After all, Ao and Kijima quickly graduate from their timid, kink-laced interactions and establish a somewhat stable foundation for a genuine relationship by the show’s end.FINAL SCORE: 7/10 about why his daughter has only served him a bowl of plain rice for dinner. Ao dismisses him, and begrudgingly reaches out for a packet of MSG, then sprinkles it over his sad excuse of a meal. Her father’s eyes twinkle in excitement, and he wolfs down his “dinner,” visibly satisfied.The takeaway: sometimes, all that’s needed to make a story work is to use what’s available, often hidden in plain sight. The answer lies in our female protag, Ao.Some might argue that having a female MC in a romcom doesn't count as a refreshing change of pace (we have the likes of Monthly Girls’ Nozaki-kun and Konobi, after all). But to be served up a romance from the POV of a girl who’s a lowkey perv isn’t only refreshing — it almost feels like a rebirth of the genre itself.Be that as it may, I’d like to point out that just like Ao’s packet of artificial flavoring, any improvements to the show are a cheap, last-minute recipe idea and fall short of delivering real romcom umami.STORYAo-chan Can’t Study revolves around its titular character, Ao Horie, the daughter of a renowned erotic novelist. She’s named after a Japanese sex pun (aokan translates to “outdoor sex”) and the sound a woman makes when achieving an orgasm.In a brief flashback in the opening scene of the anime, Ao shares this erotic tidbit of info as she introduces herself to her grade school classmates. She ends up teased by everyone in school and Ao throws herself into her studies, hoping she can one day enter a prestigious university far from the ridiculous antics of her father. Fast forward to the present day, and lo and behold: Ao is a straight-A student and misguided misandrist (“guys only want one thing and it’s freaking disgusting!”), who would much rather study than mingle with the pretentious crowd of “normies.”Everything changes when she’s approached by Takumi Kijima (Ao labels him “King of the Normies”), who takes a genuine liking to her. But Ao’s cloistered and misinformed upbringing lead her to believe that he wants nothing more than to get in her pants. It doesn’t take very long for Kijima’s kind nature to melt Ao’s jaded outlook on men, and she starts developing a distracting crush on him. And this brings the primary conflict into play: the actual title of the show.On paper, Ao-chan Can’t Study sounds nothing more than a generic plot tainted by idiocy. In fact, some may immediately write off the series as another sorry excuse for hypersexualized fanservice. I won’t lie, Ao-chan Can’t Study is plagued with light ecchi scenes (it’s what I dislike the most about this show, to be honest), but it manages to turn sex into a relevant plot point by exploring its impact on two curious teens without any experience in bed.Had this been any other anime with a standard length of 20 minutes per episode, I would have given this show a harsher score. But since Ao-chan only has a brief, 11-minute runtime, it deserves credit for successfully balancing script, pacing, and character development into a fairly entertaining story. In particular, it uses its compressed episode length to portray Ao in relevant (sometimes naughty) situations that challenge her to identify the difference between lust and love.The humor in this show is constructed around Ao’s knack for grossly misunderstanding the concept of sex and how it works, which she uses as a gauge to determine her compatibility with Kijima.In the second episode, for instance, when Ao hears a “big hands, big dick” rumor in school, she automatically assumes that Kijima’s athletic persona is enough reason for him to be XL-sized. Later on in the episode, she accidentally grabs Kijima’s hand and realizes how big it is. In a fit of self-consciousness, Ao tells Kijima that her downstairs department simply lacks the space for the size of his crotch. Without chemistry in bed, she claims that they should dash all hopes of their “relationship” working out as early as now. But Kijima assures her that it’s natural for people to have apprehensions about sex, and shares that he has insecurities of his own.The rest of the series follows a similar pattern of plot unraveling by way of busting “sex myths”, which serve to bring Ao and Kijima to a closer level of intimacy. The slapstick humor takes Ao’s ignorance lightly, and her overblown and eccentric reactions end up being legitimately funny.Score: 6/10CHARACTERSThe story unfolds from the perspective of Ao, who has lived her life covered by the white noise of eroticism. Her father’s career as a distinguished sex novelist has made her develop a cynical outlook towards men, which she views as mindless creatures driven solely by carnal lust. Even though she distances herself from the “normies” and has no interest in pleasantries, Ao is an object of curiosity among her peers, not disdain. In fact, her classmates look up to her because of her high grades, and this is exactly what draws Kijima to her in the first place.As a foil to Ao’s hardened, cynical nature, I found Kijima rather bland in comparison. He’s soft-spoken, good-manned, and too nice for his own good — basically your typical, lovable jock. It’s standard romcom fare, nothing new to see here.The distinct contrast in Ao and Kijima’s personalities work, and it makes sense that they’re attracted to each other. But Ao’s persona drastically changes after Kijima tells her that he’s a virgin.She automatically uses this grand revelation to her tactical advantage, convincing herself that she has gained the upper hand in their relationship. All of her repressed sexual desires from her childhood come bursting at the seams, and she turns into a sex-starved teen awash with delusions of erotic grandeur. She conjures up images where she subjects Kijima to her wildest fantasies, and devises all sorts of ways to seduce Kijima to get into bed with her. During a study session, she suggestively draws a curved graph in Kijima’s notebook resembling her tits, convinced it would turn him rock hard and go down on her.In other words, she turns into the very thing she hates: one of the “normies.”I consider Ao’s sexual awakening a double-edged sword. Even though it has given her an obvious confidence boost, it has turned her into someone who looks down on other people simply because they are a virgin. It doesn’t matter if she grew up in a toxic household — virgin shaming is virgin shaming. And it needs to stop.Don’t get me wrong: I have nothing against a perverted female lead. It’s exactly what makes this show so much more refreshing than your typical romcom. But an overactive libido and looking down on someone who chooses to abstain from sex (by a potential love interest, might I add) are two completely different things. So different, in fact, because even though we’re a slave to our urges, we can most definitely control how we react to them. And for as long as the world is round, shaming someone for their sexual choices will never, ever be acceptable.But for all my frustrations in Ao-chan’s virginity shaming issues, it still can’t hold a candle to the blazing conflagration that is Ao and Kijima’s chemistry. I’ve seen quite a number of romance anime, and there’s no couple as cute as these two (horny) lovebirds. Ao and Kijima are aware of their attraction to each other, and they share a mutual eagerness to please each other in bed. Despite Ao’s raging libido, however, they never really decide to casually hook-up because they’re sensible enough to acknowledge that neither one is emotionally and mentally prepared to take that next step in their relationship.Even though the story is rather rough around the edges, Ao-chan still manages to keep the narrative cohesive and well-paced. In fact, the series has a proper conclusion, and it doesn’t leave you in thematic limbo where you have no other choice but to track down the manga to find out how the ships sail.Other supporting characters include Ao’s father, who hilariously shifts from a careless, high-pitched voice during casual conversations with Ao to a mature, deep tone when dishing out sex advice to anyone within earshot. The rest of the other folks at school are forgettable, save for Ao’s childhood friend Miyabi who only exists to throw herself at Kijima and cause minor trouble.Score: 4/10ARTThe art in Ao-chan Can’t Study is amazing, and it's animated by Silver Link. The only other anime I’ve seen by their studio is Bofuri, and I was similarly impressed by its colors and designs. Each frame in this show bursts with color, giving the dull school scenes a vibrant, upbeat atmosphere.But what really makes the art stand out is its realistic and powerful depiction of facial expressions. The art isn’t carelessly done like the brief, comedic chibi inserts in Food Wars, which look like they’ve been drawn at the end of a weekly deadline. A lot of careful detail went into the show’s portrayal of character expressions. And rightfully so, as Ao-chan relies heavily on slapstick/reaction humor for its gags.As for character designs, Ao is best described as Sakura Matou from Fate: Stay/Night with better eye art (for real, I only picked up this show because I mistook the poster for a Sakura Matou spinoff). Meanwhile, Kijima reminds me of Mafuyu Satou from Given (seriously, put them side by side, there’s no difference). But despite their similarities to other characters, Ao and Kijima manage to stay distinct in their own right.The design for Ao’s father deserves a paragraph of its own, however. Unlike the rest of the characters, he’s portrayed as a funny looking, wide-eyed midget, and the way he’s drawn sticks out like a sore thumb. He sort of reminds me of Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura, but there’s nothing about him that’s funny or cute. He looks ridiculously out of place, and it cheapens the gravity of Ao’s childhood trauma caused by his perverted eccentricities.Despite the design inconsistencies, I’ll have to give points for how well-animated and thematically congruent the OP is to the overall theme of the show. Despite its short series format, the OP isn’t just some lame slideshow of its main characters (looking at you, JC Staff) and it succeeds in setting the right tone.Score: 7/10SOUNDThe OST for Ao-chan is bubbly and bright, as is expected from any romcom that we aren’t meant to take too seriously. During romantic scenes, however, it shifts to somber, acoustic medleys to set the right mood.But the best part of the sound is the show’s opening theme, which is a fucking banger. You know what, I encourage you to stop reading and listen to WONDERFUL WONDER by Edoga Sullivan. It’s addictive and catchy, and I’ve lost count of how many times I had to rewind the OP just to listen to the song. It’s currently my third favorite romcom OP after Rent-a-Girlfriend and Kaguya-sama: Love is War. The ED isn’t quite as good, but it’s just as upbeat as the OP.Score: 8/10ENJOYMENTAo-chan Can’t Study was a truly entertaining watch. It’s the perfect show to binge on a weekend, and gives me hope that not all short-form anime lack substance or any real plot. If only more shows followed its no-frills storytelling approach by using its limited runtime to its advantage, then I’d have significantly less shows on my on-hold list. Far too many shows drag on with needless exposition and character drama.With that said, I’ll be prioritizing other shows by Silver Link on my PTW just to gauge its ability to churn out quality content, regardless of genre.

I felt compelled to write it due to the other reviews on here. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this anime is very hit or miss due to it MC. The MC in this story is a girl who jumps to really terrible conclusions and constantly thinks poorly of the guy who's interested in her. If it wasn't for the other reviews being so poor I would've stopped a long time into the series (I wanted them to be wrong really badly, especially the feminist one). As the series went on I started to like the story a lot,...began to like the love interest and side characters a lot, but still didn't like the MC. But after the 9th episode I began to really like all of the characters and the anime overall. My overall rating of 7 is mainly due to how long it took for the anime to really get going. Now to make this review short and simple I'm just going bullet the main things about this anime that make it good/bad.Good:1. Great character development (specifically the MC).2. Great side characters that are fleshed out well.3. Shorter episodes that don't give a feeling of filler.4. Short intro song.5. Good intros and outros.6. Unique plot (or at least I've never seen it before).Bad:1. MC is really unlikable in the beginning (it gets better, but I wouldn't blame you if you stop watching immediately).2. Love interest is a cliche doormat for a large portion of the story.3. Side characters can sometimes be really over the top.4. Very little backstory.5.

Though when a popular and friendly Takumi Kajimi takes a interest in her, her world gets thrown for a loop!This is a very pure and wholesome anime, apart from the man child of a dad. I really enjoyed this, because as it does have lewd parts, fan service and a overall theme of sex and losing your virginity; there's a wholesomeness that these two have never really experienced love from another.I had a love, hate...relationship with Ao, I can understand how she's grown to hate men, as she's only seen them in a sexual light from her father. But the acts when she would reject Takumi, him being a good guy and accepting it, and then getting upset when he stayed away from her like she asked him to do. It's the equivalent of a girl saying she's down to eat anywhere, you take her somewhere and she gets upset that you didn't pick a different place. But other than that, I found her innocence and somewhat overthinking entertaining to watch.Takumi has to be my favourite character in this anime, hands down. He's a respectful guy, even though he's fallen for Ao, and keeps getting rejected and a million mixed signals from her. He never gets upset at her for not fully understanding her feelings, or  wanting to prioritize studying to get into a good university over having a relationship. I love being able to see him get all shy and flustered when with Ao, or talking with friends about how inexperienced he really is, going against the normal stereotype for him.Overall, I found this anime really funny, wholesome and enjoyable. Apart from the father, who I could care less of his character, as I felt the only times I could bare to see him on screen is when he was actually talking seriously and not in his child-whining voice. I would give this a 8/10 just because I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.

Ao-chan can’t study is a bit like that. It has no depth, no intellectual capital to draw you in, no sotry depth, it is not a show to think about, but just watch and be entertained.And it doesn’t pretend to be anything other than that. The series provides all the typical hallmarks of a show designed to appeal to the young male - bikini’s, people in various states of undress, awkward inappropriate touches and a blossoming love overlaid with sexual tension. Just the thing for filling in a...couple of free hours.This series had me wondering what kept me watching and not switching off as I have done with some series (Conception I’m looking at you). Simply put – its like any junk food craving – you don’t have to like all types of junk food and know it is bad for you, yet you still crave it. The craving desired by the caudate nucleus and satisfied through bursts of serotonin and dopamine due to the erotic visual stimuli is something I know I need from time to time. A break if you will from the often serious nature of reality.But I digress. The main protagonist Ao Horie is a girl conflicted. She is conflicted about her sexual desire which she been repressed due to the overt sexual nature displayed by her father. And conflicted by her desire to explore her repressed sexuality. Ao has a very immature approach to love and sex and despite purportedly being well read on the subject thanks to her father, lacks the proper emotional capital and maturity to explore said emotions.The love interest, Takumi Kijima, is about as 2D and wooden as you can get. He has no real personality, no background, no story and no development. He decides he loves Ao, and pursues her relentlessly, despite there being no chemistry between the two, no initial give and take to spark a connection. The relationship seemed very forced between the two, but despite that there will still moments of humor and I did want to stick around to see what happens. I think it also helped the episodes were only around 10 minutes in length – a typical junk food snacking time.So ultimately while I may disagree with the way in which Ao was portrayed (I thought it was unnecessary for her studies to suffer) and tough to watch Ao’s dreams slowly shift from focus and success to fulfilling carnal desire, it was entertaining. I enjoyed (albeit while cringing) the interactions between the two main characters and wanted to stick around to see if they started at third base or first. I thought the artwork for Ao was cute too – and that helped immensely.So would I recommend this? Well while this is a middle of the road anime, it is not without entertainment value.

Like it won't offend you and thankfully each episode is only 12 minutes long so it doesn't actually feel like a waste of time, even if it is. The problem being is that it isn't special in any way either.If you want to watch it, go ahead. It's just another popcorn show, if you...need something to kill time and you can't find anything else, at the very least it'll probably not bore you to sleep, you might just lose interest every once in awhile. need something to kill time and you can't find anything else, at the very least it'll probably not bore you to sleep, you might just lose interest every once in awhile."", 'I dont write reviews but i see too many people either blowing this anime out of proportion or not giving it enough credit. The show is very meh but not in the case where youll get bored mid way through but its interesting enough to watch. The main character is silly but they basically rely on the gag of misunderstandings which can feel stale after awhile. All the episodes are short so you wont get bored sometimes youll even want more! The main character really is the only interesting person besides her dad who just becomes kinda annoying after awhile. Overall if you dont know...what to watch this is a good show to pass the time. what to watch this is a good show to pass the time.', 'It can be a pain when you’re distracted from something you’ve been trying to put all of your focus on, but it’s even more of a pain when it’s your own thoughts that are distracting you. Trust me; I know from experience. I’m sure there is a certain anime girl who can vouch for me, with her sexual thoughts about a certain guy in her life, among other things, causing a distraction for her. I first became aware of the anime that this girl is in when it was still just a manga; I randomly read a few chapters of it and didn’t really think...much of it, not expecting that this completely random manga would one day get an anime adaptation, even if it was a short one. Since it did, however, I decided to give it a try.Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, I give you my review for the anime that shows us why Ao-chan Can’t Study! (No, really, that’s what the anime is called. It’s “Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai” in Japanese, though.)Ao-chan Can’t Study follows Ao Horie, a high school girl who hates her name and the fact that her father is an erotic fiction author. (“Make an AO face!” is what is referred to when it comes to why her father chose her name, although it is true that “ao” is actually Japanese for “blue”.) Desperate to go to a good university and get away from her father, she throws herself into her studies and avoids pretty much everything else, including boys. Enter Takumi Kijima, Ao’s classmate who just so happens to have a crush on her. Ao is unable to shake him off and finds herself constantly interpreting Kijima’s intentions as perverted. I guess her father’s influence really got to her, huh? Anyway, this anime follows the misunderstandings and awkward situations that Ao and Kijima get involved in.I’m just going to say it right now; do NOT watch this anime if you’re not into raunchy anime at all. Although it’s not as bad as anime like Shimoneta, there’s no question that this anime is cock-full - er, I mean chock-full - of dirty jokes. That said, though, the comedy is rather hit-or-miss; sometimes, it can make me at least close to laughing, and other times, it can just make me want to slap my forehead out of pure frustration. Comedy aside, the story can be quite predictable; if you’ve seen enough romantic comedies, raunchy or not, there is a chance that you’ll be able to predict what is going to happen.As for the characters....well, my thoughts on them are kind of complicated, especially when it comes to our leading lady, Ao Horie. On one hand, even if it has a tendency to waver, I admire her determination to get into a good university and achieve independence, but on the other hand, the fact that she always sees Kijima’s intentions in a perverted light, especially when they’re actually really pure, just makes me want to slap her. Her father is also someone I sometimes want to slap; he can be quite annoying, and it’s understandable that Ao doesn’t want to live under the same roof as him for any longer than she needs to. At the same time, however, there are times where it’s clear that he genuinely cares about Ao and wants the best for her, which is why I can’t really hate him. Oh, I haven’t mentioned Kijima yet, have I? I like seeing how much Kijima really cares about Ao, but other than that, nothing about his character really stands out that much. The side characters aren’t really that interesting, either.Now, Silver Link has done some excellent animation work over the years, and Ao-chan Can’t Study is no exception. No, it’s not the best animation I’ve ever seen, but the bright colors and character designs can be quite appealing. The voice acting is rather good, too; this is my first time hearing Azumi Waki’s voice acting, but if the way she conveyed Ao’s emotions is any kind of reflection of how she normally does as a voice actress, I look forward to watching other anime she voice acted in and hearing her voice. The first few seconds of the opening theme, “WONDERFUL WONDER” by EDOGA-SULLIVAN, is something that I swear reminds me of another song, but I can’t really think of what that song is; that aside, it’s a good song, although not one that I’d listen to on repeat. I feel the same way about the ending theme, “Koi wa Miracle” by Spira Spica, except without the “reminds me of another song” part.After Ao-chan Can’t Study came out, I happened to find many people who loved it and many people who hated it; as for me, I’d say that I’m in the middle. This wouldn’t be my first recommendation if you asked me to recommend a raunchy anime, but no one’s going to kill you for watching it.

The ecchi you'd expect from the premise does exist, but it mostly takes a backseat to developing the relationship between Ao & Kijima. The relationship between the two is developed well throughout the series, especially with the contrast between the horniness Ao usually expects from Kijima and his reluctance to deliver on expectations. The side characters are enjoyable as well, though Ao's dad comes off as a prick in the first episode; he gets better, though.In short, it's a solid rom-com with a heavier dose of nut material than usual....I recommend watching if the premise interests you.

The main girl is decent and she has her moments, especially the discussions with her dad being the highlight of my watch.  On the flip side the main guy is the generic good guy wholesome character type so he doesn't really add much to...the show.

I decided to binge the English dub of it this afternoon (since it's so short). The following is a brief review.Story: 6 - Nothing spectacular here. It's your basic high school rom-com story. It was an overall cute story about a high school girl growing up and realizing her feelings for a boy, even if her past caused her to misconstrue many different things that Kijima said or did. Overall, while not amazing, the story served its purpose.Art: 8 - I enjoyed the art overall. Ao is a very pretty girl and...is presented as such throughout the show. The art also supported some of the ecchi moments that appeared in the show. The environments were nothing special, but the lighting and atmosphere of some scenes made the scene better in my opinion, especially in the final episode.Sound: 7 - There's not much I can say about the sound. The English Dub for the characters was good. The music was average, and the sound effects were relatively normal. Not much else to say.Character: 7 - I enjoyed seeing the characters on screen. Ao and Kijima are a cute couple and have great chemistry. Unfortunately, Ao was unable to break out of the past that she grew up in (with a perverted father and all that), and her character wasn't able to build as a result. I also wish that the episodes were a bit longer, so more character development could occur. I expect that I will not remember much of this anime in a few weeks since none of the characters were very engaging. I did enjoy Kijima's character far more than I expected to, though. While Ao expected him to be a pervert and act like every other male anime protagonist ever, he was actually just a normal boy who liked a cute girl from his class. I felt as if I could relate to him in his struggle to get together with Ao, as it was a long and very difficult process. Ao was a cute character, even if she didn't have much character development.Enjoyment: 8 - Even with its flaws, I enjoyed my time with the show. I do not expect that I will remember it later, as I had said before, but for the few hours I spent with it, it was a funny and enjoyable ride.Overall: 7 - I think this a good show.

Koihime†Musou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4262/Koihime†Musou,"[""An anime adaptation of the eroge &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; which in turn is loosely based on the &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; novel, it takes a more novel and surprising approach than we are used to for anime series that are based on eroge. Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else."", ""Although i have only watch the first episode of Koihime Musou, this anime shows good potential to be an excellent anime to watch.  The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime. I was expecting something a bit more serious and action-packed but it turns out to be a funnier version of Ikkitousen with less service and less action. If you like girls and comedy then this is a title you shouldn't miss.The story is a joke. It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world. They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them.

I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating.

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot. Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters are vibrant and well-designed. Soundtrack? It\'s alright, does the job.So, if you\'re into a breezy, funny series with a bunch of cute gals, ""Koihime Musou"" might just be your cup of tea.

It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason. Although, the enjoyment is wonderful to watch, so if you want to watch the anime to find Cao Cao having some nice hot fun with her wife, Lady Bian, Cao Ren fingering her panties, Gan Ning getting slapped HARD in the back by Lu Meng? ... Don't watch it.Comedy? DO WATCH. It's FUNNY!For Anime loving sakes? Watch it."", 'Koihime†Musou is an adaptation of an H-game based on a gender-swapped Romance of the Three Kingdoms. You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit!

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

This anime could have been a lot better if the greatness of the action animation scenes is constant.The sounds are fine. The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting.

The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting. There's also this tiring trio of weak bad guys, which usually have roles of bandits. The trio appear a lot in the show and they're different people in each episode, meaning they haven't met with the main characters before.The story is not so good, The art is nice, the sounds are alright, the characters are funny and I enjoyed it a lot. It has a lot of flaws but it's still good comedy."", ""Koihime&dagger;Musou was an enjoyable to watch, but only for its comedy element.The story is loosely based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but it's pretty loose. The anime itself is mostly episodic scenes where Kanu travels across the land, defeating bandits and saving the day. Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories. The comedy was especially hilarious, although beware (or rejoice, depending on your tastes) most are in the form of sexual jokes and misunderstandings.I recommend watching Koihime&dagger;Musou if you're seeking for some lighthearted, action, comedy anime. balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED?

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience!"", ""Koihime Musou is a very light anime that doesn't requires the viewer to analyze much. At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else. she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

The jokes were good but it didn\'t quite catch the attention of the viewers.The artwork was fine but it was hidden by the bad quality. It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto. The characters just travel all around the country for...adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot). adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot).', ""An anime adaptation of the eroge &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; which in turn is loosely based on the &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; novel, it takes a more novel and surprising approach than we are used to for anime series that are based on eroge. Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea."", ""After the first two episodes, I felt like I had to force myself to continue watching.The story isn't very entertaining. It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off. The ecchi scenes, which I thought would be most of this series, didn't even feel ecchi.This definitely isn't one of the better animes but still most of the episodes weren't boring to watch. even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual.

But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED?

The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge).

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else. she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else."", ""Although i have only watch the first episode of Koihime Musou, this anime shows good potential to be an excellent anime to watch.  The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime. I was expecting something a bit more serious and action-packed but it turns out to be a funnier version of Ikkitousen with less service and less action. If you like girls and comedy then this is a title you shouldn't miss.The story is a joke. It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world. They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them.

I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct. I would say that the production team did some good job to try to maintain some of the 'essence' while covering the others.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone.

The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good.

Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED? JEEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh sorry, for my rage. I got so ANGRY when I saw a few of the characters OOC... UGH, I hate that! Although I like Cao Cao and Wen Chou (Bunshuu), WHY THE HELL IS YUAN SHAO (EN SHOU) ENEMIES WITH CAO CAO!?!?!? Shouldn't they be childhood effing FRIENDS???!?! UGH, then that ugly PIG, Lu Xun (Rikuson)... I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE LU XUN A SEXY ASS SMOKEY HAIRED, LAVA TRIMMED, HOT SUITED PYROMANIAC, BUT WHAT DO I SEE? SOME FAT ASS WOMAN WITH BIG ASS BOOBS!!! WHAT THE HELL!?!?!??!?!Okay, I'm DONE reviewing the characters, LETS CONTINUE BEFORE I SPITE MORE RAGE AT THE LACK OF EFFING CHA- OH NOW THAT BRINGED ME TO THAT!!!!Where the HELL is Guan Ping? Guan Suo? Guan Xing? CAO PI!?!?! I wanted to see MORE CHARACTERS, but do I? NO! I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason. Although, the enjoyment is wonderful to watch, so if you want to watch the anime to find Cao Cao having some nice hot fun with her wife, Lady Bian, Cao Ren fingering her panties, Gan Ning getting slapped HARD in the back by Lu Meng? ... Don't watch it.Comedy? DO WATCH. It's FUNNY!For Anime loving sakes? Watch it."", 'Koihime†Musou is an adaptation of an H-game based on a gender-swapped Romance of the Three Kingdoms. You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before.

They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them. This anime could have been a lot better if the greatness of the action animation scenes is constant.The sounds are fine. The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting. There's also this tiring trio of weak bad guys, which usually have roles of bandits. The trio appear a lot in the show and they're different people in each episode, meaning they haven't met with the main characters before.The story is not so good, The art is nice, the sounds are alright, the characters are funny and I enjoyed it a lot.

The anime itself is mostly episodic scenes where Kanu travels across the land, defeating bandits and saving the day. Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories. The comedy was especially hilarious, although beware (or rejoice, depending on your tastes) most are in the form of sexual jokes and misunderstandings.I recommend watching Koihime&dagger;Musou if you're seeking for some lighthearted, action, comedy anime. balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?!

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience!"", ""Koihime Musou is a very light anime that doesn't requires the viewer to analyze much. At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating. So yeah.', 'I recently checked out ""Koihime Musou,"" and I gotta say, it\'s pretty interesting. So, it\'s based on a game that\'s, uh, let\'s say, not exactly PG-rated. But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot. Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters are vibrant and well-designed. Soundtrack? It\'s alright, does the job.So, if you\'re into a breezy, funny series with a bunch of cute gals, ""Koihime Musou"" might just be your cup of tea. Give it a shot! about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

This was my number 1 expectation because I\'m a big fan of koei games. The jokes were good but it didn\'t quite catch the attention of the viewers.The artwork was fine but it was hidden by the bad quality. It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit!

Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED? JEEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh sorry, for my rage. I got so ANGRY when I saw a few of the characters OOC... UGH, I hate that! Although I like Cao Cao and Wen Chou (Bunshuu), WHY THE HELL IS YUAN SHAO (EN SHOU) ENEMIES WITH CAO CAO!?!?!? Shouldn't they be childhood effing FRIENDS???!?! UGH, then that ugly PIG, Lu Xun (Rikuson)... I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE LU XUN A SEXY ASS SMOKEY HAIRED, LAVA TRIMMED, HOT SUITED PYROMANIAC, BUT WHAT DO I SEE? SOME FAT ASS WOMAN WITH BIG ASS BOOBS!!! WHAT THE HELL!?!?!??!?!Okay, I'm DONE reviewing the characters, LETS CONTINUE BEFORE I SPITE MORE RAGE AT THE LACK OF EFFING CHA- OH NOW THAT BRINGED ME TO THAT!!!!Where the HELL is Guan Ping? Guan Suo? Guan Xing? CAO PI!?!?! I wanted to see MORE CHARACTERS, but do I? NO! I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So?

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge).

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else. she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea."", ""After the first two episodes, I felt like I had to force myself to continue watching.The story isn't very entertaining. It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off. The ecchi scenes, which I thought would be most of this series, didn't even feel ecchi.This definitely isn't one of the better animes but still most of the episodes weren't boring to watch. even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct. I would say that the production team did some good job to try to maintain some of the 'essence' while covering the others.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

UGH, then that ugly PIG, Lu Xun (Rikuson)... I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE LU XUN A SEXY ASS SMOKEY HAIRED, LAVA TRIMMED, HOT SUITED PYROMANIAC, BUT WHAT DO I SEE? SOME FAT ASS WOMAN WITH BIG ASS BOOBS!!! WHAT THE HELL!?!?!??!?!Okay, I'm DONE reviewing the characters, LETS CONTINUE BEFORE I SPITE MORE RAGE AT THE LACK OF EFFING CHA- OH NOW THAT BRINGED ME TO THAT!!!!Where the HELL is Guan Ping? Guan Suo? Guan Xing? CAO PI!?!?! I wanted to see MORE CHARACTERS, but do I? NO! I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason. Although, the enjoyment is wonderful to watch, so if you want to watch the anime to find Cao Cao having some nice hot fun with her wife, Lady Bian, Cao Ren fingering her panties, Gan Ning getting slapped HARD in the back by Lu Meng? ... Don't watch it.Comedy? DO WATCH. It's FUNNY!For Anime loving sakes? Watch it. instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED?

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct. I would say that the production team did some good job to try to maintain some of the 'essence' while covering the others.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge).

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else."", ""Although i have only watch the first episode of Koihime Musou, this anime shows good potential to be an excellent anime to watch.  The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime. I was expecting something a bit more serious and action-packed but it turns out to be a funnier version of Ikkitousen with less service and less action. If you like girls and comedy then this is a title you shouldn't miss.The story is a joke. It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world. They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating.

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot. Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters are vibrant and well-designed. Soundtrack? It\'s alright, does the job.So, if you\'re into a breezy, funny series with a bunch of cute gals, ""Koihime Musou"" might just be your cup of tea.

It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason. Although, the enjoyment is wonderful to watch, so if you want to watch the anime to find Cao Cao having some nice hot fun with her wife, Lady Bian, Cao Ren fingering her panties, Gan Ning getting slapped HARD in the back by Lu Meng? ... Don't watch it.Comedy? DO WATCH. It's FUNNY!For Anime loving sakes? Watch it."", 'Koihime†Musou is an adaptation of an H-game based on a gender-swapped Romance of the Three Kingdoms. You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit!

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

This anime could have been a lot better if the greatness of the action animation scenes is constant.The sounds are fine. The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting.

The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting. There's also this tiring trio of weak bad guys, which usually have roles of bandits. The trio appear a lot in the show and they're different people in each episode, meaning they haven't met with the main characters before.The story is not so good, The art is nice, the sounds are alright, the characters are funny and I enjoyed it a lot. It has a lot of flaws but it's still good comedy."", ""Koihime&dagger;Musou was an enjoyable to watch, but only for its comedy element.The story is loosely based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but it's pretty loose. The anime itself is mostly episodic scenes where Kanu travels across the land, defeating bandits and saving the day. Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories. The comedy was especially hilarious, although beware (or rejoice, depending on your tastes) most are in the form of sexual jokes and misunderstandings.I recommend watching Koihime&dagger;Musou if you're seeking for some lighthearted, action, comedy anime. balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED?

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience!"", ""Koihime Musou is a very light anime that doesn't requires the viewer to analyze much. At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else. she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

The jokes were good but it didn\'t quite catch the attention of the viewers.The artwork was fine but it was hidden by the bad quality. It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto. The characters just travel all around the country for...adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot). adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot).', ""An anime adaptation of the eroge &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; which in turn is loosely based on the &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; novel, it takes a more novel and surprising approach than we are used to for anime series that are based on eroge. Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea."", ""After the first two episodes, I felt like I had to force myself to continue watching.The story isn't very entertaining. It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off. The ecchi scenes, which I thought would be most of this series, didn't even feel ecchi.This definitely isn't one of the better animes but still most of the episodes weren't boring to watch. even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual.

But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED?

The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge).

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else. she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances.

It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else."", ""Although i have only watch the first episode of Koihime Musou, this anime shows good potential to be an excellent anime to watch.  The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime. I was expecting something a bit more serious and action-packed but it turns out to be a funnier version of Ikkitousen with less service and less action. If you like girls and comedy then this is a title you shouldn't miss.The story is a joke. It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world. They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them.

I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct. I would say that the production team did some good job to try to maintain some of the 'essence' while covering the others.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone.

The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good.

Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before.

The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?! EHEM, I DO NOT LIKE GAN NING (KANNEI) AS A COMMANDER!!! WHAT THE HELL? WHY DID YOU MADE GAN NING A SUPERIOR TO HER SUPURIOR LU MENG (RYOMOU)?!??! ARE YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY EFFING RETARDED? JEEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh sorry, for my rage. I got so ANGRY when I saw a few of the characters OOC... UGH, I hate that! Although I like Cao Cao and Wen Chou (Bunshuu), WHY THE HELL IS YUAN SHAO (EN SHOU) ENEMIES WITH CAO CAO!?!?!? Shouldn't they be childhood effing FRIENDS???!?! UGH, then that ugly PIG, Lu Xun (Rikuson)... I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE LU XUN A SEXY ASS SMOKEY HAIRED, LAVA TRIMMED, HOT SUITED PYROMANIAC, BUT WHAT DO I SEE? SOME FAT ASS WOMAN WITH BIG ASS BOOBS!!! WHAT THE HELL!?!?!??!?!Okay, I'm DONE reviewing the characters, LETS CONTINUE BEFORE I SPITE MORE RAGE AT THE LACK OF EFFING CHA- OH NOW THAT BRINGED ME TO THAT!!!!Where the HELL is Guan Ping? Guan Suo? Guan Xing? CAO PI!?!?! I wanted to see MORE CHARACTERS, but do I? NO! I only see THE ORIGINAL ONES!!BAKADA!!!Enjoyment - 8/10Although most of the other parts were crap (COUGHCHARACTERSCOUGH), I really enjoyed watching it. The comedy made me continuously laughing and some parts were extremely funny due to this. Ahh, I love how Ecchi animes make a smile come to my face :)So? Overall Score?I would give it a 10/10, but if they had imporved the characters and story, I'd rate it higher. So I rate it 3 for that particular reason. Although, the enjoyment is wonderful to watch, so if you want to watch the anime to find Cao Cao having some nice hot fun with her wife, Lady Bian, Cao Ren fingering her panties, Gan Ning getting slapped HARD in the back by Lu Meng? ... Don't watch it.Comedy? DO WATCH. It's FUNNY!For Anime loving sakes? Watch it."", 'Koihime†Musou is an adaptation of an H-game based on a gender-swapped Romance of the Three Kingdoms. You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated.

This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money.

They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before.

They just took things from there and then made a comedy, service anime with some respectable action here and there....It's like that but that's why it's funny so it's alright on my book.The art is one of the best points, good animation with very good character designs, well mostly very good character designs because I wasn't satisfied with all of them. This anime could have been a lot better if the greatness of the action animation scenes is constant.The sounds are fine. The music is s'orayt, not something you'd really want to hear a lot but it's alright, and I believe that all the voices of the characters are good.The characters, well, all of the girls have awesome points like being beautiful, having god-like skills or just being really funny. I liked most of the girls and that's the problem, I only liked most. Some were just lame, extra-like or annoyingly uninteresting. There's also this tiring trio of weak bad guys, which usually have roles of bandits. The trio appear a lot in the show and they're different people in each episode, meaning they haven't met with the main characters before.The story is not so good, The art is nice, the sounds are alright, the characters are funny and I enjoyed it a lot.

The anime itself is mostly episodic scenes where Kanu travels across the land, defeating bandits and saving the day. Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average,...balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party.Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories. The comedy was especially hilarious, although beware (or rejoice, depending on your tastes) most are in the form of sexual jokes and misunderstandings.I recommend watching Koihime&dagger;Musou if you're seeking for some lighthearted, action, comedy anime. balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead. Kazuto should also appear in this anime somehow. The next part should be atleast Cao Cao (Sousou) invading Yuan Shao (Enshou) @ Guan Du.Art - 10/10Although this anime lacks a good story, I love the artwork the creators did. Though, they could of done better.Sound - 9/10.I LOVE THE OP! Flower of Bravery is probably the best song I ever heard! I added it to my iPod.Character - 2/10WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY HERE?!?!?!?!

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience!"", ""Koihime Musou is a very light anime that doesn't requires the viewer to analyze much. At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

The characters are well animated, and the story seems interesting and full of potential.  I realize this is made after a hentai game, which make this anime more intrigung, but i have yet to see anything about the game as of yet.  Koihime Musou will surely be full of action and humor but the bottom line is if your looking for something new to watch, this will very likely be worth your time.Yea, i realize that i'm repeating myself...a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY. a little, but just WATCH IT &amp; ENJOY."", ""Koihime Musou is unexpectedly more of a comedy anime.

It's based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and it was supposed to be about a girl on a journey to find a way to change the chaotic, war-torn world.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either.Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating. So yeah.', 'I recently checked out ""Koihime Musou,"" and I gotta say, it\'s pretty interesting. So, it\'s based on a game that\'s, uh, let\'s say, not exactly PG-rated. But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot. Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters are vibrant and well-designed. Soundtrack? It\'s alright, does the job.So, if you\'re into a breezy, funny series with a bunch of cute gals, ""Koihime Musou"" might just be your cup of tea. Give it a shot! about the ladies and their interactions with each other.

This was my number 1 expectation because I\'m a big fan of koei games. The jokes were good but it didn\'t quite catch the attention of the viewers.The artwork was fine but it was hidden by the bad quality. It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

The other one was inaccurate.Story - 1/10Story doesn't make any sense at all. First, it should of started in the Yellow Turban Rebellion so we can atleast have a brief introduction of the characters. Second, I absolutely HATE, and yes, REALLY HATE, the settings of the story. I want to see Sun Jian (Sonken Bundai) in this, yet Sonsaku has to rule already. The HELL? The story should of started from there, and atleast, to Hu Lao Gate. It should of ended where Dong Zhuo turned out to have escaped, and Fan Chou was killed...instead.

You know, the epic Chinese tale set at the end of the second century AD. With just that much information, you\'ve probably already made an initial judgment of the series. So if you\'re not a fan of ero-games turned anime or the idea of historical generals re imagined as jailbait, Koihime won\'t do enough to convert you to the genre. If you read the description and thought, ""fanservice, lesbians, and ass-kicking!"" rejoice! For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be.

But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

Already quite different is the fact all of the famous characters from &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&rdquo; are female in &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo;.But instead of having a male lead character that all the female characters fawn over and desire to be with, the &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; anime forgoes this classical harem and omits the male lead character from the eroge. The anime focuses more...on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships. Though most of the yuri related scenes are either humoristic in nature or pure fanservice, at no time are serious bonds or relationships really thoroughly explored save for the bond of sisterhood that forms between Kan'u and Chouhi.From the yuri related scenes, Kan'u is the appealing victim of most, whether she's being teased by Chouun, embarrassed by Chouhi or openly pursued by Sousou. As the series progresses, the viewer can't help but wonder who will try to go after Kan'u next or which yuri joke will befall her.That being said, &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; still focuses mainly on the humour and situations the characters find themselves in. While there is a certain amount of action it's primarily used for the overarching plot of Kan'u trying to bring more peace to the people and as such does not play a pivotal role.&ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is really all about cute girls sharing laughs on their journey together.As such, the series is also mostly episodic with each episode telling a tale of how Kan'u and her travelling party befriend someone new, defeat a foe encountered on their path or have other adventures. This goes from working at a restaurant to participating in a martial arts contest, an eating contest, fighting bandits, solving a kidnapping case,...Next to Kan'u, the series revolves mainly around her companions Chouhi, Koumei, as well as Sei and Bachou when they are present in her party. I had hoped Ryofu would play a bigger part but alas she was only featured briefly.Although Sei is featured in many episodes, during the latter half she strays from Kan'u's party and appears less which is a shame since her character's interaction with Kan'u is always a hoot.Except for some of the main characters like Chouhi, Koumei and Bachou, most of the girls do not especially have any meaningful character evolution and as such they seem to remain rather superficial characters since there's little chance to really delve into their pasts or personae. But given the nature of the series, a relaxing comedy rife filled with attractive girls, this isn't really bothersome.The final episodes sees Ryuubi, the only male character appear, but although he seems to be able to seduce Kan'u at first he ends up earning her wrath and quickly flees. Perhaps this can be seen as some sort of hint that Kan'u ends up choosing the life where she can travel and live with her female companions where no man's love is welcome or needed? Who knows... but in the spirit and atmosphere of the series, this leads to a very fitting conclusion.Animation throughout &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; is quite good and many episodes feature scenes that represent the characters in a cute chibi form, the same as in the episodes' ending sequence. All of the female characters are portrayed with unique hairstyles and lavishly decorated and coloured outfits. The cast is physically diverse, from tall, long haired beauties with (very) large bosoms to smaller, flat chested girls. No doubt to cater the different tastes of the audience.Since the series focuses on the girls, they receive the best animation and detail treatment, usually a feast for the eyes!The soundtrack is average, it supports the series nicely and the more upbeat opening song and cute ending track are an indication the series is all about watching cute girls and having lots of laughs without being about anything too serious or dramatic.If you're looking for a nice comedy rife with cute maidens that also offers a zest of shouju-ai/yuri, then this series may certainly be a worthwhile viewing experience! on Kan'u Unchou and the many other girls she encounters and befriends on her journey to bring peace throughout the war torn and crime infested lands.A nice change from the many harem series out there and with its all-female cast &ldquo;Koihime Musou&rdquo; pulls the card of comedy and suggested shouju-ai or yuri relationships.

At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai.The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits...she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them.Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story.All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly.The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little!The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan.

Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace.The art and sound were decent.

For this anime delivers on those promises.Koihime†Musou knows what kind of show it is and it makes...the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone. Above all, this means that it looks incredible. Character designs are a colorful mix of greens, pinks, light blues, and yellows. The outfits worn are elegant, sexy, and highly detailed, even during combat sequences. The fight scenes, also are surpassing in quality, with a level of fluidity in movement that shows the animators took pride in their work. Intended to be eye candy, Koihime is a great big bar of chocolate. Of course, that level of quality can\'t be maintained through the entire episode, so the animation will at times switch to super-deformed designs with simplistic backgrounds. These SD sequences, however, are used to great effect in the comedy portions of the show and are thus easily forgiven.The comedy of Koihime is another of its strengths. The show is able to handle both playfully silly situations, such as Chouhi\'s overly energetic antics, and the more risqué banter of characters familiar with physical intimacy, which find frequent fodder in Kan\'u and Chouhi\'s pact of sisterhood or Kan\'u\'s virginity. The writers also know how to use a joke multiple times but still recognize when to stop before it has worn out its welcome. The bit about Kan\'u being known as the ""beautiful bandit hunter"", for instance, is used frequently in the first few episodes, but stops appearing before it becomes tiresome.Since the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is such a widely known and adapted work, the characters don\'t require the same kind of exposition as if this were an original franchise. The show does provide a little backstory for some of the more notable figures and a couple episodes are devoted to character development, but those familiar with the original material or some of its derivatives will easily be able to pick out a good number of the characters based on a few traits or whom they associate with. Indeed, the difficulty in this situation becomes how to make these personalities stand out from the numerous other variations while remaining true to the spirit of the individual. Koihime†Musou requires maybe a little leniency on faithfulness, but this is acceptable when the reduction in enmity between the historical players creates the more interesting interactions that make the show enjoyable.The plot of this anime may be its weakest point. While the original Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a sweeping epic of war and political intrigue, Koihime is an episodic adventure. Characters will join with Kan\'u on her meandering journey for a few episodes, and then part ways, perhaps returning again later. There is a small spattering of intrigue, but aside from the nonspecific threat of bandits roaming the countryside, nothing really approaches an overarching story. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that; many shows try to be something grander than they are meant to be and turn out less because of that, so Koihime†Musou avoiding that pitfall is a good thing. There are a small handful of episodes that hold messages about trying one\'s best and the importance of friendship, but these are mostly the episodes in which Kan\'u meets the characters that stay with her for longer parts of the series, so the moral isn\'t overbearing. The final couple episodes do get a little more serious than most of the rest of the series, but even if that were a bad thing, it is easily justified by the final battle (which features two highly recognizable badass moments) and a very entertaining plot twist.Koihime†Musou is not a deep series, and it is better for not trying to be. It is a comfort food, like marshmallows. Big, fluffy marshmallows. the effort to please its target audience rather than try to stretch itself to appeal to everyone.

Big, fluffy marshmallows.', ""I decided to pick up Koihime Musou since I enjoy fantasy adventure series, and it looked like it might also fit in with the part of me that enjoys ecchi comedies as well. But it was definitely not what I was looking for.After watching the first 5 episodes, I found myself trying to find other things to do on my lunch breaks, and I only watched the next 5 out of what felt like an obligation to get though what I was hoping to be a lull in the series.Characters:I think one of the drawing factors of the anime was the variety of characters, each...of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty. I was hoping for an equally varied group of personalities, but I felt like they all had a lot of the same basic characteristics: a sense of justice, no blood family left, desire to be great, jealousy, trying to compensate for insecurity. I suppose the set of characteristics can make the characters quite real, but I'd like a little more in the mix. Also, aside from Kan'u there is almost no deep development of the characters based on events that transpired before the present.Story:The story really disappointed me. Everyone's on a mission to rid the world of all bandits, yet it seems all they do is scare away or run off a group of bandits from a city, and then leave it. Leaving the inhabitants of the city to now fend for themselves again with further enraged bandits. Furthermore, the characters seem to have almost no interest in joining together for their common goal. Someone will inevitably leave or abandon the group for whatever reason they feel. After a little while, the story begins to feel repetitive. Stumble across people in need. Help them solve their problem. Drive away the evil. Repeat.Drama:With a cast of all female main characters, I was hoping for a bit more drama to the series. I feel like there was more drama between characters in KissXSis (which, I by no means consider to have a deep story). It can be argued that there are never guys present, so that sort of sexual or relational drama would naturally be absent, but there certainly seems to be an attempt at drama through the insinuations of various lesbian relationships. Even so, all these relationships seem to be either very one-sided, or so consensual that there's no tension in the relationship at all. The times that any kind of relationship is alluded to, it is made to be a joke, either on behalf of, or at the expense or an uninterested, or unknowing character. None of the main characters seem to express any desire to be in a relationship with anyone else, be it purely physical, long-term or just to bide the time.Overall I feel like the show:* lacked the continuous action to really be an action series* lacked a solid story or goal to be a decent adventure* failed to provide reasonable drama or relationships between characters.just not my cup of tea. of whom seemed to have their own type of weapon of specialty.

It's just a journey of a couple of female warriors. You'd expect some battles but no. There are a few but those are really badly animated. One person swings a lance (too slow to be realistic) and another flies away. This reminded me of the fact that this anime was originally a visual novel.The dialogue can sometimes be funny but the humor is usually too obvious. A few episodes ended with everyone laughing. That just seems so unrealistic and the thing they're laughing about isn't...even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off. The ecchi scenes, which I thought would be most of this series, didn't even feel ecchi.This definitely isn't one of the better animes but still most of the episodes weren't boring to watch. even that funny.The art isn't bad but like I said above, the animation can be a bit off.

(As the Visual Novel is rated 18+ (PC) and 15+ (PS2))Still, it contain quite a handful of iichi stuff and some erotic scenes in yuri terms. Still it kept some original parallel concept on the 'Three Kingdoms Novel' - E.g. in the original Three Kingdom, Sou Sou (Cao Cao) has a vision/dream of 'collecting' the most beautiful women from around the Han world to himself, while the Visual Novel version also has the same vision/dream, but in a 'different' manner as...she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct. I would say that the production team did some good job to try to maintain some of the 'essence' while covering the others. It is entertaining and enjoyable. she is a she.Nether the less, the storyline are straight forward and direct.

I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since.I personally don\'t know what\'s up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It\'s probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically...correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I\'m not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.)It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime.But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn\'t give it such a horrible overall rating. So yeah. correct and make more money.

But here\'s the twist: all the characters from that game, who are originally from the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" novel, are now ladies.The main story revolves around this gal named Kan\'u Unchou and her crew of fellow females. They\'re on a mission to bring some peace to a world that\'s basically tearing itself apart with war.Now, what sets this anime apart from your typical harem show is that there\'s no dude at the center of attention. It\'s all...about the ladies and their interactions with each other. Sure, there are some scenes that hint at romantic stuff between them, but it\'s mostly played for laughs or, you know, fan service.Each episode kinda stands on its own, telling a little story without relying too much on the overarching plot. Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters are vibrant and well-designed. Soundtrack? It\'s alright, does the job.So, if you\'re into a breezy, funny series with a bunch of cute gals, ""Koihime Musou"" might just be your cup of tea.

This was my number 1 expectation because I\'m a big fan of koei games. The jokes were good but it didn\'t quite catch the attention of the viewers.The artwork was fine but it was hidden by the bad quality. It was a little hard to understand what was going on and to read the subs.Character Development needed work.If I were to relate it to another anime I\'d say it\'s kind of like Pokemon Kanto. The characters just travel all around the country for...adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot). adventure in preparation for the next gym battle, except that this show doesn\'t have ""gym battles"" (main plot).']"
