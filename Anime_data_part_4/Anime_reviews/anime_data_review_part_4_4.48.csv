Bokura no Nanokakan Sensou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37828/Bokura_no_Nanokakan_Sensou,"[""I don't write reviews often, but I feel like this film needs one.I watch so much anime (tv and films) that it's not often I get into a film and have it surprise me multiple times in a row. For one, the description really doesn't tell you anything about the film much besides that the run away for 7 days.Another thing is the characters all seem like stereotypes of anime that we know (and love) but they become so much more real and deep than that as the film progresses. Multiple issues are tackled as well: home life, social life, ethnicity, sexuality, love,...etc. And it's all done in a respectful manner.The film itself isn't very groundbreaking, but it certainly makes you feel included, whether you're a teenager now or an adult already. (A lot of adults in the film also related to the MCs which was nice too.)I won't spoil anything, but I certainly was surprised by some reveals, and I loved that the film didn't hold back for them.I hope everyone, especially with the current climate, will give this film a chance -- even if only for a rainy day. It's sweet and makes you feel warm and fuzzy at the end (after some hardships of course), so what have you got to lose? etc. And it's all done in a respectful manner.The film itself isn't very groundbreaking, but it certainly makes you feel included, whether you're a teenager now or an adult already.

Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.My Score: 3/10 (Bad anime)Reading time: 2 minutes readReview:The story premises are some normal stuffs that happened everyday everywhere amplified tens if not hundreds times more…or so was the plan. The story filled with satire in the half latter of the show, which have the potential to be good, but unfortunately it’s too late. It’s introduced a bit too late into the show and therefore they need to compressed it to how...many minutes left in the movie, and therefore I feel it’s a bit rushed, although I get the message, I only get the gist of it instead of a clear message. The various action scenes throughout the shows emphasized itself to be as realistic as possible while actually it’s totally wrong and unrealistic (oh, the irony). Many plot holes are presented in this anime, and the main thing that I feel like everyone should know is that there’s lack of (if there’s even any) consequences ever happened to anyone in this show, which once again goes against the realistic approach this anime take…The visuals might be the only one worth praising from this movie, especially the background, the building, the machinery, everything were of high quality and they maintained such standard throughout the whole movie. The same can’t be said for the character designs though, it’s generic of average quality, and they do drop their quality from time to time, I wonder how the consistency can differ this much when everything except the characters maintained consistent quality. The animation are okay, it’s fluid with a bit note here and there due to unrealistic physics, but since most of this small errors are wrapped during the action scenes, I doubt most of the viewers will even notice it.The musics are something, for real, it’s just unfortunately in a bad way, the build up in some scenes are great, the visuals looked way better in this specific scenes, and then by the time it should hit me the hardest, the songs throw some empty punch to my face, it’s so disappointing, it’s dragging this show even more with every songs it introduced. The sound effects are the competitor for the worst part of this anime, one of the many examples I can throw is this: how would you imagine the sound of a group walking through a big empty abandoned coal mine? The sound effect for this exact scenario could be everything, but definitely not the one in this movie, many more examples spread throughout this anime that I’m just not bothered to list every single one of them. The seiyuu? Generic and bland are all I can say, they’re not that bad per se, but definitely need more training to not sounds like a soulless robot.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-A short movie where you need to turn off your brainReasons NOT to watch:-A confusing story that might taken the wrong way due to the satire-A show that tried so hard to be realistic but it became so unrealistic-Plot holes everywhere!-An underwhelming inconsistent visuals many minutes left in the movie, and therefore I feel it’s a bit rushed, although I get the message, I only get the gist of it instead of a clear message.

The film itself felt like an odd mixture between the aesthetics between Your Name, and some random melodrama. Overall however, the entire film was incredulously boring, and honestly uninspired.Story: 4This was an incredibly uninspired story, with many contrivances, and a particular deus ex machina sequence that made me literally want to cry for all of the wrong reasons. Furthermore, the presentation of the story felt incredibly off due to its constant montage sequences. Through these sequences, the film felt more like a summary of a film, rather than a film itself. Overall, generic, boring, and honestly uninteresting.Art: 7The art...in this film was acceptable. Some of the shots were actually quite well done.Sound: 4The soundtrack of this anime was just generic j-pop music. Never really tried or attempted anything interesting, or further thematic with the film, making this soundtrack bland and boring.Character: 3This was honestly the worst portion of the show. The characters themselves, outside of a few set hobbies and the basic structures of a personality, had some of the worst chemistry ever. Most of the scenes felt like listening to chalk on a whiteboard.Enjoyment: 4Nothing really to say here that I haven't said above. Incredibly boring and generic.Overall: 4This was incredibly tiring film. With character writing that made me literally want to scratch my eyes out and sequences of events that constantly made me feel disappointed, this film gets a low 4/10. in this film was acceptable.

The main point of the movie was to tell people to be true to their feelings but I think I heard about this before already. I think this movie is more pointed towards children that wants to quickly grow up to be an adult, but first they need to know what is an adult really is.I recommend this to people who like high schoolers going on adventures.I forgot to mention but I'm sure not all...adults in reality are like the adults in the movie, i think this is one of the reasons why this movie has such a low rating. I don't know since i didn't read the most of the other reviews.I'm not certain why the rating was pretty low but I want to change that, so if you free time please take a look at it. adults in reality are like the adults in the movie, i think this is one of the reasons why this movie has such a low rating.

The review is spoiler free, so feel free to read it even before watching.I'll start with a small notice – I feel like there are 2 major approaches to this movie and I'm going to describe it from approach which I took, but I also can understand why a lot of people will probably disagree with my point of view. So yeah, you can obviously watch it as all other movies and rate it based on same criterias, but hey! This one has some cool origin, so...I think this is the one thing thats worth to know!Lets start with a small backstory – the movie itself is based on the quite old live action movie from 1988 (which is based on the novel written by Osamu Soda) and it tries to refresh concept while maintaining the same vibes and fundamental thesis as the novel and live action movie. It should be noted as well that premise of the story should be treated with a grain of salt – there are obviously some plot holes and thinking like „why these kids aren't even thinking about the consequences of their actions” is not entirely wrong way of thinking, but its also unfitting for these kind of movies. A lot of decisions in the show can be perceived as taken out of reality but it fits into the atmosphere of the original novel and its reception for those old times. Young japanese people in 80s were very calm and innocent, so the novel and live action of this highlighted kinda unknown and unfamiliar image to them.Okey, so it wasn't a short introduction but let's move on. I know that a lot of reviewers like to cut the review into a smaller segments like “Plot” or “Characters”, but I feel like all these things are connected so tighly that it doesn't make sense to do this, so I'll just talk about it in my own style.The whole of the story is quite simple – it follows a bunch of kids (okey, highschoolers, but “kids” is more relevant, taking into account the context and story), not necessarily friends, that decides to start a small revolution against adults. The kids-adults interactions are strongly highlighted cause the whole point of story is to showcase some differerences in point of view between kids and adults and to (obviously!) make the thesis that becoming adult is not necessarily something good and desirable. The group barricades themselves in an abandoned factory and begins to fight not only with adult tyranny, but also with its own past and feelings so they won't end up in the same way as bad adults. The important character in this fight against own weaknesses is thai child which the characters decides to protect. The character development here is not that constant and stable as you may know from new movies – it takes more gradual approach, giving us a bunch of new informations from time to time, which marks the next turning points of the story. This character development is best manifested through responses and behaviour of characters – how they approach and react to these not necessarily positive external factors, how they interact with each other and how they want to fit themselves in this group. Considering the length of the film and the size of the group , they did a really good job of sketching the profiles of each character and describing them.Another important point is the presentation of an adult point of view along with how they approach the current problem and how to deal with it. There are quite few important adult characters here and and each of them complements the adult image depicted by movie. Whats noteworthy is that the family interactions are also considered here as kid-adult interaction which deepens the outlined differences of both  'worlds'.Personally speaking, I found all these characters likeable and I was able to become familiar with most of them – each of them shows different personality, although they are well known in anime industry, but I don't think that it's bad in itself. The movie contains several unexpected plot twists (one of them should be used A LOT more in the anime overall but hey, what do I expect...) which were particularly interesting, but I found myself very captivated how well they changed the atmosphere between comedy and drama parts. This movie even had a small reference to live action movie, it felt good to catch this reference!The technical part of the review is not something that I'm fond of, but I'm going to praise the seiyuu for how well they showed the characters emotion. Soundtrack was also fitting for this show. Art obviously wasn't Shinkai-tier, but the characters designs, backgrounds and details were drawn nicely and neatly.Well, thanks if you made it to the very end of this review and I hope that I was able to provide you some good backstory information about this movie and how this rather specific movie should be approached in my opinion. Of course you can rate it based on your own criterias and whatever you want, but I think that its cool to know the origin of the show and take this into consideration!

So yes the guys must carry the bags but I should really like a boyfriend to carry my stuff to. Carring on:The narrative gravitates around some nice perspective: submission to the norms, pliability to the status quo and yes, lots of hormones. The shonen who wants to declare his love...to his kindergarden crush is there and we can expect all of the clichés we love so much.All the fantasies I had as a adolescent otaku became some well done anime - and the rigorous anime-fan in his 30s is pleased with the production.Listen, I'm brazilian in bolsonaro's government, so I MUST alienate myself from this dull reality.

That\'s literally my first thoughts upon the premise of the movie [specially the part where they all hold hands while standing atop of the abandoned building].I know for myself that I\'ve watched tons of anime movies nor series, so my taste of plot is kinda above average. But damn, I thought this movie would just be a shadow of other popular released anime movies.Halfway through the movie, it feels like it\'s kinda rushed, knowing the series of events differ in each day portrayed. But hell, the idea about the characters made me feel like...""Damn I wish I had friends like those"". Well, I do but not that kind of open and stuff.So basically, the movie was directly making us realize whether you\'re a teen nor an adult towards what we call (y o u t h). It all attacks in all aspects and angles of the way we perceive and live life [specially in our own rebellious phase]Oh wait, it was never a phase because the youth was there with us right from the start and it\'s up to us to grab it within our reach.Tho damn, well I had my own share of experiences going out with friends to the point of lying to our parents or guardians but this movie just gives me a feeling that I was part of their adventure as well. I see myself in every character in the movie.Overall it\'s a pretty good movie, the plot wasn\'t that majestic as you want it to be but it got a pretty damn attack that you can\'t defend.

I thought it's just your typical adventure slice of life anime movie but after the second half it gets more interesting specially with it's plot twist! It shows you many circumstances like family problems, ethnicity, sexuality, politics, etc.... I was surprised with the OST and thought it would be some mellow feels one but what I got is something that gets your blood pumping. xDIt's a must watch for sure! 8/10! would have been a 9 for me it it were a bit longer and if they...show what happened to the end. show what happened to the end."", ""This was an exceptionally well done movie in terms of directing. It's simple, but it flows so well - the visuals, the music and the characters are engaging and they never stop for a moment.It's the kind of movie you need to see through the eyes of a kid. Like they said, one of their best quality is they never give up on what they think is right. It made me remember my childhood, all the things we've done together and some of then may have been stupid, but we never once doubted that we're right and the grownups are not.An important realization, which they...didn't say out loud, was that Honjou was wrong when he said the internet exposed the truth about each of them. Under the circumstances, those were lies and the real truth came out through the bonds they formed together.The picture with Tamasurade, which I assume was from the student protests from the late 60's (she didn't look that old though), was a nice touch. Especially in today's apathetic world it's important that young people fight for what they think is right. They might not achieve what they set out to do, but they can still change the world in some capacity.The only place this movie stumbles in - and unfortunately falls right flat on its face - is the romance department towards the end! To pull off this kind of bait & switch, the movie would need to have an entirely different structure and a longer runtime. I'd really love to rate it higher, but I had to call bullshit at this point. didn't say out loud, was that Honjou was wrong when he said the internet exposed the truth about each of them.

The animation and art styles are akin to Summer Wars and Bakemono no Ko, which are very fluid and enjoyable. That was already a plus for me.The synopsis is a bit misleading. Honestly, it was a whirlwind of adventure from beginning to end. The first half was like watching Home Alone. There\'s only so much you can fit into a 90 minute feature film, so the plot might feel rushed but I believe it was done in a manner that wrapped up the film nicely. It especially was able to address some themes...that really encapsulates ""youthful privilege"" as the movie likes to put it.While the first half seems like a lot of fun, the latter half focuses more on the characters and the group dynamic. We don\'t get much background information on them, but the relationships between them unfold throughout the film so that we understand them more.Overall it\'s a really enjoyable movie, where the story is continuously told and there isn\'t a pause on the plot twists, emotions, or comedy. It\'s like a coming of age story, and this trope was done well given its parameters. that really encapsulates ""youthful privilege"" as the movie likes to put it.While the first half seems like a lot of fun, the latter half focuses more on the characters and the group dynamic.

And that, I think you will get it, is a pretty average summary of it.I liked this movie: it\'s 87 minutes of fun, a very simple story of rebellion of the youngsters against the adult, a celebration of youth itself and a satire of the japanese society. If the production wanted to give us just this - a regular movie to turn off the brain and have fun for a hour and a half - then, they did it. Bravo. But if they think they...made a good movie, like Penguin Highway, they\'re wrong.Seven Days War is about Mamoru, a shy boy who is in love with Aya, a schoolmate. One day, he finds out that she will leave the small town they live in for Tokyo, because of his father\'s job. She, however, disagrees, but her father not only doesn\'t listen to her, but also treats her poorly, thinking that she should just obey him, since adults obey their superiors. So she and Mamoru escapes for her last seven days in town in a dilapidated factory with some friends. Here, however, they found out that a young illegal immigrant is living there.The biggest problem with the movie is that I don\'t give a damn about his character. I could understand Mamoru, but all the others are as interesting as a chair, and that\'s a shame, because I think that they could have given them much more space. If the movie had last 110 minutes, maybe we would have had better characters, that around the end, when an ""important moment together"" happens, we would have actually cared about. Instead, we have them just doing regular things until the end, and ""that"" moment seems much less important.  The plot, in itself, is interesting, but with this cardboard characters, is it really worth a watch? Even the arts and the animations are not that great, there are TV Animes that are far more interesting.I don\'t want to be too harsh on the movie, because in the end I had fun, I was actually entertained, but if I go a little deeper, I found nothing worth of note. made a good movie, like Penguin Highway, they\'re wrong.Seven Days War is about Mamoru, a shy boy who is in love with Aya, a schoolmate.

It's been awhile since the last time I made a review but I decided to make a review of the 5th season though it's not really that worthy in my opinion.Basically, the main formula for this season is the recurring or should I say the over recurring characters from previous seasons. Well, they're great and kids will just happily celebrate it with their new shiny bey, yippey. The minor part is of course the new characters that appear and maybe should take a major portion in the new season. But yeah, whatever, the decision is not mine to make to begin...with.

Now one thing to note, since the manga is monthly, the anime takes its own take on the major points of the manga, so although there isn\'t filler per say, it\'s just all anime canon. Beyblade Burst Sparking is the 5th season of Beyblade burst, and I believe it actually holds up really well compared to other anime outside of toy based anime for one reason alone. I\'ll get to that later.Plot: 6The plot is kind of the...down side to this season, the first half is basically meet the bladers, then tournament arc, then another one. The first tournament arc was decent but not really that good. It doesn\'t hold up to the past tournament arcs like the God Blader\'s Cup, or the nationals. However, it set\'s up interesting character dynamics between the returning cast.Sound: 5ForgettableCharacters: 8The cast for burst is very likeable, although the two new main characters are kind of annoying, they have been fleshed out decently well. We got to see the season tackle a concept that has only kind of been done in season 2, this concept being an inferiority complex. Shu kurenai had one in season 2, and used it to become Red-Eye, and in this season we see a more down to earth version of it with Hikaru Asahi. Throughout the first half, Hikaru has accumulated more losses than Hyuga, although he was ahead of him at the start of the season, during the legends festival we got to see Hikaru take multiple Ls while his brother continued to excel. They did it fairly well, however i\'d say it was kind of dropped after the evolved version of the beys came in. As for the reoccurring cast, Aiga and Ranjiro\'s friendship was developed really well this season, and it was a nice continuation from Cho-z. Same could be said about Valt and Rantaro, who although aren\'t really the team, but their dynamic is cool to see.  Sisco has his arc of wanting to beat free extended into this season, although unfortunately it doesn\'t really go anywhere. the only disappointing character this season was Free, who had a really good motivation to fight Lain Valhalla, but it didn\'t go anywhereAnimation: 9The animation although sometimes quite janky, really does pull through when needed. Free & Sisco VS Lui & Drum was beautiful to watch, Lain & Shu VS Valt & Rantaro although it didn\'t have animation that truly stood out, the battle choreography was just stunning.  And ofcourse the breathtaking final battle, that was by far the best animated sequence i have seen from this franchise, and is definetly comparable to other series outside of the toy based anime category.Themes: 10as of late, with GT, Beyblade Burst has been trying to add themes to its seasons. Themes that focus on the final antagonist. Now from season 1-3 some guy would just be the final opponent, but we never got any back story for how they became who they were, with GT we got Gwynn Ronny who had the old trope of ""i don\'t understand power of friendship"" which although refreshing for burst, it doesn\'t really hold up at all compared to anything else. However, Sparking had introduced a character called Lain Valhalla. When he was introduced, I think I could say quite confidently no one really liked him, he was too strong for a new character, and just never lost. He was a frustrating character to watch because whenever he would go up against a favourite character, the outcome was clear, he\'d win. Only after his victory against Shu Kurenai did I realize how strong of a character this was. They didn\'t introduce him last minute like Gwynn, he had a purpose from the beginning. Lain is the embodiment of a Beyblade Burst main character, wanting to be the best. But unlike the others, that\'s all he wants, so when he beats all the legends, he gets confused and loses sight of himself, he gained what he wanted, but now he cannot fight anyone stronger. I\'m a sucker for the good written overpowered character, and Lain is one of them. Throughout the second half of the season we see him constantly get confused by everything around him, while everyone is truly giving it their all, he cannot since he doesn\'t need to. The person across from him is distant while only being a meter away. and in the battle between Lain & Shu VS Valt & Rantaro we finally see Lain for the first time beginning to realize a key message Beyblade Burst has been trying to tell us since the very beginning. And when he finally loses in an equal bout with the main characters, that message is even clearer. Being the best at anything isn\'t what one should strive for, instead the constant improving of one self alongside another is what can bring greater happiness. Valt and Shu, although both wanted to be the best, they only really got to their high ranking because of how many times they have faced each other, because of how much they worked together. They are rivals, and they push each other to be better. Anything you want to improve in, you can do it by yourself, but it will be more fulfilling if you do it with another person, constantly challenging yourself, competing. You may not be the best, but you will be better. down side to this season, the first half is basically meet the bladers, then tournament arc, then another one.

You have to watch both in order to appreciate them despite their shortcomings.For EM97, my biggest gripe was it being an anthology, lacking continuity and in my personal opinion being hardly coherent whatsoever. At times, I was scratching my head thinking what's going on, because despite the animation and action theme, it felt like some art house production instead - lots of metaphors, symbolism, etc. In other words, stuff I don't take too kindly to, I prefer more direct...and straightforward approach.EM98 doesn't have those problems - the story is about 3-4 segments, or 3-4 different stories with one recurring character from the middle episodes to the last episodes. The story being more coherent also makes it easier to watch and invest yourself in it better. But when you look at it from a distance, it's still similar to EM97 - Bolt Crank travelling the world, accepting jobs and then moving on and you are introduced to an entirely new scene and entirely new characters.The only difference is there is definitely more action and Bolt Crank's powers and how his ability works are put on a greater display with more depth to it.I think overall this sequel is also not too fantastic, but a definite improvement over the first one, again, if you decide to watch the series, make sure you watch both in order so you can appreciate them better.

Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31147/Concrete_Revolutio__Choujin_Gensou,"['The 2015 seasonal lineup have given rise to several shows surrounding superheroes and their antics. From the well-known juggernauts like One Punch Man, to the more paradoxical ones like Punch Line; superhero stories seem to be on an all time rise, which can be a direct respondent to the recent boom for superhero films surging in the west. With the success of The Avengers, currently one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, and Marvel\'s ever-expanding cinematic universe, as well as DC Comics, who has also thrown their hats into the ring to follow the trend, this phase isn\'t expected to die down anytime soon....Japan has always been influenced by the actions of big brother, and this is now being reflected in the world of anime, with the introduction of shows like 2013\'s Gatchaman Crowds and Samurai Flamenco, all the way up to what\'s being produced today. And like studio Bones\'s other 2015 show Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront), which explored this idea in a less common way, they once again take that approach with Concrete Revolutio: exploring the inner workings of the would-be organizations that would form if superheroes truly exist. Similar in structure to the governing bodies found in movies such as The Incredibles and Men In Black, Concrete Revolutio focuses on the political maneuvering and policies that such an organization like that would have to navigate when dealing with ""superhumans"". The biggest difference from those movies, however, is the creative liberty that Concrete takes to toss in every supernatural entity in consumable media under the same umbrella, which results in the biggest supernatural orgy placed in a TV series format since the likes of X-Files and Once Upon A Time.Before we dive further into this review, I feel like it\'s absolutely essential to give a bit of context about studio Bones and their infamous reputation when it comes to dealing with plots in supernatural premise anime. Bones and proper writing meshes as effectively as oil and water. If there isn\'t a pre-written guideline to follow (and sometimes even that isn\'t enough), studio Bones can almost guarantee to write themselves into a corner, with convoluted narrative choices and contrived plotting. When it comes to visuals and auditory choices, they are often leagues ahead of the pack, but the moment it\'s time to work on the script, they\'re as proficient as a group of monkeys on a typewriter. Darker Than Black season 2, Eureka Seven AO, and recent entry Kekkai Sensen, are just the tip of the iceberg when discussing Bones\'s infamous track record.So as a forewarning, when you sit down to watch a Bones anime, good visuals are almost always pre-packaged with it, but unfortunately, the chances of a coherent narrative to accompany those visuals are as likely as a coin toss.Now let\'s make this clear, Concrete Revolutio isn\'t really ""badly"" written, just badly organized. Following the plot is somewhat manageable if you dig deep and pay attention to minute details, like setting changes and timeline placement. And as to be expected, the visuals were great, as they tend to be with the content the studio creates. But when it came to that coin toss on whether or not we would receive a coherent narrative, this is yet another Bones production that reinforces their standing as the ADHD studio. There may be a huge influx of superhero titles being produced in recent years, but none can boast the same kind of headache inducing clusterfuck narrative set forth by Concrete Revolutio.The story takes place during several timeline events that\'s intermingled into one overarching narrative. The first timeline that\'s introduced is the personal journey and eventual turncoat direction taken by Jirou Hitoyoshi, the show\'s protagonist, and window into the world of Concrete Revolutio. The other major storyline is dedicated to the macroeconomics and real world implementation of superhumans, coinciding with the organizations that would be created as a direct result of their presence. What brings both stories together is our protagonist himself, who is an agent that works for the \'Superhuman Bureau\', which is one of the biggest governing bodies that oversee the handling of superhumans; may that be by suppressing those that they deem ""dangerous"", or using them as tools to further their agenda.What Concrete Revolutio deserves credit for is tackling the subject matter with some level of sobering realism. It\'s not often that we get a superhero story that bothers to explore the inner-workings of the politics and regiments needed to make such a world function. With shows like One Punch Man that only generally discuss the ideas of a superhero organization, or Samurai Flamenco that does so intermittently between arcs, Revolutio goes the extra mile by making the idea a primary focus, and scratches an itch that some viewers didn\'t even know they had for such a topic, to begin with. It was an interesting idea that blended the surreal world of comic book lore, with that of actual political maneuvering.But that\'s where the praise ends. Despite this intriguing premise, Concrete\'s plotting is nothing short of... mind-numbingly bad. Everything that it had going for it, from the retro comic-book inspired art-style, to the interesting storyline, is made null and void by Bones\'s inability to craft a coherent narrative. And this isn\'t to say an interwoven narrative about supernatural beings told in different timelines can\'t be done (anime titles such as Baccano and Durarara can attest to that). This is just another case of Bones being \'Bones\', which is a shame since the potential for something good was there. Like I already said, if you pay enough attention you can piece the puzzle that is this narrative, but even when you do so, the resulting picture is as warped as anything laid down by Pablo Picasso.If you do decide to watch this anime, do so with the understanding that the story presented to you will be an utter mess. Not a bad story, I can\'t emphasize that enough, but simply a messy one.With that out of the way, let\'s discuss something that studio Bones do demonstrate competency in, and that\'s their visuals. As briefly mentioned, the show has a very nice art direction. Drawing inspiration from western comic-book panel work, we get a vivid depiction of the show\'s universe. With lots of saturated wall-to-wall color, stippling (halftone) effects, pop art illustrations and other key elements used, this show is great eye-candy. If you\'re a comic-book enthusiast or simply looking for a visual treat, this title should be on your radar, for it is nothing short of excellent in the art department.Following suit, we\'re also given a soundtrack that upholds the feeling found with superhero stories. With uplifting synthpop numbers, post-modern rock undertones, and quirky ambient sound-bites to help set the mood. It did a decent job in keeping in tempo with the actions being demonstrated on-screen. Despite no real musical cues really standing out, or any moment where I can say the soundtrack ever went above and beyond what\'s expected of it, It was still a cut above average, not impressive but still serviceable.Like the world the story takes place in, the characters are equally vibrant in personality and outward appearance. And if you could recall, I mention that the show included every fictional supernatural being in its universe, which led to quite a diverse lineup. While not as memorable individually, as a whole the characters introduced were expansive enough to keep things interesting. You never know what you\'ll get at any given episode. One minute we\'re following intergalactic sentient beings, and the next we\'re given magical girls from another dimension. It\'s hard to pinpoint or even describe the cast in any detail, when I said ""the biggest supernatural orgy"", I really do mean that.The biggest problem with the characters come from the main cast that we follow on a daily basis. They\'re not bad, but at the same time, they\'re just not that interesting. These are characters who\'s definitive personality traits are only as interesting as their superpowers. They\'re better defined by what they can do than who they are. Because of this, they\'re not people most viewers would find intriguing. They\'re mostly there to carry the plot along, rather than anyone that you\'ll want to personally invest in.All in all, the cast was fun but wasn\'t really anything beyond that.Enjoyment: 6/10The premise and art style is what ultimately got me through this show. I never thought I would find the inner-workings of a superhero universe to be so interesting. But as far as enjoyment is concerned, Revolutio really fell short, thanks in no small part to the horribly executed plot.Overall: 5/10Concrete Revolutio is a show that I hesitate to suggest trying out without mentioning a few precursors. This anime is NOT easy to follow, even for the more astute of viewers out there, nor is it rewarding as a story when it is all said and done. But if the idea of politics being incorporated into a superhero universe seems intriguing to you, then I say proceed with caution. Visually the show keeps up the track record of Bones\'s other works, but it sadly does nothing in improving their standing in the sloppy plotting department. Concrete Revolutio may not live up to its potential, but it\'s still something that contains some inherent value. Japan has always been influenced by the actions of big brother, and this is now being reflected in the world of anime, with the introduction of shows like 2013\'s Gatchaman Crowds and Samurai Flamenco, all the way up to what\'s being produced today. And like studio Bones\'s other 2015 show Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront), which explored this idea in a less common way, they once again take that approach with Concrete Revolutio: exploring the inner workings of the would-be organizations that would form if superheroes truly exist. Similar in structure to the governing bodies found in movies such as The Incredibles and Men In Black, Concrete Revolutio focuses on the political maneuvering and policies that such an organization like that would have to navigate when dealing with ""superhumans"". The biggest difference from those movies, however, is the creative liberty that Concrete takes to toss in every supernatural entity in consumable media under the same umbrella, which results in the biggest supernatural orgy placed in a TV series format since the likes of X-Files and Once Upon A Time.Before we dive further into this review, I feel like it\'s absolutely essential to give a bit of context about studio Bones and their infamous reputation when it comes to dealing with plots in supernatural premise anime. Bones and proper writing meshes as effectively as oil and water. If there isn\'t a pre-written guideline to follow (and sometimes even that isn\'t enough), studio Bones can almost guarantee to write themselves into a corner, with convoluted narrative choices and contrived plotting. When it comes to visuals and auditory choices, they are often leagues ahead of the pack, but the moment it\'s time to work on the script, they\'re as proficient as a group of monkeys on a typewriter. Darker Than Black season 2, Eureka Seven AO, and recent entry Kekkai Sensen, are just the tip of the iceberg when discussing Bones\'s infamous track record.So as a forewarning, when you sit down to watch a Bones anime, good visuals are almost always pre-packaged with it, but unfortunately, the chances of a coherent narrative to accompany those visuals are as likely as a coin toss.Now let\'s make this clear, Concrete Revolutio isn\'t really ""badly"" written, just badly organized. Following the plot is somewhat manageable if you dig deep and pay attention to minute details, like setting changes and timeline placement. And as to be expected, the visuals were great, as they tend to be with the content the studio creates. But when it came to that coin toss on whether or not we would receive a coherent narrative, this is yet another Bones production that reinforces their standing as the ADHD studio. There may be a huge influx of superhero titles being produced in recent years, but none can boast the same kind of headache inducing clusterfuck narrative set forth by Concrete Revolutio.The story takes place during several timeline events that\'s intermingled into one overarching narrative. The first timeline that\'s introduced is the personal journey and eventual turncoat direction taken by Jirou Hitoyoshi, the show\'s protagonist, and window into the world of Concrete Revolutio. The other major storyline is dedicated to the macroeconomics and real world implementation of superhumans, coinciding with the organizations that would be created as a direct result of their presence. What brings both stories together is our protagonist himself, who is an agent that works for the \'Superhuman Bureau\', which is one of the biggest governing bodies that oversee the handling of superhumans; may that be by suppressing those that they deem ""dangerous"", or using them as tools to further their agenda.What Concrete Revolutio deserves credit for is tackling the subject matter with some level of sobering realism. It\'s not often that we get a superhero story that bothers to explore the inner-workings of the politics and regiments needed to make such a world function. With shows like One Punch Man that only generally discuss the ideas of a superhero organization, or Samurai Flamenco that does so intermittently between arcs, Revolutio goes the extra mile by making the idea a primary focus, and scratches an itch that some viewers didn\'t even know they had for such a topic, to begin with. It was an interesting idea that blended the surreal world of comic book lore, with that of actual political maneuvering.But that\'s where the praise ends. Despite this intriguing premise, Concrete\'s plotting is nothing short of... mind-numbingly bad. Everything that it had going for it, from the retro comic-book inspired art-style, to the interesting storyline, is made null and void by Bones\'s inability to craft a coherent narrative. And this isn\'t to say an interwoven narrative about supernatural beings told in different timelines can\'t be done (anime titles such as Baccano and Durarara can attest to that). This is just another case of Bones being \'Bones\', which is a shame since the potential for something good was there. Like I already said, if you pay enough attention you can piece the puzzle that is this narrative, but even when you do so, the resulting picture is as warped as anything laid down by Pablo Picasso.If you do decide to watch this anime, do so with the understanding that the story presented to you will be an utter mess.

Concrete Revolutio may not live up to its potential, but it\'s still something that contains some inherent value.', 'Original anime is quite a rarity these days.  Most of the shows that you encounter on a normal seasonal basis are adaptations of manga, LN, or VN, as things really only get an anime when it\'s really popular.  And then you have original anime, where there is no source material and only itself in order to tell the story it wants to tell.  So, thanks to Bones, we have Concrete Revolutio.  A show that...you know what, fuck it, a single word cannot describe this mess.Story: In a fantasy version of the world, there are beings that live among humans known as...Superhumans.  What are superhumans?  Well, they don\'t just include humans with superpowers, they, according to the show\'s logic, involve things like aliens, witches, yokai, time travelers, cyborgs, androids, what have you.  It is here where we follow the story of the Superhuman Bureau, a group of people who work to aid Superhumans and aid them in their plight of need.Concrete...is a special kind of show, and that\'s meant to be taken however you wish.  Following our group of superhumans, every episode of the show follows these characters as they go through a completely different storyline in almost every episode, tackling a different event and problem that has to do with the Superhumans featured in the show.  The biggest problem with Concrete as far as story is concerned is that it\'s very, very, VERY badly paced and structured.  Not only does every episode basically start a completely different story, but they go into different periods of time as well.  The show bounces back and forth between the present and future (or...past and present; both of them work, really.) without really any warning.  In addition, the show just feels like it\'s rushing itself.  The show throws you right into the action and leaves you there to see what\'s going on as characters shout their definition of justice to their opponent, discuss politics, or what have you.And that brings me to my next point, justice.  Concrete tried to make itself into a show that talks about the morality of justice, freedom, and the rights of beings, regardless of what they are.  (Just a little side note, the characters in the show even argue what a superhuman even is, with some saying that they\'re just humans with superpowers, while other\'s say it\'s everything NOT human.)  As a theme, it\'s a good one.  But as they say, great in theory, messy in practice.  The concept of morality in this series is very in your face, as almost every line has to do with the rights or what have you.  The problem is, that\'s all it really is, talk.  The characters don\'t really do anything for this topic, relying solely on the plot to bring them another situation where they state their goals and hopes for the future which really in the end doesn\'t do the show any justice since it\'s all talk and no real action.In the end, Concrete is what I would describe as an ""incomprehensible piece of crap that doesn\'t bother to make sense of itself until the VERY LAST EPISODE"", and even in the last episode it doesn\'t make much sense.  (And that is my honest opinion.)  With its episodic storyline that is so disjointed that not even the \'connecting\' parts of the story really connect, as well as a philosophy concept that doesn\'t get off the ground period, this is a show that I for once, will not be watching the next season of, since there is more for some god unknown reason.Overview:-  Disjointed story-  Really bad pacing-  Concept of \'morality\' never gets off the ground-  Why is there going to be a second season?!Characters: Characters are also one of my biggest gripes in the series.  Not just because they said that ghosts are physical and can apparently shapeshift into animals, objects, or what have you, but because there\'re just so many of them and none of them are really spectacular.For once, I really can\'t pin down any of these characters for the sole reason of there\'s not really anything to say about them.  We have the superhuman bureau, and then we have everyone else.  As mentioned before, each of these characters in this cast has some sense of morality or view on the existence between superhumans and humans together.  As such, there are a lot of sides and a lot of say in the matter, and these characters really just feel like puppets on a stage.  I can\'t even pin the supposed main protagonist Jiro down because on one hand, he wants to protect all superhumans, but at the same time, he fights a lot of them and says he wants to protect the people as well which is rather conflicting.For the most part, the cast of this series features side characters, as they take up the brunt of the showtime.  (Another interestingly odd thing.)  With every new episode, the show introduces new characters, primarily superhumans, and features them and their plight with every new episode that comes.  As a concept, this show wouldn\'t be too bad with its episodic format, but because it\'s structured in the way it is, a lot of the motivation that the side characters have with each passing episode doesn\'t always make complete sense, and the reasoning why they do stuff is either unknown or is told in a confusing manner so much so that I question what their plan was from the very beginning.  (They have a kid agitate the monster he was trying to say was a good guy, before promptly crying because it went on a rampage and he felt sad.  Where is the logic in that?!)Overview:+  Devotion to side cast-  One note cast.  (Everyone\'s pretty one-note)-  Character motivation is confusingArt: Produced by Studio Bones, Concrete bears a very different style of animation contrary to anime in general.  Hosting a very bright and vibrant color scheme reminiscent to comic books and what have you, the artstyle for Concrete is very flashy and incredibly vibrant.  It was done in a way that was actually really appealing to the eye since it reflected the fantastical world that they were trying to portray and it fit with that aspect of the show.In addition, the art is very fluent.  There really aren\'t any bumps with it, as the entirety of the show is well made, showcasing all of the superhuman powers, the crazy tech, and out of this world stuff that just looks fun to watch.Overview:+  Great and unique artstyleSound: Sound is also an aesthetic to the series that I cannot deny has decent qualities to it.  The OP of the series is this loud and blaring rock song that gives you this rush and excitement to it.  It\'s what I think of as a good song and it\'s memorable because of its uniqueness.The ED on the other hand is a bit of an odd choice.  Similar to its respective OP, the song is a rock song, being very heavy in electric guitar, however it has this trippy feel to it that feels like you\'re on acid or having some drug trip while listening to it.  And when you have those visuals in the ED as well...oh boy, that\'s quite the LSD nightmare.Overview:+ Great and memorable OP+/-  LSD ED.  (Its like a drug trip...)Personal Enjoyment:  Concrete is just that, concrete.  Watching this show felt like being slammed in the face repeatedly by a slab of concrete.  They\'re both painful to experience and for the most part you don\'t know why it\'s happening.  As such, this show for me was quite the rage-inducer.  Normally, whenever I review anime, I always watch future seasons in order to keep consistency.  For this show however, that will not be the case, as the sheer amount of fucks I don\'t give for this horribly written piece of crap is not enough to constitute me to watch any more.Did I like this anime?No.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Everything.  Everything except the art and the OP is something I both despise and resent.Would I recommend this anime?Even though I hate it...personally, I wouldn\'t recommend it.  The show itself is a fusion of the random storytelling (like FLCL) in conjunction with a theme that made the show try to take itself more seriously than it ever could\'ve.  As such, I can\'t even recommend this show as a time waster since it tries to take itself very seriously without the show really doing anything to build onto that theme aside from introducing new characters with different points of view.  I\'ll say this though; Bones, you have failed me. Superhumans.  What are superhumans?

I\'ll say this though; Bones, you have failed me.', 'Looking for a show about heroes fighting bad guys to save the world? Or maybe something really flamboyant with all type of gags? Perhaps interested in a series with all kinds of supernatural beings thrown into a big chunk of story all packaged ready to open? Concrete Revolutio might be your answer. At its core, the series is a wild ride with everything it tries. And given what it delivered, this show is quite a bit of fun.A few things to know. Concrete Revolutio is an original series and not based on any work. The show is produced by Bones and directed by Seiji Mizushima,...who is known for directing Full Metal Alchemist. Furthermore, we got Shou Aikawa who’ve worked on other Bones’ shows like Rahxephon. That alone should spark some interest. For an original show, the series is inspired by some unoriginal ideas like superheroes. It’s just like the premise says: a series where supernatural beings becomes part of human society and where superheroes has to deal with them.The core part of the characters are part of a group known as the Superhuman Bureau, an organization formed by heroes who wants to save the world. Think of it like the Justice League and you’ll get the picture. But rather than Superman, we got a character named Jiro as the main protagonist. Alongside him there’s also others like magical girl Hino, expert tracker Emi Kino, a kid named Fuurouta who can transform into a wild beast, among others. The idea is that these group of heroes has gathered together to save the world without government recognition. Their purpose seems to be the generic moral of “doing the right thing”.  The series also invests a lot of time in the group dealing with some interpersonal issues. As a member of the group, Jiro makes his intentions pretty well known. With his trademark violet hair and an indifferent personality, he’s a man to keep an eye on. The rest of the cast is less noticeable although their diverse range of personalities can be entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, there’s not really a whole lot of characterization focused on them individually. Rather, it approaches the group with more of what they do rather than the reasons of them doing what they want.In terms of episode structure, prepare for a lot of confusion in the first few episodes. Any viewer watching this may have to re-watch a few of the scenes to get a better understanding. Almost every episode has a rather absurd start with a frenzy fashion. You’ll probably get used to it after a while but don’t get caught off guard if it feel like the show dropped you in the middle of the story. Taking a closer glance though, the series focuses on a variety of ideas that extends from historical context such as World Wars to immorality. The timeline of the story is also hard to piece together at first but later does get clearer as each progressing episode. What’s most interesting about the show is how much fun it seems to have with itself. Most superheroes shows these days are mostly about the good guys vs. bad guys and saving the world. Concrete Revolutio goes a little bit beyond that and shows how heroes approaches their problems. Not every episode is structured like this though and some can give the repetitive with the ‘villain of the week’ feeling. But in retrospect, it still retains a sense of fun as it blends between fictional storytelling and entertainment.Superhuman Bureau also battles a variety of strange beings throughout the series. From oversized Transformers to King Kong like behemoths, it’s actually quite colorful. There’s also secret organizations with their own agenda while we sometimes see the Bureau’s group battle their own personal demons. The show doesn’t offer a central antagonist (The ‘Big Bad’) so it’s more about fighting the good fight and making a difference. Unfortunately, some of these antagonists lacks a decent personality and can feel pretty stereotypical. The battles and resolutions are also fairly predictable so you may get bored from time to time. I can also fairly safe to say that Jiro is a character that is hard to get attached to. I find it difficult to relate to him or understand his character especially later on with his identity issue. Not that it’s holding the show back but Jiro may be a hit or miss character for most fans. Just as the show it is, Concrete Revolutio may not be suitable for everyone.The art can easily be described as being colorful. It’s saturated all over the setting with its buildings, characters, and supernatural beings. The action itself is also quite stylistic with a gag approach while also translating into some fast paced battle choreography. It’s not hard to keep up but the momentum of the action can be quite swift if you don’t pay close attention. There’s also various transformations that while gimmicky can be amusing to watch because of the physical changes of the characters. Despite this, most of the main characters looks normal in their base form. On the other hand, we got monsters with their otherworldly designs and some that follows a suit of evolution with their revamped body structures. Fan service also exists although not really explicit at all except a few skin here and there. By all terms, it’s actually quite unique for a show about superheroes.It’s one of my favorite OP songs for this Fall season. From upbeat tones to its catchy lyrics, the theme song takes a dive into colorful choreography. There’s also showcases of the main characters in noticeable moments although most of it is overshadowed by the colors. The OST is less noticeable although makes the series credible during action scenes. However, I have to give some credit for the character expressions to bring out a good amount of comedy for the series. This is coordinated in conjunction with the character voice tones. And because of that, it makes the show quite fun to watch as it adds both thrilling excitement and laughs.It’s not a masterpiece but Concrete Revolutio is definitely a show to look out for. You don’t have to enjoy superheroes themed series to like this. Nor do you have to examine it like some detective story. With everything it has to offer, the show is quite a bit of fun. From superhero fighting to morality context, it’s a series that knows what to do with its seemingly oversaturated amount of ideas. At least take a look at it and see what these heroes do for a living. who is known for directing Full Metal Alchemist.

The rest of the cast is less noticeable although their diverse range of personalities can be entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, there’s not really a whole lot of characterization focused on them individually. Rather, it approaches the group with more of what they do rather than the reasons of them doing what they want.In terms of episode structure, prepare for a lot of confusion in the first few episodes. Any viewer watching this may have to re-watch a few of the scenes to get a better understanding. Almost every episode has a rather absurd start with a frenzy fashion. You’ll probably get used to it after a while but don’t get caught off guard if it feel like the show dropped you in the middle of the story. Taking a closer glance though, the series focuses on a variety of ideas that extends from historical context such as World Wars to immorality. The timeline of the story is also hard to piece together at first but later does get clearer as each progressing episode. What’s most interesting about the show is how much fun it seems to have with itself. Most superheroes shows these days are mostly about the good guys vs. bad guys and saving the world. Concrete Revolutio goes a little bit beyond that and shows how heroes approaches their problems. Not every episode is structured like this though and some can give the repetitive with the ‘villain of the week’ feeling. But in retrospect, it still retains a sense of fun as it blends between fictional storytelling and entertainment.Superhuman Bureau also battles a variety of strange beings throughout the series. From oversized Transformers to King Kong like behemoths, it’s actually quite colorful. There’s also secret organizations with their own agenda while we sometimes see the Bureau’s group battle their own personal demons. The show doesn’t offer a central antagonist (The ‘Big Bad’) so it’s more about fighting the good fight and making a difference. Unfortunately, some of these antagonists lacks a decent personality and can feel pretty stereotypical. The battles and resolutions are also fairly predictable so you may get bored from time to time. I can also fairly safe to say that Jiro is a character that is hard to get attached to. I find it difficult to relate to him or understand his character especially later on with his identity issue. Not that it’s holding the show back but Jiro may be a hit or miss character for most fans. Just as the show it is, Concrete Revolutio may not be suitable for everyone.The art can easily be described as being colorful. It’s saturated all over the setting with its buildings, characters, and supernatural beings. The action itself is also quite stylistic with a gag approach while also translating into some fast paced battle choreography. It’s not hard to keep up but the momentum of the action can be quite swift if you don’t pay close attention. There’s also various transformations that while gimmicky can be amusing to watch because of the physical changes of the characters. Despite this, most of the main characters looks normal in their base form. On the other hand, we got monsters with their otherworldly designs and some that follows a suit of evolution with their revamped body structures. Fan service also exists although not really explicit at all except a few skin here and there. By all terms, it’s actually quite unique for a show about superheroes.It’s one of my favorite OP songs for this Fall season. From upbeat tones to its catchy lyrics, the theme song takes a dive into colorful choreography. There’s also showcases of the main characters in noticeable moments although most of it is overshadowed by the colors. The OST is less noticeable although makes the series credible during action scenes. However, I have to give some credit for the character expressions to bring out a good amount of comedy for the series. This is coordinated in conjunction with the character voice tones. And because of that, it makes the show quite fun to watch as it adds both thrilling excitement and laughs.It’s not a masterpiece but Concrete Revolutio is definitely a show to look out for. You don’t have to enjoy superheroes themed series to like this. Nor do you have to examine it like some detective story. With everything it has to offer, the show is quite a bit of fun. From superhero fighting to morality context, it’s a series that knows what to do with its seemingly oversaturated amount of ideas. At least take a look at it and see what these heroes do for a living.', ""Concrete Revolutio was the one show this season I wasn’t expecting to be as good as it was. This series was a pleasant surprise of Fall 2015. And as it has already been stated, the MAL average here is far underrated. This is definitely not a show you should judge based on first looks.The artwork is fitting for the superhero theme of the show. In fact, the backgrounds are colored in by tiny dots, almost as if it were printed out from an actual superhero comic book. Other background elements are drawn with very basic shapes and colored solid, also as if it came from...a comic book. Also, the first thing that hits you when you watch this anime is the color. The colors are very bold, and pop, and are flamboyant, if not *fabulous.* Where else are you going to find a main male MC with hot pink hair that swoops? And for a contrast, the psychedelic animation for the ED is pretty trippy; don’t skip it. I must give a 10/10 to the artwork. Bones brought in a new, daring style to the medium, and I love it. However, the playful artwork cannot be taken at face-value. There’s so much more to Concrete Revolutio than what you first see on the surface.The story is about the Superhuman Bureau, which protects and regulates superhumans. This includes eliminating potentially dangerous superhumans. However, you cannot take the “superhero” theme at face-value either. This is NOT your average cookie-cutter superhero show. One thing that is important to note is that the plot uses timeskips to connect certain points together while leaving events in between secret. It’s not difficult to keep track of since the screen shows you what year it is. Scenes that happen in year 42 deal with cases that the Superhuman Bureau is currently working on. At some time during each episode, the scene will skip ahead to year 47. Here it seems like our hot pink MC, Jiro, is on the run from his own organization, but we don’t know why. Watch each episode to find out more as the plot thickens. This is very much more of an “action mystery” rather than your typical shounen.As we watch, we learn that each of the main characters have their own secrets and motives, and the lines between good, evil, and justice begin to blur. Some fight for justice, some fight for peace, and some fight for freedom. Humans, superhumans, ghosts, beasts, witches, demons, aliens... what's the difference between these groups and why are they treated differently? Are any of them innately evil? Does the peace of one group inhibit the freedom and justice of another?I think that's all I should say for now. The best thing I can compare this to is Darker than Black. At first, the series is largely episodic with their own individual mysteries, but each episode digs a little more into the main plot. Then everything begins to tie together as we learn more about the main characters towards the end. However, this season is largely a setup for season 2, it seems.Anyway, this isn't something you will regret watching if you give it a fair chance and don't judge too early. Enjoy the ride~ a comic book. Also, the first thing that hits you when you watch this anime is the color.

Enjoy the ride~"", 'I\'m not going to deny that there was once a time when I liked Baccano and Durarara. After all, I watched them during a time in my life when the only anime I was familiar with were harem romance shit and I still thought Guy Ritchie and the first Iron Man movie was cool. Over time though, I\'ve fallen out with them harder than people who once thought Clannad was a masterpiece of making you cry now see the show. There\'s only so long you can enjoy anime and other visual mediums for its quirkiness and being ""better than the pack"" before you start craving...something that\'s actually good on its own terms, and Narita (along with the rest of the light novel author pack) lack that entirely what with his inability to write anything but energy that isn\'t being applied to anything useful. It\'s like watching Pulp Fiction if it only came prepared with one pistol rather than the truck-worthy supply Tarantino uses to elevate himself above his friends.In that regard, I\'d like to thank Bones for creating an anime that actually does the whole time-jumping/multiple character/energetic presentation well, because it actually applies that presentation to something with some actual fucking substance rather than try to make said presentation ""the"" substance. And since we\'re at it, why don\'t I thank Bones for a lot of other things too? Like making a superhero anime that actually utilizes the concept of being a superhero. Making an anime that doesn\'t rely on nostalgia as its only draw. And most of all, making an anime that doesn\'t suck, something the studio hasn\'t done in years.Not even going to be shy about it: Concrete Revolutio is not only my favorite anime of 2015, but one of the best anime I\'ve seen in a long time. It has its lame moments, but the overall package was strong enough to turn the show into an Undertale-style hit that grabbed the attention of quite a few big names. Gen Urobuchi and that guy who handled the writing for Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill are both attached to its upcoming sequel, with the latter acting as a third main writer because apparently two people and a few guest writers aren\'t enough to tell the story Bones wants. Whether or not this will benefit the show\'s writing or turn it into a ""too many cooks"" situation, I don\'t know. But those names will get more people watching the thing than this dinky review can even hope to match, and that\'s a good thing as far as I\'m concerned.Whilst it starts off weak due to a premiere that felt like an hour-long episode crammed into 22 minutes, Concrete Revolutio quickly rises above the rest of the superpower pack by assuring us that it\'s going to take its premise seriously and not use it a vehicle for throwaway gags and beautifully animated yet incredibly empty fight scenes that will always prove Zack Snyder right about Marvel\'s movies. Similar to how Haibane Renmei stood out from the rest of the ""slice-of-life centered on cute girls"" pack due to its religious bent, Concrete Revolutio is jam-packed with all manners of political metaphors surrounding Japan\'s history to accompany the adventures of an organization of super humans centered on a young man named Jiro, the only dude I know who can make pink hair cool. Whilst seemingly just another cool boy who leads his team to victory, it\'s revealed very early on that five years into the future, Jiro would betray his organization in order to help out super humans on their own terms and much of the show\'s momentum is carried by learning why he did so, whilst exploring its world through various episodic plots centered on other super powered people who have their own vision of justice in regards to the happenings caused by the time period.Admittedly, I\'m not too familiar with the history portrayed in this show and I\'m not gonna bother looking them up since so many other people have written about the connections better than I ever will, but I do know that the story\'s melding of politics and superhero is not dissimilar to Watchmen - which the creators have admitted to wanting to make a Japanese version of. And Watchmen was a great book that Concrete Revolutio borrows from correctly. It has the same time-jumping mechanics and conflicts caused by ultimately good intentioned superheroes as a result of the atrocities committed by our government along with foreign ones (particularly America in CR\'s case because that\'s whom anime always goes after when they need a country to oppose. You know, at least Geass went after the UK in its story) that you\'re nevertheless not supposed to root for because they\'re fucking psychos whose plans aren\'t even guaranteed to succeed. The final bad guy in particular is basically Zero from Code Geass - right down to the costume and his way of thinking - if the show portrayed his morality as a reasonable alternative that we nevertheless want no part of rather than the ultimately right choice that R2 ended up doing. Nevertheless, Concrete Revolutio not only gets what makes its predecessor work, it knows it shouldn\'t outright copy it and does its own thing where, without spoiling anything in particular, Ozymandias doesn\'t win. Obviously there are more differences to Watchmen than just that, but if I listed all of them, this review would be over 5000 words long.But let\'s focus on the characters since the story itself is best experienced by going into it with as little information as possible even if you can still enjoy it greatly despite that. Most of the interesting aspects are given to Jiro and episodic characters like Earth-chan, whilst the more recurring characters are generally there to serve the plot as needed with the occasional moment in the sun as long as it adds to the story. We don\'t even learn anything about Kikko - the character we\'re supposedly meant to project ourselves onto given how she\'s the naive newcomer - until the final arc, and when we do, it doesn\'t really have much bearing on what\'s going on besides giving her an unexpected darker side in order to make sure she isn\'t left behind by the other more complex characters. They\'re not boring given how they all clearly have their own baggage which the show exploits from time to time, as well as the existence of that one really boring sixth episode that took the focus away from them and suffered massively for it. Nevertheless, I can\'t really picture watching an OVA of them slacking off the same way I can for Noragami.And for the record, thank fucking christ that there are no slack-off scenes or character relaxation moments in this show, unless you count that scene where Kikko whines to Fuurouta about her crush on Jiro being spoiled by him living with a fox lady. There\'s nothing wrong with them in-between big moments, but too many anime - and Durarara in particular - overdo the breaks to the point that they\'re pretty much the animated series equivalent of an employee who\'s paid on the hour but never does any actual work. Concrete Revolutio never separates the characters from the story, keeping everything nice and tight even when it leads to some spotty plotting, and trusts the audience to figure out for themselves what timeline we\'re supposed to be looking at. It never bothers to hold their hand, but it\'s not inaccessible. You just have to pay attention and accept that you\'re not going to get the bigger picture on your first go.Concrete Revolutio is a heavy show that demands a lot from its audience whilst juggling many different viewpoints in a narrative that\'s all about how there\'s no winning side when it comes to crimes committed by our government. It refuses to make things simple, because it can\'t afford to be simple in regards to issues that professionals haven\'t been able to figure out for years. It\'ll take the time to show the consequences no matter what side you\'re on, but it doesn\'t have answers. Nobody has answers, and if they do, they\'re not going to express it through a cartoon on public television. All anime like Concrete Revolutio can do is keep raising awareness until someone someday figures out the best way forward. And when you express that agenda through usage of a world where every kind of super powered being imaginable exists, even better. something that\'s actually good on its own terms, and Narita (along with the rest of the light novel author pack) lack that entirely what with his inability to write anything but energy that isn\'t being applied to anything useful.

It is a series of seemingly disconnected stories that at first try to just show what most stories within a superhero saga don't do, the consequences of an action. We see superheroes as beings who can do no wrong, but what happens when what we think is right, what we think we're protecting, turns out o be the wrong thing. That's what Concrete Revolution: Superhuman Phantasmagoria attempts...to tackle.The Story is something that takes a while to piece together. At first it seems like completely disconnected events that have some weird tone shift further down the line. I want to compare what the first episode tried to do to Gakkou Gurashi, but failing to hook the viewer, instead I think it wasn't the strongest way to start. However, as the story pans out, the two or three separate timelines start to intersect, you start to understand what is occuring, and you piece together that all is not what it seems. The reality is that the series follows the idea of manipulation of superheroes(superhumans), and the manipulation of the media to polarize people's views on them. I believe that it may need to be rewatched to fully understand it, but the overarching plot is more than meets the eye. It's a very slow burn, but it's quite satisfying on to see piece together so far by the end of this season.The art... oh boy. This is probably one of the things that really attracted me to the anime at first, just to see the different art style. It just pops, but they also manage to use that flare to emphasise the darkness of the series at times, especially lighting the series. I don't know what to say about the art style, I've never watched anything before by Studio Bones and I wanna watch more of their stuff just for this vibrant art.The sound design... Hmm. Well, most of what I can remember was the opening and ending theme. However, the ending theme was interesting. It's a very dark sounding song which increases tension at the end of the episode. This is what tells you there is definitely something weird about this show from the beginning. However, I think they also did this so that when you would hear it later during episodes of the show, you'd know that that moment was meant to be tense. However, I didn't really pay all that much attention to the OST. If I do rewatch and re-review, I plan to play close attention to the OST.The characters are very interesting. Surprisingly, with some exceptions, every character introduced has some longer impact on the plot, side or main. Consequently, this helps reveal certain details about the main characters who are not one-dimensional characters but instead have many little details that deconstruct what they actually are. Possibly the two best examples of this are Kikko and Magotake (Jiro's father), both of which completely shatter your opinions of themselves as the series progresses.I don't really know how quite to describe this series.

Nope, since episode 1, this show's been incredibly polarizing, leading to many people dropping the show because it didn't immediately fulfill their expectations. But after finishing the season and reflecting on it as a whole, Concrete Revolutio is something very exceptional.Story: 9/10Concrete Revolutio's unconventional narrative style is probably what initially scared many people away from the show. You see, the storyline is not linear. The date that episodes take place in will be shown at the start of the episode, but at first episodes do not seem to be...connected at all. But the further you get, the more you begin to understand that all of these seemingly unconnected episodes are actually very tied in. By the end of the season, a very deep and engaging story has been woven.I don't want to go into too much detail about the actual events of Concrete Revolutio's story (it's much better experienced yourself), but I'll go over the themes. Taking place in an alternate world in which superhumans coexist with the rest of the world, Concrete focuses on the Superhuman Bureau, a mysterious organization whose job seems to be to protect superhumans. Political intrigue, protests for rights and peace, and many more concepts ensue. The premise is great, and while it isn't immediately delivered on, it's very satisfying by the end.Art: 9/10In a world of Tokyo Ghouls and Akame Ga Kills, it's nice to see some anime that remembers that you're allowed to use colors. Exceedingly. Concrete's artwork is colorful and vibrant, a unique breath of fresh air. Additionally, the backgrounds are often shaded with Ben-Day dots (that's when you see shading made up of a whole bunch of tiny dots in comics), which is a very cool throwback to the comics that inspired Concrete. Character designs are pretty good too, and the animation as a whole is solid. 3DCG is minimal and looks pretty good when it is used.Sound: 9/10The opening of Concrete Revolutio is probably in my top 10 openings of any show I've watched. I mean, I'd have to actually make that list first, but I'm sure it would make it on somewhere. It does a great job of hyping you up and I never skipped it. On the flipside, the ending is full of distorted slow guitars and trippy visuals - a totally different vibe but still a great one. The background music checks out, and I especially liked how the ending theme serves as a character's theme later on in the show.Character: 8/10Of course, Concrete has a central cast of main characters. There's the protagonist Jiro, the ghost kid Furota, and the witch girl Kikko. However, there's also the other 5 or so members of the Superhuman bureau. There's also multiple groups of young kids, two bands, and members of vague yet menacing advertising agencies and militaries. The point is, there's a ton of characters, and most of them actually get a suprising amount of screen time, with most members of the Bureau and groups of kids getting their own episodes. Of course, this division leaves some of the main characters without too much backstory - we still don't really know the story of Emi - but all in all, the large cast doesn't get stale. Everyone's motives are different, every action is justifiable, and every character is likable.Enjoyment: 8/10Although not a drag to get through, the early episodes of Concrete Revolutio can come off as confusing, as they often open plot threads that aren't mentioned and resolved again until much later episodes. However, the farther one gets through the show, the more everything makes sense, and the more enjoyable it is. Besides, with a show as heavy on symbolism as Concrete, there's a lot of people willing to discuss speculation and theory and try to  figure out the timeline. I myself tried to map out a time-traveling character's multiple timelines and how they converged and diverged, and it ended up being a lot of fun.Overall: 9/10If I had to describe Concrete Revolutio in one word, it would be emergent. The story slowly rolls out over the course of the show until everything becomes connected by the end. While that's a really cool feeling to experience, it didn't bode well with viewers who watched the first few episodes and were disappointed that the show wasn't explaining everything right away. Because of these early droppers and disenfranchised viewers, Concrete doesn't have a very good rating on MAL. But don't let those ratings deceive you. Concrete Revolutio is one of the best shows of this year, and the great experiences I had watching this show were unlike anything any other anime has offered to me. connected at all. But the further you get, the more you begin to understand that all of these seemingly unconnected episodes are actually very tied in. By the end of the season, a very deep and engaging story has been woven.I don't want to go into too much detail about the actual events of Concrete Revolutio's story (it's much better experienced yourself), but I'll go over the themes. Taking place in an alternate world in which superhumans coexist with the rest of the world, Concrete focuses on the Superhuman Bureau, a mysterious organization whose job seems to be to protect superhumans. Political intrigue, protests for rights and peace, and many more concepts ensue. The premise is great, and while it isn't immediately delivered on, it's very satisfying by the end.Art: 9/10In a world of Tokyo Ghouls and Akame Ga Kills, it's nice to see some anime that remembers that you're allowed to use colors. Exceedingly. Concrete's artwork is colorful and vibrant, a unique breath of fresh air. Additionally, the backgrounds are often shaded with Ben-Day dots (that's when you see shading made up of a whole bunch of tiny dots in comics), which is a very cool throwback to the comics that inspired Concrete. Character designs are pretty good too, and the animation as a whole is solid. 3DCG is minimal and looks pretty good when it is used.Sound: 9/10The opening of Concrete Revolutio is probably in my top 10 openings of any show I've watched. I mean, I'd have to actually make that list first, but I'm sure it would make it on somewhere. It does a great job of hyping you up and I never skipped it. On the flipside, the ending is full of distorted slow guitars and trippy visuals - a totally different vibe but still a great one. The background music checks out, and I especially liked how the ending theme serves as a character's theme later on in the show.Character: 8/10Of course, Concrete has a central cast of main characters. There's the protagonist Jiro, the ghost kid Furota, and the witch girl Kikko. However, there's also the other 5 or so members of the Superhuman bureau. There's also multiple groups of young kids, two bands, and members of vague yet menacing advertising agencies and militaries. The point is, there's a ton of characters, and most of them actually get a suprising amount of screen time, with most members of the Bureau and groups of kids getting their own episodes. Of course, this division leaves some of the main characters without too much backstory - we still don't really know the story of Emi - but all in all, the large cast doesn't get stale. Everyone's motives are different, every action is justifiable, and every character is likable.Enjoyment: 8/10Although not a drag to get through, the early episodes of Concrete Revolutio can come off as confusing, as they often open plot threads that aren't mentioned and resolved again until much later episodes. However, the farther one gets through the show, the more everything makes sense, and the more enjoyable it is. Besides, with a show as heavy on symbolism as Concrete, there's a lot of people willing to discuss speculation and theory and try to  figure out the timeline. I myself tried to map out a time-traveling character's multiple timelines and how they converged and diverged, and it ended up being a lot of fun.Overall: 9/10If I had to describe Concrete Revolutio in one word, it would be emergent. The story slowly rolls out over the course of the show until everything becomes connected by the end. While that's a really cool feeling to experience, it didn't bode well with viewers who watched the first few episodes and were disappointed that the show wasn't explaining everything right away.

It will reward you big time in the end. Just like the other viewers, I was confused at first with the constant switching of time frames but you will soon appreciate how story was told as you reach the end. It is a unique experience where in the question ""Why Jiro left the Superhuman Bureau?"" is introduced in the beginning and you go back to the past to search for clues to answer that question. The constant flashbacks will give you hints on how the protagonist end up with his stand on the anime\'s main theme (justice,...peace, and freedom), and also help you decide whether or not the protagonist made the right decision.This season gives the viewers an opportunity to choose a side. Across all the episodes, you will see the flaws and strong points of each factions (superhumans, government, ordinary citizens). Unlike other animes, this one dwells more on the gray area of humanity. There is no clear distinction between good and evil. Instead this anime gives you different characters that you can identify with.

Spoilers ahead!)One of my father’s favorite superheroes is Superman. But, to me, Superman is always one of my least favorite.He can lift cars. He can literally deflect bullets. He can regenerate by exposing himself to sunlight. But what kills him? A rock. He is boring and, ironically, weak. Lame.You know what is not lame? Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou. Kryptonite will not be taking down Concrete anytime soon.STORYThe anime world coins Concrete as a split-cour anime. Its first half plays in one season. A season-long break is taken. And then the second, final half plays during the...season following the break. It is basically a two-cour anime rather than two, independent seasons since the second half directly continues where the first left off.The first half to a split-cour is generally meant to create the foundation. Introduce the characters, have some plot, get the audience interested in what it has to offer. The payoff comes in the second half.Concrete does not resign itself to such simplicity.The anime is framed in a fascinating way. Rather than the events being played in a continuous fashion, they are scrambled. Episodes take place years and months apart. Often times, the current period jumps back-and-forth within a single episode. Most certainly interesting. But why? Why intentionally make everything difficult to follow?Before this question can be answered, Concrete’s themes have to first be explored. Three major themes exist. This amount is a lot for an anime to handle, especially a first half to a split-cour. The handling is made harder by their scope: morality, racism, and control.The first theme, morality, is the most prominent in the anime and arguably the most important. Many events, like Fuurouta killing the bugs in the “Black Fog” or Earth-chan the robot flying around the globe helping people, revolve around a philosophical thought that has stumped men and women forever: What does it mean to be “good” or “evil”?Is it considered good to take out a civilization bugging others when that same civilization were the first ones to be treated poorly? Can a lie, which is inherently wrong, ever benefit another? The actions of the “good guys” and the “bad guys” are constantly up in the air, questioned by not just the cast but also the audience.The second theme, racism, starts appearing later on in the season. Racism is certainly not as philosophically challenging – racism is simply discrimination of another based on race (or a similar trait). But it is no doubt just as important.Concrete has people with superpowers and those without. Sometimes they work together, but, more often than not, they are clashing. Superhumans even clash with other superhumans. One episode focuses on the destruction of a harmless family that literally cannot die. Another episode highlights the betrayal of Rainbow Knight, the best and most important superhuman. In essence, these nonhuman people are treated in a particularly racist fashion.Concrete further explores its theme on racism when it showcases horrible mistreatment of the nonhuman groups. Coexisting with monsters, experimenting on superhumans, and student-held rallies for both. The anime does not just present racism and leave it for later; the anime actively explores it.For these and many other examples, they continue investigating the theme on morality. Should an undying group that is doing no harm, but cannot ever be stopped, continue to exist? Were Rainbow Knight’s actions as infamous as they seemed?The third theme, control, intersperses itself throughout the season. Like government, the theme is always there, but it only occasionally explicitly appears. It hides in the shadows. Unseen but not unheard of.The “Superhuman Bureau,” the conspiring nationalistic powers of Japan and the United States, and lobbyists like “Imperial Ads” have their hand in many of the events. Akita secretly meeting with other members of his species to run the proceedings behind the scenes. The US submarine filled with in-super-humane test subjects. The poisoning of chocolate to curb superhumans. These are steps these different groups take. Steps made to seize control.On its own, this theme is interesting, but it is its overlapping with the other themes that makes it purposeful. Whether or not the Superhuman Bureau wanting to eliminate rather than protect Grosse Augen, a dangerous yet beneficial superhuman, questions the morality of their actions. Japan and the United States hiding superhuman test subjects in a secret alcove, which causes Claude to kill the scientists in charge of the project, targets racism and morality respectively. Imperial Ads pushing to stop the Revised Superhuman Law in order to deal with superhumans and monsters how they, Imperial Ads, want to challenges racism once more.Now back to the main question. Why make the narrative intentionally difficult to follow? The answer is in the themes themselves. Morality, racism, and control are ideas that are often times convoluted and confusing. Multiple perspectives, personal bias, and situational variables do not always leave a definitive, linear answer. In other words, the complexity of the themes coincides with the convoluted nature of the narrative.All of these details are occurring in just the first half of Concrete, giving the anime a very strong foundation for the second half to eventually work off of.ANIMATIONConcrete’s color range is large, adding a lot of pop and pizazz to the different characters, locations, and events. It is not even worth trying to list all of the colors; the anime grabbed a rainbow and slathered it all over itself.The art also includes different techniques to continue Concrete’s appeal. Almost as if braille were covering the walls or the sky, some backgrounds adopt what appear to be a ton of tiny dots. Other backgrounds have parallel lines. These techniques add a comic-book feel which, given the superhumans and superpowers, fits wonderfully.Lights and shadows have a presence, too, making the various scenes and abilities that much more detailed. And Concrete even includes comedic mouths and expressions for just a dash of hilarity. Not so much funny that it drowns out the drama but enough funny that a quick laugh or two can keep the drama from overwhelming the audience.The visuals of the ending track also deserve a mention. The giant caterpillars, eyeball entities, and humanoid spiders, accompanied by the psychedelic colors, movements, and realistic depictions, follow a common motif of the anime: Not everything is as it seems.Actual animation throughout the season surprisingly keeps up. The usual hair and eye movements are around (not all of the time, but they are there), but it is the episodic battles with their high animation levels that stand out. Iron Raito duking it out against Android Megasshin and Jirou, Jirou using Equus to kill MegaGon, and Earth-chan colliding with an electrified liar are just a handful of examples that demonstrate the nice animation Concrete has. Alongside the explosions, the collapsing objects, and the superpowers of the different superhumans (a special shout-out goes to Kikko’s “Meteortail!” magic), the anime’s animation never lets up.But most impressive are the character designs. Kikko has three main designs. Her everyday human self has purple hair and a nice blue outfit. Her good side is more magical girl in origin with lavender-colored hair, star-filled eyes, and intricately-made clothing. And her bad side contrasts her good side with magenta hair, red eyes, and black attire.Kikko is a bit of an anomaly when it comes to the designs of the anime, but most of the characters switch up how they look now and again. Jirou has his formal attire while in the Superhuman Bureau and his more renegade, vigilante look when he is on the run. Fuurouta has his various forms – balloon, bird, bee – as well as his dichotomous clown and worker outfits.Fuurouta’s dichotomy highlights a trick that Concrete uses. In order to orient the audience, these different designs are associated with the past and the present. When the audience sees Hyouma, the time wielder, in his brown outfit, they know the current time period is before Jirou’s defection. But if he is in his purple outfit, the audience instead understands that the time period is back to the present.And many other members of the cast are the same way, like Earth-chan and Hikaru (the electric user) and Raito. Nearly every character has a design that varies, is interesting, or both, proving once and for all the strength of Concrete’s art.CHARACTERSWhile the cast of Concrete is not as strong as the story it contains, for a first half to a split-cour anime, they have proven their worth more than enough.Emi is arguably the most mysterious of the bunch. The audience does not know much about her. She is technically not a superhuman; she is a monster. Her nickname is “Ogre Emi” given her manipulation of dark, often otherworldly creatures. And as the audience comes to learn, she can shapeshift to look like any woman in a photo or drawing. (It is unknown currently if she can do this for males since she has never been shown to do so. It is probable but so far not canon.)Beyond these more superficial details, she remains a mystery. Her backstory does not exist yet. Her motives are unclear. But what is understood is that she has a deep affection for Jirou.Not just in her helping Jirou when he goes berserk (which is already valiant). But also in how she listens to him. Cares for him. Dotes on him more so than anyone else she has ever known. Her relationship with him has even sparked some controversy. That, perhaps, Jirou is only with her out of obligation for everything she has done for him. To some extent, Emi knows this, too. Especially near the end when she states, “I wanted him to chase after her,” referring to Jirou and Kikko.However, Emi’s most interesting trait is one that is not really a trait of hers at all. To reiterate, the narrative flits back-and-forth between the past and the present. But, strangely, Emi is very rarely shown in the present.Despite how much she is around in the past. Despite how much she lives for Jirou. Her presence in the present is next to none. The cool part is that is the point. Emi is mysterious, so what better way to amplify her mystery than to exclude her almost entirely from what is arguably the more interesting timeline.As such, it is inevitable that she should have (read: better have) some important scenes in the second half. But, for now, she is more than utilized in the first.Kikko almost remains as mysterious as Emi, but, thankfully, the anime goes into a bit more detail with the witch. This wording is not an insult; she is canonically a witch. Or, as her companion Ullr calls her, “Star Child.” For much of the season, the audience sees Kikko as nothing more than a kindhearted girl. Still, her main role is acting as a lens the audience uses to understand Concrete: She participates in the events, but she is always posing questions the audience should think about.For Kikko, Jirou is love at first sight. Literally. She joins the Superhuman Bureau in order to be close to Jirou and to understand the world he lives in. While with him and through Emi, she learns of the beast within Jirou. A similar trait she shares with the man. Yet she remains rather passive for the majority of the season. Then the last few episodes come around.Throughout the season, it was hinted that Kikko seeks energy in the form of human happiness. During the last arc, however, her true reason for being on Earth is revealed: She is looking for a suitor – i.e., a “spouse” as Ullr puts it – in order to officially take over the “devil realm” where she presumably comes from.Her eviler side arrives because she believes Claude to be Jirou. Claude says and does what she wants Jirou to say and do. And, of course, her love for Jirou plays a role, too. So she mistakenly makes the assumption, turning her against the Superhuman Bureau and, more importantly, Jirou. As such, she indirectly forces Jirou away: Emi agrees to help Jirou get Kikko back on the condition that he forevermore stays away from Kikko.While Jirou keeps his promise, Kikko fights to understand Jirou and to get him back. In the present, she becomes like Emi, chasing after the man that she has come to love so much. And, again like Emi, she is in a strong spot as a character for when the second half rolls around.This leaves Jirou. Jirou is considered human despite his incredible and incredibly dangerous power. He is adopted, his idol is the now-deceased (maybe; still somewhat unconfirmed) Rainbow Knight, and he works with the Superhuman Bureau in order to do right by his father and by his hero.Arguably the main protagonist, Jirou sees many of the events. They test his convictions. More specifically, they test his definition of justice. The side characters help to make this happen. The episodes usually bring a new set of characters who get their own backstory as well as another new way for Jirou to view justice.For example, helping out a known, helpful superhuman. Stopping an old, misunderstood grudge. Showing an old friend what justice thinks of him. Fighting what he calls “beasts.” Realizing what others think of their own powers. Witnessing someone who always values good. Explaining his side to a fellow admirer. Understanding limits. Having the strength to stand for what one believes in. And learning the sad, unfortunate truth about his hero.And in regards to the narrative themes on morality, race, and government, justice is paramount. All three themes rely on justice. On what justice means and brings and gives to those involved and not involved. And like those themes, justice is not always defined.Jirou puts it best: “But not everyone can be black or white. Even if they’re grey…. If they believe in justice, I want to be the ally of justice.” Jirou wants to be like his hero Rainbow Knight. Someone that does not view life as either yes or no. Up or down. Left or right. He wants to be the man that aids justice. In whatever way that may be.Justice is not just Jirou’s theme but all of the characters’ theme. Emi and Kikko and the myriad of other side characters justify justice in their own way. Jirou, though, takes it to the highest level: He embodies justice. He comes to the conclusion that he is “no longer justice.” Thus, he pursues being an “ally of justice” to protect everyone, transitioning from the main protagonist to the main antagonist. Due to the nature of the narrative, this transition happens repeatedly, but it shows how multisided Jirou’s character is.What will become of Jirou is anyone’s guess, but he is saying and doing what he should have been all along.Like the narrative, Concrete has only just begun to work with its characters. But, what has been given about them and what they represent thus far, they are primed and ready for what lays ahead.SOUNDOne of the strongest parts of Concrete is the ending track. No lyrics are sung. Just a simple and slow hard guitar accompanied by resounding drums and a killer beat. It all comes together to create a track that captures the foreboding feeling of the narrative quite well. And to top it all off, the piece is catchy to listen to.The opening track does not even compare to the ED, but it does have strengths of its own. The beginning with the “Whoa!” and the general quietness. The middle with the various beats and nice singing. The end with the payoff to the build-up and the stepwise, quick finish. The OP comes together nicely, making it a nice lead-in to the episodes it precedes.The rest of the original soundtrack is filled with all manner of songs. “Revolution” gets at the rock-n-roll vibe that matches the cool (as in popular) vibes of the anime. “A Bittersweet Pill” is exactly that: a bittersweet song. And variations of the OP and the ED litter the anime. Concrete’s tracks are mostly there for atmospheric purposes, and, while almost none of the tracks positively stand out besides “Kinji Rare Ta Asobi” due to its origins and relations, the tracks are fitting for the anime and not much more.Sound-effects in Concrete are pretty standard for an anime filled to the brim with superpowers. Special shout-outs for Earth-chan’s squeaky sound when she makes a step and Kikko’s magical magic are deserved. And a smaller shout-out for the occasional English-spoken lines.Finally, voice acting performances are likewise standard. Sumire Uesaka as Kikko gives the witch a young, girly voice. Kaito Ishikawa as Jirou goes through some emotions. And Ayana Taketatsu as Earth-chan gives the bad-fighting, good-girl robot a cute way of speaking. About average overall not just for them but also for the other performances.Except Mr. Cloud that Kikko summoned for three seconds in episode one. His “Hi!” and “Bye!” were so jovial.ENJOYMENTThis anime falls into that weird category of shows that I find to be very well crafted yet neither enthralling nor appalling. It is just there.On the one hand, the show is interesting. The constant time shifts. The more mature themes that society deals with and that nearly everyone should think about. The cool battles and the pretty colors and the yet-to-be-revealed mysteries. It is an anime that requires me to think rather than just be amused by its brand of entertainment.Other parts were amusing. The running gag with Jiro calling Kikko by name and Kikko subsequently blushing was fun to me. And when the anime turned the romance into a vital part to Kikko’s character and the story, I was pretty darn happy. In other words, I was thinking and I was smiling.On the other hand, the show is uninteresting. The characters, despite how wacky or fun or different they may be, are not memorable. That is, they do not leave a strong impression. I do not see myself raving about Kikko weeks from now. I do not see myself talking about Jirou months from now. I do not see myself mentioning Emi years from now. They are cute, cool, and crafty, respectively, but not characters that have any lasting impact.The anime also lacks enticing comedy or drama. Hilarity is there. Drama does exist. But the level that these areas reach did not resonate with me deeply. A slight chuckle here, a head nod there. These reactions are about as much as this one got out of me.Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou may seem like a pretty strange anime. And it is. But what lays inside is a lot of execution. Thought-provoking themes, well-prepared characters, and surprisingly-cool visuals and music create an anime that more than readies itself for its second half. Another way to put it is that Superman wishes he was as super as this one is.SUMMARYStory: Great, themes on morality, race, and control, wrapped in a confusing yet purposeful narrative structure, establish a very strong first halfAnimation: Great, diverse color range, various artistic techniques boost appeal, above average actual animation, and very nice character designsCharacters: Great, Emi, Kikko, and Jirou are set up nicely, the side characters are purposeful, and the theme on justice ties them all togetherSound: Fine, good OP, great ED, okay OST, standard sound-effects, and about average VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, while the whole package is there and interesting, the unmemorable characters and low emotional resonance bring down the experienceFinal Score: 8/10 season following the break.

Despite how much she lives for Jirou. Her presence in the present is next to none. The cool part is that is the point. Emi is mysterious, so what better way to amplify her mystery than to exclude her almost entirely from what is arguably the more interesting timeline.As such, it is inevitable that she should have (read: better have) some important scenes in the second half. But, for now, she is more than utilized in the first.Kikko almost remains as mysterious as Emi, but, thankfully, the anime goes into a bit more detail with the witch. This wording is not an insult; she is canonically a witch. Or, as her companion Ullr calls her, “Star Child.” For much of the season, the audience sees Kikko as nothing more than a kindhearted girl. Still, her main role is acting as a lens the audience uses to understand Concrete: She participates in the events, but she is always posing questions the audience should think about.For Kikko, Jirou is love at first sight. Literally. She joins the Superhuman Bureau in order to be close to Jirou and to understand the world he lives in. While with him and through Emi, she learns of the beast within Jirou. A similar trait she shares with the man. Yet she remains rather passive for the majority of the season. Then the last few episodes come around.Throughout the season, it was hinted that Kikko seeks energy in the form of human happiness. During the last arc, however, her true reason for being on Earth is revealed: She is looking for a suitor – i.e., a “spouse” as Ullr puts it – in order to officially take over the “devil realm” where she presumably comes from.Her eviler side arrives because she believes Claude to be Jirou. Claude says and does what she wants Jirou to say and do. And, of course, her love for Jirou plays a role, too. So she mistakenly makes the assumption, turning her against the Superhuman Bureau and, more importantly, Jirou. As such, she indirectly forces Jirou away: Emi agrees to help Jirou get Kikko back on the condition that he forevermore stays away from Kikko.While Jirou keeps his promise, Kikko fights to understand Jirou and to get him back. In the present, she becomes like Emi, chasing after the man that she has come to love so much. And, again like Emi, she is in a strong spot as a character for when the second half rolls around.This leaves Jirou. Jirou is considered human despite his incredible and incredibly dangerous power. He is adopted, his idol is the now-deceased (maybe; still somewhat unconfirmed) Rainbow Knight, and he works with the Superhuman Bureau in order to do right by his father and by his hero.Arguably the main protagonist, Jirou sees many of the events. They test his convictions. More specifically, they test his definition of justice. The side characters help to make this happen. The episodes usually bring a new set of characters who get their own backstory as well as another new way for Jirou to view justice.For example, helping out a known, helpful superhuman. Stopping an old, misunderstood grudge. Showing an old friend what justice thinks of him. Fighting what he calls “beasts.” Realizing what others think of their own powers. Witnessing someone who always values good. Explaining his side to a fellow admirer. Understanding limits. Having the strength to stand for what one believes in. And learning the sad, unfortunate truth about his hero.And in regards to the narrative themes on morality, race, and government, justice is paramount. All three themes rely on justice. On what justice means and brings and gives to those involved and not involved. And like those themes, justice is not always defined.Jirou puts it best: “But not everyone can be black or white. Even if they’re grey…. If they believe in justice, I want to be the ally of justice.” Jirou wants to be like his hero Rainbow Knight. Someone that does not view life as either yes or no. Up or down. Left or right. He wants to be the man that aids justice. In whatever way that may be.Justice is not just Jirou’s theme but all of the characters’ theme. Emi and Kikko and the myriad of other side characters justify justice in their own way. Jirou, though, takes it to the highest level: He embodies justice. He comes to the conclusion that he is “no longer justice.” Thus, he pursues being an “ally of justice” to protect everyone, transitioning from the main protagonist to the main antagonist. Due to the nature of the narrative, this transition happens repeatedly, but it shows how multisided Jirou’s character is.What will become of Jirou is anyone’s guess, but he is saying and doing what he should have been all along.Like the narrative, Concrete has only just begun to work with its characters. But, what has been given about them and what they represent thus far, they are primed and ready for what lays ahead.SOUNDOne of the strongest parts of Concrete is the ending track. No lyrics are sung. Just a simple and slow hard guitar accompanied by resounding drums and a killer beat. It all comes together to create a track that captures the foreboding feeling of the narrative quite well. And to top it all off, the piece is catchy to listen to.The opening track does not even compare to the ED, but it does have strengths of its own. The beginning with the “Whoa!” and the general quietness. The middle with the various beats and nice singing. The end with the payoff to the build-up and the stepwise, quick finish. The OP comes together nicely, making it a nice lead-in to the episodes it precedes.The rest of the original soundtrack is filled with all manner of songs. “Revolution” gets at the rock-n-roll vibe that matches the cool (as in popular) vibes of the anime. “A Bittersweet Pill” is exactly that: a bittersweet song. And variations of the OP and the ED litter the anime. Concrete’s tracks are mostly there for atmospheric purposes, and, while almost none of the tracks positively stand out besides “Kinji Rare Ta Asobi” due to its origins and relations, the tracks are fitting for the anime and not much more.Sound-effects in Concrete are pretty standard for an anime filled to the brim with superpowers. Special shout-outs for Earth-chan’s squeaky sound when she makes a step and Kikko’s magical magic are deserved. And a smaller shout-out for the occasional English-spoken lines.Finally, voice acting performances are likewise standard. Sumire Uesaka as Kikko gives the witch a young, girly voice. Kaito Ishikawa as Jirou goes through some emotions. And Ayana Taketatsu as Earth-chan gives the bad-fighting, good-girl robot a cute way of speaking. About average overall not just for them but also for the other performances.Except Mr. Cloud that Kikko summoned for three seconds in episode one. His “Hi!” and “Bye!” were so jovial.ENJOYMENTThis anime falls into that weird category of shows that I find to be very well crafted yet neither enthralling nor appalling. It is just there.On the one hand, the show is interesting. The constant time shifts. The more mature themes that society deals with and that nearly everyone should think about. The cool battles and the pretty colors and the yet-to-be-revealed mysteries. It is an anime that requires me to think rather than just be amused by its brand of entertainment.Other parts were amusing. The running gag with Jiro calling Kikko by name and Kikko subsequently blushing was fun to me. And when the anime turned the romance into a vital part to Kikko’s character and the story, I was pretty darn happy. In other words, I was thinking and I was smiling.On the other hand, the show is uninteresting. The characters, despite how wacky or fun or different they may be, are not memorable. That is, they do not leave a strong impression. I do not see myself raving about Kikko weeks from now. I do not see myself talking about Jirou months from now. I do not see myself mentioning Emi years from now. They are cute, cool, and crafty, respectively, but not characters that have any lasting impact.The anime also lacks enticing comedy or drama. Hilarity is there. Drama does exist. But the level that these areas reach did not resonate with me deeply. A slight chuckle here, a head nod there. These reactions are about as much as this one got out of me.Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou may seem like a pretty strange anime. And it is. But what lays inside is a lot of execution. Thought-provoking themes, well-prepared characters, and surprisingly-cool visuals and music create an anime that more than readies itself for its second half. Another way to put it is that Superman wishes he was as super as this one is.SUMMARYStory: Great, themes on morality, race, and control, wrapped in a confusing yet purposeful narrative structure, establish a very strong first halfAnimation: Great, diverse color range, various artistic techniques boost appeal, above average actual animation, and very nice character designsCharacters: Great, Emi, Kikko, and Jirou are set up nicely, the side characters are purposeful, and the theme on justice ties them all togetherSound: Fine, good OP, great ED, okay OST, standard sound-effects, and about average VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, while the whole package is there and interesting, the unmemorable characters and low emotional resonance bring down the experienceFinal Score: 8/10', '(This is a review for both seasons of the show, as they don’t really work as stand-alone pieces and it wouldn’t be useful to review them as such. That said, no spoilers for either series is in this review, so it is generally safe reading)Setting up a premise for Concrete Revolutio is almost impossible. The plot threads of this series twist and articulate in almost imperscrutable webs, changing the narrative landscape of the series in almost every episode. As a narrative technique this is a double-edged sword, while on one hand, it makes for an almost mesmerizing viewing experience, as events unfold in front of...our eyes in unpredictable ways, its borderline nonsensical twists reinforcing the fundamental powerlessness of the protagonists in the face of systems way bigger than them; on the other it can make for a story that is very challenging to follow as a linear plot, given that the viewer is required to pay attention to every single line of dialogue, while at the same time being careful to remember each flash-back and flash-forward, even those originally shown with no context.To try and sum it up, at its core Concrete Revolutio uses an alternate version of post-war Japan, where both humans and super-human exist, as the backdrop for a story about political allegiance, insecurity and the difficulty of discerning an abstract concept of righteousness (or JUSTICE!) in an era of information overload. Each episode generally follows the “super-human bureau”, an organization which purpose is to both protect super-humans and protect humans from super-humans, dealing with relatively self-contained issues, while flash-backs and flash-forward are used to both expand on the core themes of each episode, and to weave the self-contained events in a wider narrative tapestry.While the repeated and constant use of the word “JUSTICE!” and the subtly comic book inspired art style of the backgrounds, might make Concrete Revolutio a good fit to be slotted within the rising trend of western-superhero inspired anime, both is theming and aesthetic, when looked at closer, seem to be more deep-rooted in Japan that one might expect. Super-humans in this case, are not simply a transposition of western superhero tropes. The term is instead used as an umbrella for any kind of fantasy fiction trope, from aliens and yokai, to sentai heroes and robots. Aesthetically this makes for a very interesting choice, as the series often plays on contrasting the complex morality of its narrative, with fights that seem borrowed directly from the overactive imagination of a cartoon-loving Japanese kid, with clear stand-ins for iconic fictional figures like Daitan III or Godzilla, facing each other in big monster fights.This conflict between innocent ideals and the complexities of reality is one of the themes at the core of the series, as idealistic characters end up facing a reality made of hidden motives and overly intricate plots in a manner that can be reminiscent of some weird overlapping of the themes of Metal Gear Solid 2 and the original Gundam.Unlike Metal Gear Solid 2 though, Concrete Revolutio doesn’t just outline a world where the control of information frames righteousness and the overload of information makes it so that it is basically impossible to discern schemes from truths, but goes one step further, diving deep into the insecurities and paranoia that that environment creates, in a more personal and character-driven way. This approach works quite well, as it avoids the cliché “innocence lost” kind of character arc, which seemed what the series was going for in the first couple of episodes, instead developing in the way more interesting direction of characters having to grapple with their failability, and the failability of the systems they uphold, making for portraits of doubt and paranoia that are quite relatable in the current political climate.The series uses its episodic nature to also relate to many other themes, from the capitalistic exploitation of minorities, to PTSD, to imperialism. The results of this are generally varying, as some episodes are bound to be better executed than others. Really, the main flaw of Concrete Revolutio, aside from the fact that the plot can sometimes be a bit difficult to follow, is that it seems to try to tackle too many things without then successfully managing to pull them together in one thread, which makes a great part of the series feel a bit scattershot.While the trick of Concrete Revolution is to willingly confuse the viewer by flashing a multitude of unrelated concepts and plots, in order to replicate the hopeless struggle for truth of its protagonists, some of those plots end up feeling a bit redundant and odd even in that context. While the number of episodes the series got is pretty much perfect (24 episodes divided into 2 seasons), allowing it to drive its points home without overstaying its welcome, it would have been nice if a couple of the most “out there” bits were trimmed, in favour of more exploration of the main characters.Ultimately, it should be noted that I do not have the historical knowledge to trace any comparison between Concrete Revolutio and the politics of actual post-war Japan, but I can say that the core themes that the series engages with are perfectly relevant and relatable even in the present.Carried by writing that feels untypically personal for a mainstream anime, Concrete Revolutio is a fittingly harrowing meditation on what it means to try to do good in a world where truth can be easily manipulated and the systems themselves feel broken. While not all of it always work, and the tone can sometimes bounce around a bit too much, it is, in the end, an extremely interesting series that might have flown maybe a bit too much under the radar when it was originally released.Cool.

Good. Watch it.', 'Before watching Concrete Revolutio, there\'s much to like and catch your eye. Bones is always an interesting studio, the artstyle pops, and it\'s about superhumans. But the real problem is what comes after.Concrete Revolutio follows an organization that seeks out superhumans and protects them in order to maintain public order. This show\'s plot isn\'t necessarily beat up some guy abusing his power and terrorizing the city which is a good thing. But it starts to fall wayward soon after its start.The big issue I have with the show is that nothing is properly connected. This is not because of the occasional transitions between the current...timeline, which shows the MC after having left the Superhuman Bureau, and the past timeline in which he\'s still a member. In fact the most interesting part of the show is finding out how the story got to where it was. The problem is that plot points are all so dull. The cases that the Superhuman Bureau works don\'t catch the interest of viewers and the big failing is the it doesn\'t emphasize the main characters enough. As an episodic style anime, Concrete Revolutio fails to strike a balance between the plot, the main characters, and the small cast that gets their one episode slot.What happens here is that the extras get too much time and the main plot is nowhere near emphasized enough in the story. Each episode features a side plot that isn\'t linked in a way that draws more interest into the main plot. In the end this makes it feel like filler, a wasted 20 minutes of time that could\'ve detailed something else. A few of the episodes just felt like ""another day at the office"". This could be okay if the main cast had more time in the story and we got to learn more about them, but this isn\'t the case.The best part of this anime was definitely the art. The few fights looked nice and as stated before everything pops and is vibrant. The backgrounds are fantastic and I definitely plan to save a few of them.Overall, Concrete Revolutio isn\'t particularly worth watching this season. The show seemed pretty unique, which is something I\'m all for, but it was executed poorly.

Dealing with hard topics such as mentioned above is interesting, applying the same principles across all other superhero works and review what political and social backlash these superheroes should have brought.The show has episodic nature yet it has consistent build up to a...grander story. The show's presentation was one of the most confusing piece of work I've seen lately. It presents with different timelines where events takes place in seemingly random time slot in the anime.Myriad of colours with many range of hues definitely keeps the eye candy going. The art direction is also incredibly delicious, but at times there are characters that doesn't seem to belong in the same universe (i.e. Fuutarou vs Jirou). But that perhaps may be the charm in Choujin Gensou, where you have fantasy of different superhero characters mashed into one.Studio Bones could have taken a more serious approach but decided to go with mid way point where it's a still a little light on the topic. With that you get an anime that can both take on one critical issue while remaining cutesy colourful anime that's appealing to most.As a disclaimer, I am biased as elephant when it comes to superhero content.Should you recommend Choujin Gensou?: Maybe, if they are into human rights grander story.

Concrete Revolutio. yeah.So, let me say the most important thing first. Although I gave this show 8/10, I did not enjoy it at all. This show is that type of a work that has very high value, yet no one really enjoys it (akin to shakespearean plays). The characters are interesting, the animation is vibrant, the problems and solution it proposes are reasonably well thought out, and yet it's utter pain to watch, with a band-aid in form of vivid colors and mechas.Incidentallly, there's just one thing that ruins the enjoyment, which is the pacing/way of storytelling. It's that LET'S-FUCKING-JUMP-ALL-OVER-THE-TIMELINE-BETWEEN-PEACEFUL-DAYS-AND-THE-END-GAME-FINALE-FULL-OF-TREATCHERY-AND-STRIFE kind of deal that...all these overabmitious animes use.So, If you watch anime in order to gain something from it, this might be a show for you.

A show I severely underestimated solely because it looked silly at first glance.The show was a massive critical success in Japan but it failed commercially, an overlooked gem so to speak.I loved most of my time I spent on watching the first season of Concrete Revolutio: Superhuman Phantasmagoria and here\'s why :The plot of ConRevo centers around society and Superhumans with themes of discrimination, different moral compasses and justice.If Superhumans are the one protecting normal people, then who is protecting the superhumans? Enter the Superhuman Bureau, an organization that studies...and oversees superhumans, consisting of 6 people in total. They\'re the primary figure dealing with everything related to Superhumans, the police being left out of supernatural cases save for only one detective they have.The show depicts justice as something that comes in many forms, it\'s neither black nor is it white. At the end of the day, justice is not objective, everyone can feel justified in their own actions and be technically correct in believing they\'re justified. Nothing is inherently villainous, ""villainy"" is something that really just serves a purpose you don\'t agree with.These sort of gray morals make Jirou Hitoyoshi, the main protagonist of the show and the Superhuman Bureu\'s No.1 superhero, to start questioning the Bureau\'s method of handling and \'\'protecting\'\' superhumans, beings he idolizes.The contents and themes of the story aside - the show is depicting it\'s events in an achronological order - meaning each episode constantly shifts time periods while packed to the brim with events. It\'s non-linear structure makes it hard to follow for some people but it shouldn\'t prove to be any trouble if you\'re even remotely acquinted with any work that presents itself in a manner like this.All characters have unique and stylish character designs and are quirky in their own way.Jiro is at a first glance - a professional guy who\'s only focus is his job but he has some really subtle fanboyish tendencies towards Superhumans. He doesn\'t know his own idea of justice, but he knows that he wants to be a hero and that\'s his conviction to push forward.And then there are the rest of the Bureau\'s members, which consist of Emi, an attractive and sly Yokai woman who is supposedly in a relationship with Jiro who she seems to care a great deal for, followed by the witch Kikko, who is really just a Mahou Shoujo with a naive personality, she has a crush on Jiro ever since she first encountered him and he\'s the reason why she joined the Superhuman Bureau in the first place.The rest of the colorful cast comes in the form of Fuurota, a ghost who has remained a child since forever, he\'s obnoxious but is a caring friend when it\'s the right time for it, coming after him is Hyouma Yoshimura, a man in his 30s better known under his alias \'\'Mr Jaguar\'\' - he\'s capable of stopping time and transforming into a humanoid Jaguar, he\'s a genius physicist and is the creator of Jiro\'s stylish car which transforms into a Mecha centaur.And the last member of the Superhuman Bureau is Akita Daishi, their boss and the one responsible for strategising and overseeing their operations.All of them have a certain layer of mystery to them (most likely left out to be explored in the second season) which makes us more involved with them by seeing more and more information about them slowly unveil.Concrete Revolutio looks simply amazing. The vibrant neon colors, comic dot shading and amazing character designs by Noizi Itou who is better known as the artist of series like Shakugan no Shana and Haruhi Suzumiya, as well as the character designer for the anime original \'\'Another\'\'.Needless to say, ConRevo\'s character designs are her best by an extremely large margin.Complimenting the amazing art is the fantastic animation done by a lot of talented key animators including but not limited to :Yutaka Nakamura (Cowboy Bebop The Movie, Sword of the Stranger, Soul Eater)Norimitsu Suzuki (Star Driver, Soul Eater Persona 4)Yasushi Muraki (Eureka Seven, Star Driver, Gundam)and the newest animator one in the staff Kenta Yokoya (Captain Earth, Darling in the FranXX, Dragon Ball Super).The animations is fluid, dynamic and varied. Thanks to the show\'s rough and vibrant art a lot of different animation styles work with it, which results in each key animator applying their own style without the fear of consistency, so the animation can get from extremely smooth with proper weight to it to an extremely snappy, dynamic Imaishi-like style, and it all fits together.As per usual with every Bones original, it\'s filled to the brim with sakuga.The insert tracks present in Concrete Revolutio consist of energy pumping techno and rock instrumentals usually with a slow build up and a strong impactful drop towards the main portion of the song which is perfectly timed with action scenes at all times.It helps keep you on the edge of your seat, pumps you with adrenaline and makes you move to the rhythm.Overall, Concrete Revolutio: Superhuman Phantasmagoria is a great show severely misunderstood because of it\'s achronological order, dealing with relevant themes such as discrimination and morals in it\'s own way, sprinkled with some social critique and accompanied with great animation and sound. It\'s definitely worth a watch, but it\'s also definitely not for everyone. and oversees superhumans, consisting of 6 people in total.

The vibrant neon colors, comic dot shading and amazing character designs by Noizi Itou who is better known as the artist of series like Shakugan no Shana and Haruhi Suzumiya, as well as the character designer for the anime original \'\'Another\'\'.Needless to say, ConRevo\'s character designs are her best by an extremely large margin.Complimenting the amazing art is the fantastic animation done by a lot of talented key animators including but not limited to :Yutaka Nakamura (Cowboy Bebop The Movie, Sword of the Stranger, Soul Eater)Norimitsu Suzuki (Star Driver, Soul Eater Persona 4)Yasushi Muraki (Eureka Seven, Star Driver, Gundam)and the newest animator one in the staff Kenta Yokoya (Captain Earth, Darling in the FranXX, Dragon Ball Super).The animations is fluid, dynamic and varied. Thanks to the show\'s rough and vibrant art a lot of different animation styles work with it, which results in each key animator applying their own style without the fear of consistency, so the animation can get from extremely smooth with proper weight to it to an extremely snappy, dynamic Imaishi-like style, and it all fits together.As per usual with every Bones original, it\'s filled to the brim with sakuga.The insert tracks present in Concrete Revolutio consist of energy pumping techno and rock instrumentals usually with a slow build up and a strong impactful drop towards the main portion of the song which is perfectly timed with action scenes at all times.It helps keep you on the edge of your seat, pumps you with adrenaline and makes you move to the rhythm.Overall, Concrete Revolutio: Superhuman Phantasmagoria is a great show severely misunderstood because of it\'s achronological order, dealing with relevant themes such as discrimination and morals in it\'s own way, sprinkled with some social critique and accompanied with great animation and sound. It\'s definitely worth a watch, but it\'s also definitely not for everyone.', 'Concrete Revolutio is a story about justice, but not in the traditional sense. The story does not use justice as a means of black and white character motivation or to move forward a sequence of events. It does not involve someone seeking revenge for the murder of their family, or a magical little girl fighting for love and justice.Concrete Revolutio instead gives a story about seeking out answers that no one can give you, specifically about justice and what seeking justice truly means. This means that the characters analyze justice for themselves, and in the end, come to a conclusion about whether or not...justice is worth seeking out, if it exists or not, and who deserves it.This means that justice is not a simple plot devise in Conrevo, but instead a theme, a question instead of an answer, a confusing topic that the characters think about in every episode. Justice is, however, not the only theme conveyed in this work, but also many others, such as love, naivety, and the human condition. It’s a show that is selling an idea about justice, about what the character believe about justice and if justice can be manufactured and sold as a fantasy.Conrevo does all this in a setting that is at first very much unlike our own. It contains monsters, beasts, robots that beat up bad guys, aliens, magical girls, and superhumans. Over time, however, viewers with a keen eye can point out how things that at first seemed so foreign can also be symbols for real things, things that were in and going on in the time period Conrevo takes place, which is the 1950s through the 70s, using the cold war to its advantage to get its themes across.The characters are used mostly as a means of getting ideas and beliefs out. Some characters are merely there to convey their beliefs, and some are symbols of other things. This is not to say the characters aren’t well written. On the contrary, the characters must be masterfully written in order to get the themes and symbols across to the audience, although it is hidden through dialogue, imagery, and symbols.The way Conrevo presents the story in highly unconventional. In every episode we start with one point in time, and in every episode we skip to another point in time which has relevance. Some have called it messy, however I have formed the opinion that it is well planned out and fits in the overall structure and the theme the show wants to convey.The art style, looking similar to comic book strips, is fitting for the subject matter. With a show about superhumans, robots, aliens, and magical girls, why not have a wacky art style? But this style also fits with old style Japanese manga characters, such as Cyborg 009 and Devilman. It is obviously fitting for a show that deals with stripping away the role of the superhuman and questions justice to have this imagery, just as most these characters from the old days fought for justice.Overall, Conrevo is well worth your time. It has amazing thematic pacing, strange but warranted storytelling, having time skips in every episode, and is one of the most original and well planned out anime I have seen in a long while. justice is worth seeking out, if it exists or not, and who deserves it.This means that justice is not a simple plot devise in Conrevo, but instead a theme, a question instead of an answer, a confusing topic that the characters think about in every episode.

The episodes about the family & the three small timer comedians were soo good as far as I remember.So I\'d still suggest you all to give this a try,just remember the whole thing will mostly be random and episodic and there won\'t be much explanation about lots of things.For the bare minimum, the character design and animation is 100/100 so you can just watch the show for the animation and give your eyes some delight. too late by then.The whole anime is just pretty inconsistent.Presenting characters out of nowhere with one single story and making them a messiah, superfast pacing with no proper indroduction of the characters nor the plotline.Even the main character cast is not much explored.Also there\'s zero demonstration for the superpowers,which is something you can\'t expect from this kind of show.I don\'t mind a cocktail of space rangers,magical girls,ghosts,mutated monkey soldiers,MHA quirks and all kinda superpower stuff,but damn I want to know what superpowers the main cast posseses for the very least.Don\'t make the show this much vague for the love of God.Also would it hurt to add perhaps a table spoon of worldbuilding?Also the show gets confusing time to time as there are multiple timelines running and they just throw them into random episodes by taking them out of context.The addition of weirdly executed flashbacks, stories that run in parallel and random occurances that took place before or after the present timeline is pretty uncomfortable.You\'d often wonder if you\'ve left one episode behind as the things get confusing all the time.Despite ranting this much, I still like this anime as you don\'t really get to see a superpower-based anime to go this much deep into the wild.You get to see a manipulative government,students rioting,anxiety all around the atmosphere-government,superheroes,civilians,our very own protagonist,the Bureau-no one\'s an exception,no one\'s morally all white or all black and that\'s why the concept feels way more relatable than the kind of stuff you\'d usually see.It\'s like reading Mario Puzo\'s The Fourth K,a political drama that was pretty well written.

So if you don't like politics or just don't really care for them it may hinder your enjoyment.Now for the story itself. It is hard to keep up some times because of the amount of flash-forwards and backward. It is kinda like Memento in that sense, but it's used in a way...that doesn't overcomplicate the story and in fact, makes the watcher more engrossed in the story.

Fate/Zero: Onegai! Einzbern Soudanshitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13263/Fate_Zero__Onegai_Einzbern_Soudanshitsu,"[""The Fate/Zero Counsel Specials are something that are to be watched after finishing the entirety of Fate/Zero, doing so otherwise may bring about confusion or spoil events to come.The story to these 6 specials is very simple, and is not the main focus to these more lightly-toned, comedic and 'educational' episodes. However, it was designed simply enough to be enjoyable so the viewer can enjoy the comedy while not being too lost in the hints towards the 'plot' of the specials, the over-arcing story of the main series, and the series that Fate/Zero Prequels, Fate/Stay Night. Overall, the story gets...a 6; On its own it would leave much to be desired, but it fulfills its roll adequately, and giving the viewer a bit more than they would expect.The art is fairly similar to the main series, but lower quality animation for the most part. However, this less photo-realistic style suits this special quite well by having the familiarity of the main series while adapting a chibi-style for educational parts and allowing comedic expressions and elements while keeping that beautiful ufotable style. Overall, the art gets a 9 in my book; Keeping, for the most part, the high-quality character designs and backgrounds from the main series while sneaking in minor changes to fit the lighter tones of the special gives it high marks, but the directing style is a little lackluster.The sound design and soundtrack (the little that is used) is of equal quality to the main series, which was a surprise to me. It was a pleasant surprise as you might imagine, and the inclusion of some of the OST of Fate/Zero added that right atmosphere at the right times, and the general sound effects were high quality. The sound quality gets a 10; The high quality of the effects, the excellent performance of the Seiyuus and the inclusion and good timing of the main series's OST made the sound a very strong pillar of quality in this special.The characters for this part were a little bit tricky. Although similar in look to the characters we know from the main series, they also had to be altered a bit to fit in the more light-hearted and comedic style special. Only 4 servants appear, along with the mysterious student Zecchan and instructor Irisviel von Einzbern, but each of them were well crafted, having their own quips and contributions to the serious-humor of this special. However, since this series was very short, it did not leave much time nor leave much space for the characters to develop, only leap across points. With all that being accounted for, the Character part gets a 7; Good adaptations of the characters we knew into a lighter-toned mini-series, and a new character that has a good base, all of which complemented each other quite well.In all, this series is a very nice short series to watch after finishing the 2-cour Fate/Zero. However, if you are looking for something more akin to the tonality of Fate/Zero, it would be better to place those expectations asides while watching this. Fate/Zero: Onegai! Einzbern Soudanshitsu is mostly a somewhat comedic special that focuses on answering some possible questions you may have raised during the series, all the while explaining the troubles of a few of the characters from the main show. If you are looking to spend some time having a few chuckles, this special does deliver, even if you don't have questions about the Holy Grail Wars. In all, if you enjoyed Fate/Zero and had some questions and/or wanted to see a slightly more comedic take on a handful of its characters, then this is certainly something you could enjoy. a 6; On its own it would leave much to be desired, but it fulfills its roll adequately, and giving the viewer a bit more than they would expect.The art is fairly similar to the main series, but lower quality animation for the most part.

To be clear, the Tiger Dojo is the room that the FSN player ends up in when he chooses a bad ending in the VN. The Einzbern Soudanshitsu plays much the same role for F/Z.Story: The consultation room carries very little of its own story, instead relying on the parent work of F/Z for the story. It does help to fill in some missing information for the new-to-Fate series watcher, at least in the first 2 episodes, and even VN readers will discover a...new thing or two.Having watched this after watching F/Z, I might suggest that this show can or even should be watched in line with certain of the Fate/zero episodes so that the watcher can create (partially) the same tone that FSN VN has when when the FSN reader hits a bad ending. While there may be some references which the watcher won\'t understand without having read the FSN VN or without having seen at least the FSN Fate and UBW paths in their entirety, I didn\'t see anything in particular which might spoil F/Z in particular episodes.Episode 1 can be watched any time after F/Z episode 1. Episode 2 can be watched after F/Z episode 4. Episode 3 is a little weird from a timeline perspective but should probably be watched after F/Z episode 4 or later.

Animation wise, there is much less movement than in F/Z.Sound: The sound was merely good (I didn\'t notice it in particular).Character: I think this actually adds to the character of the involved parties. While it might not be canon, episodes 3 to 6 carry an interesting tone for each of the characters and aid in understanding what that character was thinking or feeling given the corresponding time period in F/Z.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it, given my general enjoyment of the Tiger Dojo.

As such it explains quite a bit of background-information, both on the war in general and on certain servants. While this is mostly lighthearted fun (“you snuck in all proud of yourself just because a cool-sounding Kajiura theme was playing”), there soon starts to be an increasing amount of weirdly dark scenes. And while Irisviel seems to be quite nice for the most part, some of her decisions become questionable...All of this would already be quite nice, but the thing that really turns this into more than just an explanatory series is the absolutely magnificant...second halve of the last episode which takes a sudden turn into a MUCH darker direction. second halve of the last episode which takes a sudden turn into a MUCH darker direction.']"

So when I saw this I figured, “What the angel, I enjoyed The Galaxy Railways I should enjoy this.” and I was not disappointed. It had action, mystery; a true sci fi adventure. So few anime have a space setting these days and that’s disturbing because that’s how I got into anime in the first place. It was great to see other characters from the Leiji-verse interact with the crew of the Big-1, because that doesn’t happen in the original Galaxy Railways series. The story was strange...and emotional, par for the course with Leiji sensei. The art has his familiar style, which may be off putting to those not familiar with it, but great for those who are. The only problems with this series all stem from lack of familiarity with the Leiji-verse. But that’s okay because it would encourage newcomers to check out the origins of these characters and familiarize themselves with some of the classics. Don’t know who Maetel and Tetsuro are? Watch Galaxy Express 999. Don’t understand why Manabu Yuki acts this way? Watch The Galaxy Railways. Also, since it’s a sequel, it helps to watch The Galaxy Railways first to know the cast, but it’s not necessary as this is a self contained story and they sum up the vital points for you. I do want to complain about the subtitles though. It was on par with some fan subs and not up to the usual quality I expect from CR. In summation, watch it! At four episodes you’ve got nothing to lose and emotional, par for the course with Leiji sensei.

Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25907/Glass_no_Hana_to_Kowasu_Sekai,"['Asuka, Yukinon, and Menma become cyberpunk mahou shoujos and fight viruses in a speculative fiction setting under the supervision of Shin Sekai Yori\'s director, Masashi Ishihama, and Nozaki-kun\'s head writer and script composer, Yoshiko Nakamura. While this sounds like it has all the potential of being fucking great, all it turned into was an emotionally detached snorefest, trying to cram too much into too little and not doing anything with its assets.Not to say that it isn\'t without its highlights: it\'s certainly pretty, with some set pieces being actually gorgeous, making use of its movie sized budget to make sure shots...flow into one another with animation at a near consistent high note (though there\'s more than a few wonky edits), and the music isn\'t too bad (though its reliance on piano pieces as a gateway to melodrama feels forced and almost comical). There are brief moments that made my bottom lip quiver a little, so I guess it must be doing something right there. But even then, the film didn\'t really earn those on its own merits, it just used a lot of cheap tricks to pull emotion out from the viewer, complete with a ""shoot the dog"" sequence, ultimately making it feel shallow and working off of the audience\'s own inherent connection to those images instead of building something on its own. I can see it pulling a few heart strings if you\'re new to this genre of Dark Mahou Shoujo shows, but for us that are well versed in its various trappings it\'ll feel like a carbon copy of a certain other Dark Magical Girl show from 2014, down to its major plot points, world, and \'big reveal\'. The character development in this is actually not that bad either, in that the ensemble definitely experience worthwhile changes as the film reaches its climax, which is neat, though the way they went about developing them was all wrong (I\'ll explain this point in a bit). There\'s also a reasonably fascinating setting here, one that approaches a prototypical speculative fiction backdrop in a somewhat refreshing way, and that\'s something worth crediting it for. While the notion of a post-apocalyptic world where lives are lived out through data is nothing new in this medium or any other, the manner in which this is presented places it further from the tech singularity of standard genre fare and into something just a teensy bit more unique than a few of its influences and contemporaries. With the correct approach, the universe being established here could be salvaged and make for good franchise fodder, though they\'d have to steer clear of the pitfalls in worldbuilding that plagued this particular product.But that\'s all I can really say in its favor. While the notorious pair at its head are known for spearheading incredible stories, this film somehow manages to pull off the unthinkable by being a paragon of mediocre storytelling. About a solid fourth of this hour long feature is nothing but infodumping, throwing a lexical onslaught of meaningless technobabble at the audience in the most repetitive forms of exposition available: the dreaded ""as you know"" and ""as we both know"" banter. This vice extends to the general dialogue as well, which comes off as inorganic and honestly a tad annoying at times, with characters constantly reaffirming their feelings towards themselves (at eachother) in bloated solipsistic monologues. I understand they\'re not meant to be human, and a certain form of uncanny valley is to be expected in their mannerisms, but they never felt strange or compelling in their inhuman behavior, they just felt poorly handled. I just couldn\'t really care what happened to any of these ""people"", and the fact that they start off as the most derivative forms of their moe archetypes doesn\'t help that cause either.Going off on the exposition dump is one of the most ill conceived montage sequences I\'ve ever witnessed. While the match cuts in the film\'s central Cute Girls Processing All Sorts of Things segment were impressive and the whole idea of it works well on paper, the fact that what should have been the most interesting part of the whole film was condensed into three consecutive music videos makes me incredibly frustrated. This shoehorned appeal to pathos severely disrupted the flow and pacing of the film, and this ties back to my previous statement about the film lacking ""true"" emotional resonance: in lieu of fleshing these experiences out, all three of the major character arcs are given life in 5 minutes through a combination of ""watch these cute girls make food together! so cute!"" and ""watch these cute girls look sad as they stare at tragedies! so sad!"" It\'s just bad usage of film length overall and boy is it frickin\' dull. Considering this makes up about a half of the film\'s runtime, and the second half owes all of its impact on how well we connect to the first half, the whole experience just sort of falls apart right there before it ever really began.Overall, this just isn\'t worth the investment, which is upsetting considering it\'s founded on some pretty solid ideas and found itself in the hands of some rather talented people. I felt like a big issue with this came from it feeling like an aborted television series, like if it were a recap film to a show never made (think MSG: F91). If this were given even half an hour more to breathe, perhaps we\'d have something worth talking about here, but instead it\'s just a mess. flow into one another with animation at a near consistent high note (though there\'s more than a few wonky edits), and the music isn\'t too bad (though its reliance on piano pieces as a gateway to melodrama feels forced and almost comical).

The story grabs your attention in the first 10 minutes as Dual deletes her best friend Sumire and then the sudden apperence of Remo. The story flows through out the anime making it really easy to understand.9/10ArtThe art was very good it wasn't very detailed like other A-1 animes but all was written off by the excellent story. The background CG is very vivid in colors which bring out the artist's emotions.

To no avail.Story: 4Sad to say, I didn't understand what the heck was going on throughout the movie, especially the more hectic part towards the end. The height of my sadness of a cute girl was dying was as great as I was in my 'wtf is going on' mode. It was not coherent at all, and I'm left from start to finish just going 'yep, this just happened, and no one is going to tell...me why'.Art:8The saving grace of this movie. The art was amazing, I'm pretty sure it was the cost of producing this kind of art that caused this movie to be only 1 hr long. There was one scene of various locations around the world, that actually made me go 'wow'.Sound: 7The music was good, however, I do question the selection and the creation of these pieces. Some of the piano songs did not reflect the sort of mood that the scene was trying to relay, and I was left quite emotionally confused. The songs on their own are very nice to listen to, and I would even invest in the soundtrack if it were to be released. Just... I don't know, get a better music director.Character: 6We see minimal character development in this movie, mostly because of the lack of plot explanation and the contribution of a short screening time. Although they were cute girls with separate personalities, none of them are qualified to be of any recognition in my after-movie life. There's nothing that I can defend any of them with in terms of decisions that they make in the movie if someone came up to me and told me this character was trash.Enjoyment: 6From my earlier comments, you can probably tell I'm not very satisfied with this movie at all. I think if there was more time spent on developing characters and making the movie coherent even by a little bit I would've enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did. There was a recent promo in my country before I was released, and that raised my expectations to quite a high level. Only to be disappointed I guess.Overall: 6If there was a part 2, I would watch it in my spare time. About this movie, I would suggest that you watch it, ONLY if you're absolutely bored and have nothing to do. I swear if you watch it because of what the ads tell you, you'll be disappointed. Also, you would watch it if you were interested in magical girls, but with a spin, as there are a lot of magically themed 'magic' in this movie.

Combine that with a bit of sci-fi, cute girls, adventure, and mysterious worlds and you get Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai. Now, I have to admit, watching this film for the first time felt like taking a chemistry course. It’s like all sorts of ideas thrown together at once. For such a product, it would have been better off as a TV series. However, Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai has something to offer and that’s a world of strange wonders.The film is directed by Masashi Ishihama. Anyone familiar with sci-fi thrillers...like Shinsekai Yori or Speed Grapher may recognize his work. Thus, diving into this film requires a bit of thinking behind the logics. The premise itself takes on a unique approach that transits between fantasy, reality, and emotions. The movie starts off with Dorothy and Dual doing their usual business until they run into a peculiar girl named Remo. From there, it becomes obvious that she is anything but ordinary. In fact, there’s hardly anything ordinary from the beginning as we witness a multitude of dimensional-like realms, reality distortion, and even altered timelines. Remo is particularly strange as she doesn’t have her memories intact except for her name. The phrase “""I must return to the flower patch..."" is also part of major source of mystery about her character. On the other hand, there’s Dorothy and Dual. Both of them fight a mysterious enemy known as the “Virus” to protect the “Box of Wisdom”. Throughout the movie, we learn their motives and the essence of their enemy while also discovering the truth about Remo.To be quite honest, this movie is a bit confusing. It takes a few times to really comprehend what the message is.  A lot of terminology has connections with software and technology. Some of these include virus, anti-virus, bugs, etc. The “Box of Wisdom” invites attention as viewers will wonder about its purpose. Furthermore, we also have Remo’s role in the movie who has a mysterious significance in the story. It offers a Madoka-like feeling that combines sci-fi thriller, fantasy, and even slice of life. The SOL part comes from the friendship between the three girls. Their adventures takes them around the world as they see wonders. At one point in the film, they can even be described like “sisters”. The thriller part comes from the challenges the girls undertake as they fight viruses. There’s also a feeling of virtual reality that can easily be felt through the world fiction of the film. That being said, the film also has some more sensible topics that includes extinction, dealing with loss, and blurring a line between fiction and reality. As such, approach this film with a bit of trepidation. It’s one of those fictional works that either you’ll like or dislike. On a personal level, I think the film’s length is questionable. A television adaptation would be more suitable as it feels like there’s too much ideas thrown into a package all the same time. On the other hand, the film itself is thrilling enough to stand out on its own. It has the characters, a premise that invites curiosity, and stunning visuals that combines world fiction with adventure.A-1 Pictures crafts the visuals with a stunning amount of effort. The backgrounds has a surreal-like feeling especially if you examine the Box of Wisdom. The action is also fluid and credible in terms of science fiction. Furthermore, the character designs is innocent and decorative for the girls. It almost makes us forget that there’s darker concepts going on in the background. As the screenplay is produced by Fumihiko Shimo (known for Air, Kanon, Clannad), expect facial expressions of the characters to show emotions. Furthermore, the characters’ voices are expressed in a way that is suitable for their roles. At the end of the day, you’ll probably remember the characters more than the story.Make no mistake, this isn’t The Matrix in a more charming form. Rather, Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai is a technologically sci-fi adventure that will get people talking. Whether the talk is about the story, characters, or stunning visuals can be viewed differently in a variety of stances, it’s still a rather unique piece of work. Once again, confusion isn’t something that should be surprising when watching this for the first time. It’s tough to explain but how much more does a peculiar world with three cute girls really take? like Shinsekai Yori or Speed Grapher may recognize his work.

Once again, confusion isn’t something that should be surprising when watching this for the first time. It’s tough to explain but how much more does a peculiar world with three cute girls really take?', 'Before anyone asks, yes I went into Garakowa, or Glass no Sekai no Who Gives A Shit if you want to be a weeaboo about it, fully expecting to hate it. When I saw that A-1 was producing the thing, that they teamed up the director of Shin Sekai Yori and the writer of Golden Time for the project, and that the cast would consist of nothing but little girls, I knew right away that there was no chance I was going to get any enjoyment out of the film. The synopsis itself wasn\'t helping matters either. You remember how the second season of Higurashi...built up Oyashiro-sama to be this all-powerful entity that causes people to kill themselves, only to make that retarded reveal that she was just an annoying little girl who went ""haaaauuuu"" all the time, effectively killing all the tension and causing the final arc to be one long snorefest? Garakowa made it clear from the very promo that all three of its main characters would follow Hanyuu\'s example in making the gods lame rather than being the kind of Haibane Renmei-like religious females I can actually tolerate.Mind you, calling Garakowa religious is a bit of a stretch on account of the fact that it stretches the scope of its world so wide that it comes off like someone wanted to mesh genres for the sake of meshing genres. The show takes place in some weird virtual reality-like dimension called the Box of Wisdom where it\'s revealed that our world along with a bunch of other different realities are actually mythical computer programs that can be deleted at a moment\'s whim if they\'re infected by viruses. Sounds a bit Megaman Battle Network doesn\'t it? Occasionally the gods of this world, Dual and Dorothy, try to fight the viruses first before deciding the world is a lost cause and it is during one of their excursions that they meet a mysterious female program named Remo, who states that she has to return to a mysterious ""flower patch"", causing the two to take her in. I guess it\'s to the film\'s benefit that it\'s getting its Fractale-like twists out of the way first so we won\'t balk at it later, but that\'s about the only thing it does better than Fractale.Garakowa shoots itself in the foot at the very start by assuming you already know who Dual and Dorothy are when we first meet them, and then proceeding to tell us what\'s going on through a load of boring plot dumps that flow about as naturally as a WWII subplot in the middle of a Vietnam War narrative. More importantly, it\'s world-building for the sake of world-building, preventing the story from even surfacing until more than halfway through the film, not helped by the fact  that Dual and Dorothy (and Remo too while we\'re at it) are incredibly irritating characters who just react to everything that happens whilst having no relatable flaws or story to call their own. I understand that they\'re omnipresent emotionless virus busters who are supposed to be far above humanity and committed to just the job, but that begs the question, ""why is the film about them at all? And why do I have to sit through incredibly tedious scenes and numerous montages of the two acting like BFFs with Remo if they\'re so emotionless?"" ""Because it builds character,"" is what people might say. ""Yeah, how well did that work out for every visual novel adaptation ever?"" I retort. ""The story of the show is that programs can have feelings too,"" they fire back. ""That\'s an incredibly boring and overdone story!"" I say out loud whilst pointing a machine gun at them.And it\'s incredibly charitable to say the story starts after the halfway point either. It\'s just more of the characters being reactionary, except with more of an action bent against some viruses that kinda look cool, but their lack of personality or individual threat makes it hard to really care about their destruction, as well as infecting Remo with a mysterious illness that wouldn\'t really add to anything even if she had been an interesting character. This leads to a very brief discussion regarding how our world was destroyed due to being incredibly dependent on technology along with a truth regarding the Box of Wisdom that I won\'t spoil, but trust me when I say that you won\'t be the least bit surprised by the twist because it\'s been used in every sci-fi premise everywhere. Instead, you\'ll most likely be asking ""why am I not watching this movie instead?"" And then you\'ll realize you do own this movie and then pop it into your blu-ray player so you can cleanse this film from your mind. Or at least you would if the film didn\'t go on afterwards by throwing in one more action sequence in order to have an awkward tear-jerking scene that not only came off as incredibly contrived, but it wastes a golden opportunity to really delve into the nature of what it means to be a part of a much bigger world then you realize in the process. Did I mention that the guy in charge of Golden Time\'s composition also did the composition for those Key series and Kokoro Connect? Yeah, dramatic timing is really not the guy\'s specialty.As many people have already said, the film is rushed, but here\'s the punch line: even as a full-blown series, it\'d STILL be bad. In addition to the lackluster characters, the lack of originality in the plot, and the ridiculous amount of padding this thing managed to fit in only an hour, the fanservice in Garakowa is really creepy to the point of being a deal-breaker. Numerous times when they\'re fighting, Dual and Dorothy are wearing outfits that leave them half-naked, which I think is just messed up considering we\'re talking about anthromorphic virus busters here. There\'s even one scene where either due to an animation error or because someone let a pervert into the room that day, Dual is crying whilst topless and covering her breasts with her arms despite the fact that her outfit never showed that much earlier.Not that I\'d blame her for doing so. After being stuck in a movie this bloody awful, I\'d lose all hope in humanity and submit myself to the kinky fetishes of a vengeful god as well. built up Oyashiro-sama to be this all-powerful entity that causes people to kill themselves, only to make that retarded reveal that she was just an annoying little girl who went ""haaaauuuu"" all the time, effectively killing all the tension and causing the final arc to be one long snorefest?

And then you\'ll realize you do own this movie and then pop it into your blu-ray player so you can cleanse this film from your mind. Or at least you would if the film didn\'t go on afterwards by throwing in one more action sequence in order to have an awkward tear-jerking scene that not only came off as incredibly contrived, but it wastes a golden opportunity to really delve into the nature of what it means to be a part of a much bigger world then you realize in the process. Did I mention that the guy in charge of Golden Time\'s composition also did the composition for those Key series and Kokoro Connect? Yeah, dramatic timing is really not the guy\'s specialty.As many people have already said, the film is rushed, but here\'s the punch line: even as a full-blown series, it\'d STILL be bad. In addition to the lackluster characters, the lack of originality in the plot, and the ridiculous amount of padding this thing managed to fit in only an hour, the fanservice in Garakowa is really creepy to the point of being a deal-breaker. Numerous times when they\'re fighting, Dual and Dorothy are wearing outfits that leave them half-naked, which I think is just messed up considering we\'re talking about anthromorphic virus busters here. There\'s even one scene where either due to an animation error or because someone let a pervert into the room that day, Dual is crying whilst topless and covering her breasts with her arms despite the fact that her outfit never showed that much earlier.Not that I\'d blame her for doing so. After being stuck in a movie this bloody awful, I\'d lose all hope in humanity and submit myself to the kinky fetishes of a vengeful god as well.', ""Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai is a 60-minute long animated film directed by Masashi Ishihama and produced by A-1 Pictures. Frankly, what made me watch this film was its relatively short length, so I'll describe its positive and negative aspects.Positive:(+) The art and animationI guess this is the section most of the budget went to. The backgrounds of this anime were simply gorgeous. The colors and details were amazing. The animation was also smooth and high quality. I didn't especially like the character designs, mostly because I dislike anime with little girls, but objectively speaking, there was nothing wrong with that either.(+) The soundtrackThe...soundtrack of this anime was comprised mostly of piano pieces, which fit well in most of the scenes. Overall, I liked the soundtrack a lot.(+) The conceptDespite the flawed execution, the concept of this anime was pretty good. The events happen in a virtual world, where the main characters, who are anti-virus programs, delete corrupt files. Basically, imagine if the agents in Matrix were cute magical girls. I have to admit, the idea wasn't bad at all, but it could have been better, for reasons which I am gonna explain below.Negative:(-) Everything elseApart from the great art and soundtrack, as well as the concept, the movie fails at pretty much every other department. Despite its short 1-hour length, this movie feels like 2 hours due to the slow pacing and constant information dumping. The characters speak endlessly about the details of their world, but without a proper explanation, everything feels like pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo. The characters remain mostly under-developed, so you don't really care what happens to them. The action scenes were short, and despite the brilliant animation, you don't really know what's happening, apart from the obvious ugly virus monster vs cute anti-virus girl.Overall, despite the attempt of doing something unique, this movie ends up being pretty much forgettable and with nothing much to offer apart from the good visuals. soundtrack of this anime was comprised mostly of piano pieces, which fit well in most of the scenes.

It’s not really about anything; just a collection of the most precious moments of life, and the three girls most connected to them. In this blogger’s opinion, this is truly a story worth taking a glance at.The film takes place primarily within an advanced OS capable of actually recording data of all periods of time and space, including the people who lived there. Two anti-virus programs, Dual and Dorothy are entrusted with destroying the corrupted data. Known as viruses, they infect the artificial worlds as well as the data of the people who once lived...there. Duel and Dorothy have to go inside the data worlds and find the ones that are too corrupted to be saved. Of course, this means they have to destroy the people there, including the ones they consider to be “friends”.Those harrowing days soon change when one day, a mysterious girl known only as Remo falls from a defeated virus. Unknowing of who she is and where she comes from, Remo starts to hang around with Dorothy and Dual, and the three of them share an amazing bond that will transcend the very essence of what it means to be real…If that sounded like a cop out…CONGRATULATIONS!! You get a cookie.The movie is way more darker than it appears to be. But it was a rich and endearing movie in so many aspects, creating a visual masterpiece with a simple but endearing message.ART10/10The visuals were absolutely breathtaking in this film! I especially liked the parts where the girls visited data versions of landmarks like Niagara Falls, and how much work the staff took to not only recreating them, but animating them in a way that seemed like they were realistic. The viruses were just typical fodder; nothing too special about them. But the colorful landscape of the data world was an absolute marvel to behold, and while the character models were just typical moe, I didn’t seem to mind all that much. Moe is good when it’s done right!MUSIC8/10There were two songs in the middle of the movie that were kinda iffy for me. However, what really worked for me was the background music. The piano not only complemented the story as an important plot point to drive the story forward, but was very stunning and kept me soothed and relaxed while watching. It was especially nice during character interactions and the final act of the movie how much the music got me to feel during those moments, particularly for tropes I’ve seen done on screen hundreds of times. But that didn’t really diminish my enjoyment of it.STORY7/10Plot wise, there was nothing too different to separate this film from others of this genre. But it did raise some important questions about humanity and what it means when trying to retain it long after its gone. What’s the best justice towards that end? Is it only important to remember the most “beautiful” parts like joy and love and happiness? Things like pain and war are sad, but they are just as much a part of what make us human as the happy things. I thought that was a really deep thought, something I have seen in anime before but never really thought about until now.CHARACTERS10/10According to the Director’s intro, the most important part of this film to him were the characters. There aren’t that many, and there wasn’t much time allotted I’m the movie to truly explore them, so I’ll simply go through them one by one.DOROTHYA “tsundere” program with a seeming nonchalance about deleting viruses and getting too attached with the data-people, Dorothy is not really that much of a focal point in regards to the story. Nevertheless, she does have an interesting character growth during the film. She initially finds human emotions and feelings like taste and happiness to be “weird”, but learns to appreciate life over time and realize things like “dreams” and “feelings” aren’t such bad things after all. It’s a trope that’s been done to death, but it was done here so beautifully that it appears so endearing when it happens to her.DUAL Originally introduced as someone who does her job of deleting viruses like it’s no big deal, Dual is revealed to be more “human” than she initially lets on. Being able to taste yummy things if she tells herself they are “delicious” is just a small indicator of how self-aware she really is. This only increases through contact with Sumire, a data-person with a passion for piano that develops a friendship with her, and the enigmatic Remo, a girl who changes her world forever.REMOThere are a few interesting things about her character to note, but the only thing that really matters is how dedicated she really is, both to her newfound friends and her secret mission, one that really demonstrates just how important humanity really is, and why it’s worth preserving!OVERALLWhile this is defiantly not “Anime Film of the Year” material, it’s DEFINATELY an enjoyable movie with a simple message about life (and maybe about technology) that will leave you thinking for at least a few minutes afterwards! Make sure to see it on Crunchyroll, complete with an introduction and Q&A from the director himself! You won’t wanna miss this one!Garakowa – Restore the World can be found on Crunchyroll, complete with a intro and Q&A by the director himself, to describe key aspects of the film both going in and coming out of it.

This is also my second review so bear with me.The overall is that the world is run by a system and there are two programmes which help keep the system in tact which are represented as girls of the system in truth they're anti viruses for the system. This system help to keep social balance and social order in a peaceful world however like most things there are more that meets the eye.Story: 6I found even though this had major potential...in its story and came of with some good socialogical theories, it never really fulfilled it potential. The beginning was great as it described how the world in this story is set up as they meet a new character called Reemo. However for 30 minutes of the movie nothing happened to the point where 10 minutes of it had no dialogue what so ever. I found this very frustrating as it felt like they hadn't thought about anything for the story at this point and just left it with basically what was just filler at the end.Art: 8A1 pictures always produce great art work and this was no exception. The art work for this kind of story was spot on if not fantastic. A1 always  do a job with their colouring saturating and bringing the animation to life.Sound: 9The best thing is the amazing soundtrack to it. I personality don't think I need to comment on this section to much because the sounds are really a base of opinionCharacters: 7The characters in the series suited to what genre the story was mainly based on. Very similar to Selector WIXOSS and Madoka Magica, the characters are based on girls struggling on what comes to term with what happens in society.The main characters of Dual, Dorathy and Reemo are a perfect setting for this kind of show. The way the writers brings back characters that were suppose to have been killed off, show that each character even small have a major part to play in the movie.Enjoyment: 7They were parts that really irked me and i thought why am i watching this. But i kept to it and towards the end enjoyed watching it.Overall: 7Overall it is a decent movie which only lasts 70 minutes of your time and its something you don't have to totally have patients and invest time into. I found it a decent watch however i believe if they had more time if it was created into a series, this would potentially be better. in its story and came of with some good socialogical theories, it never really fulfilled it potential.

The previously mentioned movie with a really long and elaborate name, Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai, also known as Garakowa -Restore the World-, and also *breathes* Vitreous Flower Destroy the World Backup, is a strange sci-fi adventure following Dual and Dorothy, 2 anti virus programs that eventually find an anomaly in the system that they cannot figure out. This anomaly, which calls itself ""Remo,"" is also a cute girl...with a mysterious mission: to return to the ""flower garden."" Dual and Dorothy subsequently live with Remo to try to assess what the ""flower garden"" really is.Garakowa largely takes place in the digital realm, which in this interpretation seems to look suspiciously like a scan of someone\'s brain. Right in the middle of the digital realm is Dual and Dorothy\'s spacious house, a place where they relax and do cute things when not battling against viruses. Right away, viewers are treated to the very imaginative digital world, with lights pulsating in every direction, bits of data floating about, and a myriad of nasty viruses which seem to take form as nightmares come true. However, a large contrast to the artificial, dreamlike world is the backups of data Dual and Dorothy frequently scan and visit, taking shape as memories of humanity from different eras. These data backups range from anything from Victorian England to 21st century Japan. One of the most successful qualities of Garakowa is definitely in the visuals. Since this is a digital world, the studio can flex its imagination and budget into breathtaking set pieces, showing the artificial digital world and magnificent sites grounded in reality, such as a sweeping mountaintop view, antique buildings of 19th century France, or the natural beauty of a modern day park in springtime.Unfortunately, the visuals are one of the only absolutely good qualities the movie has. Garakowa has a very loosely associated plot that definitely dips into interesting territory, but most of the movie is cute anti virus software doing cute things. Glaringly, the middle of the movie has a very awkward music video inserted with no dialogue and no plot progression. Admittedly, much of what I loved about the visuals and the magnificent set pieces in the movie are from this music video segment. However, the very light-hearted tone of this segment is in stark contrast to the overall mood of Garakowa. In a few scenes, the burdens of deleting viruses begins to take its toll on Dual and Dorothy, particularly Dual. These scenes offer a glimmer of a more substantial storyline, but these moments are few and happen too quickly.Speaking of storyline, Garakowa seems confused on whether it wants to show cute anti virus software doing cute things or a grim story about the deleting of humanity\'s memories. The mood shift is a little too strange for me, and I would have much preferred if they cut the slice of life moments in favor of going more into depth Dual and Dorothy\'s mission to find out just what Remo is. Only much later in the hour long movie do they delve into interesting territory, but at this point it\'s a little too late. Another thing to note about the storyline and world building is the very confusing use of terminology. The trio frequently talk about a ""Box of Wisdom,"" but I have no idea what this mystic box is or its purpose in the film. Background as to why Dual and Dorothy are anti virus software are also touched upon, but I feel like not enough time was devoted to craft a detailed sci-fi world to really matter. Viewers have to simply accept a lot of things the characters say at face value, and imagine what could have been a very interesting, fantastic world.On sound, I quite enjoyed the light background music and the lovely piano tune that is introduced, but soundtrack wise this movie is very light. Voice wise, Dual is played by Taneda Risa, so I was...really biased (in a good way) towards Dual.I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential in Garakowa. The budget is there, the stunning visuals, the voice talent, and a director with a pretty good body of work. The most notable series the director for Garakowa has done is Shinsekai Yori, in my opinion. However, these elements simply can\'t exist without a good storyline to hook the viewer to want to know more about Dual and Dorothy, Remo, the mysterious ""flower garden,"" and the suggestions of a digital apocalypse. Most disappointing is Dorothy, who has a paper thin personality that only briefly gets more development towards the end. And again, too much time was devoted to the music video in the middle. While pleasant to watch, it did not add anything at all to the storyline. The ending suggests a potentially engaging plot element regarding humans, but the film largely ends with not much resolved.Regardless of its flaws, I found Garakowa at least mildly interesting and don\'t regret the hour I spent watching it. Not only is this movie something like a mix of Assassin\'s Creed, Code Lyoko, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica, it is fundamentally an imaginative look at anti virus software, giving it human form and emotions while weaving a mildly engaging storyline with moments of despair, joy, and reflection. If anything, Garakowa is at least unique and quirky, which is probably enough to warrant sitting down for an hour and being drawn into the strange digital world of memories, regret, happiness, and apocalypse....honestly, I watched this movie to listen to Taneda Risa, but all the stuff I mentioned before  has my half-hearted seal of approval and I honestly do think Garakowa is worth a watch, if for the novelty only at least. with a mysterious mission: to return to the ""flower garden.""

The script was by Shimo Fumihiko who also worked on Air, Bakuretsu Tenshi & Non Non Biyori. I honestly don\'t know what to expect because the output there is a bit mixed and the same is true for A1 themselves. They\'ve put out some great anime like Uchuu Kyoudai and absolute rubbish like Sword Art Online. I guess I\'ll have to dive into this one and see where it lands.Story:Our main heroines, Dual & Dorothy, are anti-virus programs inside a device known as the ""Box of Wisdom."" Which I thought was the nickname...for Athena\'s virginal vagina, but has a completely different meaning here. They scan various cyber worlds that come up based around Earth\'s past and erase viruses. One day, their lives change when they find a strange program named Remo after dispatching some viruses. Remo has no memory of who she is but seems strangely human. Their only clue is that she mentions returning to a ""flower garden.""My only issue with the story is that the whole theme surrounding humanity gets to be a little heavy-handed towards the end. I\'d like to really go into heavy detail about it, but it is extreme spoiler territory so I\'m not going to.Aside from that, the narrative is pretty fantastic. It really does a superb job of establishing what the ""lives"" of our programs are like. The flashbacks it uses are highly effective. The way it showcases the various worlds encased within the Box of Wisdom by having the girls visit while looking for clues to Remo\'s past is very nice. It\'s a montage that helps build the girls\' relationships while also running the gamut of the human experience. I also appreciate that the ending takes some big risks and they pay off very well. The sci-fi elements are also handled very well.Characters:Since the film only really deals with three major characters, it really needs to get them right. Which it absolutely does. Shimo does an excellent job of giving us some sense of personality from Dual & Dorothy before they meet Remo & of developing them in a more human direction as a consequence of their interactions with her. Remo is also a great character with a good deal of verisimilitude. Even the viruses have a decent level of depth. And they aren\'t exactly talking, high interaction characters like the viruses from ReBoot.Art:The artwork is very impressive. The inside of the Wisdom Box has a lot of really cool visual elements. Although they might get a little too busy at times. The viruses have a really good look. Especially when you see them in the act of infecting something. The characters don\'t have the most unique designs. Dual & Dorothy look a lot like the heroines from OreGairu. They\'re still well drawn and the designs are good ones. The animation is nicely done too.Sound:The acting is pretty close to flawless. Hanamori Yumiri, Taneda Risa & Sakura Ayane are all superlative. The film uses a lot of really well done piano music and some nicely performed songs.Ho-yay:This film does get progressively more homo-erotic with its characters as it goes and our anti-virus programs start developing more human personalities. We\'re talking all three of our major characters are very shippable. Now, you might say they\'re programs so it doesn\'t really count. But they\'re programs that take on the forms of girls and have very human aspects to their personalities. So, I say it counts.Areas of Improvement:This is going to be pretty nit-picky since I don\'t have many complaints. And those I do have aren\'t major ones.A little more subtlety with that whole theme surrounding humanity.Character designs that don\'t look like they were ripped off from another anime. I get it, most designs have been done and getting something truly unique isn\'t going to happen. But I feel that the characters being programs was an opportunity in that regard. For instance, you could have given them an odd skin colour when they weren\'t engaging with recreations of our world or another odd feature that would have set them apart.A bit more subdued backgrounds. As much as I like the aesthetic for the more computerised sequences, the backgrounds can be a bit much.Final Thoughts:Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai was a fantastic film. I absolutely loved it. That\'s why I\'m going to go so far as to give it a 10/10. for Athena\'s virginal vagina, but has a completely different meaning here. They scan various cyber worlds that come up based around Earth\'s past and erase viruses. One day, their lives change when they find a strange program named Remo after dispatching some viruses. Remo has no memory of who she is but seems strangely human. Their only clue is that she mentions returning to a ""flower garden.""My only issue with the story is that the whole theme surrounding humanity gets to be a little heavy-handed towards the end. I\'d like to really go into heavy detail about it, but it is extreme spoiler territory so I\'m not going to.Aside from that, the narrative is pretty fantastic. It really does a superb job of establishing what the ""lives"" of our programs are like. The flashbacks it uses are highly effective. The way it showcases the various worlds encased within the Box of Wisdom by having the girls visit while looking for clues to Remo\'s past is very nice. It\'s a montage that helps build the girls\' relationships while also running the gamut of the human experience. I also appreciate that the ending takes some big risks and they pay off very well. The sci-fi elements are also handled very well.Characters:Since the film only really deals with three major characters, it really needs to get them right. Which it absolutely does. Shimo does an excellent job of giving us some sense of personality from Dual & Dorothy before they meet Remo & of developing them in a more human direction as a consequence of their interactions with her. Remo is also a great character with a good deal of verisimilitude. Even the viruses have a decent level of depth. And they aren\'t exactly talking, high interaction characters like the viruses from ReBoot.Art:The artwork is very impressive. The inside of the Wisdom Box has a lot of really cool visual elements. Although they might get a little too busy at times. The viruses have a really good look. Especially when you see them in the act of infecting something. The characters don\'t have the most unique designs. Dual & Dorothy look a lot like the heroines from OreGairu. They\'re still well drawn and the designs are good ones. The animation is nicely done too.Sound:The acting is pretty close to flawless. Hanamori Yumiri, Taneda Risa & Sakura Ayane are all superlative. The film uses a lot of really well done piano music and some nicely performed songs.Ho-yay:This film does get progressively more homo-erotic with its characters as it goes and our anti-virus programs start developing more human personalities. We\'re talking all three of our major characters are very shippable. Now, you might say they\'re programs so it doesn\'t really count. But they\'re programs that take on the forms of girls and have very human aspects to their personalities. So, I say it counts.Areas of Improvement:This is going to be pretty nit-picky since I don\'t have many complaints. And those I do have aren\'t major ones.A little more subtlety with that whole theme surrounding humanity.Character designs that don\'t look like they were ripped off from another anime.

If you can deal with somewhat convoluted, confusing plotlines and enjoy sci-fi / cute girls it\'s possibly worth a watch.Story 6.5/10:As you\'ve probably already seen from other reviews the plot is considered to be pretty convoluted and things are not exactly explained in detail. In my opinion, it\'s not too hard to put everything together but the movie doesn\'t exactly spell everything out for you. The story focuses on the 3 main girls and explores the nature of the world and what exactly the...girls (primarily Remo) are. The world is pretty cool and unique but can be kind of shallow considering it\'s just an hour long movie. I\'d say they did well with the time that they had though.It\'s not as convoluted as some people make it out to be but it\'s also not the psychological masterpiece that others say it is. It\'s just a decent sci-fi story about cute girls learning more about Remo and the world they\'re in with some emotional moments.Art 7/10:The art and animation were pretty decent but not amazing. Pretty average for A-1 I\'d say.Sound 6/10:Pretty much the same as art to a lesser degree. Decent but nothing stuck out to me.Character 5.5/10:On one hand I\'d say that Garakowa does an ok job of character development in the ~ 60 minutes it has. On the other it\'s still shallow. Each girl has their own personality and all, but some development points in the story feel kind of forced and sudden. Remo was really the only one who had something beyond being an ""antivirus program with a personality"".Enjoyment 6/10:It\'s a pretty short movie so I didn\'t really get bored while watching it, but at the same time it\'s not super noteworthy. It does well to initially capture your attention and while it lulls a little bit in the middle with some slice of life stuff nothing drags on too long. There\'s some decent emotional moments and twists but nothing super impacting.Overall ~6/10:Overall Garakowa is a decent movie and while it\'s not a ""must watch"" by any means I\'d say it does well with the little time it has. It\'s not super memorable but if you\'re bored and want a decent sci-fi story I\'d say it\'s worth a watch. girls (primarily Remo) are.

The beautiful art style will surely enhance your experience from the story. I didn’t understand some aspects of the anime completely, but I did get the general idea. I cried at one point, that’s how much the anime touched me. The idea behind the anime is very nice and original, the art is gorgeous to say the least, the characters are pleasant to watch, the background music is great throughout the whole thing,...and the anime manages to create a very detailed and captivating world, which I am certain anyone can enjoy. It isn't the best anime movie out there, but it was worth the watch. and the anime manages to create a very detailed and captivating world, which I am certain anyone can enjoy.

However LA would find some sense of of them fluffing around as for Dual and Dorothy to gain some sense of empathy through all the fluffing around, LA says this as Dorothy was the most unemphatic about her job and seeing the worlds she visited as nothing more than infected data. It\'s not until Dual\'s memory of a person she thought she erased (Sumire) that the plot really kicks in and we see the reality of Remo as well as the nature of Dual and Dorothy\'s job. The biggest problem however lies in how much of a rushed pace it takes with it\'s execution, with little less than 20 minutes to both world build, give us revelation to Dual and Dorothy AS well as Sumire in the process of showing us what Remo truly is...it goes at a very breakneck pace trying to explain everything AND resolve everything in the process. This rushed pacing is just the result of a mere one hour screentime and the characters fluffing around that it had to rush in the first place.For characters, Dual is your typical kuudere with a bit of empathy of her job what with her feeling guilty of deleting Sumire\'s dream, on the opposite side Dorothy is your typical genki no-nonsense straight man of the trio who opens up to her job of deleting worlds thanks to Remo giving her a bit of human empathy in the process of the movie. Remo is your mysterious genki girl of the movie that\'s pretty much the focal point of the movie as well as what she really is being the biggest plot twist of the movie.The animation done by A1-Pictures is decent to some gorgeous background work from time to time, LA sees Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai for A1-Pictures in experimenting and tech-demoing with what it can do with it\'s animation for this movie, is it a bad thing?, no..it just shows that A1-Pictures with it\'s backgrounding and for the most part it\'s gorgeous with many color palettes blending with the virtual ""world"" that Dual and Dorothy authorize.The voice acting, well...LA would say that Yumiri Hanamori, Ayane Sakura, Risa Taneda and Ai Kayano did brilliantly in this movie, with special mention going to Ayane Sakura and Yumiri Hanamori, Ayane Sakura for giving us a wide range of vocal accenting and Yumiri Hanamori for the same.The big revelation of Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai took a while for LA to understand however for what a breakneck pace Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai tried to explain everything as well as how it tried to resolve everything, LA understood it by the end of it as well as the connections Dual had with Sumire affecting Remo giving us hints in the first place.Glass no Hana to Kowasu Sekai needed just a bit more screentime in order for this movie and interesting concept to be fleshed out more, nonetheless we do get developments from our main trio and the major conflict of the movie being resolved even if it is in a rushed pace.

Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2494/Goshuushou-sama_Ninomiya-kun,"['Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun, is just one of those shows that you probably shouldn\'t like but you do anyway.  Even for an echii show this is pretty over the top at times.  It’s full of swimsuits, bouncing boobs, and moe.  If you like those themes then you’re really going to love this.The story is pretty weak overall though it does have a premise that is fairly unique.  Mayu Tsukimura is a succubus, who pretty humorously suffers from a fear of men, well except one, our hero Shungo Ninomiya.  The story starts with Mayu\'s brother and Shungo\'s sister having him protect her from...zealous boys drawn to her by her succubus power she can’t control and helping her overcome her fear of men.  This puts our mains in plenty of echii situations, such as being forced to sleep, bathe, fondle and other silly sexual situations. To tell you the truth as much as this anime was geared towards the sex drive of young men I still found these situations quite funny.  Of course there is always a rival, and Reika Houjou, a rich spoiled girl who is in love with Shungo, fills that role.  Even taking a demeaning position as a maid in his house to keep an eye on his relationship with Mayu.  There is a series of dreams that unfold as the show progresses that reveal more and more of the motivations of the characters.  This becomes the real story and the show becomes less and less about what it starts out as.Most of the characters of the show really stand out and are exceptional.  I really enjoyed them and their antics are hilarious.  They don’t have a tremendous amount of depth which is why I only give them a good rating.  Probably because the series is short there isn’t much development or back story.  We never really find out more about the succubus\' or why there seems to be so many running around.  Reika probably is the best developed character and you can see actual growth with her as the series comes to its conclusion.  But like I said, they are just fun to watch!The animation I felt was really great.  Very cute character designs and shockingly no loli\'s!  They are all high school age and they actually look it.  Mayu especially is drawn to bring out the moe feelings in all of us.  This is reinforced by her voice acting.  I just wanted to grab her and snuggle with her too!  All the other acting is very good too, usually there is always some character whose voice gets on my nerves but not so in this series.  The songs are all very catchy and fun too.Overall this show isn’t going to win any awards for depth or make you smarter.  This is pure eye candy.  It’s a must watch for anyone who is a fan of echii/harem genre but I think also for anyone who wants to watch a lighthearted comedy.  Your experience may vary but I don’t see how anyone could ""hate"" this show. zealous boys drawn to her by her succubus power she can’t control and helping her overcome her fear of men.

Coming from the same studio that produced Girls Bravo, this isn't all too surprising to be fair.StoryThe story is pedestrian by most standards for the harem genre. The focus is primarily on the daily life of Ninomiya Shungo, and is really only pushed forward by his recalling of long suppressed memories of his childhood. There are a couple moments in which the plot strives to be something greater than is...typical, but those are short-lived.ArtThe artwork is solid if unspectacular. Character designs are fairly average, although at times quality degrades significantly despite this only being a 12 episode series. More money may have been spent on the commercial break fan service than on animation, which while quite good, detracts from the show as a whole.SoundThe OP theme is catchy for about the first 45 seconds then falls off at the chorus. The ED theme, not so much, and as a result can be easily skipped without regret after hearing it once.CharacterThe main character, Ninomiya Shungo, is not the everyman typical of the harem genre. He's quite capable in a fight, but then again, so is every other male character with any plot significance. He's also extremely popular with all the girls at school vying for the attention he would rather not give anyone. The two women fighting over him are Tsukimura Mayu, a succubus with androphobia and feeds of the life force of men, and Hojo Reika, in the tsundere role. Most any other character in the series is an archetype that has been seen before.EnjoymentFor a harem show, the series does have some good moments. There's a certain absurdity to some of the comedy. The omake segments in some of the episodes are well worth watching. Other times, however, the story dragged on and on for long periods, or worse, forgotten just minutes after watching the episode.OverallIf you are looking for a harem anime that in no way challenges the sensibilities of the viewer, this could be well worth a watch.

Large number of plotless episodes. Unrealistic. Exaggeration. Confusing plot.Story:4In the beginning, there were a lot of exaggerated scenes, containing a ""wow"" factor.There also seemed to be a plot, one to save Mayu from her uncontrollable powers. But after the first or first few episodes her power seemed non-existent.Then another main female character seems to have some ""secret"" in one episode. A few episodes later we see the ""secret"" coming back again and that was the beginning of the end.And then another new...concept came out: Ninomiya\'s past.Well, aside from varying storylines, flashbacks that make little sense keep flashing throughout the series, which were only explained too late imo.I felt that there were more fanservice or plotless scenes than scenes with plots. Beware.Art:8Nicely drawn, animation was good. Easy to recognize the different characters cos they were drawn very differently. Background was drawn well too, along with special effects.Sound:6Both OP and ED were quite good, but I dun really agree that they are fitting, especially the ending, which seemed to fit more as an OP. Sound effects, voice acting was good, expressive but not spectecular.Character:3Kudos on having a character with 2 personalities (bipolar i think). Other than that the characters seem too easygoing, supernatural, mysterious, or downright random (as in personality keeps changing thruout the series).Character development was lacking for several characters, including the main ones. There were too many scenes where a lot of characters were pulled together just for impact, eg. for fanservice or the concluding episodes, so much so that some of them seem like just extras.Enjoyment:4Too much ecchi, fanservice and plotless episodes. Confusing flashbacks and sudden changes to the characters\' powers cause much questions to surface. Was pretty much watching the episodes just to see if the original ""possible plot"" could be picked up again.The short clips at the start of every episode sometimes were a bonus, but sometimes ended with a cliffhanger or just proved too lame to laugh at.But the beginning and ending episodes were still quite good.Overall:4After finishing the series, I was left with an empty feeling. Too many questions about the series. Felt like some time was wasted watching fanservice.

Sound effects, voice acting was good, expressive but not spectecular.Character:3Kudos on having a character with 2 personalities (bipolar i think). Other than that the characters seem too easygoing, supernatural, mysterious, or downright random (as in personality keeps changing thruout the series).Character development was lacking for several characters, including the main ones. There were too many scenes where a lot of characters were pulled together just for impact, eg. for fanservice or the concluding episodes, so much so that some of them seem like just extras.Enjoyment:4Too much ecchi, fanservice and plotless episodes. Confusing flashbacks and sudden changes to the characters\' powers cause much questions to surface. Was pretty much watching the episodes just to see if the original ""possible plot"" could be picked up again.The short clips at the start of every episode sometimes were a bonus, but sometimes ended with a cliffhanger or just proved too lame to laugh at.But the beginning and ending episodes were still quite good.Overall:4After finishing the series, I was left with an empty feeling. Too many questions about the series. Felt like some time was wasted watching fanservice. But, it\'s still interesting though, so I completed it, although I skipped some scenes.', 'StoryThis is a romantic comedy, with some harem elements. I was therefore quite surprised that the show actually had a little deep story, some episodes in. It definitely didn&rsquo;t turn out as a regular harem, etc. Most of the episodes were pretty random, but they all lead to the ending, which I thought was quite neat. The comedy was most prominent, but it also had a slice of drama, and a bit of irregular romance. But at one time it was a bit ridiculous, with succubuses popping out from every corner. Although, it didn&rsquo;t affect the story as a whole.ArtThe animation was clean and looked...nice, but in my opinion it wasn&rsquo;t really top notch. It was as good as it was needed, to make this into a decent series.SoundThe OP wasn&rsquo;t particularly memorable to me, but the ED was a bit catchy. Background music wasn&rsquo;t that prominent, but it worked out quite well. The music built well upon the comedy, though.CharacterI thought the characters were likable, very likable indeed. Shungo wasn&rsquo;t the typical guy in a harem-anime, and Mayu was just hilarious. Reika was a bit too tsundere for me, but it worked out fine with her.

The anime doesn't excel in anything specifically, but it's at least enjoyable.The storyline is very typical: the main male character is surrounded by women that like/love him, yet he doesn't seem to acknowledge any of them. In this case, the only twist is that there are only two girls that fight for him, and that both shared a common past with the male character, though he forgot about it. The art style is just standard; nothing astonishing nor dull. I did feel uneasy about the way female eyes were portrayed, it just didn't seem right. The opening and...ending songs are just alright, I guess they suit the serie. Character development is exclusive to the three main characters, leaving every other one as if they came out of the blue. Even so, I'm not saying that they were developed fully, they only explained the very essential to understand the plot and it's outcome.I approve of this anime, it's enjoyable overall. It has some ecchi, though not explicit, and some comical parts.

Sure it has its bits where girls have big boobs and tight tops, but thats a harem for you!I thought the artwork was good and the story line was abit cheesy but likeable.Overall a very funny and charming anime to watchHope this review is ok ;) "", ""Okay i'll keep this short watch this Anime it will change your idea on ecchi instead of being rather perverted like most of them this anime has ecchi to a certain extent but it doesnt over do it. For instance how most echii animes have most character in somewhat revieling clothing this one only does that to some extent. In all i gave this Anime a 9 out of 10 which is pretty awesome and a must see. "", 'When it comes to Succubi in anime, the interpretation can vary in a number of ways.  On one hand, we have Astarotte\'s Toy, which involves a succubus at the age of 10 (don\'t ask me why that age), needing to build up her male harem for reasons I need to keep censored; and on the other, we have Rosario + Vampire, which involves a more developed and outgoing succubus named Kurumu, who can only have one mate in her life.  And then we have Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun, an anime that has way too many succubi, and a rather interesting plot.Story (7.52/10): This...anime for the most part does have a decent plot.  The story of Good Luck Ninomiya-kun, as it is known in the english version, is about a boy named Ninomiya Shungo, who is some sort of martial artist badass, considering the fact that he beats up a bear in the first episode, who finds himself in a predicament of having to take care of this cute and rather large chested girl named Tsukimura Mayu, and help her get over her androphobia by doing various ""relationship-esque"" things with her.  Along the way, a 3rd year by the name of Houjou Reika somehow makes herself involved in their affairs by becoming the house maid, and the story of this love triangle continues onward.While this synopsis is fairly standard in terms of how the character relations are set up, the actual plot itself is a roller coaster; meaning that it has its ups, downs, spirals, and unexpected twists.  What the series does do, is integrate a backstory for the three main characters, and develop a sort of connection between them all, as this backstory provides a main focal point towards the end of the series.  While the backstory was cute and all, the fact that we only got bits and pieces at the beginning, followed by some really heavy hinting as the series went on, was infuriating.  What I mean is the fact that we had characters mention the actual backstory constantly, like ""I won\'t forget what you did to me 10 years ago"", over and over again for 3 episodes.  It was so ridiculous to the extent that it would make any normal watcher crazy due to how teasing it was.On the flip side from the main story, we have side episodes.  Several episodes throughout the series were pretty much just pointless side story, which made me felt like I was wasting time watching this series.  Especially since this anime is only 12 episodes long, using every minute to explain plot and do what you want to accomplish is pretty crucial.Overall, I felt as though the story was at the very least watchable.  There were a couple of facepalm moments and complete utter waste of time moments, but the majority of the series proved itself to be ok to watch.  The pacing was decent, and nothing felt particularly rushed, but I just felt like some parts of the show could\'ve received a bit more explanation for a few of its points since some things felt ridiculous even by anime standards.The end I felt like was a bow to the series (not a nice looking fancy bow, but just a normal one), as the actually end was a close to the series, just not the most wonderful close to a series ever.  Apart from that curveball that I did not expect, the end was rather generic, but somehow really befitting for this series.Overview+  Decent main story+  average pull off of a back story-   Too little explanation of certain plot points-   Pointless side story-   unexplained detailsCharacters (6.83/10):  Ninomiya Shungo as the main protagonist is a rather interesting male lead.  Compared to a majority of male leads that I\'ve seen in romance-related animes, this guy can most definitely pull his weight.  He is shown to be a rather determined and caring person towards the people he cares about, and is generally a decent character.  When he\'s not somewhat dense.  Compared to a lot of male characters, he\'s not completely oblivious to the fact that he\'s got 2 girls that basically live with him crushing on him at the same time, but he\'s still oblivious to this fact.Tsukimura Mayu is generally what you would expect of a cute, dandere character.  She is most certainly a dandere, being only proactive in the series at the end, as well as being an androphobic, meaning she does not like to deal with men.  Other than this, there\'s not really any other way of explaining her, since she is that damsel in distress character that Shungo sweeps in and saves at the very last second.  Which, when you have a martial artist badass having to save you from various threats cause somehow your brother is an international terrorist, being saved happens quite often.Houjou Reika as the last of the character trio is a tsundere character that is more explored than Mayu.  While I don\'t necessarily like the route that the anime put her on, (considering the fact that she\'s a stalker half the time), I find her to be a lot more interesting and more developed than Mayu because of the fact that she was affected by the aforementioned backstory that isn\'t explained until the very end.  Apart from that, she\'s also a Oujo-sama character too, and I just feel like she wasn\'t put beyond the pedestal that she was given at the start of the series, since the only development she actually gets only appears at the very last few episodes.The side characters in this anime are heavily one-noted, being a bunch of troupes and pointless people that I personally could care less about.  There\'s only perhaps one or two that I feel like actually matter, since some of the supporting cast basically show up in almost every scene and add more to a perspective character and develop them in the process.  Mostly though, they\'re just plot devices.Overview+  Above average male lead for a romance-related anime.  (Since most of them are crap.)+  Some character development-   Very troupe heavy cast-   Mainly useless side cast-   Underdeveloped main castArt and Sound (6.98/10):  The art for this series is a standard looking look.  The actual color palette and detail aren\'t particularly outstanding, but as aesthetics, they look rather decent to look at.  One thing that I feel is a turn off for a lot of people, is the very moe-looking females.  Every female in this series has those large, moe eyes, and if you\'re not a fan of moe, or hate it, this isn\'t a series for you.Ecchi section (I do this for any ecchi show I watch.): What surprised me about the ecchi was the fact that there wasn\'t an excessive amount of it.  Sure, there was some here and there and some scenes that would have you watch this in your room alone when no one\'s looking, but for the most part, this series isn\'t too aggressive in terms of showing its audience the naked bodies of their female character. (I just wrote that, didn\'t I?)From a musical aspect, the series had a very hyper and very generic OST and ED.  They\'re cute and all, but they really aren\'t as catchy as one might think.  Apart from that, the series does have this mystical woodwind music that actually sounds pretty decent.  It\'s not the most memorable thing to take from this show, but the music does appear quite often, and it gives a whole other tone to this anime.OverviewEverything is average.  There\'s no real positives or negatives to the aesthetics of this series.Personal Enjoyment (7.02/10):  I wouldn\'t say that I disliked this series, cause I did finish all of it and was rather pleased with myself after I had finished, but I wouldn\'t say I truly liked it.  It wasn\'t by far the best series that I\'ve watched, but it wasn\'t the worst.  Apart from the pointless side story episodes, which I hate in any anime in general, the story was rather executed well, and I was able to follow along with it rather easily without any trouble whatsoever.  I will say however, that I wasn\'t a fan of some of the plot points and focuses that the series had, such as the entire middle arc, as well as some of the absurd parts of the story, that I felt like needed a bit of explanation because there are some confusing scenarios in this series.If you don\'t mind moe, ecchi, missing plot, or even generic anime troupes in general, then you might actually like this series.  If any one of those you hate with all your heart, this probably isn\'t the first choice for you.  Personally, I feel like this series is a good time killer, and nothing more.  However, I will put a disclaimer that there are a few scenes that get my seal of approval for being disturbing and overall strange, so bear that in mind. (Ex.  A man wearing a bunny girl outfit.  Yeah, that exists in this anime.)Overal Score: (6.73/10) anime for the most part does have a decent plot.

You get what u want here, boobs, swimsuits and i did get a good laugh. What i was surprised about was the story. Most of you know that most ecchi anime don't really have a true storyline and all and most of the time the story is in the last episode. This one however is a little different which i liked. The basics of it are that Ninomiya is trying to help Mayu with her androphobia and they do...some crazy stuff. At first it may sound like its no different than other ecchi anime. But the story progresses through the all the episodes not just the last one. You see flashbacks and learn new stuff about their past that lead to the ending.

The doormat called Ninomiya Shungo allows every female character in the series to do whatever she wants with him at every point in time.  In the first episode, a group of girls has somehow tied Shungo up in order to sexually harass him, and it only gets worse from there.  These same girls, and especially one of them, continue to walk all over Shungo throughout the anime.  It\'s not explained how Shungo allows this; one can only assume he has no will of his...own.  He wants to spend time with Mayu but allows the other girls (and one in particular) to monopolize his time.  His home life is just as bad: Shungo acquiesces to every demand from his older sister Ryouko, including the absurd ""training"" she demands to help Mayu with her androphobia.  This ""training"" is of course merely an excuse for the anime to put Shungo and Mayu in sexual situations; it doesn\'t have any relevance to its stated purpose, but for some unknown reason, everyone goes along with it.Some other things that detract from the anime are as follows:* Some episodes open with a throwaway bit that has no bearing on the actual plot.  It felt like a fever dream until I figured out what was going on, and these bits would have worked better as after-credits scenes.* The plot has little development.* Shungo\'s character has little development, and he\'s in desperate need of developing a backbone.* The anime has several flashback scenes which have importance to the plot/backstory, but due to the color filter used, it\'s not clear who the characters are in the flashbacks.  Since these flashbacks are forgetting memories resurfacing from different characters, the viewer should be able to tell who\'s in the flashbacks.* Shungo\'s lack of character emphasizes how unrealistic it is that all the female characters want him.  A good harem anime should at least make it understandable that all the females like the MC rather than other male characters, but there\'s no attempt made here.* Mayu literally says ""uwu"" at times, which just seems over the top.* The setting seems to be somewhat realistic, but then has superhuman feats of strength and agility from various characters.

The plot is rehashed from any harem anime you have ever seen with a small ""twist"" that changes nothing of the show.The protagonist , the titular ""Ninomiya"" Shuungo encounters a girl that is secretly a succubus, this is established in episode 1 so I am not presenting any spoilers, he is somehow resistant to her strange pheromone control over men so he is then tasked to...""Train"" her in dealing with the opposite sex.That is the backdrop for a lot of messing around. ecchi and comedy. The problem is, it is incredibly flimsy... the story literally goes nowhere, the characters are exactly the same in episode 12 as they are in episode 1. Nothing is resolved, nothing changes.

Avoid at all cost.', 'Ninomiya is your typical two girls after one guy plus lots of accidental ecchi moments. It\'s about a not-so ordinary high school guy and his meetings with two not-so ordinary girls. There is a fair amount of suggestive material, though it has been far eclipsed by the ecchi works of today.The actual show is pleasantly enjoyable if you can tolerate the overflow of old school fan service and the inconceivable nature of the entire situation. The majority of the show just introduces the characters as they go on mini-adventures before culminating in a substantial climax near the end.Overall, this is a decent at best watch...for those who can live with some fan service. This is a really crowded genre, and this particular work just doesn\'t stand out much.Animation:The animation was probably crisp for its time but is definitely outdated by 2015 standards. Colors are nicely toned though a bit over-saturated and the characters are well proportioned (and I don\'t mean that in an ecchi sense), and still quite cute.There is a fair amount of action in the show though obviously the only reason you\'d venture here is for the ecchi. And to be honest, if that\'s what you\'re looking for other shows do that better as well too.Sound:The sound of the series is pretty average. The OP isn\'t bad but not that memorable. The ED is actually better though there is a bit of ecchi-ness in the visuals. The BGM fits the mood nicely but isn\'t anything outstanding. As for voice actors, Mayu has a very high pitched voice (which some might find cute but others annoying). Overall, the VAs did a very good job, especially Miyuki Sawashiro for giving a pompous, arrogant attitude for Reika.Story:Ninomiya is yet another show about a somewhat timid guy with a girl literally falling onto him. It focuses on the relationship between Ninomiya kun and the two girls Reika and Mayu. As with many other shows, it involves the main character\'s long lost childhood memories.For the most part, the series consists of mostly stand-alone episodes where viewers learn a little about Ninomiya and the girls, who end up living in Ninomiya\'s house. Mayu is afraid of men and so Ninomiya is used as the ""tool"" for her to get used to guys. This often involves unusually ecchi situations that may offend some viewers. Near the end of the series, a great deal is revealed about Ninomiya\'s past and how the girls play a part in it, culminating in a fairly intensive climax in the last episode.Overall, the story could have built up to the last few episodes a little better and the ending leaves an inconclusive feeling.Character:First of all, I will note that nearly all of the characters in this series are irregular (including unusual martial arts abilities, succubi powers, or an oddly aggressive personality (sexually) etc.).Ninomiya is a popular high school boy who lives with his elder sister. Both are apparently highly skilled martial artists and essentially super-soldiers. However, he tends to be weak/timid around girls and the school girls often harass him due to his lack of resistance. He has known Reika and Mayu from his distant past though his memories are foggy at best.Mayu is a succubus who lives with her brother. Both join the Ninomiya family once it is determined that Ninomiya will help familiarize Mayu with guys. Mayu is a succubus and thus looks extremely attractive. She has a clumsy personality and naive nature. She is often seen in suggestive positions/acts with Ninomiya as part of their ""training"".Reika comes from a very affluent family (which also happens to be succubi) and, in a weird series of twists, ends up as Ninomiya\'s maid. She also harbors feelings for Ninomiya though her proud attitude would never allow her to admit it.The cast in general is fairly diverse and developments are fairly good for the main characters (the secondary characters are static for the most part).Value:The overall show had a lot of humorous occurrences as well as some decent dramatic moments. The show also tries to throw in some action which is well played out as well. As for value in general, the storyline isn\'t very great and the characters aren\'t particularly memorable. Though it might be a fair spur of the moment watch, don\'t expect it to be a standout. for those who can live with some fan service.

So, I will just go about the positives as soon as I can this time.The anime opens to a pretty cool fighting sequence where Shungo and his sister are training against wild animals. I assumed they were mildly close here due to the way it was addressed, but I would be proven wrong later. This is mainly meant to establish that Shungo is not a complete wimp and is able to defend himself. Good stuff right here.I like the character designs, particularly the females, as the long vertical eyes look strangely...appealing. One of the only reasons I tackled this anime is because I thought the plot was interesting. A succubus with androphobia seemed like it would revolve around her comical mischief and, for the first episode, that was the vibe I got. Also, I really enjoyed the cool flip Shungo did when he grabbed Mayu\'s arm and swung her around into a full grab. That is one of the coolest action sequences I have ever seen in a while. You see it right away anyway, so it\'s not spoiling much.I also enjoy how they mention a school field trip, but don\'t go through with it right away like nearly every other anime does. It\'s interesting since they acknowledge it\'s there, but still leave room for the time between them getting ready and actually going for more plot. Most anime normally just have the characters bring it up, they plan and then they\'re off. They acknowledge it in one episode and it does not actually occur until a couple more later.And here we go. It\'s a harem and, as I said earlier, I thought it would be centered around Mayu and I did not know it was a harem. It still mostly involves her, but she\'s the awkward moral support to Shungo more than anything as he is the main character. So many weird dynamics are present in the anime, but the main one is all the females openly violating Shungo in public with nobody stopping them when we\'re introduced to more of them. The first time you see them (yeah, all of them), they tie him up and force him to look at their underwear. Perverted women seems like a foreign concept in anime, but what\'s even sadder is that this proves that female characters can get away with anything. Even when they\'re doing acts that male characters are infamously punished for, nobody bats an eye. Real dumb indeed and it quickly annoyed me. And it only gets worse since Mayu eventually stops being harassed by the male students and it really becomes one-sided on Shungo, where the males are also always picking on him. She occasionally gets punished, but it\'s not really that harsh.And of course, my favorite part about the harem genre, the male is always punished in nearly every episode. I am not going to hate this too much since the harem genre pretty much established itself as such due to Love Hina making it this way, but the concept is just too old now. Anime like Isekai wa Sumaatofon to Tomo ni prove that a harem can revolve around the male being respected and still be funny. Of course, this is an old anime, but the criticism still stands. It was made over half a decade after Love Hina and was at the worst time for harems when the majority of them have lifeless plots that are essentially ""I wonder how we can get the male to feel the most pain possible"" scenarios over and over. I mean, most in the next decade still do this, but looking back at the one I mentioned earlier, it\'s hard to believe it took until near the end of this decade for them to think ""oh, maybe we can have a harem where the male is respected"" and even then, I imagine most of them still don\'t do that very often.The running gags are also about what you\'d expect. Shungo is always bullied by nearly everyone, misunderstandings happen all the time, Reika is always telling Shungo not to do lewd things, his friends are always wanting him to do lewd things, though I can\'t deny nearly all the females being involved with this as well is also surprising. The most interesting one is probably Ryoko\'s bizarre punishments, always ending with ""naked"" which I found myself enjoying for some reason. Earlier in the series, they acknowledged Shungo\'s combat training more and Ryoko would always mention he would receive a bizarre excursion if he did not do a particular task that involves him honing his skills in a very difficult manner, always ending with him having to be ""naked"" during it.Before I end off, however, I\'d like to mention one episode in particular, being the eighth one. The anime took a pleasant turn and I enjoyed it a lot. The character personalities got unusual in a fresh way. The goal was for Shungo to make some ramen for his sister, but believed it to be a ""written challenge"" so he wanted to make it fresh. He asks Mayu to assist in stirring the pot well he goes out for the rest of the episode to grab all the ingredients. Hinako became the star of the show here after Mayu calls her for help on stirring the pot. For some bizarre reason, it turns into a softcore hentai fest shortly after Hinako arrives. It becomes even more comical when the plot turns in her favor as every other girl that walked in was forced to help stir the ramen.To top it all off, Shungo returns home to the march of rip-off Rocky music, goes into the kitchen and, in a surprising twist, the girls then tell him he can finish it off, as opposed to teasing him like usual (or attempted murder in Shinobu\'s case). After shrugging the situation, Shungo does just that. Also different is that, opposed to it ending with a punishment for him, it instead ends with Ryoko simply eating something else. Not out of boredom, but because Reika asked her to sample their family\'s newest ramen. And for the first time in the whole series so far, Shungo is on the giving end of the punishment, yelling at Reika and calling her an idiot, alongside all the girls that helped with the pot. They then all eat their acquired ramen in sadness.It\'s something I felt didn\'t need to be written about in full at first, but due to the way the anime is structured, it came off as surprising that they took such a twist in what I believed were established concepts on how the rest of the anime\'s humor would flow. Shungo does a bunch of bizarre tasks with minimal punishment, Mayu is not bashful in the slightest due to the apparent drug-induced air from the pot and the women that normally tease Shungo instead help him make ramen for Ryoko. Really, I couldn\'t love this episode more due to the unfamiliar nature. Just this episode alone saved this anime from receiving a deadbeat score.Of course you would think that, with how highly I\'m praising the last episode I watched, it is rather bizarre I am now starting the review rather than seeing if the rest of the anime improves upon this. Well, I can\'t see this anime getting fresher than this. It will most likely be the same thing again and I imagine if he ends up with anyone, it will be Mayu. Or maybe one of his sisters punishments will get so bizarre that it ends with ""naked"" on her and decides to strip him of his virginity for not doing anything with Mayu. Maybe that would be a bit much, but due to how much Ryoko disrespects Shungo, I wouldn\'t be surprised if she did something so horrid.And as for the field trip episode that\'s been padded out, well, I imagine it won\'t be any different than the norm. Shungo probably doesn\'t want to peep at the girls, his friends make him do it anyway, he gets into an awkward situation with Mayu, Reika or both and then he is punished for it. Won\'t be surprised if my prediction is barely any different than what I will watch later.

I think they could look better. Sound was good as far as the theme song. The characters are all diffrent in apperance and style which goes appreciated, and finally it is quite enjoyable. I think one main running gag will be that our main man is like superman. He can do all these things like fight bears and tigers. Its funny to watch making enjoying the anime easy.

Highly recommended for people who like a romantic and simple anime all rolled in one."", 'tl;dr: An anime that has a plot that hasn’t aged all that well but may feel somewhat nostalgic, though the comedy still holds up decently well.This is an anime from 2007. That probably isn’t that old for some people, but is about the time I got into anime so I’m somewhat nostalgic for anime from the time. This very much felt like an anime from back then. Not just in terms of the art style and animation, but also in terms of the story and characters. It’s an incredibly generic anime for back then, but the tropes and such that it uses have actually fallen...out of favor so they’re actually not used all that much recently.The protagonist, Shungo, a high school student who lives only with his older sister as his parents are off on a trip to who knows where and are never seen the entire anime. His sister is a mercenary who makes him go through ridiculous training making him an incredibly powerful fighter, but that almost never matters. The first love interest, Mayu, is an airheaded succubus who has androphobia and is relying on Shungo to help her get over it. The second is an incredibly competent tsundere ojou-sama who has an army of attendants at her beck and call. Also, one of these two may be his childhood friend since Shungo keeps having dreams about there being someone he made a promise to, but he seems to have forgotten who. And of course Shungo is completely dense and has absolutely no personality outside of being nice. Also, loads of utterly ridiculous stuff happens, such as random death matches, aliens, highly maneuverable fighter jets, ninjas, etc. Throw in all the other standard stuff such as a beach episode, hot spring episode, boys trying to sneak into the girls room on a field trip, accidental grabbing and kissing, etc. too. Just go down the checklist and hit pretty much everything.The anime certainly isn’t incredible, but I enjoyed it as a throwback. The serious drama parts definitely haven’t aged well, though I guess they do have some charm. The comedy on the other hand I think has aged pretty well and overall the show is pretty funny when it’s trying to be. The anime also throws in purely comedic shorts unrelated to the main episode before the OP which I thought worked pretty well. I think I would have preferred for the serious parts during the main episode to take themselves less seriously and be funny as well, but the overall balance is decent enough though the pacing feels really slow during extended serious portions such as the finale. The finale is solid enough I suppose, if essentially completely predictable. I would also like to note that despite it being tagged as such, this isn’t a harem series as far as I understand the term. The protagonist only has two love interests. Of the other four girls in the poster, one I suppose teases him but it doesn’t seem like romantic development at all. The other three end up pairing off with other male characters and aren’t interested in the protagonist romantically.The art, animation, and designs, are in the style of anime from the late 20s, and are decent for then though not especially high quality. The same applies to the soundtrack, which is decent enough but not particularly memorable outside of a track that’s used for flashbacks and such. The OP and ED are both pretty solid in terms of the visuals and song. The eye catches are decent as well and remind me a lot of VNs from back then. out of favor so they’re actually not used all that much recently.The protagonist, Shungo, a high school student who lives only with his older sister as his parents are off on a trip to who knows where and are never seen the entire anime. His sister is a mercenary who makes him go through ridiculous training making him an incredibly powerful fighter, but that almost never matters. The first love interest, Mayu, is an airheaded succubus who has androphobia and is relying on Shungo to help her get over it. The second is an incredibly competent tsundere ojou-sama who has an army of attendants at her beck and call. Also, one of these two may be his childhood friend since Shungo keeps having dreams about there being someone he made a promise to, but he seems to have forgotten who. And of course Shungo is completely dense and has absolutely no personality outside of being nice. Also, loads of utterly ridiculous stuff happens, such as random death matches, aliens, highly maneuverable fighter jets, ninjas, etc. Throw in all the other standard stuff such as a beach episode, hot spring episode, boys trying to sneak into the girls room on a field trip, accidental grabbing and kissing, etc. too. Just go down the checklist and hit pretty much everything.The anime certainly isn’t incredible, but I enjoyed it as a throwback. The serious drama parts definitely haven’t aged well, though I guess they do have some charm. The comedy on the other hand I think has aged pretty well and overall the show is pretty funny when it’s trying to be. The anime also throws in purely comedic shorts unrelated to the main episode before the OP which I thought worked pretty well. I think I would have preferred for the serious parts during the main episode to take themselves less seriously and be funny as well, but the overall balance is decent enough though the pacing feels really slow during extended serious portions such as the finale. The finale is solid enough I suppose, if essentially completely predictable. I would also like to note that despite it being tagged as such, this isn’t a harem series as far as I understand the term.

First off, the lead character is INCREDIBLY likable (in my book)...the supporting characters' personalities have been used so often in the anime universe, that it's not even funny.The main character is the only character that has any charm, at all. There is bunches of fan service, but this anime is also VERY funny...*laughing in head* one character had small breasts and fantisized about pupularizing small breasts over large breasts, and handing out posters, making...large breasted girls  long for small breasts. It was funny.The music was great, GREAT. This anime seemed to have found a 'format' for good anime, and attempted following it, but it failed to provide personality for it's characters, and that is it's downfall.**I apologize for the grammar. large breasted girls  long for small breasts.

Add on top a sister who thinks she is Rambo.The storyline is almost as torturous as the life the male MC lives, as...he is tortured by girls and also too stupid to choose or reject anyone in typical harem fashion.  Most of the characters have no features you could like and it is about the ecchi/harem element more than good art, sound, characters, or storyI don't know what's worse the story or the likes of this get produced when so many better animes are left on the sidelines to die. he is tortured by girls and also too stupid to choose or reject anyone in typical harem fashion.

Eureka Seven AO,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12471/Eureka_Seven_AO,"[""OK. First off, let me just say that this series was a mess.I had huge expectations for this sequel since I'm a fan of E7, however, this didn't even come close. What I enjoyed about E7 was the story and character development. I actually felt connected to many of the characters. The story flowed very nicely. I even liked the Nirvash as its own character.E7AO started off ok while introducing the characters, then it quickly went downhill. The focus was more on the story and fight scenes. I dont think the story was good, but that's where the focus was.I liked Elena and Fleur and...i thought they had great potential. I thought that Fleur would develop feelings for Ao but that never happened. They actually threw in some signs that she had a thing for Gazzele. Elena made a lot of references to other anime. I picked up easily on the Evangelion ones. Both these characters failed to go further and were just part of the cast for a majority of the series until they decided to wrap it up and give them their scene. I felt like it just came out of nowhere. Ao just made me upset. He was a wet blanket. He was boring and indecisive until the end. Truth. Wow. Just wow. I think its always great to have a crazy character somewhere and let them have their 1 second insane facial expression, but Truth had his on more than half the time. It got old and annoying fast. Anemone is 100% a better character. I didn't even understand Naru. Noah was better than her.The Mecha designs were well done I think. I wish they gave a little more air time to appreciate them. What was bad was that there were too many special ones thrown in. There were several Nirvashs and it became confusing because of them coming from a different time and all that. I understand that there are two, but it seemed like there were many more. I wonder what the back story was for Truth's Mech. It just appeared.Then there's the story. The basic plot was good, but all the little details they threw in made it a wreck. I didn't even know what was going on half the time. There would be a serious fight going on, then it just switches over to a calm island scene. I didn't like this at all. It sucked the severity and seriousness of the events. They just jumped on the time travel hype, but time travel is really hard to put together. Its an interesting concept, but difficult to make it enjoyable. They would have been more successful if they had kept it more low key with a single goal. The protagonist didn't even know what his own goal was until the last episode. Also, that ending! Seriously, what the fuck? If you've seen it you probably have the same thoughts I have. The main questions, how and why. The series would be better off without it.What was good about the series were the animations and music. They were consistent with the first series. The openings and endings were also pretty good. The animations for Ao were a bit lacking about halfway though. It kept changing. It might have been just me.In conclusion, E7AO failed to meet my expectations. It may seem my intent was to bash the series but that is wrong. I'm just expressing what made me upset. It had a lot of potential so it makes me sad when it turn out like this. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to keep all of E7 in a good light. i thought they had great potential. I thought that Fleur would develop feelings for Ao but that never happened.

That doesn\'t stop people making the attempt though, and nowhere is this more prominent than in the world of fanfiction. This rather odd realm of amateur (and not-so-amateur), writers is filled with continuations, alternate retellings, character side-stories, non-canon additions, and a host of other works that reflect the fan\'s passion for the source material. Although they often lack the quality and direction (and sometimes the logic and common sense), of professional pieces, they\'re generally imaginative yarns that can...sometimes lead the reader to new insights about the original work.That said, there are occasions where the story has been created not out of love, but simply because the author feels that they can do better.Eureka Seven AO (which stands for Astral Ocean, but is also the name of the lead character), is the sequel to 2005\'s extremely popular Eureka Seven - and with director Kyoda Tomoki at the helm again and Bones producing both shows, it\'s easy to see why fans of the original would be excited. Written by Kato Yuichi, the new story focuses on Fukai Ao - a 13 year-old boy living with his grandfather on the island of Iwato Jima in the independent nation of Okinawa. Considered an outcast by the residents who blame the disaster that occurred ten years before on his mother Eureka - who has been missing since that time - his life changes when an accident delivers a strangely familiar bracelet into his hands, which in turn brings him into contact with a mysterious robot called Nirvash.The tale begins in relatively familiar territory and progresses at a decent pace for the first few episodes, but as the series continues more things are added to the plot until it grows into a ponderous, shambling behemoth of ideas and concepts that simply don\'t go anywhere. In addition to this the storyline degenerates into a mediocre monster-of-the-week narrative for a good portion of the show, and elements of the original series have either been left out, crowbarred in, or completely altered - sometimes for no logical reason at all - creating some major continuity issues. The problems are further compounded by the addition of time travel and alternate realities, all of which lead to a rather lukewarm, confusing, and decidedly unsatisfying ending that lacks the catharsis of the original series.Eureka Seven AO takes many of its visual cues directly from its parent, and Bones have worked hard to maintain the style while updating the design. That said, there are some odd decisions about clothing (Ao\'s school uniform resembles a costume used by male strippers),  but some good animation and effects work balances the strange outfits. Much of the aerial combat is fluid, and although there are some minor issues the character movements are handled in a reasonable manner. In addition to this the mechs - which are clearly influenced by the original series - have a definite ""man-made"" feel that highlights the creator\'s desire for Eureka Seven AO to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sequel.The show features two opening sequences that serve as bland-yet-functional introductions to the story thanks to the use of the check-box approach (protagonist running, birds flying, people looking pensive/cheerful/heroic/constipated, [insert cool action sequence], [insert suggestive minor spoiler that may have no connection to the plot at all], rinse, repeat, end with cool and/or spicy action still featuring the protagonist (and his love interest - male or female, species is optional), adverts, etc). The first closing sequence is equally unimaginative (and ticks all the boxes), but the second is something of a departure as it adopts a ""pop-art"" style and relies on still images to suggest that Ao\'s playtime is over.""Escape"" by Hemenway (the first opening track), is the type of bland rock song that seems to grace every major shounen title at least once, but FLOW\'s ""Bravelue"" manages to capture  at least some of the magic of ""Days"" - the opening theme from Eureka Seven. ""Stand By Me"" by the oddly named Steropony is a rather dull, brooding affair that doesn\'t really fit with the formulaic closing sequence, while Joy\'s ""Lolite"" is a poppy little number that works surprisingly well with the associated imagery.Eureka Seven AO is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to overall audio quality, and the uninspiring opening and closing themes are reflective of the music throughout the show. The predominantly well-chosen background tracks often work within the context of a given scene, but there are far too many attempts at enhancing a humourous moment using a comedic tune, and many of these attempts fall short of the mark. In addition to this the diverse array of effects can be let down by a lack of care with choreography or poor production quality, and the issues are further compounded by a script that is sorely lacking in emotional intensity. With little to work with the Japanese cast are unable to showcase their talents effectively - resulting in performances that vary wildly as the voice actors struggle to breathe some semblance of life into their roles. Unfortunately things don\'t get any better with the English dub as, true to form, the approach is literal and the scope is limited.One thing that should be pointed out is the continuous inability of the Western license holders to find people with accents to play particular roles, and it\'s painful to hear Sainty Reid as 16 year-old French pilot Fleur Blanc - especially when she macerates her way through terms like ""maman"" - the colloquial form of ""mère"" (mother). It\'s unfortunate that her first serious role is one that really needed a specific vocal style, and the truly sad part is that in an era where talented people can be found under every rock, viewers are still being subjected to the idea that everyone in the world speaks English (with an American accent), as their native language.The wastelands of anime are littered with the shades of forgettable characters, and the numerous problems with the storyline and script deal what could only be called a killing blow to Eureka Seven AO. The foundation of good characters lies in the logical development of the plot together with an organic approach to dialogue - both of which require time, patience, an understanding of relationships, and a healthy dose of criticism. The original series featured some good character dynamics that added personality to each role, making Renton, Eureka, and several others believable to a degree - but more importantly they became interesting and likeable. Unfortunately logic appears to have gone out of the window with this ""sequel"" - resulting in a set of bland ""people"" with few saving graces.The decision to treat Ao in a manner similar to Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion has backfired, and although some attempts have been made to save him from the pit of obscurity, he stands at the head of a queue of unlikable, uninteresting, and excruciatingly dull characters - all of whom shove him steadily towards the precipice. Truth initially serves as a decent antagonist, but his development is sorely lacking as he is quickly relegated from that role - becoming little more than a force of nature whose actions serve no purpose whatsoever. As for Naru, her status as Ao\'s love interest quickly loses all meaning once the plot shifts into monster-of-the-week mode, and like Truth her purpose in the story is ultimately rendered irrelevant. That said, there are some intriguing interactions between the supporting characters, but the approach to relationships is surprisingly lacking in emotional depth - becoming little more than background noises that are eventually swallowed by the confusing plot.Eureka Seven AO is a strange, lumbering beast that struggles to maintain its balance before the weight of its collective flaws sends it careening into the realms of logical fallacy, but the odd thing is that nobody appears to have noticed any of the obvious problems during the planning, production, or ADR stages of the show - which raises quite a few questions. Kato Yuichi\'s confusing, poorly written storyline has a mechanical feel that lacks emotion or passion for the original series, and in truth has more in common with amateur fanfiction written by someone whose ideas, imagination, and belief that they can do better are greater than their talent. The shoddy dialogue makes it difficult to like or believe in the characters, and fans of the original series may find this addition to the franchise painful to watch. That said, the show does feature some rather nice action sequences that can distract the audience from the mundanity, and there are some interesting aspects of the story that really should have been more prominent. If all the viewer wants is something to pass the time then Eureka Seven AO isn\'t the worst show available, and if it isn\'t examined too closely then the show may attract its own fan base.The decision to make a ""sequel"" to a successful show is understandable (anime is a business after all), but Eureka Seven AO highlights some issues that lie at the heart of the industry - in particular the lack of understanding about what the wider audience wants and a serious need for quality control at all levels. The simple fact is that the series has broken under the weight of too many unnecessary straws, and aside from the visuals the show lacks the finesse and polish that one would expect from a mainstream title. sometimes lead the reader to new insights about the original work.That said, there are occasions where the story has been created not out of love, but simply because the author feels that they can do better.Eureka Seven AO (which stands for Astral Ocean, but is also the name of the lead character), is the sequel to 2005\'s extremely popular Eureka Seven - and with director Kyoda Tomoki at the helm again and Bones producing both shows, it\'s easy to see why fans of the original would be excited.

Now here I am facepalming all over the place at how bad this show is, and how I was foolish to be excited for this.Let me start out by saying, the original Eureka Seven is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and it\'s just sad for me to see what BONES did. They are merely marketing a show purely based off of nostalgia, and putting zero effort into it, less so than those incomplete adaptions used to sell more of the source material.So first off, what is this show...all about? Well originally it was about Ao, Eureka\'s son as you probably could have guessed from the promo image, joining a group called Pied Piper-actually, just a subsection of Generation Blue-(The E7 AO equivalent of the Gekkostate, not.), and trying to find his mom (Who he calls ""Anma!""-Where did this shit come from?). From there, it\'s total nonsense, especially in the second half. Seriously, I doubt even BONES knows what they\'re writing in this show. Hell, it\'s even hard to review this show because it\'s so messy. So where did it all go wrong?Part of the problem is how Eureka Seven had a completely closed ending, with no loose ends. So, what the heck were they supposed to do for a story, a sequel story? Set it up in our world, instead of the world of the original E7? Introduce an overpowered villain with no motives, and then come up with something along the way? Put in terminology the viewer is completely unfamiliar with, and explain it midway when all the characters knew everything from the start, and assumed the viewers were the same? Put random things in, and forget about them completely in only a few episodes, making it completely redundant? How about just put in random crap to fill up 24 episodes? Really, these are warning signs the show is going to be a total mess.There are tons of plot holes everywhere (Especially in the final two episodes which are just one large Deus Ex Machina), and lots of things will not make sense as such. In one instance, it\'s stated everywhere the Secrets are not the enemy as they merely take an element called Quartz away from the Scub Corals. But then later, Generation Bleu tries to eliminate all the Secrets. Oh and let\'s not forget how you can travel around the world in only an hour, it doesn\'t matter where. Seems the earth is way smaller than it really is...How about the characters? Did the characters turn out good? Hardly, the show makes some of the same mistakes Shakugan no Shana III (Final) made. It introduces a bunch of characters, and then doesn\'t bother to develop them, or show any backstory, so they\'re just...there. Many characters will develop in some way, but it\'ll either make no sense, or it\'ll be a total character rewrite. We\'ll also get some good backstory, but the show then tosses it aside and forgets about it. The backstory rarely ends up being relevant to the story.Lastly, can we forget how they introduced certain elements you never in a million years wanted in E7? An otaku girl? Moe girls everywhere, resulting in a harem practically? Fanservice? And what purpose does this serve? Really, what does it serve for a good story? In this show, it can\'t co-exist with the story, and character development like does in various shows.Now the production values, believe it or not, despite being newer, E7 AO visually looks worse than its predecessor, and the animation can be rather messy. The soundtrack, same thing. Not all that much to it.Really, they should have either made this not a sequel, or took a page from Gonzo from when they made Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam, the sequel to Last Exile which also had a completely closed ending. That show managed to do a much better job at things, from the story, to the characters. It did not rely on purely nostalgia to tell a story, and the result wasn\'t all that bad.Eureka Seven AO in the end is a prime example of doing everything wrong in a show, and what happens when a studio uses only nostalgia to tell a story. Take the E7 fanboy glasses off, and you\'ll immediately notice the many, many problems. One can only hope less of these kinds of shows get made in the future. Nostalgia can be great, but not when you use it to tell a story for a show. all about?

We\'ll also get some good backstory, but the show then tosses it aside and forgets about it. The backstory rarely ends up being relevant to the story.Lastly, can we forget how they introduced certain elements you never in a million years wanted in E7? An otaku girl? Moe girls everywhere, resulting in a harem practically? Fanservice? And what purpose does this serve? Really, what does it serve for a good story? In this show, it can\'t co-exist with the story, and character development like does in various shows.Now the production values, believe it or not, despite being newer, E7 AO visually looks worse than its predecessor, and the animation can be rather messy. The soundtrack, same thing. Not all that much to it.Really, they should have either made this not a sequel, or took a page from Gonzo from when they made Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam, the sequel to Last Exile which also had a completely closed ending. That show managed to do a much better job at things, from the story, to the characters. It did not rely on purely nostalgia to tell a story, and the result wasn\'t all that bad.Eureka Seven AO in the end is a prime example of doing everything wrong in a show, and what happens when a studio uses only nostalgia to tell a story. Take the E7 fanboy glasses off, and you\'ll immediately notice the many, many problems. One can only hope less of these kinds of shows get made in the future. Nostalgia can be great, but not when you use it to tell a story for a show.', ""Eureka Seven AO serves as a sequel to the fantastic Eureka Seven of a few years ago. however to call it a sequel is akin to calling a doughnut a loaf bread, it shares many of the same base elements, is similar on a surface and level but make for totally different products in the end. one of which has a giant hole in the middle.The hole in this context is the story, or rather the lack of it. The series mulls around being a monster of the week show for the majority of it's run all the while attempting to raise mysteries and intrigue...around a few side plots that aren't really addressed till later. the problem however lies in when it actually does address those plots, it's painfully rushed, borderline incomprehensible at times and leaves the impression that writers didn't have an ending in mind and just sort of winged it for the last stretch of episodes, culminating in a bizarre mess of a plot which feels like it was over too fast and drawn out at the same time.the entire ordeal feels like a directionless mess. which spends so much time trying to make it seem like it's doing SOMETHING that it eventually becomes clear it's not really doing ANYTHING. introducing just a many plot points as it seemingly drops, it has a schizophrenic whiplash of a pace which never seems to settle in on what it wants to do enough to do any of it effectively.as far as the plot goes, it's a disappointment to prior fans of the franchise due to it's handling of what few legacy elements it embraces but at the same time relies fairly heavily on you knowing/liking the previous series to fully understand it, which leaves new fans in the cold too.While the story may be a broken mess, the animation and art design are actually very good. the show has some really impressive visuals at times and upholds to bones usual high standard of quality. backgrounds are often colourful and detailed and it features some of the nicest looking explosions I've seen in a long time.The primary character designs were handled by Kenichi Yoshida, who was the character designer for the first series, which lends a nice bit of visual familiarity to the series and helps tie it to the original series.mecha design is sadly a low point, the original series had shoji kawamori, a veritable god among mecha designers, and this series... doesn't. the mechs don't look bad on their own, but they lack the distinct visual punch the original had, only made worse by it's comparing the two styles.and finally you have the G-monsters or secrets, the primary antagonists of the series. which are essentially monsters made of polygonal shapes. their appeal seems to be a matter of taste, they are simplistic enough to resonate with some, but bland enough to be forgettable to others. personally i found them to be an interesting concept that turned out to be unmemorable due to their execution, another failing of the story and it's lack of direction.It's visuals are certainly one of it's strongest point and it rarely looks cheap, but some of the mecha/antagonist designs can feel sub-par which really takes away from some fairly well done action.the music is the only point i have absolutely no problems with. the score is handled by Koji Nakamura (of supercar, lama and ILL) and is a audible treat, i often found myself rewatching parts of episodes just to hear the songs going on in the background. it ranges nicely from slice of life calmness to intense mecha action perfectly and compliments those scenes fantastically as it goes. the few insert songs are also great, though musical taste may be a factor in your enjoyment of them.the music never failed to get me into the series moods and managed to accomplish the rare feat of both fitting the scenes subtly and without overstating itself but also being good enough for me to end up humming it long after watching episodes. of all it's traits, the soundtrack is the thing i've most taken away from AO and i personally am more likely to just listen to the soundtrack than rewatch the show.overall the series is a real mixed bag, on the surface level it's great. it's pretty and sounds great with a seeming return to a fantastic world. but as is often the case things are not quite what they seem. it's ties to the original series are tenuous and confusing, it's own plot is underdeveloped and meandering and the whole experience ends up feeling a bit hollow. it's fantastic presentation does a lot to carry it, but in the end the the story is weak and it's art isn't good enough to watch just for it.It's a case where the show is primarily bad, the most important thing (the story) is lacking and often confusing, but there is just enough good to balance it out. it ends up being a completely middle of the road show despite all it's qualities being at extremes. they just happen to cancel each other out into this weird show.Personally it left me with an odd impression.

Here are the reasons why,Eureka Seven AO focuses too much on the action. In the previous series, there was drama and love. I know most of you will think to yourself ""mecha animes aren\'t suppose to have any drama or love, just action"" but the drama in Eureka Seven was what made the series. It made you love the two main characters, Renton and Eureka. But in Astral Ocean, you don\'t have the same connection with Ao.The story of the show is still strong, it\'s...very mysterious. There are new entities called Secrets attacking the unnatural beings known as Scub Corals. There is a man named ""Truth"" who is trying to reveal the truth to the world (sorry if that sounded repetitive) and he is the shows main antagonist. There is Naru who was Ao\'s best friend who decided to go total whack on Ao one day and follow the main bad guy. And there is the mystery behind of ""what happened to Eureka and Renton?""The art is still beautiful like the original show, I love the action scenes and the mecha drawings, it\'s pure epic. The sound is crystal clear, the openings and endings are amazing, (OP 2- Very Nostalgic to Eureka Sevens original opening), and overall I give the animation and sound effects a ten.Here is where I get a bit pissy. The characters seem very bland compared to the characters in the original series. Renton from the original series was a crybaby, he was a crybaby but we got to know his character so well that we felt like we actually knew him. He was very true to himself, and he loved Eureka dearly. He cared for others and put his life on the line at certain times. The rest of the crew- members in the Gekkostate (Gekkostate is their flying ship) all had their own unique looks and traits that made us love them. Holland (the captain) was a bit of a jerk but nonetheless I loved him as a character of the show.But the characters in Astral Ocean is a different story. Eureka Seven had humor and the characters were fun to watch and listen to. But in Astral Ocean, many of the characters seem way too serious and it feels like you can grab several characters and just meld them into one person- that\'s how boring they are. A lot of characters feel the same to me and I just don\'t connect with them.Even Holland (from the Original series) was such an ass to Renton that I actually hated Holland. To actually hate someone that doesn\'t even exist, means that they\'re a good and true character.Here\'s how bad the characters are in Astral Ocean- I won\'t be sad if Ao dies. I\'m serious. He\'s the main character but he\'s so boring like the rest, that I don\'t feel like I\'ll be very sad if he died. However, if Renton died, I would be extremely sad and I\'ll hate the show for killing him, (thank God he didn\'t die) but if Ao dies, I\'ll just say ""meh the show could still possibly go on without him"" (and a lot other characters besides).The only reason I\'m still putting up with this show is because I can\'t wait to see Renton and Eureka reunite. But Ao? Whatever. He can do whatever he wants to, because he\'s as boring as the shows pet.My enjoyment of the show would be around a 6 when my overall enjoyment from the predecessor would be a 9.Overall the show gets a 7 because the art and action saves it from dropping below a 5.Watch Eureka Seven then watch Astral Ocean.

You\'ll see a depressing drop and you\'ll wonder, what in the hell happened?', 'It may be early days yet, but the refreshed and reinvigorated Eureka Seven franchise holds great promise.  Earmarked as it\'s spiritual sequel, Eureka 7 AO appears to not only match its predecessor in beauty and story, but does create firm groundwork to better it.StoryBy the end of the first episode, I was hooked.  The whole progression is well-built, where E7-AO dips its toes pretty evenly between character dialogue and fast-paced action scenes.  Just when you think the action has outstripped its relevance, the plot yanks you back, to cover any gaps you may have missed.  This to and fro between action...and deep & moving storytelling creates means each is that much more compelling, as it is contrasted with one another.  Episode four typifies this, where one half is pure mind-melting action, and the other half delving into the deeper mysteries of Ao and his mother.More interestingly, the story feels darker than the original E7.  This comes out in the open depictions of violence by the ""G-Monsters"" to the open yet diverse political opinion voiced between the main characters.  Yes, politics and divided issues do form a subtle undertone here.  Themes such as racism, nationalism, political identity and independence, and even government corruption are bandied about from character to character.  Pippo\'s snide reply to Giselle\'s remark that the Nirvash being part French, US and theirs springs to mind (""it’s fat, wants to surrender and has bad teeth"").It reminds me A LOT of X\'amd in a way, which also grappled with these issues, and as such, really makes the story feel real and visceral.  More importantly, it feels like the story has aged with the viewer.  Whereas E7 placed the viewer squarely in the sheltered and naive hands of Renton; here in AO, Bones does away with the protection and says: ""Here\'s the real world - its not a fluffy fantasy - it\'s real, gritty and desperate.""  Nothing evokes better emotional responses than that.Art & SoundPlease.  It\'s Bones we\'re talking about here.  There should be no question over this stuff.  The artwork is BEAUTIFUL (as usual) and the voice-acting is top notch.  More interestingly, the music really sounds like an improvement on E7, which did feel a tad repetitive.  Here the music, especially the track concluding episode one, is swelling and moving.CharactersFor me, Ao as the protagonist is distinctly different from his previous counterpart (Renton).  Renton in E7, was grossly naive for much of the early episodes, and his mood fluctuated wildly, often transpiring into tears or bouts of frustration/anger.  Pretty understandable for his age BUT it did get on my nerves a little (probably doesn\'t bode well for when I have kids).  Ao on the other hand, appears to be far more assured and assertive.  He rarely contemplates/broods over issues, and rather jumps quickly to proactive action (Renton, to be fair, did this at times).  For this reason, I prefer Ao, owing to his more assertive nature.  Sure, there are times he is shocked or saddened, but several times, he shows this tough resilient attitude, such as the end of episode one.  At other times, he acts entrenched and guarded of his secrets, such as his first interactions with Flair Blanc.  Finally, Ao just seems to be less naive to Renton.This is really the same for all the main characters in general.  Naru, the vulnerable romantic interest, Elena and Fleur combining to make tenacious yet comical Generation Bleu team to the rough and rebellious Giselle and his crew (much like Holland and his).  By the end of the four episode, each of these characters (and more) are memorable and provide their own watermark on the story.  This most of all shows fantastic storytelling and writing, that it has only taken FOUR EPISODES, to flesh out stories, that take some animes triple the time to get to.OH - and how could I forget NOAH.  Easily the best pet-sloth-thingy ever. It\'s like Bones stole the ""cuteness"" potion from the Powderpuff Dolls and smeared it all over the one animal.  Awesomesauce.ConclusionOne analogy springs to mind when summing up E7:AO so far.  One of my best mates produces electronic music, which is a time-consuming and hair-tearing process.  By the end of writing and recording the track, the track must undergo ""mastering.""  What mastering does, is basically it crams as much synth, bass, treble, percussion and general loudness into the smallest capacity.  This process is often rife with error, and as such, the perfect final sound is hard to come by, yet sought endlessly by my friend.Eureka Seven AO is really beginning to feel like that perfect mastering.  To bring back to the topic at hand, it just feels like the writers have managed to craft episode after episode crammed with great storytelling - such that by the time the 22min (or so) disappears, you feel like you\'ve watched an hour of story in 5 minutes.  Every second is utilised.  No unnecessary fat here.E7:AO has set high expectations from its great opening episodes.  As such, many commentators preach that like most anime, there will come the inevitable dip, when the studio needs to pad out the script.  However, judging from the past episodes, I feel quietly confident that AO is quite safe in the mastered hands of Bones.UPDATE: Episode 12 and on.WOW.  Just wow.  M Night Shamalamalamalyan (maybe incorrect spelling :P) would be envious of this well performed twist.  Without divulging spoilers, episode 12 represents a significant shift in the plot surrounding E7:AO, and direct links between E7 and E7:AO are beginning to show clarity, like peering through a clearing fog.Up to this point, the plot feels like it has taken 3 sharp ""chapters"".  Episodes 1-4 really introduce us to Ao and the main characters, as well as the greater world of E7:AO.  Episodes 5-10 then slow down the pace, and allow in-depth character development to proceed, of supporting characters.  Then from episode 11, the series begins to pick up pace again, whereby many questions and answers are raised, as the worlds of E7 and E7:AO begin to collide.Regarding the three parts, probably 5-10 is the weakest.  I still enjoyed them, but the view between E7 fans, voyeurs and the general mishmash of commentators appeared to hold a mixed, if not, negative reaction.  In a way, I do share their criticisms.  These episodes were very formulaic, whereby each episode could be summarised as the following:Supporting character problemProtagonist tags alongMonster of the week appearsMonster of the week is destroyed + supporting character overcomes issuePudding is had by allIn hindsight (eg. after seeing episode 12+), I can see why BONES had to approach the supporting characters with such detail, as the characters of Ao, Naru, Truth, Elena, Fleur and Ivica become incredibly central (I predict) to the quickly changing plot.  But, I also think that despite the product being good, BONES could of thought of perhaps a more complex path to get there.  To be fair, I am nitpicking, so as to not come across as completely biased :PTo cut to the chase: if you are an E7 fan but are unsure whether to proceed through the series, perhaps due to getting restless during eps 5-10 or due to the somewhat negative fans, my recommendation is to persist at least till episode 12.  I can at least predict that if you watch it no further, you will still get a kick out of a certain blue-haired individual making their fashionably-late entrance ;) and deep & moving storytelling creates means each is that much more compelling, as it is contrasted with one another.

That\'s is all....okay, that wouldn\'t make for much of a review, but really, the best way I can put this series was it was painful to watch. I remember seeing the original series in both English and Japanese and loved both. One of the few English dubs that I didn\'t despise that much. I really hope this doesn\'t get localized so it can slap the faces of any other Eureka Seven fans that don\'t watch subbed anime.Okay, enough venting and more reviewing. The problem with this series was the story and character development...and boy, was it bad. Bones had a pretty...strong reputation before this series but I get the impression it\'s going to take a major hit. The writers tried to create an innovative plot that took Eureka Seven character archetypes, put them in a time travel/dimensional travel plot, and see what happens. It\'s almost as if Bones took a look at Steins;Gate and said ""see how successful this was?! We need to do that!"" Problem is, Steins;Gate created a full cast of likable characters and didn\'t make the plot any deeper than it had to be. This? It was confusing from start to finish. It\'s one thing to slowly pace out plot development out of suspense, it\'s a complete other thing to slowly pace out plot development and then not have a proper payoff.What made the original series so great was the character development. There was a cast that was well hashed out, well developed, and most importantly, the characters were actually likable and memorable. Astral Ocean failed in that department. It had some unique characters that could\'ve filled that role. I felt as though Elena and Fleur were probably the best characters outside of Ao in this series when it comes to likability. However, even they were not hashed out as well as they should\'ve been and in moments where the dramatic tension should\'ve been high, it wasn\'t. Simply put, I react well to animes that can convince me that there\'s dramatic tension between the characters and how they respond to each other. I wasn\'t sold on any of their dramatic tension.By far the WORST part of Eureka Seven: Ao though was the ending. Since I\'m not allowed to ""spoil"" it, I\'ll just come out and say...it was pointless...and I mean that literally. The ending deemed the entire Eureka Seven: Ao storyline essentially pointless. On top of that, it COMPLETELY hung Ao, the series lead character, out to dry. I found it to be an absolute TERRIBLE approach. It\'s one thing to have a tragic ending that has an affect on the main cast of characters. This anime didn\'t have that. It had a tragic ending that effectively left zero impact on the main cast of characters. Buzz kill is really the best way to describe the ending.I know I said a lot of bad things about E7: Astral Ocean so far, but are there any good things? Yeah, there are. The artwork was pretty consistent with the original series and I\'d even say slightly better. Although, I do think they went a little overboard with Truth\'s facial expressions. The music on the whole was pretty good. I also found myself REALLY enjoying the 2nd OP BlazBlue by FLOW. The OP set up the feel that the anime would have an epic 2nd half...so good advertising on Bones part...just poor execution.Ultimately, the bad outweighs the good. I can say that for the most part, I did enjoy the series but like many series before it, poor writing and an absolute ""worst possible ending"" just ruined the series for me. The writers tried to do way too much with the plot and not enough with the character development. In an attempt to be innovative, the writers instead created a confusing, heaping mess that even by the time everything was cleared up and explained, it left me unsatisfied. For a sequel to a great series like Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean failed to meet expectations...and then some. strong reputation before this series but I get the impression it\'s going to take a major hit. The writers tried to create an innovative plot that took Eureka Seven character archetypes, put them in a time travel/dimensional travel plot, and see what happens. It\'s almost as if Bones took a look at Steins;Gate and said ""see how successful this was?! We need to do that!"" Problem is, Steins;Gate created a full cast of likable characters and didn\'t make the plot any deeper than it had to be. This? It was confusing from start to finish. It\'s one thing to slowly pace out plot development out of suspense, it\'s a complete other thing to slowly pace out plot development and then not have a proper payoff.What made the original series so great was the character development. There was a cast that was well hashed out, well developed, and most importantly, the characters were actually likable and memorable. Astral Ocean failed in that department. It had some unique characters that could\'ve filled that role. I felt as though Elena and Fleur were probably the best characters outside of Ao in this series when it comes to likability. However, even they were not hashed out as well as they should\'ve been and in moments where the dramatic tension should\'ve been high, it wasn\'t. Simply put, I react well to animes that can convince me that there\'s dramatic tension between the characters and how they respond to each other. I wasn\'t sold on any of their dramatic tension.By far the WORST part of Eureka Seven: Ao though was the ending. Since I\'m not allowed to ""spoil"" it, I\'ll just come out and say...it was pointless...and I mean that literally. The ending deemed the entire Eureka Seven: Ao storyline essentially pointless. On top of that, it COMPLETELY hung Ao, the series lead character, out to dry. I found it to be an absolute TERRIBLE approach. It\'s one thing to have a tragic ending that has an affect on the main cast of characters. This anime didn\'t have that. It had a tragic ending that effectively left zero impact on the main cast of characters. Buzz kill is really the best way to describe the ending.I know I said a lot of bad things about E7: Astral Ocean so far, but are there any good things? Yeah, there are. The artwork was pretty consistent with the original series and I\'d even say slightly better. Although, I do think they went a little overboard with Truth\'s facial expressions. The music on the whole was pretty good. I also found myself REALLY enjoying the 2nd OP BlazBlue by FLOW.

The artwork is new and definitely fresh and at moments has some almost 3D aspects but it still has the Eureka 7 feel to it. The manga and the anime have a few different ambiguities that are slight.

This review will tell you what to expect from E7: AO so you can be spared the headaches if you don't want to watch it. I won't be doing the generic reviews of the usual elements since many others have covered them.First, don't expect that the original series is paralleled here in AO.

Eureka 7 AO gave us the promise of Eureka's son, Ao, trying to discover his mother's whereabouts by trudging through some complicated conflicts between military factions and Generation Bleu. While this idea showed its potential for much of the first half of the series, while also digging into the complicated issues surrounding affairs between the mentioned factions and monster threats, later episodes get increasingly messy with...the title's writing and its exploration of characters.Let us first talk about the choices of writing for AO. The original series had a clear direction for what it wished to accomplish with Gecko State's motives, revealing Eureka's origins, some pretty shocking secrets surrounding the origins of the world and Dewey Novak's manipulations to bring forth his own twisted plans. For AO though, the series starts getting messy towards the middle of the show when we come to learn of Eureka's whereabouts as it introduces a convoluted plot device, that I won't spoil here, that makes things rather hard to follow with what exactly is happening to her and how this element to the plot affects things for later events in the series. The series also gets in the rather obnoxious habit of creating twists in the direction of the plot that you would assume would be relevant for later events of the show or unveiling details on characters yet in many cases, these twists aren't quite as relevant and were mostly there to swerve the audience. The final two episodes that were hyped up to just recently were noticeably more fast paced than earlier episodes of AO as a major character from the first season of the series finally made his appearance and the resolution to the series will have one questioning what the entire point of it even was with how mean-spirited and contradicting AO was from how it presented itself in the earlier episodes.Characterization was another issue effecting AO. Relevant characters in the original series got a good amount of fleshing out with their personalities and backgrounds so the audience would learn to care for the issues faced by them throughout the series and see how they eventually grow throughout the series. Even among the supporting characters, the first series still gave them enough personality where they were entertaining to see in serious and light-hearted moments. In AO though, many characters who were relevant in the major events of the series get limited development and don't have much in the way of personality, limiting any kind of connection one could get from them. Those characters who do get reasonable fleshing out are still limited in their development and growth thanks to the mentioned messy writing. Any chemistry between characters that would have one think there is a significant bond between them, like friendship, family or love, or there is development of one is snuffed aside for the most part thanks to larger focus being on the advancement of AO's plot.The only thing that AO seemed to genuinely land right were the visuals. Eureka 7 AO retains the same animation style used from the first season of the series while having a more vivid color palette and smoother details. The fluid and intense mecha fights are also retained here as well and make for some of the best animated moments I've seen from a TV anime this year.Overall, Eureka 7 AO made for one of the year's biggest disappointments for me in terms of expectations. While I was expecting a title that would retain the spirit of the original Eureka 7 in exploring Ao's search for his mother from its earlier episodes, AO became quite a mess in terms of writing and characterization in later episodes as it had trouble deciding on a proper direction to follow with its elements compared to the original series.

How can you do this to me?Honestly, it wouldn\'t have been an awful anime standing on it\'s own. But you had to attach it to Eureka 7, to which I have so many fond memories and emotions attached!My first complaint with this anime is.. The waste of time. The key points of this episode could have been done in 12 episodes. There were no real filler episodes either!Why 12? Well, at least half the content was just boring: Go here, kill these guys. Minor character development. Nothing really happens.My next complaint is.. the characters. The super powers, they didn\'t make sense...in this universe. To some extent, Naru fit in great. However, Truth was just the personification of every awful villain of any anime. Even when you get his full story. He just sort of.. is horrible.The other thing about the characters.. Is the lack of development. Even on the main characters. We saw more development from Moon Doggy in E7 than we did from Ao in the entire series.Third complaint.The story doesn\'t make sense. I hate time travel. Hate it! With a passion, and this took confusing time travel and made it more confusing. They never answer a few questions which arise like ""Were the scubs actually time traveling, or were they going to another universe in which an earlier time period of earth was occuring?"" We don\'t have the insightful mind of a character like Dr. Bear to elaborate to the viewers what the staff knows.To that end on the story. It kind of ruins the original series. I don\'t think I\'ve been this dismayed at  a series end since Mass Effect 3.While creating a clone of the original is  fruitless endeavor, making the sequel more similar than distant to the original story should have taken a  precedent. When it didn\'t apparently. There were so many avenues to be followed upon with the original anime but instead they offer this short series which honestly should have been way shorter.What I really missed were those scenes where you felt in touch with the character. I remember literally crying during Anemone\'s lamenting, and the tears of joy that followed when Eureka and Renton helped her see past the life she was locked in to.Granted the end of Eureka 7 PoP was a little bit trippy for me, it was still amazing compared to what we got from Astral Ocean.Goddamn how Bones has fallen. in this universe.

Now usually when I do that I rarely go back to finish watching it but E7 was different. I found myself checking it out once more and loving it! I\'ll tell you why I was so compelled to watch that anime again despite initially not liking it very much....the characters and character development was great! Even for characters I did not like such as...Dewy and Holland. I still was able to understand where they were coming from. Talho was a flawed character as well but she had a personality and was likable. Renton, I thought he was the typical mech anime boy until he opened up and revealed his true and honest feelings toward eureka, his family life, and his future. I was glad that none of the characters were up in Renton\'s buttcrack like most of anime characters tend to be toward the main character, they just liked him. Eureka, once again I thought she was the typical expressionless anime girl but she surprised me and revealed to be a girl who suffered a lot and truly wish to set everything right. Her, Renton, the kids, and the members of the Gekko State were unique and enjoyable to watch.But don\'t expect that from E7:AONow when I finished watching E7 and heard there was a second part I was so happy I immediately began watching it. We\'re introduced to Ao who is Renton and Eureka\'s son and I\'m thinking great start! But soon you learn that Eureka and Renton are nowhere in sight and he is in fact in another world on another timeline. Apparently Eureka and Renton get separated and Eureka came to their world and had her kid and went back blah blah.First of all, don\'t expect to find decent character development here. The characters are ALL typical mech anime characters. First we have typical mech anime boy Ao who gets recruited to join ""Generation Blue"" a military like organization that uses children to fly IFOs because for some odd reason only children can fly IFOs *eye roll*All of the characters are one dimensional including Ao. He\'s the typical mech anime boy that all the characters instantly love even when they say they don\'t. He comes complete with a ""funny"" pet, and a love interest whom he feels he must fight to protect.  Of course there is a chief of the child pilots who love them all like they were his own children. And the story does take a five minute break every five episodes so we can see the characters be ""quirky"". But is this character development? No! These characters are so bland they could really all be just one person and you would never notice. These characters lack everything that made the members of the Gekko State fun and interesting to watch. The members of the Gekko state had lives, the members of Generation Blue needed to get a life. There is really nothing to them but never ending mech battles. Gone are the priceless moments such as the Gekko team tricking Renton into thinking a bowl of Ramen was a deadly mission. Instead with AO you get some banter about whether or not Ao can swim. Gone are deep characters like Charles and Ray and instead you get....nothing! None of these characters are remember-able!The plot of AO simply sucks! the creators try to be deep with the whole mysteriousness of it but it\'s really just a ploy to keep people watching cause they really have NO PLOT!They try to do this whole time travel deal but it\'s a mess.Now I don\'t mind time travel stories being a little messy but this was just a hot mess and it seems as though the creators are just pulling plots out their rear to compensate for the lack of character. For example; When Eureka arrives again in that world on board a ruined Gekko State she is pregnant and just before Ao helps her go back she says she\'s having a girl not a boy which leads Ao to question the whereabouts of a mysterious older sister. There is never much of a explanation as to how Eureka is constantly traveling to that particular world while pregnant and she never even seems to remember anything. The anime also tries to remain interesting by not explaining anything and coming up with stupid names that are supposed to make you question what is going on. Such as ""The Secrets"" ""The truth"" *eye roll*Yes the main villain\'s name is Truth and apparently he\'s Ao\'s girlfriend\'s (Haru) Nirvash although he\'s not in mech form. Anyway he\'s called a ""Secret"" which at first are the main bad guys of the show. Sigh. So this regular girl gets her own Nirvash simply because she was accidentally exposed to scub corals? Then she spends her time riding on the real Nirvash  for some reason. Blah blah. And of course Ao wants to save her blah blah. The creators for some reason thought it made sense to take away everything that made Eureka and Renton and subsequently Ao, so special and just pass them to the other bland characters like hot cakes. Anyway, the story sucks, the characters suck, and the music sucks. I tried to watch as much as I could just to see Renton and Eureka and so far all I saw was Eureka and the show picked up somewhat but she left and it was back downhill again. Dewy and Holland. I still was able to understand where they were coming from. Talho was a flawed character as well but she had a personality and was likable.

But I wanted to get this down since I just recently finished watching Eureka Seven AO. Probably won\'t bother doing much editing either. So here goes my review of Eureka Seven: Astral Ocean.I will start this off by saying up-front I am a huge fan of the first Eureka Seven. It is by-far my number one favorite anime next to Steins;gate, NHK, and a few others. Tbh, I did have some pretty high expectations for the sequel. Based on how well Bones did with the first series. I really...wanted / hoped the next one to be just as good if not better. And i figured with the way things ended with the last one they were free to do whatever they pleased and it should be fine. Right?First off, in the beginning of AO I liked how everything was going. Bones has a way of leaving you with questions and building curiosity and suspense. After about maybe not even mid way through the season I got bored of it. Like, okay I liked where it was going but from the early-mid to end the plot practically stays the same. It\'s just flat out boring. Cool actions scenes, if you\'re into that kind of stuff. But not much worth watching if you\'re looking for a good story and some character development.Speaking of development, AO had absolutely NONE (if any) character development. In Eureka Seven you got to see Renton grow from this clumsy silly little kid to this sort of heroic figure. And throughout the show you really get to connect with the cast. They were so likeable. Not only that you got to see what kind of challenges Renton faced as a young boy growing up. Not to mention the added love story which pretty much completed it.I don\'t really want to delve into the soundtrack a whole lot but MY GOD they are seriously lacking in the OST department for AO. How do you go from an awesomely ridiculous soundtrack to like, half-assing the new OST?It\'s as though Bones just said, ""okay let\'s see how bad we can screw up and see if any of the fans will notice."" I\'m glad I\'m not the only one who noticed that there was a lot that should\'ve been fixed with the new series. I won\'t spoil anything but some characters that were added were unnecessary. Because they hardly served any purpose other than to be there just for show.If anything they introduced new elements to E7:AO that didn\'t need to be there so they ended up spending more time explaining all the new elements and spent less time on the story and characters. As a matter of fact there were a lot of things in AO that they simply wasted time trying to explain. I felt like I was watching a whole new show. Hardly anything reminded me of the original E7. So for the most part I would watch it believing this was some stinky new anime that just aired.All in all, I watched AO with an open mind and holding it to no standards too high but even as an anime for simply watching and enjoying, or killing time, I couldn\'t have been more disappointed. I might as well have watched paint dry if sheer disappointment didn\'t kill me first. If I had to say whether or not I would watch it again. I may. But I\'d skip through most of it because some scenes are a nuisance and a waste of time to watch.If you read the reviews before watching, you probably shouldn\'t have. Just some fair advice. You should probably go watch it yourself before checking the reviews to get your own opinion on AO. Because I get a feeling that not very many people are going to be too thrilled about this one.tl;dr? E7 was the best. Nothing can compare. =) wanted / hoped the next one to be just as good if not better. And i figured with the way things ended with the last one they were free to do whatever they pleased and it should be fine. Right?First off, in the beginning of AO I liked how everything was going. Bones has a way of leaving you with questions and building curiosity and suspense. After about maybe not even mid way through the season I got bored of it. Like, okay I liked where it was going but from the early-mid to end the plot practically stays the same. It\'s just flat out boring. Cool actions scenes, if you\'re into that kind of stuff. But not much worth watching if you\'re looking for a good story and some character development.Speaking of development, AO had absolutely NONE (if any) character development. In Eureka Seven you got to see Renton grow from this clumsy silly little kid to this sort of heroic figure. And throughout the show you really get to connect with the cast. They were so likeable. Not only that you got to see what kind of challenges Renton faced as a young boy growing up. Not to mention the added love story which pretty much completed it.I don\'t really want to delve into the soundtrack a whole lot but MY GOD they are seriously lacking in the OST department for AO. How do you go from an awesomely ridiculous soundtrack to like, half-assing the new OST?It\'s as though Bones just said, ""okay let\'s see how bad we can screw up and see if any of the fans will notice."" I\'m glad I\'m not the only one who noticed that there was a lot that should\'ve been fixed with the new series. I won\'t spoil anything but some characters that were added were unnecessary. Because they hardly served any purpose other than to be there just for show.If anything they introduced new elements to E7:AO that didn\'t need to be there so they ended up spending more time explaining all the new elements and spent less time on the story and characters. As a matter of fact there were a lot of things in AO that they simply wasted time trying to explain. I felt like I was watching a whole new show. Hardly anything reminded me of the original E7. So for the most part I would watch it believing this was some stinky new anime that just aired.All in all, I watched AO with an open mind and holding it to no standards too high but even as an anime for simply watching and enjoying, or killing time, I couldn\'t have been more disappointed. I might as well have watched paint dry if sheer disappointment didn\'t kill me first. If I had to say whether or not I would watch it again. I may. But I\'d skip through most of it because some scenes are a nuisance and a waste of time to watch.If you read the reviews before watching, you probably shouldn\'t have. Just some fair advice. You should probably go watch it yourself before checking the reviews to get your own opinion on AO. Because I get a feeling that not very many people are going to be too thrilled about this one.tl;dr? E7 was the best. Nothing can compare. =)', ""After watching Eureka 7 and loving it I decided that I would give this anime a try.  I tried to go into it with an open mind knowing the eureka series, however this is not what I expected.  The best way I can describe this anime is a mecha mystery mess.Story- In my opinion I do not feel that this story is solid.  There are many holes and mysteries that even after watching up to episode 20 still don't make sense or haven't been explained.  This story has endless plot holes that will most likely never be explained or never make...any sense.  You can't really write much about this anime without  giving anything away the only things they do explain.Art- The art isn't bad. There is a lot of color and the characters are well drawn.Sound-well this category has never made sense to me because any anime I watch has good sound..Characters- The characters of Eureka ao are not that great. Your left with wondering why some of them are even in the anime at all, and what their purpose is.  Especially his friend Naru.  I can't seem to stand her.Enjoyment- I can say that after each eps. that I watch I get more irritated and seem to dislike this anime even more.  I can't enjoy something that irritates me.  To be honest I continue to watch it in some hopes that something that will happen. Some glimmer of hope that they will explain some of the mystery with the secrets, with Ao's sister....why the hell Naru is all high and mighty now...Overall-I gave it a 4 for some level of hope that it will redeem itself with some awesome ending.  If you are looking for an anime like Eureka this isn't it.   This anime doesn't have half the amazing components that Eureka 7 had! any sense.

Since i have reached the half way mark of AO i felt like it would be a good idea to give a opinion on it now, then an opinion after the show. Also i will not be ranting in any case of this review. I feel like people aren't here to hear a rant they want to know about what the anime features good and bad.Eureka 7 AO or its full name Eureka 7 Astral Ocean is the sequel to the very...popular Romantic/Mech anime Eureka 7. If you have not seen Eureka 7 yet then it's recommended to watch it before AO as it does mention very important things that people who watched Eureka 7 would know. Another thing to note is that AO takes place in a different universe than the original show which is explained in the original Eureka 7 and in some of AO.The story takes place on Okinawa's isolated island of Iwado where a young boy of the age 12 named Ao (yes the main characters name is the same as the anime title) Fukai lives. Ever since he was born nobody liked him and was known by many as a foreigner. Why? AO knows very little of why everyone hates him but what he does know is his mom at a very young age. She had Beautiful aquamarine hair and Mallow eyes with a red fringe. But soon after AO was born his mom left him alone with the old doctor of the island  Toshio Fukai. AO tried living a normal life on thel island just like anybody else on the island, accompanied by her childhood friend Naru. a young girl of the age 13. Soon after AO's mom's appearance scub bursts begin to appear all over the world. for those who do not know Scubs are Intelligent lifeforms that has been on earth for 1,000's of years before the series. As soon as the scub bursts appear secrets( uninditified objects) appear creating havoc at wherever their destination is which is really close to scub bursts.  But back to the story of Ao, Scub bursts start occurring more and more on his island and then he soon gets caught in the situation of the scubs and secrets and meets a mysterious robot named the Nirvash. A bit after his situation he soon joins Generation Bleu a organization dedicated to stopping the Secrets and extracting certain objects from the scubs. AO is teamed up with a group who name themselves the pied piper. From then on AO is dedicated to helping the world by defeating the secrets with the help of Nirvash.I do not want to spoil everything I just wanted to Talk about the intro and a little summery of how AO got to the position he's in now. Story wise it keeps you very intrested in whats going on, but. It can at times be very slow in the first few episodes. It may also be very repetitve at times but they keep it from not getting to boring. But, give it time and it will become very awarding after the few episodes.Like Original, Like Sequel, AO was able to provided outstanding visual performance that's even better than its Original. The animations had amazing detail and the fights with the secrets looked top notch and detailed. the way the trapar waves in this anime looked was outstanding even better than Eureka 7. The art was phenomenal all the colors that they added and all the detail in the background really gave it a addicting feel to it. The way the hair moved and the way the models interacted was outstanding job.Bones seemed to pull it off again creating an amazing soundtrack for this anime. The music being played in certain scene gave it more emotion to that certain scene and created a sense of enjoyment. The sound effects in the anime sounded splendid to such as the way the Nirvash moved on the trapar waves or the battles with the secrets. As for voice actors, They sound fantastic the way the put in their emotions in certain scenes just added to the Anime's quality. As the music did sound great their were a few scenes where the sound shouldn't have fit in or just sounded weird. But never the less it is a great soundtrack.The Characters definitively provided a sense of enjoyment to the anime. AO the main protagonist was really great and had a great personalty. Naru was really great character to be with AO its as if they could be lovers but i digress.  Noah AO's pet sloth was really funny to watch too. As for other characters, Gazelle played a very important part in AO's story he has a great sense of how people feel and is a very smart person. Truth supposedly the main antagonistic of the story so far is really played out well. His ability's were really unique and kept you wanted to know who he was. Team pied piper are alright too but it seems as though they don't provide lots of back story about them SO FAR! Fleur and Elena are very interesting but it would be great to know more about them. As for Ivica the leader of the pied piper he has an interesting back story that's really enjoyable to watch. Other characters in AO kept the story interesting and made the anime oh so more fun to watch.Eureka 7 AO provides a great deal of detail so far that keeps you wanting for more. Story wise it is really interesting but can get a bit repetitive and boring at times mostly just in the first few episodes. The art and animations are especially phenomenal and top notch for a show of its caliber it will keep you entertained with stunning visuals and effects. The music and sound effects play out very nicely in certain scenes of this anime and voice actors are espically top notch.(do know that I am talking about sub right now as dub has not came out yet.) The characters are very unique in there own ways and are very fun to watch. As for action and Mechas Eureka 7 AO is not so technical when it comes to Mecha battles they are mostly quick battles that are very entertaining to watch and are unique in their own way from other Mecha's. If you are a hardcore mecha fan then you will see that this show isnt really based on mechas but more of the characters themselves. Overall this anime is well worth the watch for anyone who has seen Eureka 7 the orginal show. for new people who are watching this first it can become very confusing and will leave your brain in knots and twists.DO NOTE THAT I AM MAKING 2 PARTS THIS IS PART 1 OF WHAT I THINK AND PART 2 WILL BE AFTER EPISODE 26.

SO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I MAY CHANGE MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE SHOW AFTER THE ENDING FOR THE GOOD OR BAD.THANK YOU :D."", ""As quick overview to this review:  I liked Eureka AO but, I can't get into what I liked without discussing its shortcomings as a series and sequel first. There are a considerable amount of shortcomings to this series but, I am going to try to condense them down into three primary faults from which other problems with this series stem.Probably the biggest problem I initially had with this sequel is that it denies fans the happy ending that a lot of us had pictured as following the end of Eureka Seven. Ao's parents are missing, Ao's island home in is remarkably different from...the setting of Eureka Seven and most returning themes are subverted in one way or another sporting a considerably different vernacular as well. This is an especially hard pill to swallow for fans who already watched Pocket Full of Rainbows as AO immediately gives off the feeling of another blatant redacting of the Eureka Seven universe. In retrospect this seems like a creative choice to play with fans' expectations coming into the sequel although this might have been a little over done as I dropped this series the first time I watched it because of this.The next issue seems to be the result of over ambitious writing. The combination of everything that is going on in AO and the relatively large central cast results in a number of difficulties in telling each character's story while conveying a sense of overarching plot that viewers can comfortably follow. For some people this makes the character development seem rushed, unclear in execution or tacked on. Where as other reviewers were left wanting more character driven story and were disappointed with the overarching plot which was truly hard to follow with all the back stories popping up along the way. I found myself in the middle wanting a clearer plot and more time with each character (except Truth.) Aside from this, transitions between episodes often felt jarring and confusing since the series rarely fell into a familiar swing while trying to find a place for everything.A lot of reviewers have said this and I feel it deserves restating: This series is not Eureka Seven. This is fairly obvious to those who've watched or are considering watching this series, but this phrase holds a considerable amount of weight to it. Lets consider some of the things that Eureka Seven has/had to its advantage over AO.  Eureka Seven had the benefit of open expectations, a new word to discover and fifty episodes. This makes Eureka Seven a reasonably hard series to follow up in twenty-four episodes without disappointing a lot of people. It is arguable that issues with the story and presentation of the series could stem from trying to fit more into this series than could be done in twenty-four episodes, but I feel that is more a matter of opinion than fact so I've kept this as a separate shortcoming in the series.My opinion of this series is that there is a lot to love and hate. For me personally there was more to love in this sequel. For a lot of reviewers there was more to hate and I find that completely understandable since there is a lot to look past to start seeing what this series did well. With that said I don't think everyone that enjoyed Eureka Seven will enjoy this sequel, but I think fans who approach this series with an open expectations and are willing to look for what they like in this series will find a lot of pleasant surprises.I really liked the whole set up for this anime. In a cohesive, although not very well presented, plot the creators of this show managed to bring the audience into a setting that is both similar and different than the setting of Eureka Seven. This allows the audience to become reacquainted with the familiar while discovering what is new and different about the setting of AO through Ao's adventure in a way that was, for me, very nostalgic.There is a large and diverse cast of characters in this series and most of them are pretty likable. Although the majority of the character development felt forced and out of place in this series I still really liked the characters and I have to credit this to the fact that every primary character has some form of back story or side story.The setting of AO is much more politically diverse than Eureka Seven. I felt this really made AO stand out as a sequel and, although it added to the side story clutter and general messiness of AO's presentation, I still enjoyed the political aspects of the story.Even by the end of Eureka Seven there where many questions left unanswered and aspects of mythos left unexplored. AO continues this tradition by answering some questions viewers might have never known to ask about the Eureka Seven universe while revisiting some old questions and introducing new ones along the way. Though fairly simple, I feel this is one of AO's more notable successes as a sequel. For me this is what most of my opinion of this series as sequel hinged on. More than the characters or the story, the world of Eureka Seven is what originally drew me into this franchise and I am glad to see that aspect of Eureka Seven done justice.Closing Note:I read the guidelines and it was suggested to avoid something like this (but not expressly prohibited.) So, I held it off until the end to respectful of everyone's time. This is my first review and although I read the guidelines and kept them in consideration while writing this review I am sure people will notice things that I overlooked.

While the parent series, Psalms of Planets, focused on character interaction and psychology (among many other topics) with plot taking the backseat for more than half of it\'s run, Astral Ocean, which is less than half the amount of the original, has a stronger focus on politics. This makes for fundamentally different plot and character development, and while much of...it is often seen in a  negative light, some of it makes for very good viewing. Before I get into the pros and cons, here is a quick summary.Story:The series follows a boy, Fukai Ao, on his personal journey to find his missing mother. In order to find out more about her, he joins a for-hire organization, Generation Bleu, which fights mysterious creatures called ""Secrets"", which are destroying the world\'s precious Scub Coral, a valuable resource for an energy termed ""trapar"" (the same from the original series, but in much lower concentrations). The plot deals with various conflicts that surround Ao\'s life, namely; his (not quite) mysterious parentage and origins, the danger that the Secrets and Scub Coral pose to the world, generational politics in which adults are untrustworthy, and an even more mysterious and dangerous entity named  Truth.Cons:-Ultimately, the greatest flaw that AO suffers from is time constraints. Unlike the original Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean has a 24 episode run, which means that plot and character development take a dive compared to the scope of the first series.-As a result of the time constraints, characters in Astral Ocean do not shine as brightly as memorable characters in PoPE7 such as Eureka, Anemone, or Holland. The majority of the characters seem to have little screen time or true importance (such as Gazelle and the smugglers) or are downright boring or generic (some of Team Goldilocks and Truth). However, there are still brilliant moments of characterization interspersed within these examples. Ao and his fellow pilot Elena are good indicators of this, as both are actually very complex characters with interesting reactions.-Astral Ocean was not meant to be seen weekly. A lot of subtle and important contexts get lost in the week to week wait for the next episode. The episodes thus feel slightly disjointed compared to how they feel in succession.-The plot devices are not as creative as they could have been; the first half of the series is run in a monster of the week fashion, which then gives way to a plot which borrows heavily from classical sci-fi devices.-Truth is a very annoying, and know-it-all, villain that embraces all the stereotypes for generic anime villains I can think off, including being flamboyant. Not as interesting or complex as Dewey.-Occasionally there are visible dips in animation quality, in which, for example, Ao\'s usually feminine features suddenly change to resemble a burly Elric from FMA Brotherhood.Pros:Now, clearly AO is a flawed series, but there are far more pros involved that make Astral Ocean a very interesting series to follow.-The major problems that people have with the series always begins with the sentence, ""It\'s not as good as the original"". I agree with this statement, to an extent. Yes, Astral Ocean is not a fifty episode epic chronicling the amazing romance of a boy learning to grow up and a girl learning to change herself, it\'s not particularly good at making you love its characters, and it\'s not full of the atmosphere that makes one so nostalgic for PoP.HOWEVER.Astral Ocean is very good at what it does aim to do, and what it aims to do is so different to that of the original that while it\'s easy to compare them, we shouldn\'t. We don\'t have a romance of the ages, we don\'t have a true makeshift family, and we don\'t have the themes of acceptance and change that made the original so poignant. Instead, Astral Ocean speaks to generational conflict and the ties between families. While the original did actually incorporate both themes, AO puts them on stage and presents them through an absolutely brilliant main character. The politics are very complex and have real world analogies, and they alienate the younger characters from the scheming and untrustworthy adult world. The family dynamics are interesting to watch and shape many of the characters in ways that are very natural and also very thought-provoking in retrospect. The pilot Fleur Blanc and her relationship to her father, as well as Ao\'s own family, are such examples.-The production values are wonderful. The color palette is beautiful, the music, by composer Nakamura Koji of Supercar fame, is perfect for the atmosphere. The art is usually top-notch, and the battles, though short, are a treat to watch.-Ao is one of the most spectacular main characters in recent anime history. To some, he comes off as whiny because of his attachment to his mother, and to others he comes off as boring because he\'s a no-nonsense type and does what he must when he\'s asked to. Ao is neither. He is a complex and amazingly developed character. His attachment to his mother, which is a very interesting parallel between himself and Renton Thurston\'s obsession with his older sister in the original, stems from her unexplained disappearance as well as the fact that she is the only blood relative he has ever known. He also identifies with her as an outcast, as both he and his mother were shunned from the island in which he was born. The resulting feelings and resolve are very realistic, and poor Ao has some of the most pitiable circumstances regarding his family outside of being downright abandoned. When Ao is not dealing with his mother complex, he is a very serious character, which might be the reason why he doesn\'t quite resonate with viewers. However, after a many truly whiny and annoying or useless main character in mecha, Ao is a breath of fresh air. He fights when he is told to, he does what must be done even if it means defying orders, he does not break down and run away from his problems. He might doubt himself or his orders, but sooner or later he tells himself he can and will do what is asked of him. The boy has what most mecha characters lack; a backbone and a no-nonsense resolve. This trait brings Ao into some truly interesting moral divides, and tests both his sense of what\'s right as well as that resolve.-There are a great many superb references, both to the original series as well as to other franchises, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Elena, the resident otaku character, is usually the one to bring these up, although Ao himself is a great reference to some of the most memorable E7 scenes and characters.-While Truth isn\'t the greatest villain in the world, there is no denying that the plot is interesting to follow. There is no clear good side or evil side; even though I state that Truth is a villain, he is more of the antagonist instead, rather how Anemone and Dominic worked against Eureka and Renton but were not actually bad themselves. In fact, AO runs a bit like a free-for-all battle in which various sides have various agendas and everyone believes themselves justified. As a real world allegory, this is particularly intriguing.-While the big picture feel of AO may not seem that great, it\'s important to understand the series as a whole rather than as separate episodes as well as to appreciate small moments of characterization, symbolism, conversation, and interaction in order to get the true scope of and appreciate what is happening and why.Summary:Astral Ocean is a great series to follow, and while it is hindered by time constraints as well as the fact that it\'s related to an epic makes it feel underwhelmed, the fact remains that one should not judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree. On its own, AO is at the very least decent and at its best superb for what it\'s trying to do. It is still fun, engaging, and well worth watching, and while you won\'t get as attached to its characters as you did with the parent series, at the very least Ao himself is someone worth rooting for. it is often seen in a  negative light, some of it makes for very good viewing. Before I get into the pros and cons, here is a quick summary.Story:The series follows a boy, Fukai Ao, on his personal journey to find his missing mother. In order to find out more about her, he joins a for-hire organization, Generation Bleu, which fights mysterious creatures called ""Secrets"", which are destroying the world\'s precious Scub Coral, a valuable resource for an energy termed ""trapar"" (the same from the original series, but in much lower concentrations). The plot deals with various conflicts that surround Ao\'s life, namely; his (not quite) mysterious parentage and origins, the danger that the Secrets and Scub Coral pose to the world, generational politics in which adults are untrustworthy, and an even more mysterious and dangerous entity named  Truth.Cons:-Ultimately, the greatest flaw that AO suffers from is time constraints. Unlike the original Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean has a 24 episode run, which means that plot and character development take a dive compared to the scope of the first series.-As a result of the time constraints, characters in Astral Ocean do not shine as brightly as memorable characters in PoPE7 such as Eureka, Anemone, or Holland. The majority of the characters seem to have little screen time or true importance (such as Gazelle and the smugglers) or are downright boring or generic (some of Team Goldilocks and Truth). However, there are still brilliant moments of characterization interspersed within these examples. Ao and his fellow pilot Elena are good indicators of this, as both are actually very complex characters with interesting reactions.-Astral Ocean was not meant to be seen weekly. A lot of subtle and important contexts get lost in the week to week wait for the next episode. The episodes thus feel slightly disjointed compared to how they feel in succession.-The plot devices are not as creative as they could have been; the first half of the series is run in a monster of the week fashion, which then gives way to a plot which borrows heavily from classical sci-fi devices.-Truth is a very annoying, and know-it-all, villain that embraces all the stereotypes for generic anime villains I can think off, including being flamboyant. Not as interesting or complex as Dewey.-Occasionally there are visible dips in animation quality, in which, for example, Ao\'s usually feminine features suddenly change to resemble a burly Elric from FMA Brotherhood.Pros:Now, clearly AO is a flawed series, but there are far more pros involved that make Astral Ocean a very interesting series to follow.-The major problems that people have with the series always begins with the sentence, ""It\'s not as good as the original"". I agree with this statement, to an extent. Yes, Astral Ocean is not a fifty episode epic chronicling the amazing romance of a boy learning to grow up and a girl learning to change herself, it\'s not particularly good at making you love its characters, and it\'s not full of the atmosphere that makes one so nostalgic for PoP.HOWEVER.Astral Ocean is very good at what it does aim to do, and what it aims to do is so different to that of the original that while it\'s easy to compare them, we shouldn\'t. We don\'t have a romance of the ages, we don\'t have a true makeshift family, and we don\'t have the themes of acceptance and change that made the original so poignant. Instead, Astral Ocean speaks to generational conflict and the ties between families. While the original did actually incorporate both themes, AO puts them on stage and presents them through an absolutely brilliant main character. The politics are very complex and have real world analogies, and they alienate the younger characters from the scheming and untrustworthy adult world. The family dynamics are interesting to watch and shape many of the characters in ways that are very natural and also very thought-provoking in retrospect. The pilot Fleur Blanc and her relationship to her father, as well as Ao\'s own family, are such examples.-The production values are wonderful. The color palette is beautiful, the music, by composer Nakamura Koji of Supercar fame, is perfect for the atmosphere. The art is usually top-notch, and the battles, though short, are a treat to watch.-Ao is one of the most spectacular main characters in recent anime history. To some, he comes off as whiny because of his attachment to his mother, and to others he comes off as boring because he\'s a no-nonsense type and does what he must when he\'s asked to. Ao is neither. He is a complex and amazingly developed character. His attachment to his mother, which is a very interesting parallel between himself and Renton Thurston\'s obsession with his older sister in the original, stems from her unexplained disappearance as well as the fact that she is the only blood relative he has ever known. He also identifies with her as an outcast, as both he and his mother were shunned from the island in which he was born. The resulting feelings and resolve are very realistic, and poor Ao has some of the most pitiable circumstances regarding his family outside of being downright abandoned. When Ao is not dealing with his mother complex, he is a very serious character, which might be the reason why he doesn\'t quite resonate with viewers. However, after a many truly whiny and annoying or useless main character in mecha, Ao is a breath of fresh air. He fights when he is told to, he does what must be done even if it means defying orders, he does not break down and run away from his problems. He might doubt himself or his orders, but sooner or later he tells himself he can and will do what is asked of him. The boy has what most mecha characters lack; a backbone and a no-nonsense resolve. This trait brings Ao into some truly interesting moral divides, and tests both his sense of what\'s right as well as that resolve.-There are a great many superb references, both to the original series as well as to other franchises, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Elena, the resident otaku character, is usually the one to bring these up, although Ao himself is a great reference to some of the most memorable E7 scenes and characters.-While Truth isn\'t the greatest villain in the world, there is no denying that the plot is interesting to follow. There is no clear good side or evil side; even though I state that Truth is a villain, he is more of the antagonist instead, rather how Anemone and Dominic worked against Eureka and Renton but were not actually bad themselves. In fact, AO runs a bit like a free-for-all battle in which various sides have various agendas and everyone believes themselves justified. As a real world allegory, this is particularly intriguing.-While the big picture feel of AO may not seem that great, it\'s important to understand the series as a whole rather than as separate episodes as well as to appreciate small moments of characterization, symbolism, conversation, and interaction in order to get the true scope of and appreciate what is happening and why.Summary:Astral Ocean is a great series to follow, and while it is hindered by time constraints as well as the fact that it\'s related to an epic makes it feel underwhelmed, the fact remains that one should not judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree. On its own, AO is at the very least decent and at its best superb for what it\'s trying to do. It is still fun, engaging, and well worth watching, and while you won\'t get as attached to its characters as you did with the parent series, at the very least Ao himself is someone worth rooting for.', ""This series cannot be reviewed as a sequel. It's best to look at it as an optional side story. That being said, it has both positive and negative aspects.For those that love the original and have yet to give this a look, I do advise perhaps taking a pass on this one. It has very little continuity with the original, and it doesn't expand on the overall story. One word to sum it up is this is clearly DIFFERENT (than the original).Eureka 7: AO has a lot of mystery throughout. The biggest problem is the overall delivery of the story. The flow of the story...is very choppy, almost like it was butchered in post production. Some scenes simply don't transition properly from one moment to the next. It is flawed in it's emotional delivery, and lacks heavily in character development. It's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to most of the characters as the story goes on. It does have great artwork and good music, but this isn't enough at most times. This is one series that could easily be redone with an hour and a half long movie that would probably work better overall.I do warn that my next comments are a bit of spoilers.SPOILER: this story works well with the time travel/alternate universe theme, and I do not feel it lacks in it's explanations of the universe. There are a lot of new things like their G-Monsters (or secrets) that have the cool factor. is very choppy, almost like it was butchered in post production.

So how do I feel about E7:AO?I\'ve been a fan of Eureka Seven since I first watched it subbed by Nanashi. It\'s also been a really long long time since Bones made that. Forgetting E7, let\'s look at AO for what it actually is.Eureka Seven: AO is less like a drama and barely a romance anime at all. Its entire point lies in family ties and coming of age - which it does... Well. Not great. Well. I did enjoy it\'s constant change of perspective though, although that\'s really not a plus...- just me being absolutely insane.The story encompasses a boy growing up without knowing much of his parents, like the original. Also is picked up by a militant like group designed to fight Coralians, reasonably similar to the original as well. In fact, the first 13 episodes, while lacking on any forms of true development and romance or coherency, are in fact fairly enjoyable. This however becomes a roller-coaster, as a cycle of enjoyment, boredom, followed by bitterness, rinse repeat.See, Ao didn\'t have the same kind of run its predecessor had to tell its story. In fact, it had less than half the episodes. Bones made the decision to come up with a thousand events for this series that could\'ve been awesome but just weren\'t. In fact, the show pitches around from one thing, to another thing unrelated, then pitches back, then decides it wants to play soccer.https://www.dropbox.com/s/n74d7keexalbvpj/ao.pngI\'m not kidding.The problem really is that Ao could\'ve had a fine story until it gutted any character development, decided to forget plot-lines, decided it wanted to implement a completely confusing time-travel plot, and decided to drop more than 2 -second gag humor. If one took each episode of Ao, added some fun and maybe some actual character development to the story, and really tried fricking hard to reason out the time-traveling thing (I\'ve done it and frankly, the amount of deus ex machina made it basically a moot point), the show would\'ve been that much better.http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011063920/eurekaseven/images/7/7c/Quartz-gun.jpgIt\'s not just phallic, it changes bloody history! Also it will erase you. *click*The story get\'s a 7 though, despite every actual flaw in it\'s telling, it\'s not terrible, (lose Naru though, she went from somewhat interesting to the most annoying and pointless prophet the world will ever know) and the first and last two episodes actually do a good job of sending nostalgia waves through the viewer. It also attempts to explain every thread it abandoned on the way, which is nice, but frankly, it suffers the whole ""24 mins only"" run-time problem, and we all have to just scratch our heads, pause the video, open Descarte, and then proceed to say, ""Ohhhhhh..."" as realization comes flooding in about what was actually just said. Or be me and rewatch the entire series just to remember what they were referencing.http://ghostlightning.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/eureka-seven-ao-noah-reading-pied-piper.jpgWe like to believe he gets it. Probably does, a lot better than we did in one viewing at least.As for the art, the eyes don\'t lie, the art was spectacular, the animations fluid, the mechs were beautiful... I scored it a 7 though because frankly, we don\'t misspell white house as \'white hous\' and spell it correctly in the same exact frame of the same episode simultaneously. (episode 18... What the hell man?) Seriously, this is the same studio that did Darker Than Black (which had EXTENSIVE screens and screens of English piled onto a computer monitor, with no misspellings, a sequel with tons of Russian, which I believe is okay, and a ton of Chinese. I think we can hold them to a higher standard.)Sound.... Was good. Nothing truly new, but the sound library did feel decent, atmosphere matched well, music pieces weren\'t god-awful, and come on, we love it when the Nirvash does it\'s whole launch sequence, doesn\'t matter how  bad the show was.Characters are the worst of everything. I can honestly say I hated Naru for being a philosophical female dog, despised how the back stories of Elena and Fleur were glanced at and then never brought up again for the rest of the show (okay, like once or twice - but it was so pointless I really didn\'t care), Ivica was borderline frightening, and Gazelle was... Gazelle? Okay, point is - I don\'t even know if this show had legitimate villains. Everything just kept going a this breakneck speed that I had no idea who was who and fighting who and oh god this is a mess. Look, Ao has the personality of bread. Whiny, blue bread. With purple dots. I did not give a single damn about Ao (the character) after episode 10, and this continued until the very last episode where he finally develops a personality that isn\'t the equivalent to: Butthurt Mom Left Me.And honestly, that personality change in the last 10 mins of the last episode ALMOST makes me forgive him. But only almost. Seriously, did Naru, Fleur, Elena or any one else even have a point after the Quartz Gun became a thing? Cos frankly, we already went over that that thing takes retroactive continuity and beats you over the head with it and makes you say it\'s your daddy.Oh and don\'t get me started on Truth, that guy wasn\'t a villain at all.

I have to say - I would\'ve hated this anime - it would\'ve gotten a 4 or 5 if it wasn\'t for episode 24. It\'s certainly watchable, and isn\'t actually that unforgivable, but because it\'s so dependent on its predecessor without even being good at emulating it, and because it has so few merits of its own it can barely hold onto, the majority of the series left an anguished taste in my mouth... Like eating babies... On fire. I feel like if it had been easier on the terminology, and took more time to explain itself, and CUT ALL THE CRAP THAT ENDED UP NOT MATTERING TO EMBELLISH ON ITS MERITS, it could have been amazing, but it\'s not. It\'s passable. And even then, it\'s predecessor makes it look like a joke.Watching for what it is - you should watch it if you\'re a fan of the original, but don\'t expect much, and really don\'t buy it. It makes a sub-par show, and while it\'s better than a ton of garbage people will swear their mother\'s graves upon, it\'s just not living up to its name.7/10 - watch on TV.http://myanimelist.net/profile/eureka822/reviews for the record - this guy actually shares many of my opinions but still scored this show higher than I feel it deserves.

Still a valid read.', 'Eureka Seven is the first Bones original work I\'ve seen, and quite simply it was one of the best 50-episode anime I\'ve seen to date (Last Exile comes close). From its brilliant planning and execution, to excellent visuals and soundtrack, to solid plot and characters, it was a quintessential ""boy meets girl"" sci-fi/giant robot show.So naturally I was excited when AO was announced, and I started watching. The first few episodes weren\'t too bad, but as the show progressed the characters didn\'t seem to mesh with the story. Without spoiling the story, here\'s an example: Ao sees something about Naru that shocked him at the...end of one episode, and the next episode he\'s off fighting Secrets as though that shocking revelation never happened-- there wasn\'t a single moment of hesitation or doubt, and up to that point Ao was depicted as every bit the impulsive teenager Renton was. You\'d think he\'d defy orders to go find Naru instead of dutifully blowing up Secrets! Whether a result of poor planning or poor writing, such a disconnect is simply unacceptable in a series that depends on a cohesive narrative, much less a drama with complex political intrigue. I remarked at that point, ""If the production crew wants to kill off Naru, this is a really good way of going about it.""Additionally, it seemed as though the staff felt that hiding the connections to the first series behind hints until the last possible moment would be a great way to either entice viewers to keep watching, or pleasantly surprise them. But as it turns out, the plot is heavily dependent on Eureka Seven, and the latter half of the show is comprised partly of a mad dash to reveal all of the connections. Putting the direct connections to the first series at the beginning would\'ve been predictable and only half as dramatic, but at least the rest of the series wouldn\'t be a confusing mess I would need to re-watch.Another issue lies in the setting. Time travel is a tempting plot device for many a sci-fi writer, and as the Star Trek franchise demonstrated many times, it is not a device to be taken lightly, because it is so easy for the story to get out of control. Sadly, AO falls into the same snare, and evidently the writer\'s solution to a story inconsistency or plot hole is to blast it out of knowledge with a big ray gun. I\'ve seen my share of deus ex machina, but this was in-your-face enough for me to stop watching the series. Would things have been different had Dai Sato been in charge of the series\' story? Possibly, but unfortunately that\'s not how it worked out.Yet another problem is with characterization. I never got a chance to really get into Ao\'s head the way I was able to with Renton-- those internal monologues were there for a very good reason, after all. Likewise, I was never given much of a chance to really grasp the motivations of pretty much the entire cast of characters-- or, whatever attempt to do so was lost on me and other viewers. Whether because AO\'s staff decided to focus more on visual action or to subordinate character development to the plot, the end result is a marionette show, superficially entertaining but lacking in substance. As a result, whatever conflicts that are portrayed are largely pointless or lost.It\'s not all bad, of course. The action scenes are some of Bones\' finest visual work, the performance of the cast was engaging and dynamic despite the writing, and the soundtrack didn\'t get in the way of the experience. But if the goal was to tell another story in the Eureka Seven universe worthy of the predecessor, this series was a disappointment to me. end of one episode, and the next episode he\'s off fighting Secrets as though that shocking revelation never happened-- there wasn\'t a single moment of hesitation or doubt, and up to that point Ao was depicted as every bit the impulsive teenager Renton was.

However, I completely disagree with this notion. Eureka seveN AO could have gone in two very plausible directions.I. A sequel based on the artwork from DVD Vol. 12:http://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Seven-Vol-Episodes-47-50/dp/B00114UUKY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439064718&sr=8-1&keywords=eureka+seven+dvd+12...In this picture, there are essentially two worlds: the above-ground and below-ground, as I've taken to calling them. The plethora of questions posed by this image (since the image is canon to the end of Eureka seveN) could easily make for a new series:1. Is there political turmoil between above-grounders and below-grounders?2. If this takes place far in the future, are Coralian-Human hybrid descendants common and do they face discrimination like the Vodarac?3. How different are the cultures of lifters (above-grounders) and surfers (below-grounders), since below ground there is no trapar?The Eureka seveN universe is so detailed, there should have been no problem creating a chronological sequel to it.II. A *prequel* based on the events detailed in episode 47 of Eureka seveN. 10,000 years before Eureka seveN, humans were attacking the Scub Coral. We used jets to try bombing it, and I wouldn't doubt it if we used nukes.In this context, the Scub Coral as the true enemy would have made perfect sense, especially when fighting these creepy things: http://eurekaseven.wikia.com/wiki/Antibody_Coralians Get rid of the Secrets and Quartz, and we would have had an amazingly anime that built on the canon. There are more than enough questions to sustain a prequel, such as:1. What, in graphic detail, happened to humans as they fought the Scub?2. How did the humans build the ships that took them off the planet, and how did they survive out in space for 10,000 years?3. How many humans were left behind to be killed/absorbed by the Scub?Sadly, I've reached my Limit of Questions for this section, but as you can see, there was obviously a lot of missed potential with this series.What It Actually Was----------------------------------------------------------------------The plot was incredible sporadic. Never is there any consistency in the characters who make random choices that are not explained, or that really even matter. I can't really elaborate without *many* spoilers.Art--------------------------------------------------Art was nothing impressive. It just took from the same Eureka seveN art style, tried to change things up in a special way, and failed.Sound--------------------------------------------------If you look up Eureka seveN AO OST on Amazon, you get the OST for Eureka Seven, 'nuff said:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=eureka+seven+ao+ostThe music was so terrible in this anime; not in that the music was bad, but because it didn't evoke the raw emotions that music in Eureka seveN did. The only good music was the bit of Niji that they put in.Character--------------------------------------------------Do I have to?No really, do I have to go over this?There was absolutely no depth to the characters whatsoever, and no character development either. When does a character actually change in the inside, as opposed to the outside? Sure, some characters get different outfits, but the same underlying characters don't change. And then you have a character that has a different outfit, and did not used to be the same character, but it is very poorly explained. You have explained but unexplained romances in the series. There are times when it pretends to be a harem... and then ignores any relationships between the characters.Enjoyment--------------------------------------------------Did I enjoy one of my favorite animes of all time being butchered a SECOND time after it was previously butchered by a terrible movie? No.Overall--------------------------------------------------Save yourself the 9 or so hours spent watching this series, and re-watch the original Eureka seveN. There is no reason to watch this travesty of an anime. In this picture, there are essentially two worlds: the above-ground and below-ground, as I've taken to calling them. The plethora of questions posed by this image (since the image is canon to the end of Eureka seveN) could easily make for a new series:1. Is there political turmoil between above-grounders and below-grounders?2. If this takes place far in the future, are Coralian-Human hybrid descendants common and do they face discrimination like the Vodarac?3. How different are the cultures of lifters (above-grounders) and surfers (below-grounders), since below ground there is no trapar?The Eureka seveN universe is so detailed, there should have been no problem creating a chronological sequel to it.II. A *prequel* based on the events detailed in episode 47 of Eureka seveN. 10,000 years before Eureka seveN, humans were attacking the Scub Coral. We used jets to try bombing it, and I wouldn't doubt it if we used nukes.In this context, the Scub Coral as the true enemy would have made perfect sense, especially when fighting these creepy things: http://eurekaseven.wikia.com/wiki/Antibody_Coralians Get rid of the Secrets and Quartz, and we would have had an amazingly anime that built on the canon. There are more than enough questions to sustain a prequel, such as:1. What, in graphic detail, happened to humans as they fought the Scub?2. How did the humans build the ships that took them off the planet, and how did they survive out in space for 10,000 years?3. How many humans were left behind to be killed/absorbed by the Scub?Sadly, I've reached my Limit of Questions for this section, but as you can see, there was obviously a lot of missed potential with this series.What It Actually Was----------------------------------------------------------------------The plot was incredible sporadic. Never is there any consistency in the characters who make random choices that are not explained, or that really even matter. I can't really elaborate without *many* spoilers.Art--------------------------------------------------Art was nothing impressive. It just took from the same Eureka seveN art style, tried to change things up in a special way, and failed.Sound--------------------------------------------------If you look up Eureka seveN AO OST on Amazon, you get the OST for Eureka Seven, 'nuff said:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=eureka+seven+ao+ostThe music was so terrible in this anime; not in that the music was bad, but because it didn't evoke the raw emotions that music in Eureka seveN did. The only good music was the bit of Niji that they put in.Character--------------------------------------------------Do I have to?No really, do I have to go over this?There was absolutely no depth to the characters whatsoever, and no character development either. When does a character actually change in the inside, as opposed to the outside? Sure, some characters get different outfits, but the same underlying characters don't change. And then you have a character that has a different outfit, and did not used to be the same character, but it is very poorly explained. You have explained but unexplained romances in the series. There are times when it pretends to be a harem... and then ignores any relationships between the characters.Enjoyment--------------------------------------------------Did I enjoy one of my favorite animes of all time being butchered a SECOND time after it was previously butchered by a terrible movie? No.Overall--------------------------------------------------Save yourself the 9 or so hours spent watching this series, and re-watch the original Eureka seveN. There is no reason to watch this travesty of an anime."", 'Thus far AO has held up to my expectations for standard set by its predecessor.As usual from Bones the animation quality is top notch, with a little CGI slapped on the side in the usual places in the cockpits. The series starts off slow in the first episode but quickly picks up to a fast paced and well choreographed action scenes that have thus far managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.

You just wonder after so long, what happened.Let\'s start with a brief summary of the predecessor, my verdict: ""Jizztastic"" i was like 8 when i watched it. On YTV canada, Gundam Seed (wait 4 E7) then Eureka Seven. It just simply made my week. Why was it so good, I can summarize it with just one word: CREATIVITY. The scenario, the plot, the design, culture, feel, the environment, it was just so ""different"" but interesting and exciting. It made me want to be apart of that awesome...place. There is also CHARACTER i can name almost every single eureka seven character (even supporting or only shown in 1 episode). MUSIC = still makes me listen to TRANCE (form of techno used in eureka seven) over HOUSE any day. Even if you scraped out the romance part of it, it would still be a great show. The romance made it better :D.Now, for eureka seven ao. First of all the only reason people are still watching the show untill ep 21 is because they want to see the rebirth of the OG characters THATS ALL. But Why? Well, first of all or at least a big chunk of the characters are full of shit (excuse my language). They are as creative as grey mush, there is no sympathy for them, expect for Christopher Blanc (RESPECT). Secondly, ENVIRONMENT, earth, japan, USA, 3rd party company... SNORE, ZZZ, c\'mon bones no one wants a story based on boring old earth, we live in it for christ sake. What happened to that mixture of ""urban, futuristic yet very natural"" feel :\'( . Theres useless drama between the characters which as i mentioned before are boring as **** so no one cares. Sound and Art is amazing no doubts about that BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE SAME STYLE AS E7.

But when it comes to Sound, Art, Story its great because they played it safe and STUCK TO THE PROGRAM. But without character development and a fresh new environment (like in OG E7) it just made the series suck. The ONLY reason i still watch this show is because it has EUREKA SEVEN plastered on it, and I really want to see eureka, renton, nirvash, etc.., etc.. Besides that everyone else (New E7 AO characters) can burn in a molting pool of lava, I would laugh more than cry. The only thing that can really put its series on the right direction is a really damn good ending (with all OG characters) or a season 2 where they can fix their shit, and put themselves toeghter.

After watching it i was deeply sad that it all ended, but after a while i found out about Eureka seven AO and oh boii.Eureka seven AO is really good and i like it, but i don't really understand why people hating it so much. After completing AO i'am sitting all sad and sorrow and i still want more... Well it is what it is and some may find it good or bad.Overall AO was really good no matter what other people may say.9/10 "", 'Eureka 7 AO has a rather low average rating and ranking here on MAL. I think this is pretty sad, because AO really is a quite good series.This review is an ontake to explaining why I think it is, despite understandably falling flat for so many prequel fans as it does.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.Specific spoilers start from in the second half of the characters section onwards. I generally mostly focused on some punctual highlightings of aspects/scenes.In a nutshell I\'d say, whether this show is enjoyable or not depends, to a very vast degree on just how much of what you liked the original...Eureka 7 prequel and the expectations come out based on that.This is where this show\'s major misfortune lies in: This season is a direct sequel. And it is made as such. Even though half the show doesn\'t look outright like it, it is and any entry about the anime will mark it as such. It also expects you to have watched the prequel, because it doesn\'t waste time on reiterating what happened there. But AO\'s tone, themes and purpose are only about as similiar as Eureka 7 and Bone\'s other show Rahxephon are.Eureka 7 is the story of Renton, a 14 year naive childish idealist, a somewhat rebellious brat in puberty admiring the cool and seeking adventures. Somebody who knows nothing of the world, but would like to be taken for a grown up man, would like to not stand in the shadow of the glory of his heroic father. He is all together rather devoid of proper worries and thus falls head over heels at first fight rather innocently. Through the course of the show he learns about the complexity of the world of not just the humans but beyond it. The story follows him on his way to maturity, triggered by his romance to Eureka - who starts at about the right opposite of his character. It\'s a love story, a pretty classical hero\'s journey and gets a Sci-Fi war setting poured over it while preaching the universal values of peace, mutual understanding and coexistance.Eureka 7 Ao is the story of Ao, a barely 13 year old boy, grown up as a scapegoat of political and superstitious discrimination, with no knowledge of his father, with a mother branded as evil and who vanished every since he was three years old. Ao has just about only two people dear to him, that care for him, two who have to suffer collateral damage due to him. He has any reason for scorn against this world that treats him badly out of no reason that he had a play with. He already knows and realizes a lot of what is going wrong in the world and the heaviness of not being able to do anything about it. Nonetheless he stands upright to the values taught to him by his old foster doctor grandfather, even if nobody would thank him and already makes responsible decisions right at the beginning and works his best to cope with the burdens that come with that. All the while a lot of it is quite heavy on him as he is still the child of 13 years old. Ao\'s story is that of a lonely boy trying to regain and protect the little that is dear to him by using what means he has and clinging to a vague hope of finding his mother again. It\'s about him finding a place where he truly can be at home despite his complicated mixed heritage. And, even if there are some slight romantic inklings - This is not a love story. It\'s also not a hero\'s journey.Does that sound any much similiar to you?If you start AO expecting a second E7, AO is pretty much doomed to fail. And unfortunately most will just do that, simply because it\'s the direct sequel show. The chances of somebody who didn\'t watch E7 to watch AO are probably very low. And the chances of someone did not like E7 starting AO is probably not much higher either. (How many would bother to sit through 50 episodes of it\'s prequel just for a sequel you mostly only hear about how most fans jolt it out into the trash bin?)Unless you are perhaps like me starting the season out of some questionable reason like really just wanting to know whether or not they cleaned up the horrible moon graffiti.Yes, you inferred that right. I disliked the original E7. It has good production values, a very good illustrious soundtrack and a really great and interesting complex setting, which however felt completely wasted onto the cast. I found most of the cast (and especially Renton) absolutely obnoxious. They grew to be a bit less so later on, but not quite enough to me. And seeing those I\'m not even cheering for being presented as the righteous ""winners"" who proved their ideals and love, felt rather unsatisfying.This is were the second major punch of this sequel towards original E7 lovers comes in: AO invalidates the pathos of E7.The crux of the show is basically, Renton and Eureka did what they did in E7 and it looked all happy, peaceful and optimistic. Happy ending, whatever comes, they\'d be just fine, right? But it turns out, they actually messed up. Despite all the best intentions, whatever they fought for turns out to be probably not really the best and to some degree an outright bad decision after all. And that is the cause of anything that happens in AO.Whoever thought that invalidating a happy ending was a good idea - it definitely is daring. Some will find it pointless to downright outrageous. But personally I find that almost pretty genius and lacking in precedence. Of course I enjoy that fact all the more because I loathed the TV ending of E7. Which appearantly wasn\'t even supposed to be as obnoxiously corny of a happy ending, given the Last Order or the Manga adaption\'s alternate ending.--- Setting ---E7 was a far in the future world, making it an own world of unique fantastical flair. AO is set in a near future world of ours, year 2025, only 13 years away from when the show aired. It doesn\'t have so much fantastical illustrious novel landscapes but is pretty down to earth. As such it dabbles a good deal in real life (money) politics.I think this is worth mentioning, since most people probably don\'t seem to pick onto this. It\'s really a lot more enjoyable, if you can pick up on some background on some of those conflicts. Given though it\'s mostly focused on politics with Japan in the mix, so references of political conflics of the US vs. some moslem state may feel superficial for Western audiences, while that\'s probably really just about as much as Japanese on their remote island would realistically care over happenings on the other side of the globe.Okinawa is an island group in Japan. Naru\'s garb\'s pattern is that of a native traditional clothing from there. Okinawa is part of Japan, but there is an independent movement going on for a while already and in that political issue Americans and Chinese play a hand. It\'s not pulled out and utterly explained to death, but it does give the location a very clear sign of territory. I haven\'t seen that particular setting in any other anime.The Okinawian setting is also where Ao\'s ""anma"" for calling his mother comes from. Since it reccurs it also serves as a further charactarization for Ao, who was born there, is also a child of the island and does once state, he loved the island, even if it never really offered a place for him to be there.I think the the whole island setting is quite beautifully written with all sorts of little subtle things. Other territories also show up, the world is pretty global which gives quite a nice variety of locations.What is a bit shorthanded through - as in most anime - is a complete lack of actually spoken dialects. The Okinawa folks speak normal Japanese as do all the obvious non-Japanese characters in the show. There is also a rather clear avoidance of any shown language barriers, but these also don\'t appear too abnormal either, since Ao or the other children don\'t really interact much outside of their social circle and those who do, are all adults with negotiation responsibilities who ought to have no such language barriers. I vastly prefer this workaround over massively hilariously failing Engrish (or doitsu/furansu) insertions.--- Visuals ---The show is animated well above average for a TV Show. Every episode does offer enough material to really draw out a lot of chances to make it shine. There is always some action of some sort happening in every episode, but there are also calmer moments in which subtle character interactions and gestures shine. Beautiful landscapes and various locations around the world give way for beautiful backgrounds. There are a number of mystery scenes which give way for colour plays and directing choices. There are even some dementia-ish episodes with a completely diffrent directing. While they may feel like monster of the week so some or very much disjointed (despite the contents relating to character themes), they were a visual feast to look at. There is also not all that much gory/bloody shock effect shown. Ao realizes the meaning of life and death even without a close up on some ripped off human arm rubbed into his face.The colours are also more vibrant than E7. It also seems to fuller use the whole spectrum of the palette much more than E7 TV did.--- Audio ---The soundtrack is beautiful. It\'s however definitely not a Sato Naoki score anymore. His E7 scores are mostly dramatically suspenseful or depicting some fantastical landscape with a sense of majestic epic grandness, which sure fit E7\'s Scub lanscapes and its pathos nicely. Koji Nakamura\'s score feels more grounded and subtle, a sense of subtle mystery, playfulness, ""reality with a tint of fantasy"" and complexity which fits this show really well. It\'s also still quite E7, given that the E7 score also features tracks that he had created. One old E7 track also makes a short comeback, when Renton enters the show again creating a nice contrast between old and new. All of the tracks have been really well used with their scenes, but even listening to them on their own they feel like telling a story.The voice acting does a very good job, too. All the children do sound some 5 years older than their actual age, but they are also in more responsible positions. Eureka does feel a bit off, since she sounds like she does in E7 and that felt to me a bit too young to downright juvenile, than the age she now should have. A bit of a chuckle comes from Renton now having the voice of Holland.--- English dub ---The voices have been pretty well choosen and their tone colours fit their japanese counterparts very nicely. Being able to understand Japanese, I can\'t say it sounded all that less natural or stiff than the Japanese version already did simply by being Anime. Some nuances get lost, like Ao\'s Okinawian Anma, which has been dubbed as simply mother. (But still appears just like that in the subs.) The dub script generally looks pretty good. There is just one thing that jumped at me. There is a scene in which some hold the enemy and urge Ao to shoot. He says he can\'t just shoot them all (""minna"") with the enemy, it gets translated to that he can\'t shoot his ""friends"". Which is just wrong, especially given that he never had any real interaction with those people that he would call them his friends. (He doesn\'t even call the ones in his team like that.)Aside that I had an impression that the music/sound track vs. dialogue track in the dub was louder than in the Japanese dub. Sometimes (especially with black Georgs computer voice coming in with some static noise) it felt like the dialogue was drowning in background sounds somewhat.--- Characters ---I think it\'s pretty important to note that AO has a far diffrent characterization approach than E7. E7\'s character handling was far more explicitly extroverted (to overdramatized) and took it on to force the other character (and the viewer) into feeling something. Which has a point, since communication on some equal footing was the goal of the Scubs and a rather robotic and alien Coralian Eureka had to learn about emotions on the journey to become humanlike. She didn\'t get it, unless it was extroverted and clear, so immature Renton knowing almost no behaviour restraint was the perfect fit for it. It was one of the core themes around which everything in E7 was built. AO doesn\'t have this as a main theme at all. AO\'s plot is driven by human relationship contellations and politics. If in E7 Holland is a jerk to Renton, angry you should get at him. Anemone is a tragic victim, so pity you should feel for her and disdain for her tormetors. AO doesn\'t force it up as much. Nobody is outright blatantly evil. No action is all that bad from all angles. They just mostly all putting themselved before others, even if they know it\'s probably not the best and right thing to do. But everybody does that and there is no real reason not to, so they continue to do that. That makes the show more serious and realistic befitting the more real-world-like setting. The show also makes this really clear from the beginning, when the sister of one of Gazelle\'s group tries to sell off Ao to the Americans for a lot of money and weakly justifies herself in an empty room.That is not to say though that communicating and expressing ones wishes and feelings isn\'t still there, but it\'s it\'s pretty subdued. Everbody puts up some front, but everybody also has reasons to not disclose them so easily or talk about them, even if they wanted, because it would just not be proper or disadvantageous to do so. That approach is also evident from the first episode, as Naru verbally robs Ao of any right to feel bad over his life. (If that style sounds a bit like an Neon Genesis Evangelion characterization style approach, it probably does. But Ao is quite opposite of this whiny pressimitic emo boy shying away from any sort of responsibility as Shinji, whom you\'d like to give some good slaps.)I think the contrast between the two characterization styles becomes most notable, when a certain former titular E7 protagonist enters the stage again halfway though the show and pretty much acts excatly like in E7. It\'s like she is absolutely overreacting and overdramatising and annoyingly lovey dovey, feelings showing way to clearly on her face over just anything. It wasn\'t out of place in E7. But imo it felt quite alien in AO. So if one liked that extroverted style and expect it from AO as well, everbody in Ao is doomed to feel bland. Because they don\'t make it as obvious or simply go out there and scream out everything on their mind all the time. The show\'s first arc even concludes with Ao scornful over his unlucky fate, but then realizing that getting angry or running away really changes nothing. His feelings are still there through rippling out on all sorts of occasions. - With that in mind, I found this characterization style great. It\'s a ""show it, don\'t say it"" style and if you take a closer look, you will get a good deal of subtle facial expressions, visual tone variations, colour plays, little lines and gestures, that betray some complicated emotions. Also some really great scenes as people  hestitantly disclose inklings of their true feelings as a token of trust. And yes there are also situations with ""they really should just properly talk their minds to each other"" that may gnaw on some peoples patience. But the show makes a good effort in displaying, why it is so and that the ""properly"" part is tricky. As in a lot of cases that people would not accept it, because they are weak, selfish or because things are so out there, they would only be downright unbelievable to their peers.For instance look at how Naru and Ao start. They are childhood friends. One pitiful boy growing up hated by everybody because he is diffrent, with no place on the island and one pitiful girl sick because of the Scubs and probably not going to live long. She defends him from the other islanders. He helps her out given her sickly condition. Who is off worse than the other? It\'s a fragile equilibrium of support between them, which gets disrupted as Ao leaves the island after having protected it. But he becomes special due to exactly what caused his pitiful circumstances. She gets left behind, because there is nothing left she can do for him anymore as others are more competent in helping him out of his circustances. Until she herself also becomes special due exactly what made her life miserable in the first place. And in constrast to Ao who does it out of a sense of responsibility she embraces it wholeheartedly right away. Also much to Aos chagrin, since the one who opened the doors to her happens to be his enemy. They both continue with a sense of paternalism towards each other. Ao at some point realizes, that none of them have changed their former outview towards each other much at all. But just knowing it doesn\'t necessarily change it. They even have a talk, but it ends up being an awkward talk solving nothing, because they never really truly talked to each other. Which is subsequently brilliantly shown as Naru angrily exclaims, she does not want to be just protected by Ao, but be his equal. - While doing the same as her accusation herself. Still both are convinced of doing the right thing. While it just turns out, they both aren\'t right either when a new perspective is added. Because there wasn\'t a really completely right thing in the first place.It also has to be said through, AO obviously only has 24 episodes. There is by far not as much screentime to develop supporting characters or ""1-2 exclusive episode characters"" as in E7. Characters like those from Team Harlequin, with which Ao barely interacts with, don\'t get backstory at all. But that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. E7 was character driven, AO is far less so and feels more tight and with less distraction than E7. The story follows Ao and everybody whom he deals with more closely and whom he gets to know better is explored. In reality you also don\'t know so much about your neighbour three blocks away, whom you from time to time happen to see on the street, do you? But that doesn\'t mean, they aren\'t able to appear as people and to possibly still affect your life some way or another even without you seeing excepts and summaries on their lifes.There is some great handling about a mentor side character. He gets quickly introduced and killed off about just as quickly. Neither the viewer nor Ao never really gets to see much of him alive except like two lines of dialogue. Ao ends up visiting his to be vacated room after his death. There is some unspoken great characterization to be had from his bookshelfs and wall notes about this character we never got to know, never will, but still get an idea of. And this total foreigner still brought a realization and emotional impact to Ao, giving way for an understanding for support characters that did have relashionships with him, as his loss affects them even more. We don\'t get to know whatever they have lived through together in their own special dedicated episodes. But that\'s just fine, too. We do get see how their unknown past shape their present actions and how those affect Ao.--- Plot ---Even if it is a spoiler, I think it really is good to know beforehand: This show has parallel universes, time travel and timeline resets. The latter two are pretty much the same way as the time machine and D-Mails in Steins;Gate if the reference helps out.What however is prone to make it a bit confusing at first sight: the parallel universes are not the parallel universes as in the known parallel universe time travel concept. There is some travel between universes. But that happens literally between a slightly similiar, but completely seperate universes. It looks like they are jumping from the E7 12000 something AD to its own past of year 2025 at first, but that\'s not the case. It\'s World E (the E7 universe) and there is World A (AO universe) and they happened to be somewhat similiar, but aren\'t the same and from World E it happens to be possible to jump to any time point of World A. (As explained as ""space and time are the same"" for the Scubs.) Any time travel and world reset stuff all happen within World A. World E isn\'t the setting at all and except for some cameo scenes and a dialogue line everything remains unknown. This parallel universe concept as it is does get explained verbally once in the last episode. Before that there are numerous little hints showing it, as are the time travel and resets hints, but at least I missed them when airing on air, since numerous weeks later I\'d all forgotten about the details, so the last third became a trainwreck to me. When it actually wasn\'t as I realized upon a rewatch.The show looks messy, but the pieces really do fall into place if you watch it attentively and then continuity issues disappear, too. Save for the 2 minute epilogue scene (which got remade to a full final episode years later) there is also no extra unnatural ""the characters already know that, but the viewer doesn\'t so let\'s explain it once more even though we all know it already!"" sort of exposition dialogue. This is great, but also means, nothing is served on a silver tablet.The major general hurt point about this show\'s plot is admittingly that the original E7 universe is something we learn almost nothing about in this series. And the little we do know is adressed in some 3 minute explanation exposition in the last episode and some mysterious flashbacks (which never get further explained, but do indicate something went really awry in their world, too.) Given that anybody coming from E7 was waiting to see more of E7, what became of the world and the old characters and not getting what they expected, it\'s understandable they felt betrayed. But do make no wrong assumptions: This show is about Ao. From the old cast Eureka is the only one who really gets to have screentime. Renton gets a last episode show up and that\'s it.It admittingly also doesn\'t help, that one of the narratives biggest initial driving mechanisms is a massive mystery box around ""What the heck is up with Eureka? How did she end up in this time/place? Why is she alone? Where is Renton?"" with all of the mysterious flashbacks of Ao of his lone mother and her being gone. It definitely is also intentional bait. And surely it did attract the most attention. But it never really gets focused on all that much. It gets resolved, but to the viewer the resolution feels short and unexplored as any of it is narrated, implied and not explicitly shown with a want for more been shown. Within the context of the show that actually feels very natural. Those two old characters are basically foreigners to the cast of AO whom the viewer is following. They would know nothing about them and any information will come from whatever those two outright tell them. And they don\'t say much. Eureka doesn\'t because she literally has no time to do so (and she has so see to some time line continuity) and Renton, because he doesn\'t even try. Because it\'s probably to painful to talk over his guilt and pain and as he wants to overwrite the world after all, so whatever talk there is would get erased in his agenda anyway. As a result, those two will mention stuff, that\'s evident to them and the E7 viewer (Nirvash, Mechas with souls, Archetype, Coralians, Limit of Questions...), without much of an explanation, but it only throws any of AO\'s characters into understandable puzzlement. To most viewers coming from E7 it probably feels like bad teasing.I also think there is also something about the basic point of the show, that many don\'t like. It\'s not about love, catharsis, not about getting a peaceful cooexistance and not fight, about having fun and getting happy as E7 had and which are universally successful themes. (And it doesn\'t seem to me like as if the creators didn\'t consider it, but intentionally chose not to.) In Ao it\'s mostly about guilt and resposibility. About decisions to be made in a complex net of interests and how they could turn out to be completely wrong. As I mentioned before: The whole show\'s happenings are set in gear by how Eureka and Renton in E7, despite the happy ending there, had actually screwed up. And so they try to fix it. Almost everybody has something in need to fixed up. Naru wants to fix up the world, as she got herself fixed up by accepting the Scubs. Fleur is guilty over her mother\'s death and own survival and in need of fixing up her relashionship with her father. Rebecka about her past deeds in media manipulation. Ivica over his deeds in the war and follow up resolve to never let children die again. The Okinawa folks for being so weak despite boasting their (actual fake) independence. Gazelle, who wants to do better than his father. The Japanese who want more political power as does about any other state. Elena who thinks she is in a wrong world and flees into Otaku escapism most of the time. Truth who also feels out of place of the world and clings towards the world as it was before the Scubs came, which at the same time would also end his own miserable existance. Ao, who tries to cope between, what he can do, should do, can justify before himself to (not) do and what he wants to do, all the while he is gradually more than just slightly overexerting himself. Everybody is in want and need for something. - And then pops up some omnipotent world resetting device that can fullfil wishes.But getting one thing fixed breaks another thing. Quite some responsibility and I do think the show makes a point in showing what this means. It also blends in really well with Ao\'s own character theme of finding a place where he belongs and his increasing doubts over if he really is somebody bringing only misfortune to others as everybody has ever blamed him for. He just got started getting along with Cloe, resetting the world has erased her team from his daily life. They are still alive and happy, but he is not amiss in their life, while left along with his memories of a now nonexistant timeline and nobody whom he can share that pain with. And moreover that omnipotent device sure makes situations go awry. Everybody would naturally want it and situations escalate quickly. And there is still his own wish of getting to be with his mother again. Should he use it? At what unknown cost? In the end he does, because the alternatives are even worse. And he does so by fixing up as many things up for the people whom he knew. He looses everything, but everyone whom he cares lives a nicer life. Without him. That surely isn\'t a cheesy happy ending as in E7.At that I really recommend the ""Final Episode"" ONA, it gives a really good roundabout that even if he decided to do it, it came with considerable pain and it also is much more positively rewarding as he gets to get a happy ending despite having lost so much.Aside that, there is quite some fun to be had through mostly Elena. There are a number of Otaku-culture references and self-referencing in line jokes from the creators themselves. Things like the scene in which they are in space and they stand on silicon with Elena saying ""Zero gravity is hard to animate after all."" In-series she makes one of her random eccentric remarks, outside of it it\'s a pretty witty meta-joke. There is even a scene in the last third, where some director of an in-series anime exclaimes that even of the show gets duped prematurely out of reasons that don\'t even have to do with its proper quality or due to a misinterpretation over what they were trying to tell with it, he is still all passionate about doing it. Given they bothered doing a full new final episode after 4 years to a show that gets dissed and rejected as much as this one, it does feel like a real statement. And there is Naru and Ao talking in ""private"" with an eavesdropping family including her sister exclaiming whenever the kiss is finally supposed to come, while that it\'s the last thing to expect.--- Overall ---I don\'t think the show was really messy, nor as if the creators had no clue what they wanted. It\'s also not really any worse paced than E7. (E7\'s last third also brushed over a lot of setting explanations rather quickly.) This shows one true major handicap is, that it\'s written so, that it expects you to have watched the original E7 and having been marketed mostly towards E7 fans, despite it trying and being really very much diffrent. This could have been avoided, by giving Eureka and Renton (or anybody else with knowledge) more chances of appearing and explaining in-series what had relevant things have happened in E7 leading up to their actions in AO and thus making the series accessable for complete newcomers and market it as its own independant story. As it is it doesn\'t really get through to the target audience, who would have enjoyed the show.There is an in-series argument between Renton and Ao at the end of the show. Renton argues that only one (Nirvash with an archetype), the original, is needed and negates Ao\'s. But Ao has come so far as having his own by then and so he has what it takes to stand on equal ground in a fight against Renton.Perhaps I just randomly see some meta implication here. But it fits hilariously well. A lot of those who dissed the show, had even made jokes over that dialoge piece back in the days, agreeing with Renton. When in the show he\'s comes off more like a narrow minded stubborn dork who doesn\'t want to listen, trying to escape his responsibility by erasing the mistake instead of dealing with it. But isn\'t that actually really sad? Dismissing that AO also has its own powerful merits just because he\'s an offspring that\'s diffrent than its predecessor?But perhaps the announced remake movie trilogy might fix it up. The trailer sure looks more sober, serious and mature than the original E7. Are they going to make the prequel more like the sequel? Will they really dare to make immature Renton be less obnoxious? Or does that end up being just some bait again? Probably something in the middle. But I\'m really crossing my fingers for a version with more likable E7 characters. And perhaps a moon cleanup. Eureka 7 prequel and the expectations come out based on that.This is where this show\'s major misfortune lies in: This season is a direct sequel. And it is made as such. Even though half the show doesn\'t look outright like it, it is and any entry about the anime will mark it as such. It also expects you to have watched the prequel, because it doesn\'t waste time on reiterating what happened there. But AO\'s tone, themes and purpose are only about as similiar as Eureka 7 and Bone\'s other show Rahxephon are.Eureka 7 is the story of Renton, a 14 year naive childish idealist, a somewhat rebellious brat in puberty admiring the cool and seeking adventures. Somebody who knows nothing of the world, but would like to be taken for a grown up man, would like to not stand in the shadow of the glory of his heroic father. He is all together rather devoid of proper worries and thus falls head over heels at first fight rather innocently. Through the course of the show he learns about the complexity of the world of not just the humans but beyond it. The story follows him on his way to maturity, triggered by his romance to Eureka - who starts at about the right opposite of his character. It\'s a love story, a pretty classical hero\'s journey and gets a Sci-Fi war setting poured over it while preaching the universal values of peace, mutual understanding and coexistance.Eureka 7 Ao is the story of Ao, a barely 13 year old boy, grown up as a scapegoat of political and superstitious discrimination, with no knowledge of his father, with a mother branded as evil and who vanished every since he was three years old. Ao has just about only two people dear to him, that care for him, two who have to suffer collateral damage due to him. He has any reason for scorn against this world that treats him badly out of no reason that he had a play with. He already knows and realizes a lot of what is going wrong in the world and the heaviness of not being able to do anything about it. Nonetheless he stands upright to the values taught to him by his old foster doctor grandfather, even if nobody would thank him and already makes responsible decisions right at the beginning and works his best to cope with the burdens that come with that. All the while a lot of it is quite heavy on him as he is still the child of 13 years old. Ao\'s story is that of a lonely boy trying to regain and protect the little that is dear to him by using what means he has and clinging to a vague hope of finding his mother again. It\'s about him finding a place where he truly can be at home despite his complicated mixed heritage. And, even if there are some slight romantic inklings - This is not a love story. It\'s also not a hero\'s journey.Does that sound any much similiar to you?If you start AO expecting a second E7, AO is pretty much doomed to fail. And unfortunately most will just do that, simply because it\'s the direct sequel show. The chances of somebody who didn\'t watch E7 to watch AO are probably very low. And the chances of someone did not like E7 starting AO is probably not much higher either. (How many would bother to sit through 50 episodes of it\'s prequel just for a sequel you mostly only hear about how most fans jolt it out into the trash bin?)Unless you are perhaps like me starting the season out of some questionable reason like really just wanting to know whether or not they cleaned up the horrible moon graffiti.Yes, you inferred that right. I disliked the original E7. It has good production values, a very good illustrious soundtrack and a really great and interesting complex setting, which however felt completely wasted onto the cast. I found most of the cast (and especially Renton) absolutely obnoxious. They grew to be a bit less so later on, but not quite enough to me. And seeing those I\'m not even cheering for being presented as the righteous ""winners"" who proved their ideals and love, felt rather unsatisfying.This is were the second major punch of this sequel towards original E7 lovers comes in: AO invalidates the pathos of E7.The crux of the show is basically, Renton and Eureka did what they did in E7 and it looked all happy, peaceful and optimistic. Happy ending, whatever comes, they\'d be just fine, right? But it turns out, they actually messed up. Despite all the best intentions, whatever they fought for turns out to be probably not really the best and to some degree an outright bad decision after all. And that is the cause of anything that happens in AO.Whoever thought that invalidating a happy ending was a good idea - it definitely is daring. Some will find it pointless to downright outrageous. But personally I find that almost pretty genius and lacking in precedence. Of course I enjoy that fact all the more because I loathed the TV ending of E7. Which appearantly wasn\'t even supposed to be as obnoxiously corny of a happy ending, given the Last Order or the Manga adaption\'s alternate ending.--- Setting ---E7 was a far in the future world, making it an own world of unique fantastical flair. AO is set in a near future world of ours, year 2025, only 13 years away from when the show aired. It doesn\'t have so much fantastical illustrious novel landscapes but is pretty down to earth. As such it dabbles a good deal in real life (money) politics.I think this is worth mentioning, since most people probably don\'t seem to pick onto this. It\'s really a lot more enjoyable, if you can pick up on some background on some of those conflicts. Given though it\'s mostly focused on politics with Japan in the mix, so references of political conflics of the US vs. some moslem state may feel superficial for Western audiences, while that\'s probably really just about as much as Japanese on their remote island would realistically care over happenings on the other side of the globe.Okinawa is an island group in Japan. Naru\'s garb\'s pattern is that of a native traditional clothing from there. Okinawa is part of Japan, but there is an independent movement going on for a while already and in that political issue Americans and Chinese play a hand. It\'s not pulled out and utterly explained to death, but it does give the location a very clear sign of territory. I haven\'t seen that particular setting in any other anime.The Okinawian setting is also where Ao\'s ""anma"" for calling his mother comes from. Since it reccurs it also serves as a further charactarization for Ao, who was born there, is also a child of the island and does once state, he loved the island, even if it never really offered a place for him to be there.I think the the whole island setting is quite beautifully written with all sorts of little subtle things. Other territories also show up, the world is pretty global which gives quite a nice variety of locations.What is a bit shorthanded through - as in most anime - is a complete lack of actually spoken dialects. The Okinawa folks speak normal Japanese as do all the obvious non-Japanese characters in the show. There is also a rather clear avoidance of any shown language barriers, but these also don\'t appear too abnormal either, since Ao or the other children don\'t really interact much outside of their social circle and those who do, are all adults with negotiation responsibilities who ought to have no such language barriers. I vastly prefer this workaround over massively hilariously failing Engrish (or doitsu/furansu) insertions.--- Visuals ---The show is animated well above average for a TV Show. Every episode does offer enough material to really draw out a lot of chances to make it shine. There is always some action of some sort happening in every episode, but there are also calmer moments in which subtle character interactions and gestures shine. Beautiful landscapes and various locations around the world give way for beautiful backgrounds. There are a number of mystery scenes which give way for colour plays and directing choices. There are even some dementia-ish episodes with a completely diffrent directing. While they may feel like monster of the week so some or very much disjointed (despite the contents relating to character themes), they were a visual feast to look at. There is also not all that much gory/bloody shock effect shown. Ao realizes the meaning of life and death even without a close up on some ripped off human arm rubbed into his face.The colours are also more vibrant than E7. It also seems to fuller use the whole spectrum of the palette much more than E7 TV did.--- Audio ---The soundtrack is beautiful. It\'s however definitely not a Sato Naoki score anymore. His E7 scores are mostly dramatically suspenseful or depicting some fantastical landscape with a sense of majestic epic grandness, which sure fit E7\'s Scub lanscapes and its pathos nicely. Koji Nakamura\'s score feels more grounded and subtle, a sense of subtle mystery, playfulness, ""reality with a tint of fantasy"" and complexity which fits this show really well. It\'s also still quite E7, given that the E7 score also features tracks that he had created. One old E7 track also makes a short comeback, when Renton enters the show again creating a nice contrast between old and new. All of the tracks have been really well used with their scenes, but even listening to them on their own they feel like telling a story.The voice acting does a very good job, too. All the children do sound some 5 years older than their actual age, but they are also in more responsible positions. Eureka does feel a bit off, since she sounds like she does in E7 and that felt to me a bit too young to downright juvenile, than the age she now should have. A bit of a chuckle comes from Renton now having the voice of Holland.--- English dub ---The voices have been pretty well choosen and their tone colours fit their japanese counterparts very nicely. Being able to understand Japanese, I can\'t say it sounded all that less natural or stiff than the Japanese version already did simply by being Anime. Some nuances get lost, like Ao\'s Okinawian Anma, which has been dubbed as simply mother. (But still appears just like that in the subs.) The dub script generally looks pretty good. There is just one thing that jumped at me. There is a scene in which some hold the enemy and urge Ao to shoot. He says he can\'t just shoot them all (""minna"") with the enemy, it gets translated to that he can\'t shoot his ""friends"". Which is just wrong, especially given that he never had any real interaction with those people that he would call them his friends. (He doesn\'t even call the ones in his team like that.)Aside that I had an impression that the music/sound track vs. dialogue track in the dub was louder than in the Japanese dub. Sometimes (especially with black Georgs computer voice coming in with some static noise) it felt like the dialogue was drowning in background sounds somewhat.--- Characters ---I think it\'s pretty important to note that AO has a far diffrent characterization approach than E7. E7\'s character handling was far more explicitly extroverted (to overdramatized) and took it on to force the other character (and the viewer) into feeling something. Which has a point, since communication on some equal footing was the goal of the Scubs and a rather robotic and alien Coralian Eureka had to learn about emotions on the journey to become humanlike. She didn\'t get it, unless it was extroverted and clear, so immature Renton knowing almost no behaviour restraint was the perfect fit for it. It was one of the core themes around which everything in E7 was built. AO doesn\'t have this as a main theme at all. AO\'s plot is driven by human relationship contellations and politics. If in E7 Holland is a jerk to Renton, angry you should get at him. Anemone is a tragic victim, so pity you should feel for her and disdain for her tormetors. AO doesn\'t force it up as much. Nobody is outright blatantly evil. No action is all that bad from all angles. They just mostly all putting themselved before others, even if they know it\'s probably not the best and right thing to do. But everybody does that and there is no real reason not to, so they continue to do that. That makes the show more serious and realistic befitting the more real-world-like setting. The show also makes this really clear from the beginning, when the sister of one of Gazelle\'s group tries to sell off Ao to the Americans for a lot of money and weakly justifies herself in an empty room.That is not to say though that communicating and expressing ones wishes and feelings isn\'t still there, but it\'s it\'s pretty subdued. Everbody puts up some front, but everybody also has reasons to not disclose them so easily or talk about them, even if they wanted, because it would just not be proper or disadvantageous to do so. That approach is also evident from the first episode, as Naru verbally robs Ao of any right to feel bad over his life. (If that style sounds a bit like an Neon Genesis Evangelion characterization style approach, it probably does. But Ao is quite opposite of this whiny pressimitic emo boy shying away from any sort of responsibility as Shinji, whom you\'d like to give some good slaps.)I think the contrast between the two characterization styles becomes most notable, when a certain former titular E7 protagonist enters the stage again halfway though the show and pretty much acts excatly like in E7. It\'s like she is absolutely overreacting and overdramatising and annoyingly lovey dovey, feelings showing way to clearly on her face over just anything. It wasn\'t out of place in E7. But imo it felt quite alien in AO. So if one liked that extroverted style and expect it from AO as well, everbody in Ao is doomed to feel bland. Because they don\'t make it as obvious or simply go out there and scream out everything on their mind all the time. The show\'s first arc even concludes with Ao scornful over his unlucky fate, but then realizing that getting angry or running away really changes nothing. His feelings are still there through rippling out on all sorts of occasions. - With that in mind, I found this characterization style great. It\'s a ""show it, don\'t say it"" style and if you take a closer look, you will get a good deal of subtle facial expressions, visual tone variations, colour plays, little lines and gestures, that betray some complicated emotions. Also some really great scenes as people  hestitantly disclose inklings of their true feelings as a token of trust. And yes there are also situations with ""they really should just properly talk their minds to each other"" that may gnaw on some peoples patience. But the show makes a good effort in displaying, why it is so and that the ""properly"" part is tricky. As in a lot of cases that people would not accept it, because they are weak, selfish or because things are so out there, they would only be downright unbelievable to their peers.For instance look at how Naru and Ao start. They are childhood friends. One pitiful boy growing up hated by everybody because he is diffrent, with no place on the island and one pitiful girl sick because of the Scubs and probably not going to live long. She defends him from the other islanders. He helps her out given her sickly condition. Who is off worse than the other? It\'s a fragile equilibrium of support between them, which gets disrupted as Ao leaves the island after having protected it. But he becomes special due to exactly what caused his pitiful circumstances. She gets left behind, because there is nothing left she can do for him anymore as others are more competent in helping him out of his circustances. Until she herself also becomes special due exactly what made her life miserable in the first place. And in constrast to Ao who does it out of a sense of responsibility she embraces it wholeheartedly right away. Also much to Aos chagrin, since the one who opened the doors to her happens to be his enemy. They both continue with a sense of paternalism towards each other. Ao at some point realizes, that none of them have changed their former outview towards each other much at all. But just knowing it doesn\'t necessarily change it. They even have a talk, but it ends up being an awkward talk solving nothing, because they never really truly talked to each other. Which is subsequently brilliantly shown as Naru angrily exclaims, she does not want to be just protected by Ao, but be his equal. - While doing the same as her accusation herself. Still both are convinced of doing the right thing. While it just turns out, they both aren\'t right either when a new perspective is added. Because there wasn\'t a really completely right thing in the first place.It also has to be said through, AO obviously only has 24 episodes. There is by far not as much screentime to develop supporting characters or ""1-2 exclusive episode characters"" as in E7. Characters like those from Team Harlequin, with which Ao barely interacts with, don\'t get backstory at all. But that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. E7 was character driven, AO is far less so and feels more tight and with less distraction than E7. The story follows Ao and everybody whom he deals with more closely and whom he gets to know better is explored. In reality you also don\'t know so much about your neighbour three blocks away, whom you from time to time happen to see on the street, do you? But that doesn\'t mean, they aren\'t able to appear as people and to possibly still affect your life some way or another even without you seeing excepts and summaries on their lifes.There is some great handling about a mentor side character. He gets quickly introduced and killed off about just as quickly. Neither the viewer nor Ao never really gets to see much of him alive except like two lines of dialogue. Ao ends up visiting his to be vacated room after his death. There is some unspoken great characterization to be had from his bookshelfs and wall notes about this character we never got to know, never will, but still get an idea of. And this total foreigner still brought a realization and emotional impact to Ao, giving way for an understanding for support characters that did have relashionships with him, as his loss affects them even more. We don\'t get to know whatever they have lived through together in their own special dedicated episodes. But that\'s just fine, too. We do get see how their unknown past shape their present actions and how those affect Ao.--- Plot ---Even if it is a spoiler, I think it really is good to know beforehand: This show has parallel universes, time travel and timeline resets. The latter two are pretty much the same way as the time machine and D-Mails in Steins;Gate if the reference helps out.What however is prone to make it a bit confusing at first sight: the parallel universes are not the parallel universes as in the known parallel universe time travel concept. There is some travel between universes. But that happens literally between a slightly similiar, but completely seperate universes. It looks like they are jumping from the E7 12000 something AD to its own past of year 2025 at first, but that\'s not the case. It\'s World E (the E7 universe) and there is World A (AO universe) and they happened to be somewhat similiar, but aren\'t the same and from World E it happens to be possible to jump to any time point of World A. (As explained as ""space and time are the same"" for the Scubs.) Any time travel and world reset stuff all happen within World A. World E isn\'t the setting at all and except for some cameo scenes and a dialogue line everything remains unknown. This parallel universe concept as it is does get explained verbally once in the last episode. Before that there are numerous little hints showing it, as are the time travel and resets hints, but at least I missed them when airing on air, since numerous weeks later I\'d all forgotten about the details, so the last third became a trainwreck to me. When it actually wasn\'t as I realized upon a rewatch.The show looks messy, but the pieces really do fall into place if you watch it attentively and then continuity issues disappear, too. Save for the 2 minute epilogue scene (which got remade to a full final episode years later) there is also no extra unnatural ""the characters already know that, but the viewer doesn\'t so let\'s explain it once more even though we all know it already!"" sort of exposition dialogue. This is great, but also means, nothing is served on a silver tablet.The major general hurt point about this show\'s plot is admittingly that the original E7 universe is something we learn almost nothing about in this series. And the little we do know is adressed in some 3 minute explanation exposition in the last episode and some mysterious flashbacks (which never get further explained, but do indicate something went really awry in their world, too.) Given that anybody coming from E7 was waiting to see more of E7, what became of the world and the old characters and not getting what they expected, it\'s understandable they felt betrayed. But do make no wrong assumptions: This show is about Ao. From the old cast Eureka is the only one who really gets to have screentime. Renton gets a last episode show up and that\'s it.It admittingly also doesn\'t help, that one of the narratives biggest initial driving mechanisms is a massive mystery box around ""What the heck is up with Eureka? How did she end up in this time/place? Why is she alone? Where is Renton?"" with all of the mysterious flashbacks of Ao of his lone mother and her being gone. It definitely is also intentional bait. And surely it did attract the most attention. But it never really gets focused on all that much. It gets resolved, but to the viewer the resolution feels short and unexplored as any of it is narrated, implied and not explicitly shown with a want for more been shown. Within the context of the show that actually feels very natural. Those two old characters are basically foreigners to the cast of AO whom the viewer is following. They would know nothing about them and any information will come from whatever those two outright tell them. And they don\'t say much. Eureka doesn\'t because she literally has no time to do so (and she has so see to some time line continuity) and Renton, because he doesn\'t even try. Because it\'s probably to painful to talk over his guilt and pain and as he wants to overwrite the world after all, so whatever talk there is would get erased in his agenda anyway. As a result, those two will mention stuff, that\'s evident to them and the E7 viewer (Nirvash, Mechas with souls, Archetype, Coralians, Limit of Questions...), without much of an explanation, but it only throws any of AO\'s characters into understandable puzzlement. To most viewers coming from E7 it probably feels like bad teasing.I also think there is also something about the basic point of the show, that many don\'t like. It\'s not about love, catharsis, not about getting a peaceful cooexistance and not fight, about having fun and getting happy as E7 had and which are universally successful themes. (And it doesn\'t seem to me like as if the creators didn\'t consider it, but intentionally chose not to.) In Ao it\'s mostly about guilt and resposibility. About decisions to be made in a complex net of interests and how they could turn out to be completely wrong. As I mentioned before: The whole show\'s happenings are set in gear by how Eureka and Renton in E7, despite the happy ending there, had actually screwed up. And so they try to fix it. Almost everybody has something in need to fixed up. Naru wants to fix up the world, as she got herself fixed up by accepting the Scubs. Fleur is guilty over her mother\'s death and own survival and in need of fixing up her relashionship with her father. Rebecka about her past deeds in media manipulation. Ivica over his deeds in the war and follow up resolve to never let children die again. The Okinawa folks for being so weak despite boasting their (actual fake) independence. Gazelle, who wants to do better than his father. The Japanese who want more political power as does about any other state. Elena who thinks she is in a wrong world and flees into Otaku escapism most of the time. Truth who also feels out of place of the world and clings towards the world as it was before the Scubs came, which at the same time would also end his own miserable existance. Ao, who tries to cope between, what he can do, should do, can justify before himself to (not) do and what he wants to do, all the while he is gradually more than just slightly overexerting himself. Everybody is in want and need for something. - And then pops up some omnipotent world resetting device that can fullfil wishes.But getting one thing fixed breaks another thing. Quite some responsibility and I do think the show makes a point in showing what this means. It also blends in really well with Ao\'s own character theme of finding a place where he belongs and his increasing doubts over if he really is somebody bringing only misfortune to others as everybody has ever blamed him for. He just got started getting along with Cloe, resetting the world has erased her team from his daily life. They are still alive and happy, but he is not amiss in their life, while left along with his memories of a now nonexistant timeline and nobody whom he can share that pain with. And moreover that omnipotent device sure makes situations go awry. Everybody would naturally want it and situations escalate quickly. And there is still his own wish of getting to be with his mother again. Should he use it? At what unknown cost? In the end he does, because the alternatives are even worse. And he does so by fixing up as many things up for the people whom he knew. He looses everything, but everyone whom he cares lives a nicer life. Without him. That surely isn\'t a cheesy happy ending as in E7.At that I really recommend the ""Final Episode"" ONA, it gives a really good roundabout that even if he decided to do it, it came with considerable pain and it also is much more positively rewarding as he gets to get a happy ending despite having lost so much.Aside that, there is quite some fun to be had through mostly Elena. There are a number of Otaku-culture references and self-referencing in line jokes from the creators themselves. Things like the scene in which they are in space and they stand on silicon with Elena saying ""Zero gravity is hard to animate after all."" In-series she makes one of her random eccentric remarks, outside of it it\'s a pretty witty meta-joke. There is even a scene in the last third, where some director of an in-series anime exclaimes that even of the show gets duped prematurely out of reasons that don\'t even have to do with its proper quality or due to a misinterpretation over what they were trying to tell with it, he is still all passionate about doing it. Given they bothered doing a full new final episode after 4 years to a show that gets dissed and rejected as much as this one, it does feel like a real statement. And there is Naru and Ao talking in ""private"" with an eavesdropping family including her sister exclaiming whenever the kiss is finally supposed to come, while that it\'s the last thing to expect.--- Overall ---I don\'t think the show was really messy, nor as if the creators had no clue what they wanted. It\'s also not really any worse paced than E7. (E7\'s last third also brushed over a lot of setting explanations rather quickly.) This shows one true major handicap is, that it\'s written so, that it expects you to have watched the original E7 and having been marketed mostly towards E7 fans, despite it trying and being really very much diffrent. This could have been avoided, by giving Eureka and Renton (or anybody else with knowledge) more chances of appearing and explaining in-series what had relevant things have happened in E7 leading up to their actions in AO and thus making the series accessable for complete newcomers and market it as its own independant story. As it is it doesn\'t really get through to the target audience, who would have enjoyed the show.There is an in-series argument between Renton and Ao at the end of the show. Renton argues that only one (Nirvash with an archetype), the original, is needed and negates Ao\'s. But Ao has come so far as having his own by then and so he has what it takes to stand on equal ground in a fight against Renton.Perhaps I just randomly see some meta implication here. But it fits hilariously well. A lot of those who dissed the show, had even made jokes over that dialoge piece back in the days, agreeing with Renton. When in the show he\'s comes off more like a narrow minded stubborn dork who doesn\'t want to listen, trying to escape his responsibility by erasing the mistake instead of dealing with it. But isn\'t that actually really sad? Dismissing that AO also has its own powerful merits just because he\'s an offspring that\'s diffrent than its predecessor?But perhaps the announced remake movie trilogy might fix it up. The trailer sure looks more sober, serious and mature than the original E7. Are they going to make the prequel more like the sequel? Will they really dare to make immature Renton be less obnoxious? Or does that end up being just some bait again? Probably something in the middle. But I\'m really crossing my fingers for a version with more likable E7 characters. And perhaps a moon cleanup.', ""- My orveral thoughts on AOIf you have a deep love for the original  characters this will disapoint you, for there are only minor apearences of the Renton as well as Eureka .The animation is beautifulThe openings are great, Escape is an amazing start to any episodeEnding leaves a lot to be disired, and there are way to many plot holes...This anime has a slow start, and the plot never realy takes off.The desecration of Renton, bugs me as well, and this anime lacks the vibe that made Eureka 7 so greatAs a die hard Eureka 7 fan i was very disapointed- I'm really not sure if it's worth a watch, but if you watched the original I think you should give it one This anime has a slow start, and the plot never realy takes off.The desecration of Renton, bugs me as well, and this anime lacks the vibe that made Eureka 7 so greatAs a die hard Eureka 7 fan i was very disapointed- I'm really not sure if it's worth a watch, but if you watched the original I think you should give it one"", 'At first I was like, ""A sequel without the original cast?"" I was ready to bash it before i even started. I love the original anime, just pure loved it. So it\'s sad to see that I haven\'t seen any of the originals yet, besides the mention of Eureka. But before you be like me and judge a book by it\'s cover, seriously, just give it a chance. I did. I\'m hooked, and I\'m loving it.It confuses me a bit, but the plot yanks you back and forth answering questions and making you ask new ones. The graphics, the sounds, the story, magnificent. The whole...concept of him being Eureka\'s son, and Eureka is missing is absolutely great. Although it could be better if I could see a bit of the Gekko State.I\'m pretty sure Holland and Talho should have a grown kid by now, and Eureka\'s adopted children are older. But i must say Ao looks like a child made from Eureka and Renton. I know Renton was annoying and all, but you just gotta love the originals. Not all people can make a person love an anime sequel that still hasn\'t shown some originals. But I love it, none the less. I\'m going to reread the manga from the beginning until I reach the manga version of this anime.I need answers to questions, I\'m sure that eventually all will be answered. But for now, this is so far great even without the originals yet. concept of him being Eureka\'s son, and Eureka is missing is absolutely great.

Elements of Eureka SeveN AO?, Action? check, Mystery? Check, Eureka? Check, Renton? Who knows. Romance? None =/. Not sure why Bones never incorporated the romance element, one of the main reason why the first series was a big hit Renton and Eureka\'s romance. Instead AO has A LOT of action, like there will be a fight scene in every single episode, I guess for those of you who...like action its a plus, but Eureka SeveN is really in my opinion suppose to be a romance anime, well at least thats why I love it anyway.The story, is well very mysterious, be prepared to be confused, and not know what the hell is happening between episodes 1-16 or something. A new enemy is introduced the ""Secrets"", rather than fighting Humans this time, the enemy is some kind off Alien life form or some shit with a very unknown objective. After watching 2/3 of the series, they kinda reveal what the ""Secrets"" objective is but its unclear if its true or false. But what i think makes Eureka SeveN AO great is that new mysterious continue to pop up which adds to the suspense of the story, although I can\'t wait until they get solved, to many mysterious creates to much confusion =/. But I guess with so many mysteries it kinda forces the viewer to make links with the first series before the answer appears, I for one thought a lot of theories on what may be happening. Each time a link the first series appeared I was like \'OMG OMG, Thats from the first series!"" couldn\'t help but be thrilled.Bones did a great job on the art it was definitely Eureka SeveN standard, the art is incredibly similar to the first series with some character design actually looking a lot like some characters from the first series, for example Gazelle and Holland except for the skin colour there basically the same lol. Eureka adopts a more mature and adult look with clothes similar to what Diane thurston wore in the first series. The new Nirvash looks kinda chunky and big, kinda looks a bit weird in my opinion. Whats quite cool is that each ""Secret"" actually look different, unlike the first series where the enemy IFO and ships was always the same.The sound?, This is an Eureka SeveN sequel people, of course its going to be amazing, is what i thought, Don\'t get me wrong its not bad, the opening and ending songs are amazing, especially the first ending song that is REALLY good. Only thing i\'m disappointed about is the OST, do you guys still remember in Eureka SeveN, where each scene basically had a different OST? or at least there was a lot of different OST\'s. Well in AO, this wasn\'t really the case, the fight scenes all use the same exact OST, the sad/happy scenes really only uses like the same 3-4 OST. Man Bones whats up with that, in Eureka SeveN there was like 4-5 different OST for the fight scene, even now i still remember the tecno tunes from the first season, or Eureka\'s theme song that makes you think of literally all the sad parts of the first season.Remember how you loved Eureka in the first series? Well your going to probably hate the main female character Naru in the second series, without the Romance Element, it literally feels like 2 childhood friend having a different opinion that leads to a massive fight, and Naru was the cause of it all. Even now i don\'t even know why the hell shes acting that way towards Ao, he\'s doing everything to try and help her but she\'s all like ""OHH NOO i don\'t want your help, i want Truth, because he\'s my giant"" not trying to sound weird but that is literally the reason >.> . I REALLY  hope this shit clears up soon because its pretty annoying seeing Ao get constantly rejected. But Naru is a VERY mysterious character, currently after watching 17 episodes NOTHING has came up on what Naru\'s objective is, all we know is that she wants Ao for something, and that Scub Corlian accepted her or some shit.Like father, Like son, Ao like Renton, both are amazing pilots, both are clumsy and easily charmed/embarrassed, both have that scaredy cat feel towards them. But unlike Renton, Ao is probably way more rebellious and straightforward with things and is much more stubborn and as a 12 year old kid, Ao is surprisingly coping REALLY well, remember all the mental break downs Renton had? Ao didn\'t have as much, and his break downs weren\'t as exaggerated compare to Rentons.A lot of the side characters do nothing but to add to the mystery of the story, Just where is Eureka? and what happened to her?, which leads to a LOT of speculation but it does suck that there isn\'t a lot of character development with the sider characters for example there is hardly any development of the Pied Piper crew, except for Rebecka and Ivica the rest of the crew is basically not introduced... Kinda sucks, but i guess they don\'t have enough episodes for that kind off development plus they kinda made up for it by introducing Team Goldilocks.But I feel that with all the characters in AO, theres not really any attachment towards any of them, Even with Ao, I don\'t really give a shit about him and actually care more about Eureka who has like a air time of less than 20 minutes.. Theres just not enough development with the main character and he doesn\'t really make you feel sorry for him. Even though he lost his mum at a young age theres just not enough sadness around that topic, plus nothing has really happened that will make you sympathise with him except for losing his mum at a young age. Remember how when Renton first see his sister, THAT had a big impact. When Ao first meets Eureka, that DID NOT have a big impact.Nevertheless this anime has provided me with plenty of enjoyment, it serves to fill up the hole that was left behind after season one finished. There is slight comedy scenes in this, not much but when they appear they are pretty funny. The fight scenes are pretty well made, really shows Ao\'s power over everyone else like with Eureka and Renton, literally every fight seen Fleur and Elena are completely useless, they either get shot down straight away, or their units can\'t actually fight that kind of Secret...  The best scenes for me are when things from the first series are mentioned/appear. When Eureka appeared for the first time, her entrance was the most nostalgic thing you will ever see, i just remember going ""omg, it can\'t be, thats nirvash, thats gekko go OMG WHY IS IT HERE?!?!?!?!"" I really can\'t wait when Renton will appear really looking forward to what his new look might be.For me this anime overall is ok, its nothing compared to the first, I guess you can say i\'m biased due to the fact i love the first series, but the only thing i\'m actually looking forward to is the bits with Eureka and Renton in the rest seems kinda pointless, it is still good enough to act as the sequel of Eureka SeveN due to its action and art. I think Bones focused way to much on what the current trend is for anime, just having loads of ""Action"", and instead neglected the things that made the 1st series great. like action its a plus, but Eureka SeveN is really in my opinion suppose to be a romance anime, well at least thats why I love it anyway.The story, is well very mysterious, be prepared to be confused, and not know what the hell is happening between episodes 1-16 or something.

And as I said, I\'m totally disappointed...Story: 1It\'s all messed up, I\'m serious, it\'s a real black and white contrast from the original which focused more in the story than all the fireworks. Even though the moon writing thing in the original is pretty cheesy but I can\'t help just to giggle and felt really happy for Renton and Eureka, even anemone x dominic couple still manage to put tears to my...eyes. On the other hand I don\'t really remember anything from Ao\'s story, just pretty much the last part, and even that still manages to get on my nerves.Art: 7Bones studio really did a great job on this department. beautiful animation. But somewhat it started to degrade midway and suddenly beautiful again at probably 3 to 4 last episodes. The original had a very consistent animation all the way through, even on the ""filler"" episodes.Sound: 9Sound was great and original. Really enjoyed pretty much all the OPs &amp; EDs for this series.Charcter: 1There are pretty much 0 character development, Ao did not grew or find love or did something, he just did some gun firing.

And 1 more, why the hell did they make grown up Renton like that? and why does he has the same voice as holland? They\'re not related, WHY?!?!?Enjoyment: 2Overall, I did not enjoy the series, after I watched 12 episodes I thought ""Hang on a minute, I\'m confused!"" it has too many mysteries, too many drastic change of hearts to the characters, too many time travels, too many laser beams and missiles, too many truth appearance, too many ILFs and too many things that does not make a series good and cherished. It lacks balance and taste in the writing, planning and direction department.Overall: 3Maybe I was expecting too much coming straight from the original series, but I felt that this series really massively slapped the original in the nuts. It\'s really a shame that they decided to put in too much of things especially time travels, even the scrub corals time traveled, I was like, ""R U F***ing serious???"" honestly, I was expecting a sort of a back story on how the coralians managed to fill the earths, not some some traveling corals shit and a bunch of characters that doesn\'t have enough significance in the movie. I finished watching the series just for the sake of it and I truly hoped as I watched more episodes things will get better, but unfortunately more disappointments came instead.Excuse my ramblings, but I just felt betrayed by AO, it has every potential to be a great pre/sequel but they crashed it instead.

I never thought I would see a anime similar or close to Heroic Age or Xam'd: Lost Memories but here it is and I just finished it as well my blood is pumping like crazy! And I also realized that there is a origin story of this not like a Season 1 of this anime but a Story of Ao's father & Mother AKA Eureka & Renton! Now I haven't watched it yet but as it's the origin...of how things have began I know it's going to be good so I am going to watch it afterwards!Now firstly at first the story was going normally like any anime would ( I am skip forwarding my lines or else it will a 1000 letter of easy) but excitedly from episode 14 things stared to take a turn the writer brought Time travel theory into the story at first I thought that was great but then as the story progress Ao management to get himself a machine which his father created that can change alternate versions of timelines! Now it's of course sounds very disturbing I was questioning what was Ao's father trying to vision before making this machine? Then as the story progressed it was stared to make sense from all the timelines he have changed he managed to get back into them and created a link for example showed into episode 23! So out of all the outcome this was a best outcome I think this was what Ao's father visioned and Ao made it happen! Man this story writing is so good that I am crying this is what anime is man!Now here are things that I am really angry about what was Ao's sister doing in this entire story? What tf was her role? All she did was to create more trouble then there is! No I want to know, In Episode 7 she just went with Truth and took his words for it and blindedly did what she thought it's right!!!!! I forgot the episodes name but as she was trying to ride another Nirvash and Eureka was there telling her to help Ao but she refused! Ok now I know that nobody told her that Ao is her brother and they are siblings and nor did anyone told them that Eureka is her mom and about situations I know it was a mistake from Ao and from others end but still why and for what reason was she like this?? What was wrong with Naru I don't get it in this entire story I have been constantly hating her!Ok Anyway now as this was the after story of Eureka & Rentons they had there own legacy and this anime was the conclusion of that story which Ao's parents couldn't complete but So put an end to it! Man I still remember the seen from Episode 23 Ao's parents were crying of joy as they saw there son finishing everything that they failed! What parents wouldn't be so proud after seeing there children accomplish things that they couldn't complete! (No thanks to Naru). It's sad to see a anime like this coming to an end but every good things come to an end and it's time for this anime to end it's journey here! I do want a second season of course I want to if Ao did find everything and really comeback to his time and what he is doing currently stuff like that but I think this was a good ending it's good to keep the reader curious! I think a second season will just ruin the anime I think it's good as it is now! I guess it's time to move on and look for similar anime such as this!Masterpiece!

This show is done a lot more to my liking tho character wise. Ao is a much stronger leading character with a lot of Independence and courage.

Solid 7, may go up as the series progresses."", ""Eureka seven AO astral ocean reviewStory 5/10If you enjoyed the entertaining love story that comes with the original eureka seven, you'll find none of that here.SPOILERS!!So here we go, eureka seven AO has a really confusing storyline, where throughout the series, the main antagonist remains somewhat ambiguous. Is the scub corral that appear from the ground? Is the the Secrets (antibodies that are against foreign objects, aka the scub corral)? Is it the mysterious Truth (creepy guy who kills a lot of people and overall disturbs the love relationships)? WHO KNOOOOooooOoOWs? In the end the scub corral are erased from history, thus the Secrets no...longer exists and since the Secrets no longer existed, Truth becomes the autopilot for the nirvash neo (so basically the buddy for Ao, which makes no sense because they were enemies before). So basically time was reset and a world without Ao and the scub corrals was born. Half the characters are gone and you don't really know what happens to them (kinda like in the original series, where the crew of the gekko's fate remains unknown).ultimately the story feels somewhat incomplete, because it has one of those happy endings where the fate of the characters are left to the imagination of the viewersCharacters 6/10For the most part, the  characters of Eureka seven AO are uninteresting and have little chemistry. Like I mentioned before, eureka seven AO is not a love story.Fukui AoThe protagonist of the series and the son of eureka and Renton. And just like Renton, he only wants to protect the people he loves. However he doesn't really romantic love anyone, so really the people he platonically loves. He downs really have any character traits that really pop out to me personally as a viewer.Fleur Blanc and Elena PeoplesThe two friends and side characters. Overall they are fun and have complex back stories that are somewhat filled in. Incidentally they are two of the three attractive heroines of the seriesArata NaruThe supposed love interest for Ao. However, their love is only hinted through one sided care for Ao by Naru. In the beginning of the series the character displays lots of enthusiasm and potential to be the next eureka/anemone (a mix of both characters). Ironically she becomes a reverse anemone, where she's in love with the MC and become a mindless boring character (almost as if she's on drugs). In addition, she actually seems to be attracted to Truth moreso than Ao. Also funny enough, she actually spends more screen time with Truth then Ao. This basically destroys any love interest between the two. So basically over  the course of the the episodes, I started to overlook her as an important character, because basically she just does her own thing and doesn't add to the story. Honestly she belongs in the original series rather than AO.TruthThe semi-creepy somewhat antagonist of the series. Basically he kidnaps Naru (well she goes willingly) and through the interactions with him, she becomes a much less enjoyable character. Ao views him a somewhat of a threat, since Ao doesn't realistically seem to wanna hurt him, or take Naru back. However, ironically over time, Truth becomes a character with much more depth and feels like an actual antagonist. In the end he becomes apart of the operating system for the nirvash neo and ends up being good friends with Ao (which is really confusing).Eureka and RentonBoth characters are quite enjoyable when they appear in the series. Eureka has a lot more of a personality and pops up randomly through out the series. Renton only shows up for the last 2 episodes and is a lot like Holland. Either way, the motives of the two are based upon the fact that they love Ao very much and want to protect him. The reason for this is because in a world where trapars exist, Eureka's first child turns to stone and dies. Which is why Renton and Eureka want to create a world without trapars, so that Ao would live. Overall they are the anchor that linksThe original series to this one.Animation 6.5/10It's nothing spectacular, but is definitely superior to the original (duh, it's newer). It has the classic Eureka missile chase scenes and the the mecha designs are much more appealing than the previous series, however there is no real merchandise or figures for this series, so if you liked the characters or anything like that, sorry!Soundtrack 4/10No real osts that stick out or escalate the scenes or action. The openings and ending are alright though and are quite catchy.Overall 6.5/10Ahhh if only eureka seven AO had more of the traits from the original series. It's a entertaining watch and definitely picks up after episode 7, mostly because Naru gets kidnapped and things get weird. If you liked the ordinal series and liked eureka and Renton, maybe watch it for them.

I expected the same faimly friendly, coziness, empowering feel that I got from Eureka Seven but that wasn't the case at all.Story: 5Now in the beginning it was simliar to Eureka Seven where a regular boy now has to pilot/co-pilot an IFO (Mechas they frequently use in the series) and it felt pretty nice to see that. The next few episodes were used to introduce the main and supporting characters. They were pretty boring and generic at first and the only one...who stood out was that one tan girl (but that's besides the point) The way they describe how politics are working will turn some people off from this series. I had to go on the wikia to understand who and what each political party wanted and what was their reason for even existing (kinda spoiled the big plot twist in the series for myself in doing so :/) Anyways basically the series has a problem with how they explain big points in the series, especially when in the beginning and end of the series. It's very confusing what they're saying half the time and you often have to rewatch that scene twice or three times to understand. The pacing was pretty ok, its was a little slow in the beginning, picked up a lot in the middle of the series with a bunch of action and things that actually progress the plot and the end of series was ok as well.Art: 7The art was probably one of the only consistent things about this anime. It was simple and done properly throughout the series. So it wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad either. Animation was pretty smooth as well.Sound: 8I took note of the background music because of how well it meshed together with the scene at hand. I think the OST was pretty well done. The music always just made the scenes fill with more emotions, whether they be positive or negative.Character: 5his was easily one of the weak points of this show. Most characters were there just to fill a spot in the ohw. They had no real purpose and tried to have real melodramatic moments but it just didn't work. The main character I felt went through a lot of struggle but to learn nothing really. We see no change in his personality and no one else really. Whenever there was change though, it seemed hella forced. Another thing this show does is give characters so way of magically knowing information and not telling the viewer how they know this. just so the story can progress and doesn't explain how they figure it out.  It was nice to see some characters from Eureka Seven though (the feels were real)Enjoyment: 6Even though it seems I've been bashing this anime so far, I did enjoy some moments. Very few but did enjoy some. The animation during most of the fights were pretty nice. The last few episodes were very enjoyable just because of reasons I can't spoil. Other places of enjoyment were the little comedic moments from time to time. Didn't happen often but I did crack a few laughs.Overall: 5.5-6In comparison to the prequel, AO is nothing in comparison really, the main goal of the series is all over the place, main characters doesn't really grow and the supporting characters doesn't help because all they do is fill roles and spout nonsense. The music and animation were solid though. And the feels at the end of the series were just... something I can't explain. who stood out was that one tan girl (but that's besides the point) The way they describe how politics are working will turn some people off from this series.

Worst Sequel I've ever seen done to a beautiful original series (Eureka Seven).Plot: 3/10Completely bullshit compared to the original series. So now Scub Corals can travel through time and universe. Oh, and so in the other timeline of the other world, Earth has antibodies called the SECRETs. Oh, so all the efforts of peace and harmonious living between humans and Scub Corals are useless in the 1st series as Renton is now a Scub Coral Killer. Reason? Because his daughter could not survive in...his world and he wants to destroy the scub corals in order for his soon-to-be-born son to be able to live there. There's so much more flaws in this sequel that I want to point out, but all in all the plot is questionable at its core.While this is a sequel, if you would look at this as a standalone series, I would say it still consists tons of plot holes that cannot be explained.Character: 5/10Well, the character development is pretty bad, except for Noah the sloth. And... Eureka =PArt: 8/10The art is pretty good in my opinion, movements are fluid and mecha battles looks great in this anime. However this does not fill up the flaws made from the plot.Music: 8/10Musics used in this anime is good. No comment on this. Most of you would enjoy this I think.Overall Rating: 5/10No matter how, this sequel does not lift up to be a continuation for the first series. Although in the end, explanations covers up most of gaps from the original series to this one, which appears to be so matching and makes sense in some ways (I do hope you guys who watched it will disagree), but the stupidity and illogical plot itself diverts its core purpose from the original.Is it a waste of my time?

I mean, it wasnt bad, but compared to the original materpiece, all this anime did was pass some time while I worked out.Art:10- Before I go into the generic characters and the incredibly flawed plot line, let me just say that the art is amazing, and I mean, amazing. I wish other anime had art this clear and vivid. Wow.Characters: 4- Why, just why is there not a single character that has original traits. Seriously, there are no good characters in this. You know what, lets take...the 4 I just gave and make it a 2. This may feature the most generic, unoriginal characters that I have ever scene. Lets do a play by play for the three main characters in this show.Ao Fukai- And for the hundredth or so time, your main character is...the generic male character with all of the usual protagonist traits. This man is willing to give up everything to save people he just met, causes every girl to fall in love with him and... oh wait I am describing the sword art online character. I wish this guy was the sword art online character, Ao is about as bland as water. Nothing about him sticks out other than his hair.Naru Arata- I think everyone will agree with me on this, but Naru was easily the worst heroine of 2012. All she does is hold every character back. she allies with Ao and Pied Piper, holds them back. Allies with truth, and holds him back. She is just a plot device. What a waste of potential.Truth- The most forced villain that I have ever scene. I feel like the producers just decided that they needed a villain due to the success of Dewey in the original. Truth is not even a tenth of how amazing Dewey was.Plot- So long are the days of good, deep plots from the original. Instead we have random sprints of action that make no sense at all. The plot is just incredibly flawed and the ending... well I will say that I respect the producers for trying that type of ending, it just doesn't work.A part of me seriously wishes that I could have written a positive review, as it is the sequel of an incredible anime.

Part of the reason why it isn't nearly as good as the first series is due to the time constraints. Eureka Seven was 50+ episodes and this is only 24 so there isn't nearly as much time for character development and other themes to be raised. Also, the series feels at times like they...are trying to do too much at once, which makes it somewhat chaotic and less fluid as the original series. I would say the later half of the show is more interesting than the first, because there are more references to the first series that fans might appreciate.Bones did a very good job with the art for the show as well as the sound, although I think the ost for Eureka Seven was better overall.The story and characters needed work, but mostly because the limited number of episodes allowed for character development and plot progression. are trying to do too much at once, which makes it somewhat chaotic and less fluid as the original series.

That said there are those who would like to tell you to go into Eureka Seven AO with an open mind, or that it\'s a stand alone series, that\'s more of an offshoot than a sequelfrom the original Eureka Seven.Well those people are wrong, and you should cut them off from your life, they are dead to you, KILL IT WITH FIRE.Anyone who tries to tell you that Eureka Seven AO isn\'t a direct sequel...to the original series is lying to themselves. Cause the sad sad truth is that it is. That this series exists and nothing good comes from it._________________________________________On to the review. So do you remember all your burning questions to the fate of Eureka and Renton after they left on a journey? What happened to their adopted children? What happened to Holland and the Gekkostate crew? How did humans adapt in the new world? Did Eureka and Renton ever return from the forest with their blinking red and blue head lights?Well be prepared!Cause Eureka Seven AO won\'t be answering those questions, and will instead thrown straight out the window, breaking the perfectly good window in the process.Eureka Seven AO is essentially a direct sequel, although it\'s set about 13+ years after the original. As that is our protagonists age at the start. The star of E7:AO is none other Ao himself. The son of Eureka and Renton, although the only one Ao knows is his mother who has gone missing before the start of the show. He was raised by knock off Grandpa Thurston, Dr. Toshio Fukai. Don\'t worry who he is doesn\'t really matter cause he has such a small role to play in the story. Should also mention he also leaves behind Naru, a childhood friend of Ao\'s... there may be more between them, but not like the show cares to elaborate on it.Shortly after the start of the series we are introduced to the digital black crystal monsters known as simply, Secrets. Through a series of unfortunate events with a Secret, Ao eventually stumbles into his mothers mech, the Nirvash Mk. 2 and this sparks the desire to go search her out. Leaving his care taker behind and joining the organization Generation Bleu.From here E7:AO turns into a ""monster of the week"" style anime. Also Ao seems to forget about the search for his mom as well as he gets wrapped up in the organization he joined. It\'s here we meet the shows cast, Fluer, Alena, Ivaca.... all of which are inconsequential. As they are all barely developed and ultimately the whole monster of the week thing just builds up to collecting Scub Cubes which form the series dues ex machina, the Quarts Gun, a.k.a the Retcon Gun.Spoilers!!!It\'s this single element of the series that manages to screw up any hope there ever was for some meaningful story to develop from this train wreck.As this weapon\'s key attribute is the ability to erase the thing that it hits... entirely... from that timeline. With the wonderful after effect of changing any person or object it may have come into contact with. It should be mentioned that there was also already a time travel or alternate universe element at play with Eureka being sent back in time through some seven swell worm hole in order to save her and Rentons Son... and to add to the already convoluted nature of time travel in series, they threw on an element that just crushed any chance of it making a lick of sense.Anyhow now thanks to the Retcon gun. certain characters outright disappear cause they never end up meeting Ao, others personalities change cause of change of events in their past, villains become allies, allies become villains. Everything that the show had developed up to the point of use becomes pointless, grinds to a halt and resets. With the only character left unaffected being Ao. If only his character was good enough to carry the series on it\'s own through these events, but it doesn\'t.The gun is used on very few occasions, and usually with it comes the side effect of head scratching as a re-written universe unfolds before the viewers eyes with no explanation or ground work to how things got to where they are. Worse off the rules of the time line changing gun are loose.... very loose. Some characters seem to be able to retain small chunk of memories from their previous life before the timeline was re-written... which makes no sense whats so ever.Some of the alterations to peoples personalities and character roles also don\'t add up or make sense either based on the change that was made as well.If the Retcon Gun wasn\'t a problem enough. The show does us the courtesy of bringing Eureka and Renton back into the story in the second cour of the series. Mainly a form of fan service if anything. As everything you knew and loved about these characters in the original anime is long gone. In fact their plans and decisions also make no sense. One such thing for example that also happens to be a spoiler.....Renton sent Eureka to this alternate timeline in order to safely give birth to Ao. The whole point, and motive was to protect his family. When Renton finally reappears towards the end of the series after finding his family, his goal is to reclaim the Quartz Gun and use it on the Scubs so they never existed (and consequently it would mean that Eureka, and his son Ao wouldn\'t exist either as a result). Again... it makes no sense. Also apparently his motive is that the Scubs and Humans can\'t possibly live in peace together after all, so they must be eradicated so that humanity can survive.A contradictory point from the original series which saw the resolution of peace between Humans and Scubs.Thankfully the show has a happy ending... and Ao does all of us a favor and uses the Retcon gun on all the Secrets and makes it so all of the Ao series never happened.

If you're a fan it is still a must watch, but don't expect too much, and I'll tell you why in this review.Story: 7/10Eureka's son, Ao Fukai, is living in Okinawa. Little does he know he is Eureka's real son. He finds out a lot about himself as the series introduces scub coral and Secrets. After learning about...these he gets sucked into chaos, fighting with his IFO, or Nirvash, together they uncover the mysteries of why he is there on Earth rather than where the original Eureka 7 took place many years in the future.Art: 9/10The art was beautiful in a sense that we get to see IFO fights clearly. Backgrounds are very unique. The same character designs but with different people. The art was probably the strong point in AO.Sound: 7/10The Ost's didn't really stand out. It sounded a bit recycled. Nonetheless, Flow does it again with BravBlue as the 2nd opening. Probably the only thing I cared for listening to.Enjoyment & Overall: 7/10It was good. Not great, not terrible, just good. Although many of the fans of Eureka 7 were expecting AO to be magnificent and even better than the original . It was not. But I still enjoyed AO, good mech fights. But lacking a love story. Really wished for a love story.. To sum things up, this series is a must watch for those Eureka 7 fans, just don't be expecting anything in particular. these he gets sucked into chaos, fighting with his IFO, or Nirvash, together they uncover the mysteries of why he is there on Earth rather than where the original Eureka 7 took place many years in the future.Art: 9/10The art was beautiful in a sense that we get to see IFO fights clearly.

In my opinion AO was a good anime if you won't expect too much on it.I think it would have been better if it could have as many episodes as Eureka 7 but it didn't, so it felt a little half-assed.AO was great to watch but after watching it, when you start to think the things it didn't have (compared to Eureka 7) it doesn't look good at all. That is why it should be watched without any prejudice and expectations.If you are a person that loves something so much that you will watch any...shitty sequel, I think you will like this if you really won't set your expectations high.In this anime I liked that even at 22th episode you wouldn't know what the ending would be like.

Although it is the sequel to Eureka Seven it is only 24 episodes so don't expect the same thing from a 50 episode show.Story: [5/10]The story is all over the place and it is hard at times to tell what the characters are after. It kind of keeps you on your toes but letting you think that you understand where the story is going and then the creators add an element that you didn't see coming and it makes more confusing or complex. Overall the story is about a teenager named Ao who lives a normal life until his...quiet life is interrupted by an attack on the island that he lives on. To keep my review as spoiler free as possible I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you want to watch the show based on this. It is basically a show where a teenager's life is interrupted and goes on an adventure. Although like I said earlier the story is a bit lack luster and is hard to pinpoint at times.Art: [9/10]Eureka Seven AO doesn't use one color through out the whole 24 episodes that you watch. It is extremely appealing to the eye, and is a breath of fresh air.Sound: [9/10]A plus for those who enjoyed the original Eureka Seven will be glad to hear that FLOW is back for another single that is very pleasing to the ears. The music is very fitting and the OST is fantastic. If there is anything that you retain from watching the series the music is definitely something I know you will enjoy having watched for.Character: [3/10]Now don't get me wrong the characters aren't that horrible, but they could be explained a lot more. Each character has their own spotlight, but it isn't enough to fully display who they are and what they feel.Enjoyment: [7/10]I enjoyed watching the show quite a bit. A key note that I have to bring up again to fully enjoy the show is to for the most part forget that Eureka Seven AO is even a sequel to the original Eureka Seven. The first episodes were a blast (not that the latter ones weren't), but if it weren't for the alluring first episodes i don't think I could have stood to finish AO with all the bad gripe about the show.Overall: [7/10 (rounded from 6.6)]Come in for the action, music, and animation. If that's what was missing from the original Eureka Seven for you than this could be your hidden gem.

Not to me at least.See first things first, the reviews SCARED me. They were the reason I did NOT watch this anime for almost 2 years after I watched the main series (E7). But that\'s not just it. Perhaps it was because of the humongous time gap that I put between the first part and the sequel. Because of the time gap, I could watch this series like an entirely new one, without comparing it to the previous. So guess you could say my...opinion will be somewhat unbiased as compared to those.First things first, the storyline. The plot was confusing (a bit), and it lacked the oomph of the primary series. But in the end, it kinda started making sense and it... well, wasn\'t as bad as Guilty Crown. So it was okay. *thumbs up* Though there were just too many factions... America, Japan, the private companies, Corals (I don\'t even know why they were so keen on destroying them because they were literally harmless), and Secrets (which were involved in a long debate whether they were the enemy or not, but in the start of the anime - it is FREAKING CLEAR that they are the enemy because they shot people and cars right before the protagonist\'s eyes).What really annoyed me was the characters... I mean, how bad can you make the characters? There\'s a limit! I am officially annoyed by how mainstream the characters can be. There is always this one male lead who, despite whatsoever his girlfriend does, will not stop sympathizing for her. Like his girlfriend literally ran away THRICE with another guy, and he was still ""ok"" with it. How bad can it be? And there were other characters. Characters who keep making mistakes on and on and on. The Pied Pipers - officially the worst team I have ever seen. And for some reason - EVERY GODDAMN GUY KNOWS EUREKA AS THEIR RESPECTIVE SAVIOUR! -_-But honestly speaking, the most annoying character was still Naru. I never understood her from the start till the end - she was the dumbest female lead that could ever exist... Like she is really worse than Orihime from Bleach!I personally liked the villain. I don\'t know about you, but a villain that can annoy me is a good villain.The good part was when we see Renton in the third last episode. It was like rain after a long and dry summer. You\'d give a fangirl squeak - regardless you are a guy or girl. But Renton totally kills it in the last episode... He is a disgrace to a father. He hit his son with a football, he beat the shit out of his robot, etc. etc. and that was totally unlike a mature person. They turned him into a shit character.Then there is the art. The art was beautiful, no doubts, but it was more about steel, metal, fall coloured broccolis, water, colourful robots, etc. BUT THERE WAS NO TRUE BEAUTY. If you don\'t get what I mean by true beauty - please, rewatch Eureka Seven. Or just google ""Eureka Seven wallpapers"" lmfao, you\'ll get some good examples.Sound was great! I mean, the music they put in was amazing. I loved the music that played using battle sequences, and the OP and ED - everything was good.Enjoyment, I\'d say I got a bit more than what I was expecting after all those negative reviews. I\'d say it was worth my time. Nothing more, nothing less. There was action, there were robots, and there was a story line that progressed steadily.THE MOST ANNOYING PART OF THE ANIME - THE ENDThe ending was INCOMPLETE. Like most anime show what happens to the characters after blahblahblah war ends, AO did not show ANYTHING except for the protagonist. Like that\'s the most disappointing thing that I have ever seen! Like what? What? What? What happened to the Pied Pipers? What happened to Eureka and Renton? What?Verdict: It is worth a watch.

That being said it isn't too hard to identify the reasons that made E7 so great in the first place. While E7:AO has some of that (pretty nice art and fairly enjoyable characters (most of the time)), It's hard to not feel disappointed.Despite having nice artwork, the original and colourful environments present in E7 are all replaced by very generic modern Japanese scenery. This by itself is fine, as there are plenty of great mecha shows set in similar settings, however it just...feels like part of what gave E7 it's fantastic, unique identity is gone here. And with the inclusion of an Evangelion-esque organization guiding our heroes and the more team-focused character development, it just ends up feeling overly derivative of things that it shouldn't be deriving from, since E7 established such an interesting world.Also, closure.

Even though it's ended, it doesn't mean it cannot be built on to be better. And just because the original series was about counter-culture, it doesn't have to be same in the sequel too. Eureka Seven universe was good enough to be built on. There were a lot of things to tell about the world. But AO couldn't manage that. It is bad as a sequel and pretty below average for an anime. So much wasted potential...TL;DR: It certainly does not add something valuable to...the E7, actually takes from it. And as a anime, it really not worth your time if you've not decided to consume everything about E7.Good things about the anime:-MUSIC-Animation and art styleBad things about it:-Everything elseIs is even sadder because the story could actually be amazing. It had a good premise and the later reveal about what was that world about made it better. It starts of just like the original, we have a growing boy living with an old man. Things get chaotic and the boy finds himself in a journey with people he don't know much about. There are a lot of different details but outline is pretty much this and so far so good. But as you are watching, you realize everything that made the original E7 good is not here anymore. As the story unfolds, you connect the dots with this world and original E7 and you learn about the main character. And, that was it. Without spoilers, this is pretty much what you can expect. The characters are not interesting at all. They are not even getting the one-tenth of the treatment the original E7 characters' have. Occasionally, you get some backstory for some of them but they are not in the least interesting. Ao is an exception because you actually wonder about him and when you think about Renton's development in the original series, you expect so much from AO. I can say he was interesting at first but he has not developed as the story progressed but the last two episodes or something. He had so much potential to make the sequel work but he just played the role of standart mc who makes the story progress.The music is the best thing about the series and subjectively better than the original. OP's and endings are banger, music in the fight scenes makes you hype up, and the music in the emotional moments even makes you sad, even though you don't care about the characters.I think the original E7's animations and art was better, but AO was not bad at all. Better looking than the anime of its time but it is disappointing that it is not as good as its predecessor released years ago.Even though it had the potential to become an amazing sequel, Eureka Seven AO couldn't even become a good anime.

This “sequel” lacks that certain excitement that the first series had. Indeed, the story of Eureka Seven was complicated but it was still well-made therefore, the storyline still became something exciting and interesting.Eureka Seven is by FAR better in every way and that most particularly with the soundtracks because Eureka Seven have one of...the best soundtracks out there!The only time things get exciting is probably the time when Renton finally appeared and that’s the last two episodes. It’s extremely exciting to see characters you encountered before in a different way. It’s very nostalgic.

The characters were unique and memorable and having only seen the series once when it first came out stateside I could describe every character in detail (too bad I suck with names, my failing not the shows). Eureka 7 Astral Oceans greatest folly is that it has none of that character development and feeling.Ao is kind of whiny and annoying but he has some sort of resolution to do something not quite resembling the right thing but it\'s what he wants to do for some reason that...is never really rationalized, his two squad mates are the one who is angry at her dad and the one who makes pop culture references and that\'s about it. There is no real character development, no real change, Renton went from a whiny kind who was just scared to being a kid who fought for what he wanted, Ao goes from a whiny kid to a whiny kid with brief moments of stoicism and insane choices that he goes back on an episode later. There\'s just nothing memorable about any of them. Ivica is probably the most interesting character with the most defined ethos and personality and it shows, he\'s likeable, he\'s memorable.The series feels like Eureka 7 only in name, there\'s not much relation to the original other than a few key concepts and two or three names. The arts fine, the voice acting and sound is fine. There is nothing objectionable about the show (barring the character issues). The biggest loss in translation was the freedom that the LFO\'s provided the pilots and population, it was surfing on the wind, it was sport and combat, and it was a beautiful, believable, and unique.

It just doesn\'t make sense when you say that only children can pilot the LFOs (or whatever acronym they have given to this generation) and give no reason for that, then show some grown ups piloting similar vehicles, and when you have an original series where grown ups were the predominant pilots.I honestly think that this would be a better series if it was a stand alone, there would be no comparing it its predecessor and it would be able to be its own show.

Though confused with how everything tied into the original series at first, the ending was a pleasant one that had me satisfied.I will admit, some will probably not like this because the show really does not fully explain what is going on in the world around them and kind...of expects you to have a firm grasp on the lore of Eureka Seven.Any who liked Eureka Seven, I feel will enjoy this continuation. of expects you to have a firm grasp on the lore of Eureka Seven.Any who liked Eureka Seven, I feel will enjoy this continuation.', ""The story is realy gone down from original. They introduce all sort of uneeded aspects, like time traveling and universeal traveling.  Also why did they make that Renton and Eureka can't have kids in their universe. I also hopped that the story would focus on more Eureka and Renton as adults. The only descent episodes were 23  and 24.Renton only had screen time of 3 episodes, that really sad. I was hopping to see more of the original gekko crew.Overall the Eureka Seven Astral Ocean was mediocre at best. Character Ao was kinda to into what is right or wrong.

I personally never liked it too much, as many episodes felt too slow, or were fillers, while many aspects of the story were confusing, unfocused, and eventually unexplained. It was otherwise much better than your average mecha or adventure, plus it had the privilege to end in a solid way with no reason to expect a sequel. But alas, AO is here…As soon as the promotional videos and the character designs were out, me and many others...had a really bad feeling about this. It screamed like the whole thing would turn into a harem with THAT sort of protagonist and THOSE types of uniforms.I see a pussy boy and two sluts; what do you think the show will be like?And guess what happened as soon as the first episode came out. We were of course right. Here is why.1. It is not inspirationalAllow me to describe my first impressions of each series.E7: The hero is the son of a famous man and has a dull normal life. He hopes to do something important one day. Suddenly a huge robot with a beautiful girl drops in his life. He immediately decides to follow that girl in a life of adventure, with hopes to be as great as his father, as well as winning her heart.AO: The hero is the son of a despised woman and has a simple normal life with no real goals and even a secured childhood friend / platonic girlfriend. Suddenly a weird robot attacks his village and he is running away scared until he is dragged around by some snoopy friends of his to go have a closer look. All accidentally he drops inside a mecha and without having the slightest clue of what he is doing, he beats the evil robot. Then some cute girl appears and tries to befriend him, while trying to explain what happened. He gets angry and walks away since he doesn’t care to find out. Even later when he decides to join the crew, he does so with the only motivation being to find his lost mother by randomly piloting the robot everybody is after. For that reason he dumps his girlfriend and takes part in missions battling monsters he really doesn’t care about with hopes for some clues regarding the whereabouts of his mother to drop out of the sky. Hardly what I call interesting.So basically, the first season had a very dynamic and positive beginning, while the second begins in a dark and depressing way. Although being darker usually means better, in this case they really messed it up in a bad way because it doesn’t try to make you interested in the story. He wants to find his mommy??? Seriously???2. The new characters are completely dullYou would gradually fall in love with the E7 crew but this one in AO feels generic, distant, and moody. It just doesn’t give you any good reason to care for them.- The lead boy, Ao, is always angry and runs away. As much as a pussy Renton, the first hero was, he had to begin from scratch and slowly build his fame and importance to the rest of the crew. Ao on the other hand begins as someone born to be special and awesome, and everybody is after his genetic powers that enable him to pilot the robot. This felt as a very cheap attempt at giving importance to a character who otherwise doesn’t want to do anything. And am I supposed to believe he is more interested in randomly piloting a robot that may or may not lead him to his mother and dumps back at the island the girl that is so crazy over him? What is this sick Oedipus complex? He also has the done-to-death protection syndrome of shounen leads and looks like a girl with green hair. I want to strangle him and those high heels we wears. Faggot!- The other main pilots are not any better. First of all they are all airhead little girls, something that feels retarded next to E7 where you had pilots of all ages. They don’t even take their roles seriously and prefer to surf the net or do karaoke than fight the bad robots. All you basically get is a bunch of stupid lolis and a gay-looking hero; what is this again, a military organization or an ecchi harem? Not only that, but the animators don’t miss the chance to turn them all into underage whores on every step of the way, as you get a whole lot of fan service where they are naked and rubbing it on that faggot of a protagonist. You would respect and cherish the women in the original. All you do with these ones is masturbating twice an episode.- The support characters are all shallow and uninteresting. Why are they in this show anyway? So many teams with so many agendas and none get the basic focus they deserve to become likable to us. They all feel like cardboards.- Even the enemies are faceless robots without personality that hardly have anything to care about next to the human opponents of E7. Not only that but the coral monsters of E7 had a style and identity of their own but these ones in AO look like rip-offs from Neon Genesis. (henceforth NGE).3. Actually, if you think about it the whole show stinks of a NGE rehash.Angry insecure teenage boy with mommy issues, along with other sexy underage girls, protect the world from huge monsters with shady objectives by piloting huge robots. But surely, this is hardly as exciting, not only because the concept is copied a lot by later shows but also because we are not made to care about the characters. I mean I can appreciate how they didn’t go for a rehash of the first season. It is not an adventure, like E7 was, where they randomly travel the world and meet all sorts of challenges along the way. It is a lot more military-based, where they wait in their fancy headquarters for a monster to attack … and then just head there. Boring.4. Late in the story it also becomes a Steins;Gate rip-off.Ok, not S;G in particular but any show with time resets in general. It is a terrible trope that exists to magically undo anything the scriptwriter doesn’t want, and offer an easy way out of every problem without any responsibility or purpose to anything that is happening in the plot. In this case, the whole plot ends up being deleted entirely, so it’s like you are watching a full season worth of crap that never really happened. How rewarding…5. There is no investment to story and charactersRemember how simple both E7 and NGE were in their early episodes? They were slowly adding more people and themes to the story, building up along the way as they flesh out new characters and developments, one thing at a time. Now what is all this mess in AO? We are thrown a hundred characters at our face, all at once, military organizations, some weird independence movement, rebel bases, yakuza, shape shifting aliens, none of which have much to do or say. Seriously, saving the whole world and altering reality on a daily basis in AO feels boring next to the random minor missions of E7. Why? Because it doesn’t focus on its characters! Stuff happen, shit blow up, tears drop and you wonder WHY IS ALL THAT IMPORTANT? When huge cataclysmic events take place, and are thrown to the side in a few minutes like they don’t matter at all, all you can do is reacting with apathy. Everything feels so cynical and rushed, without emotion or motivation, so how are you supposed to sympathize with whatever the hell is going on in here?6. And trust me, you will have a hard time to even understand the plot.Up to the first half you will have no idea what is going on with the politics, no idea when this takes place next to E7, and even no idea what is everybody’s motive. The scenes change almost chaotically from one place to another, you get a hundred people in a dozen places doing world-shaking, yet unimportant plot-wise things, and you almost never have a clear picture of why is everything happening. This is not new to the company who made the show by the way. In case you don’t know the studio BONES style, they always make anime with amazing production values, very good story ideas, very good early episodes … and a shitty storyboard. Seriously, they don’t have a single show that doesn’t fall apart towards the end. They all become cryptic and confusing before ending in a rushed and messy way leaving you mostly disappointed and hollow inside.Yet AO is somewhat of an exception, since it didn’t even wait to get to the second half of the show in order to be like that; it has a very messy storyboard from the very beginning. What’s the matter you guys, up to now you were at least giving us likable characters before you screw up the story, and now you just don’t bother doing not even that? I mean, seriously, what is going on with the weird way you tell the story? You jump from one place to another, mention a hundred things without elaborating on anything, present the plot in a non-linear fashion, throw in dream sequences, and yet you don’t manage to make a single worthy scene? If you are trying to keep your stories mysterious, you are doing a shitty job.7. The villain is OPAnd seriously, after decades of experience you go and make a villain who is so overpowered he can do ANYTHING he likes? An overpowered villain is a lame villain because whatever he does leaves the heroes completely incapable to control anything in the plot. They feel like they are useless and passive, peons working for whatever plans he has in store for them instead of feeling dynamic and inspiring. Seriously, if such a powerful villain ever gets defeated it will only feel like a lame asspull since there is absolutely no way to excuse his defeat.8. Too bent on nostalgiaWhat is even worse is how up to the first part of the story we had nothing to talk about it, other than how it compares to the first season. We just wondered if it’s a sequel or a prequel, or which characters are the descendants of the first crew. We had absolutely nothing to say about the new cast or story because there is NOTHING in it. And even when they later on revealed its relation, it just felt like a pile of BS as it had to do with multiple time travels and alternative realities and a bunch of other horseshit nobody cared about. WHO CARES ABOUT ALL THAT? You threw all those stuff in our face and then expect us to like them without first making us care about the characters. Did you really expect this to work?Of course and they did. Do you know what their major lure from the very first episode was? The characters from the first show! We were literally watching this just for them to appear again and didn’t give a damn about the newer cast. Can you imagine how lame it feels to have a show that can’t stand on its own feet and needs to reuse characters from an earlier show instead of trying to establish newer ones? This is Gundam SEED Destiny all over again. The protagonists of E7 are just support cast in AO yet feel a hundred times cooler exactly because they were likable in the first place. This is so cheap! They just keep everything mysterious in a lame attempt to keep us interested in seeing all this horseshit.9. Lame actionAnd goddammit, if you so much want to have robot action in this show, at least try to make it interesting instead of doing this crap. The battles are rushed and boring next to the fluent motions of E7. They just stay frozen on midair and throw lasers at each other before that hax Truth snaps his fingers and shit happens any way he likes. That’s not fun at all! And it’s always about Ao having absolutely no experience in battle yet manages to best the rest of the elite pilots. He meets and beats all the monster robots on his own and always in the same episode they appear in. And what’s with the shapes these Secrets have? They are terrible compared to the Scrubs. It is all too fast and stupid; make it exciting damn you!10. But nooo; that was apparently too hard to do so they went for retarded fan service instead.Why is there a pink haired loli with a rabbit helmet in this show? Is it supposed to make her cute? SHE IS A DRONE! I want to molest her; not feel sympathy for her. For the same reason, why are there only underage girl pilots in this show? THERE IS NO EXCUSE OTHER THAN OTAKU BAIT! These bitches even cosplay at one point as promotion for a manga that will be based on them. And guess what, their boobs are drawn there ten times bigger than they already are. There are telling straight at your face that this show is for deviant otakus!11. What’s with those god-ugly mascots?That stupid animal with the huge hands and the dumb face is not cute or funny. And neither is that AI program that is supposed to be informing them. Is that circle with a huge nose supposed to be interesting? It is so annoying! Even the characters in this show admit it is. I hate it! I hate everything in this show and it’s not just me; pretty much all the fans of the first share my feelings! And it’s all your fault BONES.12. Fancy visuals mean jack shitSo could you at least be enjoying the show for its very good production values? Not for me, since I was never such a shallow viewer; I care a lot more about good directing and interesting characters, something this show lacks completely. Furthermore, good production values don’t mean much for most viewers anymore. They were a good eye-catcher up until five years ago when the Blu Ray was still new and the DVD quality was still at its peak. But today that doesn’t mean much after so many well made shows came out. Plus who cares who many polygons you get per second if story and characters are shit?13. Improvements my arseDo you know what is even lamer than all that? I am reading how the developers took pointers from lots of things the fans didn't like in the first show as advises for improving the sequel. This is why they went for faster pace, more action, and more fan service. These were literally supposed to make AO better! Better my ass; how are they improvements if they trashed the character appeal? Furthermore nobody was watching E7 just for action or fan service. But no, just like all sequels do, it tried to be flashier and ended up being hollower. Ever heard how less is more? Moral message of the day kids: Don't let the fans tell you how to write a script or you get this mess. The fans are idiots! If you listen to them you will make fanfics full of plot holes and fan catering but never a good sequel. And I know they did the same in Code Geass r2 but even there most of us admit it was just a funny no-brainer and it trashed its interesting themes. So no, bad move there.This show is a complete failure. Stop making sequels to titles that never needed them. You only manage to ruin the good memories.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 2/2 (well-done)Character Figures 0/2 (pussies and sluts)Backgrounds 2/2 (fitting with the feeling of the series)Animation 1/2 (typical)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 7/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 3/4 (not great but fitting with the feeling of the series)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 1/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 0/2 (terrible)Complexity 0/2 (lots of things happen, that lead to absolutely nothing)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (a bloody reset, like nothing really happened)CHARACTER SECTION: 1/10Presence 0/2 (annoying)Personality 1/2 (typical)Backdrop 0/2 (everyone has some but because of the bloody resets, they mean nothing)Development 0/2 (messy)Catharsis 0/2 (messy)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch)Memorability 1/4 (no reason to remember)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 0/1 (terrible character designs, lame action)Sound 1/2 (the music is ok)Story 0/3 (crap all the way)Characters 0/4 (shit all the way)VERDICT: 3/10 had a really bad feeling about this. It screamed like the whole thing would turn into a harem with THAT sort of protagonist and THOSE types of uniforms.I see a pussy boy and two sluts; what do you think the show will be like?And guess what happened as soon as the first episode came out. We were of course right. Here is why.1. It is not inspirationalAllow me to describe my first impressions of each series.E7: The hero is the son of a famous man and has a dull normal life. He hopes to do something important one day. Suddenly a huge robot with a beautiful girl drops in his life. He immediately decides to follow that girl in a life of adventure, with hopes to be as great as his father, as well as winning her heart.AO: The hero is the son of a despised woman and has a simple normal life with no real goals and even a secured childhood friend / platonic girlfriend. Suddenly a weird robot attacks his village and he is running away scared until he is dragged around by some snoopy friends of his to go have a closer look. All accidentally he drops inside a mecha and without having the slightest clue of what he is doing, he beats the evil robot. Then some cute girl appears and tries to befriend him, while trying to explain what happened. He gets angry and walks away since he doesn’t care to find out. Even later when he decides to join the crew, he does so with the only motivation being to find his lost mother by randomly piloting the robot everybody is after. For that reason he dumps his girlfriend and takes part in missions battling monsters he really doesn’t care about with hopes for some clues regarding the whereabouts of his mother to drop out of the sky. Hardly what I call interesting.So basically, the first season had a very dynamic and positive beginning, while the second begins in a dark and depressing way. Although being darker usually means better, in this case they really messed it up in a bad way because it doesn’t try to make you interested in the story. He wants to find his mommy??? Seriously???2. The new characters are completely dullYou would gradually fall in love with the E7 crew but this one in AO feels generic, distant, and moody. It just doesn’t give you any good reason to care for them.- The lead boy, Ao, is always angry and runs away. As much as a pussy Renton, the first hero was, he had to begin from scratch and slowly build his fame and importance to the rest of the crew. Ao on the other hand begins as someone born to be special and awesome, and everybody is after his genetic powers that enable him to pilot the robot. This felt as a very cheap attempt at giving importance to a character who otherwise doesn’t want to do anything. And am I supposed to believe he is more interested in randomly piloting a robot that may or may not lead him to his mother and dumps back at the island the girl that is so crazy over him? What is this sick Oedipus complex? He also has the done-to-death protection syndrome of shounen leads and looks like a girl with green hair. I want to strangle him and those high heels we wears.

Godzilla: S.P,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43229/Godzilla__SP,"[""Well, this is it. Now we wait for season 2.From what I can tell you, this series is better to binge-watch cause they'd hit you with big brain terms that would challenge even Einstein himself.The story is... Well, it's not really bad, but it's not good. Basically this season is a big info-dump.Not really the type I like. I like info-dumps, but if they were done basically all the time, then even I get turned off.Also, the main big in the title only appeared briefly lmaoThe characters also isn't the best thing. They aren't characters, but just plot device that explains the plot for the...viewers.Heck, even the AI themselves have more personalities compared to the actual characters lolThat doesn't really scream good character writing.The animation is really really good. Of course if we separate the different styles. Because of the mishmash of the great CGI of Orange studio and the stylized animation style of Bones studio, both styles are fighting when they are on the same screen at the same time.It really shows how disconnected each style are from another even though separately, both styles are great and worthy of 9/10.But sadly, they just look jarring together in the same screen.The music is great. The OST is good and the op/ed themes are both decent. I don't really have have problems with music from Godzilla franchise. But here, really nothing stands out. But still consistently good.Overall, I probably won't rewatch this series even if season 2 comes.

It certainly is the most intellectual (or pseudo-intellectual depending on your point of view) Godzilla story ever told. That this story is being told through the medium of anime instead of live action should not come as a surprise since there are moments throughout the show that would cost millions in SFX if done live action.I like the characters very much. They are all intelligent and rarely do anything stupid that makes you groan. Some characters who would have been turned into a second rate villain in past Godzilla stories are actually very nuanced and have...reasonable points of view to do what they think is the right thing. The MC's are not superheroes, but just very intelligent characters trying to do their best, as in real life.The anime style is very original. It tries its best to balance between cute and realistic. I think they did a pretty good job.The story is a very interesting original tale, if not a little convoluted. Time travel stories are notoriously hard to keep a track of, and this one is no different. The first half gives you the mystery and is straightforward enough, but the second half gets boggled down by the pseudo-science and at certain points become almost incomprehensible without the MCs giving us an info dump in the way of SMS text messages between the two. Not exactly subtle. Also, let me warn you that the ending is rather abrupt. Not bad, but also not the best.The best thing about this show is that you can tell the creators love the Godzilla (and other Toho monster) franchises. The EP is simply a love letter to all past films and is an absolute joy to try to find every little bit of Easter Egg in it. I've noticed about two dozen immediately, but my understanding is that there are a heck of a lot more.I would absolutely recommend this show. It is fun. It is certainly much better than the last attempt to animate Godzilla. reasonable points of view to do what they think is the right thing.

Those people have misread the show.  Godzilla SP is a goofy, fluffy, and overall fun time. There's classic kaiju running around, rendered in lame-cool CG.  There's a lazy genius guy and an energetic genius girl who shout commands at a cute animated AI to do all the fake deep science for them.  There's a massive cast of fully formed eccentric adult with quirks rather than horny teenager merch objects. And, maybe...most impressive, all eight of sci-fi visual novel plots that usually fucking suck in these shows are here, but they fly past while the AI dog does some goofy sight gag.This show does not give a fuck about handling narrative twists in a certain way nor does it think any of the sci-beats are more important than the character interactions which all kick ass.

This is certainly a Godzilla sci-fi flick at best, through one that tries to inject life into the classic franchise by incorporating a rather lengthy (and much too convoluted) sci-fi angle story that at the end of the day, is stilll centered around Toho\'s now decades-old famous Kaiju IP.Being the latest entry in the slew of Godzilla TV series (and not counting the numerous films that were both hits and misses), the announced show (that is this one: Godzilla: Singular Point) that is exclusively made for Netflix reams around the all-too-familiar big Godzilla Kaiju fights by stacking another sci-fi and technical story...on top of the already co-existing sci-fi Tokusatsu series. I know how much many of you hate the Netflix binging business model of having to release all at one go (as opposed to releasing weekly), but for shows like these that are locked behind the jail that is Netflix Japan, your only choice is to sail the high seas in order to watch this one.The many mixed-media derivatives of Godzilla vary by tone and themes per its source, and in the case of Singular Point, incorporates complex internal mythology (or a ""shared universe"" for the easy-going), because its themes forces you to be highly IQ-centric in order to figure out what is truly going on with not just the resurrection of Godzilla by its unique means to Singular Point, but also the various routes and processes that evolve this story plot from just a foreseeable time-travel experiment that had its shares of shortcomings as starting clues, to one that requires you to be very attentive to the information dished out with the tight pacing within these 13 episodes (well, minus the final episode as per the norm for a closure finish), and the icing on the cake: Godzilla itself as the constant threat that everyone knows all too well (this should be the easiest to understand regardless of your IQ). This is in all parts, a contribution to the show\'s scriptwriting that is handled by Toh EnJoe, being a man that is full of wonders for both science fiction and physics. He helped work episodic scripts for Space Dandy, and also worked together with the late Satoshi Itou at a time when both of their sci-fi novels were getting attention (the former with the highly acclaimed decade-old Genocidal Organ, and the latter with Toh\'s own ""concept album"" Self-Reference ENGINE), and earned the latter the highly prestigous Nihon SF Taisho (or the equivalent of the Nebula Award in the West) for the mediocre-to-decent Shisha no Teikoku a.k.a The Empire of Corpses.To that effect, Godzilla: Singular Point definitely reeks of the immaculate sci-fi handy work of Toh EnJoe, bringing in his literary ""allusional"" fiction works of mathematical motifs that are sprung throughout the series as modern technology and history combine to outdo a common threat, from the core settings to even the episode titles. In case you weren\'t paying attention, all Japanese and English episode titles contain EXACTLY eight characters, and when arranged along the edges of a cube in 3D space, the first and last letters of episode titles intersect at the vertices, spelling the word ""together"". For context, 99% of anime nowadays just lift off episode titles based on their source material\'s counterparts to match similar terms, leaving original anime to be forced to be creative with their episode titles, and this show certainly knows how to deliver that effect as well. Despite being a veteran sci-fi writer for more than a decade, the Average Joes like you and me won\'t see that everything else clicks until the final moments, and that\'s where people will conspicuously feel like they have something missing to the mystery to the make-or-break point of dropping this show when the going gets tough. As a veteran AniManga watcher, I implore you to see through the lines if you\'re hell-bent on enjoying this show, it\'ll take some levels of brain power just to understand what\'s going on while the unique mystery slowly piles up.So then, what exactly is Godzilla: Singular Point all about? As I\'ve surfaced just a moment ago, it\'s modern technology at the forefront, while keeping the historical symbolism of Godzilla central, as with the sprinkling of the different Kaiju from Rodan, Anguirus, Jet Jaguar, Manda, to even Godzilla Aqualitus and Salunga, all hailing from the Showa Era of the franchise. What feels standalone to S.P. is the main characters: two geniuses (Mei Kamino and Yun ""Gintoki look-alike"" Arikawa), both specializing in their different fields (the former is a technological research nut with her Pero 2 machine-cum-A.I. helper, the latter an on-the-ground engineer with the Otaki Company of boss Goro and helpers Haberu Katou and Satomi Kanahara), and from the current issue of a lullaby that springs out classic Godzilla-variant Kaijus, they must work together to prevent a catastrophe from the eventual resulting factor that is Godzilla\'s destroying rampage. Even when operating at different stages, both Mei and Yun know that answers will be hard to come by depending on their unique circumstances, and Toh EnJoe\'s allegory of the mathmetical physics structure only confides the reasoning that while the end result is one big picture, the many smaller puzzle pieces are just set-ups to a whizz-level story that only gets better...if you can consummate piece by piece to arrive at the only resultant circumstance. Again, the keyword being ""together"", both Mei and Yun\'s allies help shape the foundation of the many workaround theories analyzed and scrutinized with their constant conflicting information to see the big picture and eradicate the Singular Point of the show (which is just more than just Godzilla alone). Now that\'s a lot of bludgeoning information to swallow, even when the paths are both linear and non-linear. But trust me, when you are able to see the fractured pieces that slowly come together to form the big picture, then this by a long extent, will only be certified as a good show.Being a Netflix-exclusive show can only mean that production quality will be subpar, but bringing in two of the most prolific studios together for a co-production, this in no doubt, raises expectations from the get-go. You have Orange for the OK-ish tried-and-true 3DCG formula with the Kaiju, while Bones handled basically everything else, and this at least swallows the fact that this show\'s production values will be considered as the decent-to-good mid-tier echelon of Netflix productions. Still though, always keep your expectations in check when shows only have Netflix as its streaming platform.The music is somewhat so-so, I\'d expected a better showing from BiSH because of their song repertoire standards from Black Clover, and the OP here just sounds very mid, and with the Netflix standard of ""Skip Intro"", you can click that button as you so desire and go ahead with the episode contents. On the other hand, I adore Polkadot Stingray\'s music style a lot that\'s experienced from Radiant\'s 1st ED, and the same J-Pop style lingers here for the ED, this is a great song, no doubt at all.It takes a real deal to understand this show, and by all accounts, it is equally taxing on trying to concentrate a lot for this show\'s between-the-lines commentaries while watching this like the average anime nut. Unless you really don\'t care for all the sci-fi in-between, this show is still Godzilla at the heart of it all, and depending on your takes of the amount of Kaiju there is to find for caveats, this would be an entangled mess of an experience.

For the art and sound well it's a mehSo unless you are a HUGE HUGE fan of Godzilla, I don't think you are gonna enjoy it "", ""Godzilla SP has started of as a great example of how to take the main concepts of a famous franchise and both adapting them to a new medium, while similtaneously creating something new with it's own identity.What Godzilla SP does is striking a balance between the japanese historical identity, and the popcultural identity and manages to mix these. Historically Godzilla has been a reflection of the trauma of disaster, of the atomic bombs and in Shin Godzilla the trauma of the tsunami at Fukushima. Godzilla SP has not gone there as of the first 4 episodes, but instead picks at multiple threads, things like traditional...art and myth, mecha and technofetishism, post-war remnants, traditional martial arts, AI and so on. It will be very interesting to see where it goes from here.That's good and all, but how is it as an anime? I'd say it is very good. I really appreciate that it has a high pace; the writing is great imo, it manages to be sharp and concise. Sometimes the dialogue can go by just a little too fast - but I like that breakneck pace. It makes the anime exciting and the episodes feel longer. Especially in situations of danger - it manages to keep the tension high. One of its weaknesses is that it doesn't quite feel scary enough. Even though the tension is well managed, there is little sense of danger as of yet.What I like the most is the writing, it's the nerdy kind of writing that appeals to a trivia nut as me. I love one scene (spoiler for episode 3) were one character has to distract a monster from some people in danger, knowing the mosters are attracted by certain radiofrequencies he has to macguyver a solution using a pet-bottle and an archery bow. The solution isn't realistic, but it makes sense and I love it! (end spoiler)The main characters are two nerds, but they're not your typical stereotypical annoying nerds, these are misfits because they are laser-focused and thus are somewhat detached from everyday life. I recognize myself in them, and I think they feel believable, albeit not realistic. The rest of the cast are varied and I can't say that there is any character I dislike. I even found myself loving the really serious business-like kohai at the radio institute.Music and voice acting is great. The Soundtrack was a pleasant surprise, I think it is really well scored and powerful.Animation and art is top notch. I love the use of colours, it's very effective and vibrant without becoming cartoonish. It has maroon linework wich looks great and makes the image feel a lot warmer. Character design and aesthetics are well done the characters all look great and some really goofy. They have a lot of CGI, but the processing of it uses some techniques that makes it blend almost seamlessly into the non-cgi animation. It looks really good.All in all, this is a very entertaining, well-produced anime, with spot-on writing that definitly could be one of the best animes this season, or maybe even year. If it nails the rest and the ending I'll give it an 8 instead of a 7. art and myth, mecha and technofetishism, post-war remnants, traditional martial arts, AI and so on.

The monster designs are not poor, but aren't anything special either, the most interesting being the anguirus fights so far.The characters aren't cut and paste, but aren't that interesting either. The main female and male cast are interesting, their designs aren't bad...either but they lack depth beyond the first two episodes. The main sin is the collective side cast. Characters like gorou are very loud and annoying, their voice actor mainly just screaming 90% of the time they are actually speaking.The sound is the only redeeming quality of the show, mainly in intro is amazing; BiSH showing their talent with this intro among others like black clover, god eater and the final season of fairy tail to name a few. The monster sounds are good as well, along with the main MCs voice actors doing a decent job. The only very strikingly bad voice actor with be the previously mention gorou.Overall unless they are saving the excitement for Godzilla's entrance (which again hasn't happened yet half way through the anime) I don't expect this to be much more than a 4-5 which is a shame since monster animes are relatively uncommon in the age of isekai and fantasy / adventure animes. either but they lack depth beyond the first two episodes.

so maybe my English is not very good and besides, THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)first, it\'s worth remembering that it\'s an original work, so everything that will be seen is very mysterious, something that makes me curious to see how the work will be developed, but let\'s start talking about the story, until episode 4 (episode I\'m in at the moment ) I found the story very different, taking the theme of kaijus and godzila as its main focus and remodeling it in a very interesting way, but at the same time confused, I don\'t know if I\'m slow or this...work is really confused in some points, not necessarily holes in the script but rather a complicated language for lay people in the subjects dealt with in the anime, however, the work has trapped me so far and I will quote things that caught my attention.Art: the art of this anime is really something to be emphasized, because the design of the characters are extremely beautiful (including the creator of steel in the exorcist is directing the character design part, because of that there is similarity in the art of the two works) and it caught my attention, even with the 3D used in ""kaijus"" (I don\'t know if I can call them that) something that for me doesn\'t bother me much if used correctly.Sound: I have nothing to complain about the sound of the anime, at no time did I feel a bad quality and the dubbing is also great, the sound of the creatures used is also great then nothing to complain about the sound.Characters: ok, we got to a strange point in the anime, the characters don\'t have a lot of screen time and few are being developed (apart from kamino) something that strangely isn\'t bothering me in this anime, because I think your plot is not based on developing all the characters there, none of them proved to be profound or anything like that, I believe that the role of the characters there is to interconnect everything to be able to reach the apex point of the story, in my view and that, apart from that I liked some characters including Pero 2 because he is very cute and funny.now to complete, i will talk in general what i feel in the work, as i already said i believe that all the events even if each one is very different from each other, will interconnect to have that turnaround or something, apart from that the work is providing me a good time because it is an anime that caught my attention for being a science fiction kind of strange but that seems to have potential.So I believe in the potential of anime but so far I haven\'t found anything very revolutionary so I\'ll see what it still has to offer work is really confused in some points, not necessarily holes in the script but rather a complicated language for lay people in the subjects dealt with in the anime,

It doesn't nearly redeem the rest of the episodes but dam it really is fantastic. I truly believe season 2 can be an entirely different experience and it potentially can redeem this one. Imo they have set up an incredible story-line. I really hope season 2 will actually happen. This is one of the few things Im genuinely worried about it getting a sequel since its an original.

GIVEImpressive backgrounds?....Catchy soundtrack?Good art and animation?One of the best CGI's I've seen in the anime industry?Okay I'm hookedI could list alot more stuff that got me really pumped for this. There simply was no reason for me not to get very hyped for this.I even praised it and recommend it for my fellow weeb friends and I even claimed that it will be the dark horse of this season. But episode after another this show just drained me.To put it plainly. This show is very unfun and boring to watch. You get tired very quickly watching it. 70-80% of every single episode is spent on explaining something. They spend most of the time explaining every piece of information thrown at you, whether important or not. They push the unnecessary information down your throat. The first 2-3 episodes were very eventful which deceived me into thinking this anime is something that is actually the complete opposite of it.It's almost as if the writers thought the viewers wanted an extra course to study! Ha! Even worse. This show is a thousand times more boring than anything I've studied in both college and school. I'm not even kidding.But wait! This isnt even the worst part about it. Not only that there is nothing but pointless dialouge. But it's also very hard to grasp! When the plot is extremely complicated with that much dialouge, paired with an unorthodox English vocabulary, I find myself on Google translate more often than you think. Since there isn't any official translations offered for this show in my first and second language I have no choice but watch it in my third one.Godzilla Singular Point requires so much brain power that I really find it hard to watch any other episodes in the same day as I watch it. I swear I'm not even exaggerating!!Anime is something I watch in my precious limited Leisure time. And it is supposed to be fun! But this show isnt!!!!I made the mistake of watching godzilla s.p episodes on release, but you don't have to. If you are planning to watch this or if you haven't watched it yet do yourself a favor and skip it. But if you are really curious and interested in it then I'd suggest watching one episode every 20 days or something. I'm not even kidding. In my opinion that would be the best way of consuming godzilla s.pIncase you are interested in my rating using the Mal review approach/criteria here it is  :Story 7 art and animation 7  sound 6 character 6 enjoyment 1 overall 3In short : the show took a very incorrect approach. what seemed very intriguing at first glance turned out to be a snore fest. review is posted by the time 12 episodes are aired of the show but I'm not gonna wait until the final episode is aired because I doubt my opinion will change.

It looks good and was clearly directed with a relatively strong sense of how to visually present a story with some verve.But, oh Lord is the writing horrifically bad, and in the end, no director can cover for dialogue this dreadful.Godzilla S.P. is plagued by too many characters, too much pointless talking, and far too little Godzilla and friends.I’m not sure the endless rambling of virtually every character who receives any significant screen time is best described as pretentious, or...merely inane, but whether spouting literary or philosophical references or just a word salad of incomprehensible technobabble, the criminally bad dialogue in this show proves that the only monster really needing to be stopped is the guy who wrote this garbage.The writer clearly believed that taking the subtext of the traditional Godzilla story and trying to explain it in great detail using pseudoscience stuffed into the mouths of the characters would be a good addition to the canon.

Godzilla: S.P is one of the best because it just tries to be good, not one of the best.

It genuinely baffles me. The ""characters"" are just there to serve the plot or look cool/cute (which none of them manage to do.) The cgi was fine for godzilla and JJ, but everything else was garbage. There\'s this one seen in the last episode where one of the monsters swings down this rope thing and holy, it looked like it belonged in 2002 not 2021. The story was boring, I ended up skipping through most of it on my first attempt watching and watching on 2x speed my next. Even...the episodes I did watch in the normal speed (first three) I can\'t remember anything from. The story\'s pacing was really weird. Like end of the world could be happening but the mc\'s would just be wandering around fighting some random monster or looking for clues. Honestly I still don\'t understand the mystery aspect, but it could be because I was just too bored to pay attention to it. I think the show gets most of its mileage from nostalgia baiting and pretending to be Shin Godzilla, which I guess worked alright for them.

I watched this with my brain off but the visuals are engaging it really brings you to start thinking about the dialogue gradually. The visuals also helped make those high concept science very accessible, and in a puzzle-like manner. That being said, even without trying to understand what they\'re saying, the ""actions"" (not necessarily literal battles) in the animation alone is enough to keep the brain entertained.On a side note, I love the radio song in the first episode; sets the overall tone of the show: a slow, steady march to a climatic end.The art direction is quite interesting; with the script being a combination of heavy science mixed with a historical, almost religious old lore of Godzilla, this indication of change can also be seen by the Meiji period-like color palette. In a way, it reminds me of Samurai Champloo, where they combined modern pop beats with historical samurai setting to create a refreshing new take on an over-explored theme.In regards to the CGI, the bird blended in pretty nicely, but some other creatures do feel a bit iffy and out of place. Not a huge deal though; didn\'t ruin my immersion personally.If I were to parallel the fun I had watching this show, it would be like watching Mairimashita Iruma-kun and Dorohedoro. Overall, it\'s a pleasant watch. Went in with the expectation to sit back and enjoy, and the show delivered just that for me. interested in the Godzilla franchise (aka me).But also it\'s not boring science; the science is paired with fun, easily consumable visuals.

Most of the show was intellectuals talking about concepts that went way over my head, like what the fart is a singular point. On top of this, the classic Godzilla monsters in this show were portrayed poorly. Rodan, Anguirus, and all of the other monsters were highly undersized and underwhelming. Even Godzilla himself had a ugly new depiction, which was disappointing.I came to watch Godzilla wallop on iconic kaiju not whatever this show was. "", ""Today I'll be giving my thoughts on Netflix's second attempt at a Godzilla anime, Godzilla: Singular Point. This show is an utter mess, and I'll get into why in this review. Let's get into specifics.Story: 1This category is where most of the issues with this anime lie. To be blunt, this is probably the most confusing piece of entertainment I've ever witnessed. I'm convinced you need to have an exponentially high IQ in order to comprehend what's going on. The reason this show is so confusing is the piles of techno-babble words used in every episode. Your average viewer won't have much of an idea...what many of the terms used mean, let alone how to apply them in the context of the story. In broad terms, said story revolves around the appearance of strange & dangerous monsters around the world and how they could bring an end to the world as the characters know it. In more specific terms, the show involves ideas of dimensions unseen, events that shouldn't be theoretically possible but happen by means of said unseen dimensions, predictions from decades past, electromagnetic waves, an element that requires questioning the fabric of reality to rationalize, and much more. If those concepts alone are too much to wrap you're head around, I wouldn't exactly blame you, as I can barely understand them myself. Because of all this, the pacing of this show feels like one one a minigun, firing on all cylinders with no let up to gauge what exactly is happening. The nature of this show also creates a conflict of interest, as the nigh-incomprehensible concepts create a lack of interest while the rapid-fire pacing makes not missing even a single line of dialogue a priority. Also, I find it hilarious that this show has a post-credit scene in the last episode as a form of sequel bait, as if anyone who watched this would want more.Art: 6The animation of this show is, without a shadow of a doubt, its best aspect. Unlike Netflix's previous attempt at a Godzilla anime, this show is very vibrant and lively in its presentation. However, that can come to be a fault at times, as the color red will take over the screen in some scenes. Also unlike the previous work, the human characters are all hand-drawn rather than CG. This leads to the characters moving fluidly, as one would expect. However, not everything in this show is animated in the traditional sense, as all of the monsters and the robot, Jet Jaguar, are computer-generated. This CG isn't too bad, but everything animated like this moves a bit more janky and at a lower frame rate compared to the hand-drawn parts. The opening is very aesthetically pleasing and cool. I can't speak for the ending, as I never watch it since Netflix automatically starts the next episode a few seconds after it starts.Sound: 6There isn't really much to say about this category. The sound effects sound as you'd expect them to, but they don't sound spectacular by any means. The monsters' roars also sound fine, but many of them I believe are recycled from previous, undoubtedly much better Godzilla works by Toho, including the titular kaiju. What elevates the sound from average to fair is the awesome opening, in case... by BiSH. It's very upbeat and catchy, just overall a good song. I have no opinion on the ending song, Aoi (青い) by POLKADOT STINGRAY, since, as previously mentioned, I never stay for the ending. The voice acting is also good but unremarkable. All of the voices fit the characters good enough.Character: 2The characters in this show really aren't that great. They have little to no development as people and act more as vessels to drive the story forward than human beings with their own personalities and feelings. The closest this show gets to giving any character any semblance of development is having one of the characters have a daughter. Other than that, this is really the bottom of the barrel in terms of development. At least the characters the audience is supposed to like are likable throughout the duration of the show and vice versa.Enjoyment: 2This anime started off decently enjoyable to watch at first, but then completely fell off the wagon with all the pseudo-philosophical jargon that bashes the audience over the head in every episode. Once the show becomes as confusing as it'll stay for the majority of its run time, it becomes an exercise of patience. You'll hope that the topics juggled around in this show will eventually attain a suitable level of comprehensiveness, but, if anything, the show just gets more complicated as it trudges on. By the end, the only facet of enjoyment that is salvageable from this mess is the cool kaiju and the havoc they cause. After all, it's pretty hard to mess up something as easy as a cool monster fight, at least in concept. But even then, Godzilla doesn't even show up until the show is halfway through and doesn't make as many appearances as I assume audiences would like from their piece of Godzilla media.Overall: 2Despite very occasional redeeming factors, Godzilla: Singular Point is an utter trainwreck of kaiju-sized proportions. Characters are pathetically lacking in development, animation and sound are generally nothing to write home about, and, above all else, the story and the interactions that encompass it would even throw the heads of the likes of Stephen Hawking and Thomas Edison into a tailspin. For the second time, Netflix has tried and spectacularly failed at delivering a Godzilla story worth the time and mental effort of fans via making them unnecessarily complicated and multi-layered. There's only so much that needs to be done in order to make a Godzilla work enjoyable and Netflix has twice now gone above and beyond to a fault. I cannot, within any realm of my sanity, recommend this anime to anyone that values their time or appreciates a show they can fully understand. If anyone is daring enough to brave the choppy waters of this anime, it is available exclusively on Netflix. what many of the terms used mean, let alone how to apply them in the context of the story.

It\'s not bad per say, it just went in a few strange directions that did the plot no favors. Let me start with the things that were enjoyable!All of the kaiju are 3D animated but despite the style being different from everything else in the show, it wasn\'t distracting. Somehow the deafferenting art styles meshed really well together and they felt like they were apart of the environment surrounding them. Also, the series focuses on the experiences of everyday people trying to cope with these monsters as well as scientists and doctors struggling to...find the answers. It\'s nice to see a Godzilla type story not focus solely on the military. Also, the song that plays on repeat, ""Alapu Upala"", is a banger.However, there are choices that made this series feel really bland and confusing at times. There\'s a weird robot/Gundam side-plot with Jet Jaguar that\'s honestly distracting when it pops up. The fights between Jet Jaguar and the kaiju are super boring and it feels like nothing is actually happening when we\'re in those parts. The character is only enjoyable twice in the entire series: once when Yung becomes it (which loses its charm the very next episode), and in the very final episode. These parts could have been altered or even scrapped to make more explanation for science that\'s being talked about. It\'s not super complex but its enough to where to someone has to wait til protagonists reach the answer to fully understand what\'s being said the entire time. You\'re not figuring out what\'s happening along with the characters and that\'s half the fun sometimes! find the answers. It\'s nice to see a Godzilla type story not focus solely on the military.

I thought it was one of the best parts of the anime. I liked how all the characters looked and all the colors they used to animate the anime looked. Even though I'm not a big fan of CGI in anime it didn't look that bad this time. The only problem I had with the CGI was how Godzilla looked, I mean all the other kaiju didn't look like their...MonsterVerse counterparts. I'm a pretty big fan of the Godzilla movies so it looked weird to me how Godzilla and all the other kaiju looked.So next up the characters, all of them were pretty good. My favorite probably was Pelops II, Pelops was a pretty big part of the story, I mean he was the answer to saving the world at the end and altogether Pelops was a great character. The main characters were pretty good too, I liked Mei the most out of the two of them, I think she was more relevant for the story than Yun.When I always saw Haberu on the screen I thought of Captain Oubi from Fire Force, he really looked like him and what's the deal with Tilda, like why are her eyes black, she looks like a alien, although the wiki says she's human, I just thought she looked weird.So, the story was pretty different from other Godzilla films. The funny thing is that the anime is called Godzilla S.P, but Godzilla wasn't a really big part of the story. He just showed up in episode 9 (I think), went in to the city, destroyed it for a bit and then just went to sleep. Like the Rodans were a bigger part of the story than the king of monsters himself. At the end Godzilla just got defeated by Jet Jaguar in a few minutes. They could of done so much more with Godzilla, but he just afked in the center of the city and didn't really do much. Like I said in the beginning the stroy was pretty different from other Godzilla stories so the rest was good, I liked it. Tbh the ending wasn't really that good. All of the build up to finding the code for the bomb, just not to use it. I mean I guess they did use it in a way considering that Jet Jaguar was the the thing that killed Godzilla, but yhea, I think they could of done something other than one-tapping Godzilla and saving the world like that.I think you should watch the anime all in one go, because at some parts it started to get kind of boring, I even thought of dropping it, but I powered trough it. It really is one of those anime that you watch when you don't have anything else to watch. Or you just want to watch it because you're a Godzilla fan, like me.Well this review got kind of lengthier that I wanted it to be, but that's okay because I've said everything I wanted.So, I would rate the story a 7/10, the art a 8/10, the characters a 7/10 and enjoyment a 6/10, so overall a 6/10.Thanks for reading, check out my profile and leave a comment or something.

At the end Godzilla just got defeated by Jet Jaguar in a few minutes. They could of done so much more with Godzilla, but he just afked in the center of the city and didn't really do much. Like I said in the beginning the stroy was pretty different from other Godzilla stories so the rest was good, I liked it. Tbh the ending wasn't really that good. All of the build up to finding the code for the bomb, just not to use it. I mean I guess they did use it in a way considering that Jet Jaguar was the the thing that killed Godzilla, but yhea, I think they could of done something other than one-tapping Godzilla and saving the world like that.I think you should watch the anime all in one go, because at some parts it started to get kind of boring, I even thought of dropping it, but I powered trough it. It really is one of those anime that you watch when you don't have anything else to watch. Or you just want to watch it because you're a Godzilla fan, like me.Well this review got kind of lengthier that I wanted it to be, but that's okay because I've said everything I wanted.So, I would rate the story a 7/10, the art a 8/10, the characters a 7/10 and enjoyment a 6/10, so overall a 6/10.Thanks for reading, check out my profile and leave a comment or something."", ""While this series is far from the worst story to feature the titular kaiju, it might be the most frustrating one for kaiju fans to watch.What's the main thing you want from a Godzilla story?  If your answer is Godzilla, Singular Point will frustrate you.  Not since Final Wars have I seen a Godzilla story that seems to so heavily resent the need for Godzilla to be in it.  Now I'm not saying he needs to be in every scene, or even every episode, since some of my favourites like Invasion of Astro-Monster and Shin Godzilla are among those where he has...the least screen time, but there are limits.  He doesn't show up until halfway through this 13-episode series, and has (at a guess) maybe five minutes of screen time in total, most of which has him almost completely hidden in a cloud of red dust.  Even this wouldn't be so bad if he was having a tangible effect on the story the rest of the time, as in Shin Godzilla, but he's only tangentially related to the impending wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey disaster that the characters spend the whole series worrying about.  You could remove Godzilla from this series altogether, and barely impact the plot at all.So what's the main thing you want from a Godzilla story?  If your answer is giant monsters, Singular Point will frustrate you.  When a Godzilla story doesn't have much Godzilla, it's usually because of budget constraints, but that clearly isn't a problem here, since Singular Point has extensive monster action scenes in almost every episode.  You'll notice I only said monster, not giant monster.  For some reason, the decision was made to shrink some of Toho's most famous kaiju down to the size of the dinosaurs that inspired their designs, and instead feature copy/pasted swarms of them.  So we have Rodans the size of pterodactyls (ie. the car-sized ones, not the airliner-sized pteranodons), and so on.  I'm sure the staff followed the same logic as Roland Emmerich when he switched to baby Godzillas for half of his lambasted 1998 movie: having monsters that can interact with the characters more directly.  The problem in both cases is that this causes a genre shift; it's no longer kaiju, it's an animal-on-the-loose story.  Now, as animal-on-the-loose stories go, this one presents enough action to be a good stand-in for Jurassic World 3; it just fails to fulfil the narrative promises implied by the Godzilla title.So what's the main thing you want from a Godzilla story?  If it's endless dry exposition and techno-babble, Singular Point has you covered.  This show just never stops explaining its convoluted 13-dimensional gibberish, which makes up the majority of the dialogue.  Even the brief final battle against Godzilla is overlayed with yet more exposition; they simply will not shut up.  There's an okay mystery at the heart of it all, but the eye-wateringly complex jargon feels like smoke and mirrors to distract the viewer from how much of the plot relies on deus ex machina.So what kind of Godzilla story is this?  It's not, basically.  It's an exposition-heavy sci-fi mystery with a lot of pretty good dinosaur action scenes, but precious little in the way of kaiju.  If you're okay with that, it might just scrape a 7/10 for you, but I watch kaiju stories to see giant monsters knocking cities down, so for me it's:6/10 the least screen time, but there are limits.

I will talk about the main 'scientific idea' behind the plot, and how it is badly implemented. Then a few words about the characters.Wikipedia says that the author did a physics degree. The whole plot revolves around a special compound, 'archetype', that allows light from the future to travel to the present. Large portions of the episodes so far are dedicated to explaining the fantastical characteristics of this compound. A shame that the science-talk is almost irrelevant to the story.The concept of the compound itself is not obviously impossible. But, on its...own, it would not make an interesting story. The plot needs that light coming from the future through the 'archetype' conveys information about the future. And from this, in virtue of their relation with the 'archetype', the kaiju are given the ability to foresee attacks. How the 'archetype' gives us any information about the future is never explained. Given that almost half the screen time is taken up by explanation of 'science' behind it all, it is hugely dissatisfying to not be given the most important part of the narrative. If the author has no way of explaining the future sight in the first place, it would have been best not to spend so much time discussing the pseudo-science. Simply asserting that kaijus see the future is much better than writing convoluted conversations that do not give much relevant information.Now this is not a criticism of the idea behind the story. On the contrary, I think the play with time adds great spice to Godzilla, elevating it beyond just a kaiju show. I'm taking issue with the execution. It's a simple choice: either give some complete, coherent scientific picture in simple terms, or simply assume the effects of seeing the future, and do great things with it. For now, the show has not done either. The time spent on dialogues took away chances for the show to go to strange places with the idea, while the dialogue themselves do not give a satisfying picture.An aside. The show has the interesting idea of building a super computer that spits out the output instantly by acquiring information from the future, through the 'archetype'. But, it is then ruined with the plot requirement that it cannot solve certain things due to there being an Armageddon in the future. In episode 9, finally, some character suggested that one can loop the calculations before the Armageddon. It is unthinkable that, with some characters being professors, no one understood that if information from the future is at all possible, any algorithm can be completed (almost) instantly. One can do this by looping: look 30 seconds ahead, carry on from that information, and look 30 seconds ahead again... This is completely analogous to the author's description of how light is amplified by the 'archetype'. All the more mysterious that the characters had no clue earlier. But, this is an aside, I am fine with this kind of plot holes.There is a bigger problem than genius characters not actually being geniuses: their portrayal. The author decides that characters have to think slow enough for the audience to follow, but at the same time portrayed as extraordinary. This is just does not work: it ends up with the characters dropping jargon all over the place, while only demonstrating reasoning skills that are at best ordinary. Such characters are, to me at least, nothing but annoying. And the time they spend babbling on about the pseudo-science just robs them of any character development. (Contrary to when I first saw the character art, I now feel glad that Arikawa Yun is not voiced by Sugita-san.)All in all, the show could have gone to great places with this nice concept, but the author's attempt to science-up the show has achieved little beyond taking up time.

But what I like about this, the story, as of episode 10 we've been greeted with a great story here. But it's a lot of science so I understand if others are not as easily interested in that aspect. But this is what makes this Godzilla adaptation so much more impressive. That they can elaborate and explain to use all this science stuff which at least for me makes absolute sense. Yes there are elements of the unknown, but justified.So...that is the story, a lot of talking and you have to be a fast reader for the subtitles. The art and sound are good, nothing too striking. Bad CGI monsters but it strangely works. Character development is lacking the most, they are mainly there for the exposition so you don't get to deep into them. Nothing revolutionary at least.But my enjoyment is what counts the most here and with the latest episode I have gotten hyped. All around the anime is what you'd expect, but a lot of hard to understand concepts which may deter some. But if you understand all of that, it makes the show far more enjoyable and makes a lot of sense if you have a understanding of Quantum Mechanics. I would suggest this if you enjoyed Steins; Gate.

If you like science-y confusing stories with lots of terminology being thrown at your face, then chances are, you\'ll like this one.With that said, I can get into Godzilla: S.P\'s strengths.  First of all, the soundtrack is...as good as ever. Aside from the FANTASTIC classic pieces from the original Godzilla series of movies, the opening song (""in case..."" by BiSH) is an absolute banger, and the ominous yet enchanting ""Alapu Upala"" sung by Annette Phillip is a delight every time it appears. Second, I\'d like to mention the art and animation. As some people know, Studio Bones is a studio with an outstanding track record. I must say, that the unique art style of Godzilla S.P. feels right at home with the other animes on that list. Furthermore, the collaboration with Studio Orange is an excellent fit. Fantastic CGI as always from them.Now we can start with the negatives, starting with the characters. I had high hopes for this aspect of the show. All of the characters have very charming designs and are very unique to each other. I just find it a shame that none of them displayed any form of personality. The two main characters are mainly there to just explain what\'s going on and ask questions to the supporting cast. Their only redeeming personality traits are being smart. Though, I suppose no personality is better than the pseudo, fake personalities from the Western movies. At the very least, they\'re not annoying, just a little bit lifeless.My other problem with this anime is the ending. I won\'t discuss exactly what happens, but if you\'re worried about getting spoiled anyway, just skip to the next paragraph. In short, I kind of just feel let down by the ending. What they did was cool, but I can\'t help but consider it a deus ex machina. It kind of came out of nowhere, and for some reason it tied up all of the loose ends despite only being hinted at in a short line of dialogue that no one would expect to be significant.Anyway my verdict is, if you like complicated science-y stuff, then this is the show for you. Don\'t expect any character depth, but if you pay attention you\'ll probably be hooked by the mystery aspect of the show. Would not recommend for people who want to see a lot of fighting. This anime is extremely dialogue heavy, so try not to watch it if you\'re short on sleep. I liked it though. It was definitely a pleasant surprise for me. as good as ever.

It originally seemed so interesting and fresh, with a new set of Kaiju designs and an overall greater emphasis on new ideas. So what could go wrong? Everything, that\'s what. Let\'s start with:CHARACTERSThe characters in Godzilla S.P. are so utterly bland that it hurts, which is a serious problem considering the fact that we spend so much time with them. To make a bad situation worse, there are also approximately 10,000,000 characters to follow at any given time. Seriously, by the time the season\'s mid-point rolled around I was getting a headache just trying...to remember who was doing what. Again, the insane amount of characters could work if they were interesting, but everything about S.P.\'s characters just screams unremarkable. I seriously can\'t name a single person in this show, all I can do is vaguely describe their role and what I hate about them.STORYThe story of Godzilla S.P. is some of the most convoluted garbage to ever come out of the Godzilla franchise, which is saying a LOT. Basically, the story revolves around a piece of music that seems to be attracting Kaiju. Oh, and also there\'s a bunch of useless time-travel crap that doesn\'t contribute anything, and there are also a billion characters running around trying to solve inane Kaiju related mysteries for their own stupid reasons, and how could you forget about the professor guy who is dead, but actually not dead. I DEFINITELY didn\'t forget about his existence until he randomly shows up in the last episode. But if the story is too straightforward for you, don\'t worry, because there\'s also a bunch of ridiculous technobabble that\'ll be sure to either annoy or confuse you. I swear, if I have to hear the stupid purple haired girl say ""Orthogonal Diagonalizer"" one more time I\'m actually gonna scream.ARTAlright, let\'s take a little negativity break and talk about something I actually did enjoy: the art. The overall style of the show is very visually pleasing, and everything and everyone is very well drawn (although I utterly despise this show\'s character design). I was also worried that the CGI Kaiju wouldn\'t look very good, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they actually blended pretty nicely with the 2D art. Speaking of Kaiju...KAIJUI have very mixed feelings about Godzilla S.P.\'s Kaiju. On one hand, the redesigned Toho Kaiju are really cool and breathe a lot of life into the characters, but on the other hand, way too much time is spent on certain Kaiju, specifically on Rodan. Like, Rodan is a cool Kaiju and all, but did we really need to spend half of the darn show focusing on an utterly uninteresting hoard of mini-Rodan? Even when other Kaiju show up, they barely get anything memorable or interesting to do. Sure, Anguirus gets a pretty cool fight with Jet Jaguar (more about that later), but it feels like Manda, Kumonga, and even Godzilla himself don\'t really get that much spotlight. This shafting of classic Kaiju makes the inclusion of the new Kaiju even more embarassing, as it takes way too much time off of the Kaiju people actually care about. Speaking of new Kaiju, there are four Kaiju that S.P. introduces, those being Salunga, Kamanga, Hanenga, and Zenbunga. Kamanga, Hanenga, and Zebunga are extremely boring copy-and-pastes of Kumonga who don\'t really do anything of note, while Salunga is a Kaiju with an interesting concept, but an ultimately useless role in the story. But there is one Kaiju I haven\'t really mentioned yet, that being...JET JAGUARThat\'s right baby, Jet Jaguar is getting his own section because he\'s the only part of the show I genuinely enjoyed! It was fantastic seeing Jet Jaguar get treated like a major player against the other Kaiju, and I was always excited to see him on-screen. He\'s also tied to the only human character that I actually liked, that being the old man who created him. Not only was the old man the closest thing to an interesting character, but he was also voiced by a certain Buggy D. Clown, who\'s always a treat to hear. Seriously, Jet Jaguar\'s inclusion ALONE bumps this show up from a 3 to a 4.MUSICI don\'t really have a lot to say about the music, it\'s just kind of there. The OST is nothing special and the opening was kind of neat. I did really like the ending, although I hated how it basically teased me by showing tons of Toho\'s classic Kaiju in super faithful anime designs, only for those Kaiju to never even be shown in the actual anime.CONCLUSIONThis show freakin\' sucks, look up the Jet Jaguar scenes on YouTube and skip the rest. to remember who was doing what.

The overall style of the show is very visually pleasing, and everything and everyone is very well drawn (although I utterly despise this show\'s character design). I was also worried that the CGI Kaiju wouldn\'t look very good, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they actually blended pretty nicely with the 2D art. Speaking of Kaiju...KAIJUI have very mixed feelings about Godzilla S.P.\'s Kaiju. On one hand, the redesigned Toho Kaiju are really cool and breathe a lot of life into the characters, but on the other hand, way too much time is spent on certain Kaiju, specifically on Rodan. Like, Rodan is a cool Kaiju and all, but did we really need to spend half of the darn show focusing on an utterly uninteresting hoard of mini-Rodan? Even when other Kaiju show up, they barely get anything memorable or interesting to do. Sure, Anguirus gets a pretty cool fight with Jet Jaguar (more about that later), but it feels like Manda, Kumonga, and even Godzilla himself don\'t really get that much spotlight. This shafting of classic Kaiju makes the inclusion of the new Kaiju even more embarassing, as it takes way too much time off of the Kaiju people actually care about. Speaking of new Kaiju, there are four Kaiju that S.P. introduces, those being Salunga, Kamanga, Hanenga, and Zenbunga. Kamanga, Hanenga, and Zebunga are extremely boring copy-and-pastes of Kumonga who don\'t really do anything of note, while Salunga is a Kaiju with an interesting concept, but an ultimately useless role in the story. But there is one Kaiju I haven\'t really mentioned yet, that being...JET JAGUARThat\'s right baby, Jet Jaguar is getting his own section because he\'s the only part of the show I genuinely enjoyed! It was fantastic seeing Jet Jaguar get treated like a major player against the other Kaiju, and I was always excited to see him on-screen. He\'s also tied to the only human character that I actually liked, that being the old man who created him. Not only was the old man the closest thing to an interesting character, but he was also voiced by a certain Buggy D. Clown, who\'s always a treat to hear. Seriously, Jet Jaguar\'s inclusion ALONE bumps this show up from a 3 to a 4.MUSICI don\'t really have a lot to say about the music, it\'s just kind of there. The OST is nothing special and the opening was kind of neat. I did really like the ending, although I hated how it basically teased me by showing tons of Toho\'s classic Kaiju in super faithful anime designs, only for those Kaiju to never even be shown in the actual anime.CONCLUSIONThis show freakin\' sucks, look up the Jet Jaguar scenes on YouTube and skip the rest.', '--NO MAJOR SPOILERS are in this review—Aight, I’m just gonna do a short review, more general thoughts for this one. No fancy writing, more of a just collection of thoughts.Godzilla S.P. was solidly good. I really like the story, even if I didn’t understand 90% of the sci-fi jargon thrown at me. I never really felt like I had to though, I think the show gives a good enough idea of what’s going on to follow it. Actually if anything, the conversations and dialogue in this anime feel very different and unique. It’s very much a massive info dump and that’s def not for everyone,...but it does make for a rather enjoyable experience for me personally. The kaiju/mecha action while not as common, was also very fun and fairly well executed.Characters don’t really have depth, and are mostly there to keep the plot moving. I really would’ve liked to at least see some more…idk subtle characteristics of the main cast’s personalities I guess? It just feels weird to say that the best character in the show might be the gosh darned AI dog and Jet Jaguar itself. The cast is alright overall, but certainly could’ve been better.2d animation is gorgeous, and it’s very visually appealing to watch. Character designs are great and colorful, without feeling too out of place in this semi realistic world. 3d cgi is def rough, but it’s kinda…weirdly charming? In a way, it sorta calls back to the same charm of the cheesy, old live action movies. I didn’t find it taking me out of the experience like other cgi heavy shows have. Jet Jaguar in general actually looks fairly good, and gets some amazing moments throughout the show.Music was great as always with Godzilla, and I quite liked the OP and ED. Sound design is satisfying, and hits the right notes. Voice acting was good, I have no complaints there.Overall, quite enjoyed this show. It’s nothing great, but an enjoyable enough watch for any Godzilla fan. Would also rec, if you’re into heavy into sci-fi. Good 7.5/10 show. but it does make for a rather enjoyable experience for me personally.

Good 7.5/10 show.', 'This series started extremely promising with the first few episodes, with a completely different approach and story-line that is radically different from previous Godzilla works.There are a mixture of both mystery, suspense and plenty of scientific jargon that will make sci-fi fans very happy.Animation is pretty good also using a pretty retro and abstract style to give the series a more retro feel.The first 6 to 7 episodes are pretty good, slowly building up the suspense with many technical elements mixed into the story. The plot also seemed pretty good and deep for the first half of the anime series.However things started to...nosedive though the later part of the series. The thing that is very turn off for me is that how godzilla came to be is extremely similar to Shin Godzilla the movie. It just felt to me that the writers felt lazy for the second half of the series.The story was getting too complicated with so many technical jargon that one have to re-watch many conversation scenes just to understand what they are talking about.The major disappointment was that the anime title was titled ""Godzilla Sp"" but Godzilla only appeared for pretty brief moments in the entire anime towards the final few episodes.And the ending is obviously extremely rushed and just destroyed whatever satisfaction there is and the point of watching the entire anime.Overall I find that this anime\'s potential is terribly wasted because they tried to squeeze in too much stuff over 13 episodes. An extremely disappointing ending ruined the entire series. nosedive though the later part of the series.

That isn't true they just expected humans to fight monsters with no explanation of when, where, why, how, what. This show is very good at showing a much more expansive story than just fighting for survival and showing a more intelligent route. Also nice to see Godzilla progress from a before and after, showing how it isn't just some dinosaur looking monster.The art is a really crazy old style but in a fresh new layout. I personally love the art most...of the entire show. I think it is superb to look at and such a refreshing style.The sound they used is simple yet complex. Simple in that it isn't too technical. Complex in that so much can be going on and the clarity is clear.The characters are something that seems to confuse many in that they are separate stories that work together and cross over each other. They don't need to be with each other the entire time to actually make sense of the story since like in real life, not every character is literally stood next to each other.The show from start to finish is a good run, it is enjoyable but isn't anything of a masterpiece. I would happily watch more seasons of this show but it won't be anything crazy amazing to watch but is worthwhile your time.8/10. of the entire show.

While I do appreciate a good kaiju v. kaiju smackdown flick too, I like to think these more contemplative pieces are just as crucial to the identity of the series, even if not as frequent.That said, a common criticism that you'll hear is the large abundance of science jargon and explanations, and while...in a vacuum I don't have much issue with it, it was mainly what was sacrificed in order to do so. It often felt like these scientific concepts and explanations actively fought for screentime with basic story-telling elements like plot and character development, and when push came to shove, the latter was what faced the chopping block.In the early episodes we're introduced to a handful of characters under the Otaki Factory and Misakioku Facility, most prominent of which being Mei and Yun. And to be honest, everything went smoothly at first, seeing how these characters tick, interact, and perceive the world. And then they introduce more characters like Li, as well as more characters, and yet more. And then even more for good measure. It only gets worse because these characters are intended to have these complex nets of relationships to one another, but when each one only gets maybe, 10 minutes of screen-time max, how is anyone supposed to keep track, much less care. How am I supposed to parse out their motivations or get invested? How is one supposed to determine who is purposely shady and who just got shafted in terms of screentime because we're still going on about the Diagonal Orthagonizer? By the end I found myself thinking that to a certain extent a good handful of these characters, if anything, just served as tools to move the plot forward rather than as actual characters.Main characters like Mei don't exactly make it out of this unscathed either. In the initial episodes we're led to believe she's a relatively normal Grad student. Yet by the end, perhaps as a consequence of the show's breakneck plot pacing in order to cram in all of it's pseudo-science, we see the show (hopefully) unintentionally portray her as this infallible super-genius in direct contrast to the initial image the anime intended to portray. If you ever had a hard time getting invested in an overpowered shonen protagonist, it's pretty much the same here. She apparently pumps out a report in a single night and understands the equivalent to what took her superior years to decipher. Her conclusions are taken by characters like Yun as gospel pretty much immediately without any academic discourse, despite these claims being that the entire fabric of reality is essentially null and void. She is the only one who can decipher these age-old notes, and does so in a matter of days, with the only difficulty she had being solved in a matter of less than half an episode. She is essentially portrayed as this being who can do now wrong, despite the science of this series literally being where 1+1 can equal anything.In terms of plot progression, it's all over the place. Moments are barely given any moment to breathe, again having to fight for screen time alongside all the pseudo-science going on. We as the viewer barely have any bearing on time or place, not only because so much is spent explaining jargon, but also because of how we're frantically taken from place to place and character to character to give each their brief moment with what little time is left. There's no sense of urgency or investment as a result, which is a real problem when the climax of the story is an apocalypses level event.In the end I feel like this anime had a major issue of scope. Many series already face issues cramming a satisfying amount of character development and plot progression inside a 12 episode season, so to do that alongside explaining mass amounts of scientific jargon was likely a fool-hardy task from the start. The story would have done much better keeping its cast small and manageable, and keeping its story in a singular location rather than jump frantically across many places around the globe that in the end the audience can barely even discern. While the psuedo-science was interesting, I feel more should have been done to tie all the series' long list of disparate concepts together into one cohesive network of ideas, which also necessitates down-sizing how many the show tackled at once due to how congested the show already is.While I'm still eager to see a season 2, I genuinely hope the effort is one that is more intentional about focusing on the foundational aspects of cohesive story-telling, rather than as a jumble of speculative science concepts roughly strewn together. in a vacuum I don't have much issue with it, it was mainly what was sacrificed in order to do so.

Having a good buddy be super into everything Godzilla, I knew I had to watch this because of them. But also my own personal want to watch it. Let me explain throughout this.Story and characters.I'm putting these two together into one section, as while we've got a fairly decent cast, with some getting more development than others. The main focus of the show is the build up of it's story. Not to take anything away from the characters themselves, they're a great mixed bunch, that tug the show...along. A good cast.But of course, as I was saying, the story centers around pretty much normal days, that is until monsters begin attacking the place for unknown reasons. Just why are they doing such? Where did they come from? Where, oh where? That's what's keeping me watching, and interested to see where next the story takes us. It might be a slow build, but it's one of those good slow builds that keeps you hooked.Art and sound.The art is really good. it can be real beautiful in parts, and fitting in others. Even the lighting in some scenes, is really well done. But also the art can have a more grim, and weird vibe to it, which honestly makes it stand out. Just see for the OP for that matter, the start of it will explain this point. While the sound and music within the show is fit for purpose. Even in some scenes, where it seems like they've used sounds from the actual movies themselves.Should you watch Godzilla? Mmhmm. For sure, it may be slow in areas, but it's keeping you hooked for an entertaining ride. along.

And I think that this was a very good attempt by the writers at a more deeply sci-fi story in the franchise, but for me in many ways it was just that: an attempt.I think that if you look at the score I gave the series, you might think that I...was not really into the show, but there are actually quite a few parts I really enjoyed. The main three areas I thought the show did really well with were: the visuals, the sound design and music, and the bag of concepts that the writers were willing to pull from.I feel like usually 3DCG in anime is a mostly negative mixed bag, with it sometimes looking better than expected, but I thought the textures and styling of the monsters was very good, and if you might be even able to stretch the lens and view it as a representation of showing how the monsters exist in the world but don't belong.As a big Godzilla weeb, I really appreciated the use of the classic Godzilla themes and kaiju cries and roars, which really took me back and I think helped convince me that the creators of the show are also just big fans of the genre. To add even further to this point, many of the plot points and presentation of the story is dripping with references and allusions to previous entries in the series (i.e. the story of Godzilla as a urban legend like it was in the original movie, essentially taking the plot of Shin Godzilla and adding time travel to mix, the scene after Godzilla unleashes its atomic breath and hibernating also basically being directly lifted from Shin Godzilla, and *spoilers* using the skeleton of a previous Godzilla to make Mechagodzilla a la Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, etc.) and as a long time fan, I really appreciated them showing that they knew their stuff.However, this also directly leads into some of the issues I had with the show, which particularly start to come in during the second half of the show where it focuses on the story. I think that the story suffers a lot with pacing, and trying to convince itself of its own time shenanigans to the point where to me, it feels like they almost gave up trying to make sense at the end. The use of the lullaby to transmit information through time marginally makes sense until it is revealed that Pelops uses it to transmit information to Jet Jaguar in the future, even though the song was originally supposed to have come from the deceased Godzilla in the basement, which doesn't really make sense as to how Pelops encoded that information, not to mention why it made Jet Jaguar huge aside from the obvious reason of wanting Robots to fight giant monsters which I am not against in the slightest, but still it felt like they included too many ideas and realized on the last two episodes that it was almost impossible to tie everything together.However, I think the biggest issue I had with the series was the utilization of Godzilla. In Godzilla's truest essence, he is an incarnation of the sins of mankind and their arrogance in using atomic power, a theme which has mostly remained true through all of Godzilla's more serious appearances, or at least he has represented the power of nature like in the Monsterverse. But in Singular Point he's a threat just because he's a big monster, and that is my issue: this show didn't have to be about Godzilla. To me, it felt like the creators had the concept for the show and later decided to add Godzilla, because it feels like they could have replaced Godzilla and all the other monsters with generic kaiju and the plot would remain largely unchanged, Godzilla just has better brand recognition. To be perfectly honest, Godzilla didn't even really come across as being the biggest threat to the characters: the Salunga and the vaguely described Catastrophe going on in India were always framed as being the more immediate threat to humanity, and Godzilla was mostly just chilling in Japan and cracking open a cold one with the boys unless people bothered him.Despite its flaw in my opinion, Godzilla: Singular Point is a good attempt at a heavier sci-fi Godzilla story and is a good addition to the franchise and mythos that I think fans of Godzilla will enjoy, but couldn't tie together the good concepts it presented, didn't utilize Godzilla very well, and to me ultimately failed to resolve the story it was trying to tell in a satisfying way. was not really into the show, but there are actually quite a few parts I really enjoyed.

The good things it has are the protagonists who are always close but far away, afterwards, how artificial intelligence develops is very well achieved and how contrasts are made between the different characters by age. Because of how one and the other think. From the first chapter it is full of questions that the series tries to answer you as the chapters go by. You are assuming things with the new information they give you.The bad thing is that I do not feel that it...is a godzilla series until chapter 8 more or less, you always see re op creatures that are destroying things and that but I feel that the title is only to attract more attention quietly the anime could have another name and I think it would be much better since it does not influence you when choosing the anime. I recommend it is entertaining but you will not see much of godzilla.En español:Siento muchas cosas después de ver este anime en parte me gusto y en otra parte me disgusto. Las cosas buenas que tiene son los protagonistas que siempre están cerca pero lejos, después como se desarrolla la inteligencia artificial esta muy bien logrado y como se hace contrastes entre los distintos personajes por la edad. Por como piensa uno y otro. Desde el primer capitulo esta lleno de preguntas que la serie te trata de responder a medida que pasan los capítulos. Vas suponiendo cosas con la información nueva que te dan.Lo malo es que no siento que sea una serie de godzilla hasta el capitulo 8 mas o menos, siempre se ve criaturas re op que están destruyendo cosas y eso pero siento que el titulo solo es para llamar mas la atención tranquilamente el anime podría tener otro nombre y creo que seria mucho mejor ya que no te influencia a la hora de elegir el anime.

I'm afraid I'm just a dumb fan who doesn't see why this is bad, just because of how much I'm enjoying it.I mean, I like the art, the characters, the complexity, the new things they brought to this concept and shi, but I'm not sure if I'm just dreaming.I feel like a lot of people dropped this because of the CGI and because they didn't see Godzilla at all in the first episodes.Please tell me if...I'm blind or if this is actually good, as I'm thinking. I'm blind or if this is actually good, as I'm thinking."", ""This is a very intellectually written anime, and when i mean intellectually written, i mean with a boat load of science. This is godzilla with the focus on realism, characters, and accuracy cranked up to a 10. Primarily a mystery and suspense anime, because the writer knows we expect kaijus, so we're pretty much blue balled until the big reveal...in which the reveal hasnt been shown yet. Big G doesnt show up even at episode 6. So fans of godzilla like me are gonna be disappointed in some ways unless youre satisfied with kaijus no bigger than a house. This show doesnt show much symbolism,...but it IS present in the form of science symbolism, and not much more than that. Just like how the protagonists are deeply engrossed in their science work, so are all of the characters in this story. They honestly seem to all blend together in terms of motives, despite having very colorful personalities and designs.

Some would argue that the CG in a fight would look awful, but not in this case.The story overall I thought was pretty good, though the explanation of figuring out on how to...beat Godzilla can be muddled with explanation that sounds like something out of a college level physics and math class.

Jet Jaguar's character design is reminiscent of it's original design mixed with a new take on it.Overall, this is a good entry to the Godzilla franchise and I think you should give it a watch.

This anime, however, adds a fairly surprising element: watch, think and enjoy. Godzilla Singular Point has some really fine animation and captivating action sequences. The weak link, however, is the excessive expository dialogue, which remains not only hard to follow but also hard to enjoy. The exposition-filled mystery element eats up a lot of the running time, and this is ultimately the show's major flaw while also being a key reason for its originality.First things first, this show has indeed a lot of scientific dialogue...and Tenet-esque complexity. Due to this, there are times the show will make you lose attention. But keeping that aside, the series is actually fun to watch. Good fight scenes, and the intense atmosphere in the last few episodes are two major positives. However. The overall tempo of the show keeps changing with tonal shifts between intense action and confusing science talk.Also, Godzilla, although the character in the title as well as the monster we all watched it for, is mostly missing for the major duration; it feels less like a kaiju anime and more like a sci-fi action thriller about apocalypse instead. Characters are interesting, but the same can't be said for each and everyone there is. The score is good, and the intro as well as outro songs are impressive. So all in all, if you don't mind thinking or listening to scientific talk in what is a blockbuster action anime, watch this title without much thinking. Others, please keep the aforementioned factors in mind before you start the show. The flaws will be visible from the first episode itself.

The story itself had potential, if it wasn't for the pacing and exposition, it almost seems like every dialogue has to have a metaphor, especially when the characters are explaining a phenomena in the show. What I enjoyed the most were the animation, visual effects, art design, and the music, of which are outstanding, they've handled the CGI extremely well. The only problem is the storytelling and pacing. I had high hopes for this series during its early episodes, but later on, the show keeps repeating the same thing where...it's exposition after exposition. It wouldn't be a problem if it was straightforward but there are scenes where the dialogues or texts just move too fast before you can even comprehend what they meant. Godzilla also has too few of a spotlight in the series. I never had a problem with Godzilla's screen-time in the newer American films, it's a problem if your main monster is in a show that spans 13 episodes long and only release every week.

Every character design looks unique & vibrant. The monster character designs, Radons, Spiders & of course Godzilla gives the feel of the monster that they are. The series is made by studios ""bones"" (FMAB & MHA) & ""Orange"" (Land of the Lustrous & Beastars) and you can tell who\'s making what, if I\'ve seen their previous works. The human designs looks so vibrant which are hand drawn. And the monster design look creepy & scary but unique, which is thanks to the CGI. Many have a...misconception that CGI is always bad but that\'s definitely not the case here. The clunky CGI really worked for the creepiness & monstrous look for the giant, other wordly creatures.CONS :-- Bland CharactersDuring every episode which has a monster attacking a character, I constantly asked myself, ""Why should I care for you?"". I know that sounds really harsh & edgy, but seriously the characters are just so bland, they feel more like ""Plot devices"" than actual characters. Their only personality is their design & maybe their high intelligence but nothing else. The series focusses so much on the plot and the sci-fi element, which completely forgets that these are people. Only memorable character are the AIs who shows more personality than people.Things we can debat on:-This is a section where few things may or may not apply to others that I personally found bad. So, these may not be cons or pros.-  Lack of more Godzilla""I mean, c\'mon.... You have Godzilla in the title and there are like what!  A 20 minute scenes in the whole 13 episodes Anime?? Are you kidding me!?"" is what many might think after watching this. I haven\'t watched many Godzilla films (watched only two of them) but I think that shouldn\'t be considered here. This is Anime with not much to the production, and that\'s a live-action Hollywood film with more budget. It\'s kinda unfair to compare both, but that\'s really understandable if you are someone who expected to see big creatures fight and hated this work. I don\'t really disliked lack of Godzilla, but it could\'ve been so much better if Godzilla had much screentime- The Sci-fi ElementHonestly, it is pretty interesting how the series managed to convey it\'s sci-fi element through boring dialogues. The exposition is completely based on more & *more* dialogue, which is very fast paced(for sub watchers, Dub seems to be fine).For Die Hard Sci-fi fans who constantly wants to wrap their head around, this show can be a treat. For me though, I really found it boring even though it\'s actually interesting. You could actually tell the creators did their research. I mean, HELL. One of the spiritual theories they talk about(The Bagvadgita) is something I\'m familiar of. It\'s really nice to a homage for my country. But that\'s kinda it. I really appreciate it, but it didn\'t impressed me because of the bland execution through boring dialogue.- The Blend between 2D & 3DIn the series(and few Anime in general), you have few scenes where they blend the 2D & 3D together. Now this is a little problem for me. While they are good in their own way, they aren\'t really good together because the distinction is visible. I personally think it\'s a little out of the place cause it didn\'t worked well.This is a very common problem for anything that tries to blend 2D & 3D. You have the infamous CGI crowds that looks so out of the place that it can put you off like in many Anime, but then you also have something like ""Land of the Lustrous"" CGI that really uses 3D in a way that many still framed 2D scenes can\'t try to deliver.TL;DRMay not be for GODZILLA fans**, but it can be a good watch for ""Die hard Sci-fi fans"".For people who just want to check this out tho, not really worth your time. misconception that CGI is always bad but that\'s definitely not the case here.

What else do you need?But honestly Godzilla: S.P is very good, sadly it gets taken too serious when it's clearly going the opposite way. It's fun to watch casually or to have playing on the background, everyone could watch it and enjoy it. It's not very popular and my comments may feel pessimistic but I liked it (and binged watched it lol).---Some stuff I wanted to mention:The science may be all made up but you get to understand the logic it isn't just empty words, the A.I's are alive and probably the most developed characters,...other characters are kinda plain (including the protagonists) but you empathize with them anyways, the plot or story doesn't really go anywhere but it still manages to get you attention big time.A little too family friendly for my liking, there aren't any risk or situations and absolutely no one dies or gets badly injured (not even extras), the word Godzilla on the title feels like clickbait (he only appears at the end and he isn't the real one) and sadly I strongly believe some other title would have helped the anime.The silliness of some characters feels heart-warming and the song they play all the time rocks, my head is filled of scientific theories that make me feel I don't know how the irl world works at all, that's... cool :D. other characters are kinda plain (including the protagonists) but you empathize with them anyways, the plot or story doesn't really go anywhere but it still manages to get you attention big time.A little too family friendly for my liking, there aren't any risk or situations and absolutely no one dies or gets badly injured (not even extras), the word Godzilla on the title feels like clickbait (he only appears at the end and he isn't the real one) and sadly I strongly believe some other title would have helped the anime.The silliness of some characters feels heart-warming and the song they play all the time rocks, my head is filled of scientific theories that make me feel I don't know how the irl world works at all, that's... cool :D."", 'Right of the bat, the animation was awesome. There was heavy use of CGI on the kaiju. Even though I don’t like CGI animation, it was pretty well done here. Godzilla looked mighty and more like a lizard than in the live-action movies. When Godzilla used atomic breath, there’s an add-on animation with multiple circles that looked very cool.The tricky part was the story. Even though I got the general plot, the physics behind it was beyond my comprehension. Because the plot was confusing, it was hard to follow at times and invest in the overall story. However, the pacing was still fast and didn’t...drag out. The AI spoke at the speed of light, so I had to work my eyes more to read all the subtitles. It wasn’t an issue.The characters didn’t have any backstory, which was understandable because of the urgency of the plot. I didn’t invest much in any of the characters, except Jet Jaguar, because of the complicated plot.Overall, a pretty entertaining anime despite the complicated plot. 6.5/10 drag out.

It elevates previous themes of the body of work into new modern ideas that echo modern philosophies as explored in works like Tenet, Steins Gate, Interstellar.It challenges audiences to question their beliefs about the universe and draws parallels to Hindu Philosophy.It asks the viewer to question suppositions they believe to be true. And question the reality of their existence.The first ingrained belief to be questioned is the fate of humanity in the greater cosmos....- we often assume that humanity has a long history and that it will have a prosperous future. We rarely face the fact that the Earth is billions of years old, and humans comprise just a fraction of its existence. There may be long hidden pasts in our planet that we are unaware of.- First the Rodan appears, and brings it shockingly into front stage that there exists a phenomenon we Humans don\'t know about. The subsequent episodes follow a series of TV broadcasts and scientists rushing to find an answer. The creatures also come from the sea: a place we admittedly haven\'t explored much of. So the plausibility of the event makes the show that much more gripping.And that is the second belief challenged: humans do not know everything.- As Erasmus a father of Humanism Philosophy put it, ""To be human is to live in ignorance"". We often equate ""science"" with ""truth"" but that is rarely the case. Science is an ever ongoing study it does not have the answers for things it does not know exist.- The show represents this by: as mentioned earlier the reports scrambling for answers. But also the playful/observational nature (Homo Ludens) of the beasts when they first emerge indicates that life itself can express a common theme to evolve itself through education but also strikingly puts that in juxtaposition with the image that humans may not be the only ones to do so and might not do it the best at it. Bugs for example truly rule the world. They are a much more ""successful"" evolutionary species.The third belief is that time may not be a directed linear dimension.- it may instead be a loop which can join into itself at any given moment/subdivision of time. The joining of the loop represents the presence of information in the reality around you. Everything that exists; exists that way as a fated intention of time to loop itself. Aka the future affects the past and the past the future. Similar concept is the idea behind Tenet.- when Mei is discussing with professor Lin about how everything she can think of is present as information somewhere or another. 3 monkeys or 2 birds. And if it\'s a thing she thinks of that doesn\'t exist it affects the future. Aka you\'re creating reality. And in my personal beliefs: creating art: An expression of free will.(The next two are more of a stretch but nonetheless apt, in my opinion)The fourth belief is not a belief but a defense of soul mates. The idea that information is fated through loops in time (a non planar dimension) then in the third dimension the points where the loops connect to itself form a line.The line represents phenomenon that will exist in every timeline. So essentially if falling in love was a phenomenon (which it is) then it is fated to happen laterally throughout ""infinite"" universes. (I don\'t personally believe in this, but cool theme for a show!)- in the show the code for the keys represented in the waves was the very conversation thread of information between Yun and Mei. Their words and relationship led to the events that are unfolding, and the events that are unfolding led to their relationship.Next is a personal belief of mine that I wanted to share: ""Waves are how the universe communicates"".-  the only input and output to anything in the universe is waves. Be it gravity or intracellular, or even atomic. The movement of particles in a particular pattern generate waves as energy which can be transmitted from thing to thing. Lifeforms evolved to interpret those waves. Ears evolved to capture what was at the time invisible information. Sound waves before ears were simply an unobserved movement of particles in a pattern. And the same with visible light and eyes. This idea is expressed squarely in Hindu Philosophy. It is said that the universe was created by Brahma with a single breath, the reverberations of the breath, the waves of it produced a sound: the word for 🕉 ""ohm"".- In the show, the machine that can see into the future and brings about the catastrophe is called Shiva, also known as the destroyer. And the Hindu God of Destruction. The machine is emitting a wave which is heard as a Sanskrit song. This contains the information to destroy. Aka the cause of the catastrophe. But it is being transmitted from the future. So Pelops the 2nd goes into the future to try and find a key to the orthogonal diffuser which is a molecule that acts differently in a different time/dimension and is capable of nullifying the red dust. The key is some wave or set of information in this reality which form a connection on the line in the z axis of time to trigger a reaction with red dust.The key (to stopping Shiva) aka the wave needed to communicate with the future to tell it to stop;  is in fact an appreciation of the world around us for what it is. It is to ask and desire for the world to exist as you want. Since reality is what you believe it to be.- in the show Pelops remembers what Yun desires: for Jet Jaguar to be invincible. So there is a universe where that phenomenon exists and by simply remembering the desire existing and being realized in another timeline was the key to awakening it happening in the timeline we\'re witnessing.Personally, i don\'t believe infinity exists which is why you can\'t will realities for your immediate self. So there must be a restriction, an upper limit of time and space. Beyond that existence is what I call the Void. And the Void is not an infinite entity. As opposed to Decartes\' Philosophy that God must exist because infinity can exist then there must be a power greater than that (infinity+1) and God equals that formula for mathematical induction. I instead believe ""infinity is the limit"".  And infinity+1 = null. Null+1=null. Null-1=Infinity. Null - null = null. Null+null = null.I think there ought to be a series of mathematical operations valid for null/the Void. Because truly if time/space were infinite than anything is possible.RETURNING to the show!- Godzilla: Singular point also does a fantastic job at paying homage to its history with symbolism.Godzilla used to be a cautionary tale of the immense power of Nuclear weapons. The father of the atomic bomb was Max Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer\'s famous quote was, ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"". This is an excerpt from the Gita, one of Hinduism\'s sacred texts. Shiva is the destroyer of world\'s thus aptly named the machine which causes it. Btw, Oppenheimer misinterpreted true meaning behind that Gita phrase. It is more accurately taking about the cycle of rebirth and divine creation and destruction.Which are themes I\'ve already mentioned earlier in this review.The show also pays homage to its characters like Jet Jaguar and Rodan from earlier versions of Godzilla.Lastly, i just want to say i loved how much Indian influence was present in this show. As an Indian who grew up in America with a college degree in ECE and Japanese Language this was a pleasure to watch. And absolutely delightful to my inner Godzilla obsessed child.My name is Tarang. Thank you for reading my review! 🙏P.S: Tarang means, ""wave"". Just like how the universe communicates 😜P.S.P.S: The cinematography and iconic music in the show were masterclass. Great animation. Amazing voice acting. Uniquely designed characters with their own motivations. All 10/10 production qualities. And to those reviewers rating the show poorly because Godzilla want featured enough........ That is a huge disservice to what the show was conveying. It\'s akin to a child being upset that they didn\'t get what they wanted. It\'s art. You didn\'t make it, enjoy what it actually is or thoughtfully criticize it for why it didn\'t convey its message well. Not berate it just because it wasn\'t what you expected. In my opinion, it is more deserving of the idea of Godzilla than just some animalistic desire to see kaiju fight for no reason. That\'s for kids. This show is clearly intended for those capable of unraveling it\'s philosophies. And no I\'m not just trying to be pretentious. The show directly quotes philosophical references I made in my review. Sorry for the aggressive tone at the end, I just wanted to get ahead of inevitable comments based on the other reviews I\'ve read. Shame to see the lack of popular awareness to complicated topics and philosophy as a negative reflection of the show. Same thing happened with Interstellar and the Green Knight.The show by the way did a perfect job of presenting its ideas. It\'s not mumbo jumbo. It\'s a logical series of ideas paced perfectly if you can follow along. I don\'t believe every show should cater to the median or mode of a populous to be considered ""good"" or highly rated. I would hope critics agree with that sentiment otherwise Michael Bay\'s transformers movies would be Oscar worthy films. - we often assume that humanity has a long history and that it will have a prosperous future.

I mean what were they thinking when they made this show do they not even...know why Godzilla got popular in the first place we wanna see Godzilla beat the shit out of other monsters and destroy cities and armies, instead we get the most boring characters spouting off made up bullshit for 95% of the show, Godzilla himself does not even make a full appearence until episode 10 is stupid and even after he shows up he doesn't do anything and we get a lackluster fight at the end between Godzilla and Jet Jaguar.The show could have been better if Godzilla showed up way sooner and fought more monsters from the classic films and remove ALL of the made up science boring talk that honestly reminds me of boring shows like fate/stay night and gundam unicorn.DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW, WATCH THE HEISEI TIMELINE- Gojira (1954)- The return of Godzilla (1984)- Godzilla vs Biollante (1989)- Godzilla vs King Ghidorah (1991)- Godzilla vs Mothra (1992)- Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla (1993)- Godzilla vs SpaceGodzilla (1994)- Godzilla vs Destroyah (1995)these  films are better at telling a good story thats easy to follow while giving you good monster fights. You can also watch the showa timeline or millenium films to because they are also good and the monsterverse is also good.

You need to have watched the former for this OVA to make any sense.

If you liked the original, then you might as well add on this additional 45min run.Animation:Looks just like the main series. Lots of ecchi, somewhat cheap animation, and did I mention the ecchi?Sound:The OP is the same as the main series, but they added a new ED, which is barely more enticing to listen...to than the original ED. Same BGM and same VA cast.Story:So you can pretty much tell what each ep is from the title. You get one episode explaining the Cynthia/Grace split personality, one episode giving more background to Konoe (with lots of ecchi), and one episode with Tarou being forced to cross-dress as a maid by Ikuyo. These are a nice addition to give a bit of additional background/humor, but don't really contribute anything meaningful as there was never any plot to begin with.Character:As mentioned above, you get some new background information and additional interactions showing Tarou in his most pitiful state yet.Value:It's 45 minutes of new content, mostly of the ecchi type.

Happiness!: Watarase Jun no Kareinaru Ichinichi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1902/Happiness__Watarase_Jun_no_Kareinaru_Ichinichi,"['If you like Happiness! as a brainless, fluffy slice of life show and don\'t want to think about it too much, you might enjoy this.If you dislike Jun as a character, you will hate this.If you like Jun as a character, you should hate this.I enjoyed Happiness! a bit more than most people but it was a while before I watched this. I was always kind of interested in it as Jun was my favourite character so an episode focused around him sounded appealing. He\'s cute and unabashed and open about his dress habits and he\'s  queer as hell. He\'s a great character there...really isn\'t much of in anime. So often traps and crossdressers will be reluctant or weirded out by their situation. But Jun is totally happy with it - he owns it. He knows he\'s cute and he has a thing for Yuma and he makes it obvious. That\'s why I loved him.When I envisioned this show I imagined they would run with how Jun had been established in Happiness! - he would be shocked at being a girl, maybe even horrified. As he had expressed basically no desire to be a woman, that\'d have made sense to me. He was just happy as who he was.But what they decided to do was introduce an entirely new and out of nowhere character development - that all along Jun had wanted to be a girl. And that he\'s elated to become one in this story. This was annoying to me as it kind of undermined what made Jun appealing as a character in the series. But I\'d have been willing to accept it had the tone of the episode, or the writing for that matter, actually reflected it. Instead the fact Jun wanted to be a woman is just a kind of throwaway gag. Sure it\'s a light hearted gag anime...but if that\'s the case...maybe don\'t throw in such a weighty topic? Maybe do what I had suggested and not have Jun\'s reactions be ""thank god I\'m finally a woman!""Let me say that I don\'t think the premise of this story is entirely worthless. I think it could have very easily been handled much better and in a less offensive way. The introduction of the fan club had me certain they\'d recover the unpleasantness of this episode with an arc around self acceptance. Jun, in his new body, assures his upset looking fan club that things will proceed as normal. Surely they will seem sad at his change, I thought - surely this will lead to him, in the end, realising he doesn\'t and shouldn\'t need to change himself to find happiness?Nope. Just a throwaway visual gag about him smiling and that making them happy. No one tries to assure Jun he was fine the way he was. Nothing remotely close to that.The tone gets even more twisted; despite Jun\'s happiness, his classmates are now overcome with uncontrollable rapacious lust because he has become a real woman (despite not physically changing appearance wise)? And as a result he chooses to foresake his new sex. This is why I said at the start that if you can turn your brain off you might be able to like this. I can\'t - this is just a horrific piece of writing. Jun learns the lesson of it doesn\'t matter what you want, give it up because if you don\'t men will rape you. What? Enjoy watching the original series now knowing all the while Jun is actually utterly miserable because his body doesn\'t match his gender identity. Enjoy especially all the times Yuma is incredibly callous and insensitive to him!Getting away from the writing - production wise this is about on par with the original series. The animation is as sloppy but the sound is fairly nice with some tolerable background music. The editing is characteristically snappy and fast paced.Overall I can\'t recommend this to anyone, really. It\'s a rare example of an adjacent property making its source material actively worse. My opinion on the series Happiness! has diminished in light of this and I don\'t see myself rewatching it any time soon as a result. I\'ll try to forget this exists if I ever do rewatch. really isn\'t much of in anime. So often traps and crossdressers will be reluctant or weirded out by their situation.

The story revolves around Andou Soako, a high-school girl who forgets to put on her underwear due to rushing to school and avoiding being late again.

Harukana Receive,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35983/Harukana_Receive,"['It’s easy to dismiss a show like Harukana Receive at first glance. Look at the key visual, read the premise, and check out those preview promotional material. What do you see? If the answer involves girls in bikinis playing beach volleyball, then you would be 100% correct. As a competitive sport, Harukana Receive takes the idea of beach volleyball and transforms it into a meaningful competitive story to tell.Since its serialization in 2015, the manga has received only moderate attention but had enough value to be licensed in North America. I rarely ever heard of people talking about the manga though so I assume most...people coming into this show to be fresh. I’ve only read parts of the manga but it shouldn’t be hard to realize what the show will be about. The obvious is the show will be composed entirely of beach episodes. However, if we take a deeper dive into this anime, then it should also be recognized that Harukana Receive is a very character driven story. Every episode pushes the characters to new heights and this series isn’t shy to bring out their best.The title “Harukana” is a portmanteau of two of the main characters in this series – Haruka Oozora and Kanata Higa. It makes sense too considering the significance of this character pair and their journey to become volleyball superstars. In the beginning, Haruka is fascinated by the beaches of Okinawa. It doesn’t take long for her to embrace the love of volleyball as she decides to team up with her cousin, Kanata. The first few episodes easily establishes the story’s premise and is easy to understand from the characters’ perspectives. We learn about both characters and their motivations. Haruka is presented as a very open minded girl and easy to make friends with. This is in contrast with Kanata, who shows a more reserved personality and keeps much to herself. Through flashback details, we learn that Kanata used to be an experienced volleyball player until a traumatic event caused her to resign. It is not until present day that Haruka is able to convince her to return to the sport again. The two makes an interesting pair because the way they supplement each other – Haruka’s height and Kanata’s experience. To say the least, his character pair will no doubt spark curiosity on how far they can make it in the big leagues.Throughout their journey, Haruka and Kanata also meets formidable rivals. The most prominent of these include the pair – Claire and Emily Thomas. In many ways, I see a parallel similarity between them to Haruka and Kanata. For instance, Haruka and Claire both possesses a playful personality with a very open mind. It didn’t surprise me that they quickly became friends either. Kanata is also similar to Emily as they have a more quiet nature and tends to be more reserved. Nonetheless, the show portrays the relationship of these four characters with friendship, rivalry, and respect. Deeper down into the story, we also meet other character pairs such as Narumi/Ayasa and Akari/Mai. The show makes it clear that some of these competitors are extremely talented such as the case with Narumi. Their accomplishments inspires Haruka to improve while also bringing back Kanata’s motivation to succeed. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t fully develop them enough and only gives us a glimpse of their potential. In other words, it’s not easy to get attached to the supporting cast compared to the main pair of Haruka and Kanata. Luckily, the Thomas siblings makes up for the void as they get a decent amount of screen time. The character chemistry they bring into the show is infectiously entertaining. Even their mother makes an appearance and through flashbacks, viewers will understand how they became the characters they are today.As a 1-cour show of only 12 episodes, it became a bit obvious that the anime had to make room to reserve for the plot. It’s unfortunate to say this but 12 episodes really isn’t enough to explore the show at its fullest. The tournament arc featuring Haruka and Kanata only shows their improvement as players but doesn’t fully capitalize on their potential. While the series does a decent job at making us care about the characters, not all of them really get their time to shine either. This issue could have been resolved if the anime had been 2-cour but alas, it was not meant to be. I also have to mention that the show can be a bit niche if you’re watching this for the wrong reasons. It’s very lighthearted with plenty of comedy and gags but also moments with emotional drama. In other words, Harukana Receive may appear to be a walking fan service but there’s much more to just the hot girls in swimsuits.If I told you Okinawa is one of the most beautiful places on Earth today, you’d probably point fingers and name something else better. However, I will say that Okinawa is extremely well crafted with the vibrant colorful sunny atmosphere and realistic sandy landscape. The aquatic ocean also feels real that injects more of the Summer feeling. As this show aired during Summer 2018, it’s a perfect place to be. To get the more obvious out of the way, every character in the show will be in swimsuits for a good majority of the time. There are some episodes that characters spend in casual wear but most of it will be on the sandy beaches of Okinawa. What does this mean? It basically means that you’d better get used to seeing ass, boobs, and curvy bodies on your screen. It doesn’t help that the camera seems to always focus on the character’s bodies too so get used to that. There are even comedic gags where some characters slap another’s ass as a way of expressing their personalities. Still, it’s definitely also a good idea to keep an eye on the body movements of the show during the volleyball matches. Every movement in the show feels important whether it’s a dive, block, or close save. It emphasizes character teamwork that’s as real as it gets. In fact, I would say the character pairs in the show are portrayed much more than just partners. They feel like are destined to be together whether it’s Haru-Kana or the Thomas siblings.As colorful as the show is on the surface, also be prepared to be dazzled by the energetic soundtrack. It creates the sensation of being in the sunny fields of Okinawa. Every match in the show also gets an enhanced experience with the OST matching its intense momentum. The theme songs are also catchy that emphasizes on character pairings. Last and certainly not least are the character voice mannerisms. Characters like Kanata and Emily really bring themselves to life and it’s easy to accept them who they are.Harukana Receive seems like a deceptive show that glorifies fan service and makes it look like an eyecandy for the male audience. However, if you look beyond the skin and swimsuits, it’s easy to see how well this show works with its ideas. Do be aware that as a show with just 12 episodes, it will feel incomplete. And also, some characters will feel less likable than others. However, I would definitely recommend adding this show to the watchlist.

It’s not easy to make a show as a walking fan service but Harukana Receive does more than just being sexy.', ""This show is filled with all kinds of disgusting and cringe-worthy elements of the most vile kind, things that will make your skin crawl, including but not limited to:-Fan service (oh god, the horror)-Sexy ladies in bikinis (ugh!)-Yuri moments (No, please, no!)-VOLLEYBALL (NOOOOOO)...but you know, it turns out that crazy people like me greatly enjoy all of those despicable things, and if you do too, this is probably a show for you!Satire aside, Harukana Receive is a competent show. My opinion on the show has not changed since I originally wrote this review; from an ecchi perspective, the girls are all very attractive...and, much like Keijo, the show has found a good excuse to get the audience their fan service in copious amounts without needing to push the believability out almost at all.The story is nothing particularly spectacular, though the general framework of girls playing beach volleyball works perfectly well in serving its efforts to develop the characters. Two episodes in, we had an understanding of where each girl was coming from, their relationships to each other, and what the general drama was between them. That main story is retained as the main focus in future episodes while gradually introducing new characters, which is enough for me to consider it competent, especially since dramatic narrative is (and perhaps even should be) used a plot-mover more than a feature in these types of works.I would say the main things to like about this show are generally obvious to any respectable ecchi fan, particularly all of the things I listed at the beginning of this review. As far as whether non-ecchi fans would enjoy this, I would say the girls' cute personalities, decent artwork, and the sports aspect could certainly be appealing enough to make this an enjoyable watch. However, if you actively dislike fan service, this is not a show for you.Some other things of note that may sway your opinion one way or the other:-The show appears to be all-girls. At this moment in time, the only male is a pet turtle.-Because of the first point, it should come as no surprise that the girls are occasionally flirty with each other with potential for actual yuri to occur (though we all know how that usually turns out in shows like this)-Things move fairly quickly so far in terms of the main girl's improvement at the sport; probably the writers opting to focus more on the characters in the 12 episodes they have. However, what we've seen so far in terms of actual volleyball matches have been pretty fun to watch.tl;dr I definitely recommend this show for ecchi fans who like an all-girl cast. Non-ecchi fans may get enjoyment out of the cute (though tropey) characters and the sports aspect, however I do not recommend this show if fan service is something you dislike. and, much like Keijo, the show has found a good excuse to get the audience their fan service in copious amounts without needing to push the believability out almost at all.The story is nothing particularly spectacular, though the general framework of girls playing beach volleyball works perfectly well in serving its efforts to develop the characters.

Without taking my personal entertainment into consideration, I believe this anime should be a solid 7.There's been a MAJOR lack of representation of women in sports animes. So when I saw Harukana Receive and Hanebado coming out this season, I was so excited! I had low expectations going in, especially with the ecchi genre tacked on to it, but I'm having a great time so far.The animation is absolutely gorgeous!! The sand particles are animated to perfection and the different camera angles help to capture the difficulty and excitement of this sport. Even if...the story was crap (which it's not), the animation alone makes this anime a treat to watch.The voice acting and music in the anime is nice, with some numbers shining more than others. I wouldn't say any of the music's going to end up on my playlist, but it's pleasant and adds to the scenes.Despite one of the genres being listed as an ecchi, there is a surprisingly minimal amount of fanservice. I'm not sure if this will increase as we continue, but I kind of doubt it as the anime has set itself up to be mainly about volleyball and character development/relationships. I know, surprising right? A sports anime with women as protagonists that is ACTUALLY about the sport they're playing?? Revolutionary.Now mind you, yes, there is fan service. There are butts and boobs, and they do wear bikinis. But all of this is pretty normal in beach volleyball. Now just hear me out...As someone who's played court and beach volleyball for about 11 or 12 years now (and participated in both tournaments and school matches), I can positively say that this anime is surprisingly accurate to beach volleyball. Yes, we wear bikinis when we play. Yes, we do tend to wear tighter bottoms and tops so everything stays in place better. And yes, we get to pick the matching bikinis we want to wear so it can be as conservative (if a bikini can be that) or scandalous as the pair wants. I was excited to see how much accurate information was given about the sport from the outfits to the actual rules and shots themselves. You can actually learn a lot about beach volleyball and how to play it from this anime.I also love how it's women playing beach volleyball. I have loved both volleyball and anime from a young age, so I've been waiting for a volleyball anime with women in it for a very long time. We got Haikyuu, which I was happy about, but was still frustrated with because they even made it a conflict in the beginning how their middle school didn't have a men's volleyball team because it's such a female dominated sport. So if mainly women play it, why not have a sports anime about women instead?Overall, I believe this anime deserves more love. It has surprisingly minimal fan service but plentiful and accurate information about beach volleyball. I think this anime will surprise people with it's focus on character development and the relationship development between the pairs. People who want to enjoy an anime with gorgeous animation about how some girls love playing beach volleyball while learning about beach volleyball with the main character as she develops into a full-fledged player, and doesn't mind a little fan service along the way, should watch Harukana Receive.UPDATE: After finishing Harukana Receive, I still stand by most of this review. The animation was pretty with some exceptions, that being episode 7's terrible CGI. Around episode 7 is when it got a bit cringy and they seemed to rush the story. I much would have preferred to see them training, honing in on new tricks and techniques, and doing practice matches or smaller tournaments before the prelims. Some of what I liked in the beginning got lost because of this rush. That on top of ep 7 and some cringy moments made me drop my score down to a 7. I still enjoyed watching this anime though, especially since it picked back up at the end with the prelims. I just wish the whole anime could have been as good as that last match. Still recommend it to those who enjoy watching girls develop as characters through beach volleyball. the story was crap (which it's not), the animation alone makes this anime a treat to watch.The voice acting and music in the anime is nice, with some numbers shining more than others.

Watching how cute, sportic ladies give their best in highly sportsmanship-like sport while occasionally hugging each others or falling over each others and ""accidentally"" groping some tits while doing so, is definitely the core of any sports.However, Harukana Receive is about beach volleyball, which is a bit different from normal volleyball because you play it on sand, outdoors, in pairs of two, and apparently make cute anime girl sounds whenever hitting the ball. This show is not a masterpiece of ecchi...like Keijo is, nor a beastiality wish fulfillment like Uma Musume, but hits the fanservice bucket with sexy women wearing bikini so hard it could as well be the censored version of both hentai series: Fault and Nudist Beach.The characters are incredible. The other one is a tall girl with big boobs and the another short girl with small boobs. Since it\'s a 2 person game, this is clearly the best route when it comes to design. I am personally prepared to receive just about anything from any of them.. possibly even volleyballs. Both of them do have personalities, and are supposed to be friends, but they prove to be quite distant. Then they discover this sport and start becoming closer. This is a pretty good excuse for the series, tbh, and it\'s been handled in rather comfy manner which serves the atmosphere for sure.The approach of our ecchi fanservice is respectable. If you are watching this show for what it is, there is little to no reason to criticize it for its content. For one, all our cast is fun to follow, and moreover, their personalities are always prioritized over their sexy bodies. For that matter, Harukana Receive has done good choices. None of our characters is a nympho. They all are sports ladies whose favorite past time is indeed playing beach volleyball and not sucking dicks. I approve.The art is beyond bright, and has a real summer feel to it. Lot is put in consideration when the games take place at the beach. The water is constantly present, the bikinis are pretty, and same can be said about the skin of our girls. As a person who has been rewarded with a fetish for tanlines, I am hyped. All of these bring out the sexiness --that this show promotes-- rather well. The weirdest part is how they manage to play any of it without wearing sunglasses.As a conclusion, watching those balls bounce all-around might shock some viewers, so I would rather recommend watching this anime instead of watching me watch the anime. like Keijo is, nor a beastiality wish fulfillment like Uma Musume, but hits the fanservice bucket with sexy women wearing bikini so hard it could as well be the censored version of both hentai series: Fault and Nudist Beach.The characters are incredible.

Both of them do have personalities, and are supposed to be friends, but they prove to be quite distant. Then they discover this sport and start becoming closer. This is a pretty good excuse for the series, tbh, and it\'s been handled in rather comfy manner which serves the atmosphere for sure.The approach of our ecchi fanservice is respectable. If you are watching this show for what it is, there is little to no reason to criticize it for its content. For one, all our cast is fun to follow, and moreover, their personalities are always prioritized over their sexy bodies. For that matter, Harukana Receive has done good choices. None of our characters is a nympho. They all are sports ladies whose favorite past time is indeed playing beach volleyball and not sucking dicks. I approve.The art is beyond bright, and has a real summer feel to it. Lot is put in consideration when the games take place at the beach. The water is constantly present, the bikinis are pretty, and same can be said about the skin of our girls. As a person who has been rewarded with a fetish for tanlines, I am hyped. All of these bring out the sexiness --that this show promotes-- rather well. The weirdest part is how they manage to play any of it without wearing sunglasses.As a conclusion, watching those balls bounce all-around might shock some viewers, so I would rather recommend watching this anime instead of watching me watch the anime.', '""Anything can be better if there are hot anime girls in it."" - Cultured gentleman, Agent_RedactedThere are countless anime with fanservice. As an edgy individual, I for the most part find them idiotic and inarticulately retarded as they do nothing more but satisfy one\'s lecherous desires. In any case, does that really suggest that all types of fanservice are bad? That’s what I always thought until I watched Harukana Receive. A hidden gem, and in all likelihood one of the best sports anime I’ve ever watched.Harukana Receive has a straightforward and simple story. Girls playing beach volleyball competitively. In spite of the fact...that the story is simple I find the concept of it quite captivating as an exceptionally cultured individual. Harukana Receive has a fanservice which is unique in contrast to a large portion of anime with fanservice out there. This sort of fanservice Harukana Receive has is rarely used however it very well could potentially be very viable on the off chance that it could to be used quite effectively. I call this the ""natural fanservice"". Allow me to clarify the differences between a typical and a natural fanservice.Typically an ordinary fanservice comprises of perverted shots and abundance of one\'s perversion acts. For example, grabbing a girl’s boobs and zooming in to see the hands diving and digging profoundly into her Schwerer Gustav-typed cannon as she makes an irregular, abnormal sound that stimulates ( arouses ) the majority of the hormone-uncontrollable men who are or were watching the scene. However, for a natural fanservice :Rather than causing it to feel like an ""excess"" it feels more ""natural"" henceforth ""natural fanservice"". Well sure, now and then the camera angles and zooming can be equivalent to a normal fanservice but a natural fanservice’s fanservice feels more natural. It doesn\'t stand out as much as a normal fanservice, making it natural. This may sound bad already, but I can assure you that it is excellent and well done. It doesn\'t really drive individuals into arousal states but instead allows oneself to choose if we ought to get stimulated or not. There\'s a decision and you can choose whether to think about one or another. Thus it is good.Another beneficial thing about Harukana Receive is the fact that it has Yuri baits. A considerable amount and enough for an anime that is not categorized as Yuri. The amount is right and I can detect it unmistakably. This anime has some great Yuri baits, I tell you.The other good thing about Harukana Receive is it\'s really not that awful as a Slice of life. No doubt, the main character’s development feels somewhat like it\'s too rushed but generally speaking it\'s actually acceptable as a CGDCT SoL. Furthermore, despite the fact that Harukana Receive is a sports anime it\'s just girls. Girls everywhere. And we all cultured men know that if there are hot anime girls anything can become better.The art and quality is also excellent. That is fine. Nothing to say. The sound is additionally acceptable. That is also fine. Nothing to say. What about the characters?Well obviously, with sports anime there\'ll certainly be drama. And yes this anime does not escape from the sports drama. But bruh, c\'mon. A part of the joy from watching a sports anime is from the drama. If you can\'t even take that then why even watch a sports anime in the first place. Okay, I\'m going off a little bit now. So I\'m saying that there is drama between characters. That\'s about it. Other than that, the character designs are good, the character developments are slightly cliche because of the 12-episode-rush-cliche but I think that it wasn\'t that bad for a 12 episode SoL sports anime. All in all there\'s not really anything wrong with the characters.I made some incredible memories watching this show. Tragically it ended quite fast. You don\'t have a clue how many times I screamed during the last episode. Haha, it was marvelous.Recommended to the individuals who desire a touch of fanservice ( not over the top ) as well as individuals who are looking for a CGDCT ( technically ) and sports drama ( a little ). that the story is simple I find the concept of it quite captivating as an exceptionally cultured individual.

A show with outstanding characters as well as terrific matches. But most importantly it portrays the true elegance and beauty of beach volleyball. Although less about the ""Xs and Os"" of the sport, it does something that makes you relate and resonate with the passion and intensity the sport can be.Starting off, the story is pretty straightforward. Nothing to write home about. But it works. It allows each character regardless of their screen time to shine. It is definitely a character driven show.The characters are an absolutely gem. Every single one you meet is an...absolute delight to watch. They are all add something to the cast (although some more quickly than others) It is a debate on who the ""MC"" really is, but for the most part, it follows Haruka and how she grew both as a volleyball player and as a person throughout the show. She was a typical scrub when things started out, but the way she and many others matured was amazing.OP and ED are solid. OST really shines in the middle of matches though. Art style is pretty good. Excellent use of closeups and pan outs in matches. As for the ecchi element, it is prevalent, but never takes away from the moment.Can\'t recommend this show enough. Never a dull moment as every scene feels like it is building towards the finale (which was absolutely excellent) A ton of comedy in here as well. This show is just about having a good time. Don\'t expect convoluted drama or anything similar. It is the bonds of the characters as well as terrific beach volleyball that make this show a must watch of the 2018 Summer season. absolute delight to watch.

The end result is an anime that is telling us to just sit back...and relax, and watch this while not taking it seriously. Quite honestly, it\'s a somewhat competent show that while only bears very minimal similarity towards its male-gender focused cousin (Haikyuu!) in terms of the sport represented (it\'s volleyball, only on the beach instead of in school), it\'s pretty much its own story and context while representing the female-gender side.Harukana Receive is, dare I say, an average generic show with nothing to offer but with its busty-boobie girls that kinda resembled like Keijo!!!!! in terms of storytelling and character development. The only kicker that deviates from the norm is the aforementioned CGDCT light-hearted cliche, where characters spend time practicing and motivating each other through their early struggles to make their time spent worthwhile with improving competency. Nothing groundbreaking, but yet stands out like a sore thumb.This series tells the story (and progressing growth) of 2 (largely-focused MC) girls :Haruka Oozora, with said troupe of a transfer student (and you can toss that out by the end of Episode 1 because there\'s no follow-up) and a total beginner towards beach volleyball;Kanata Higa, the experienced player and pro-status enough to play at competitions, but her waning confidence setting off the chain of events, that cost her to question her motives for playing the sport and recapturing the passion of beach volleyball once again.So first off, the elephant in the room lies in the story, which isn\'t really compelling to warrant proceeding episodes, because of a certain scriptwriter: Touko Machida. Her works include the cheap knock-off that is Dive! and the decently-made Akashic Records, to which the stories feel somewhat rushed and/or missing some plot pointers that leaves more questions than answers unanswered. Even going in with the first few episodes, the resemblance to aforementioned series clearly shows, and that doesn\'t get any better with proceeding episodes, right until the final moments of the series. But this is still an effort that\'s worth somewhat better than how Keijo!!!!! did.As for character development, there are a few and then some.Main girls duo Haruka and Kanata (that\'s why said title is called Harukana) are basically plot pointers, the anchors to show us viewers that they are not just stepping stones by the others who are willing to see them that way, and persistently with their step-by-step building-up of efforts, they made it count towards the end while having some light Yuri moments with each other.The supporting cast are the direct contrast to Harukana: plot movers along a not-so-aggressive storyline.Narumi Tooi, once worked with Kanata as junior pros before Kanata lost her footing and made Narumi become another Ayano (losing at the finals). Unwilling to forgive her partner and (somehow) reasoning with Kanata\'s progress that she was ""too harsh"" on her and simply couldn\'t take her on after the whole fiasco. And with time comes healing, and finally, recognition that both herself and Kanata are polar opposites.The Thomas sisters, Claire and Emily, the example to follow and Harukana\'s coach before the next competition arc. This part is easier to discern as hard work makes up for the amount of talent that they have, winning competition after competition and offering both girlish MCs constant practical tips and tricks before the direct confrontation at the end of the series (spoiler alert...).Last but not least, the somewhat late addition to the team, Akari Ooshiro, a high-school idol that\'s famous from a certain CM that comes forward to join the 4 girls for the school beach volleyball club (of which not surprisingly there\'s no progression to it thereafter), and is there to maintain good relations between Harukana and the Thomas sisters, and why not albeit learn some beach volleyball as well!Overall, where there\'s good moments, the bad moments reside in as a ripple effect that not everyone has sweet rosy lives to deal with, and the repercussions (or stakes) are significant towards the growth of others, blemishing all that passion into something that will either make or break the characters.The one thing I am able to give credit for this show is with the insane amount to detail for both the art and animation. This is studio C2C\'s comeback work in over 4 years as the lead studio (other than co-production with Satelight for SukaSuka in Spring 2017), and credits to director Toshiyuki Kubooka from the expertise of his work on the Berserk: The Golden Age trilogy of movies. The attention to detail from the beautiful, gorgeous and striking 2D background art scenes, to the clean CGI volleyball movements and sand-hit markings from the matches, just makes this appealing to the quality elitists like myself for good art and animation. But as we all know, one good area doesn\'t make up for the rest of the shortcomings of this show.The music however, it\'s really meh, hell, I thought it could be better. Most VAs (with the exception of Claire\'s VA, Atsumi Tanezaki) are new and upcoming seiyuus, especially Kanata\'s VA (her very first TV anime work). Despite all that, the light-hearted aspect of the show makes the OST more appealing to those who just want to have a laid-back experience. I think this is a decent job done as it pretty much describes the series in the utmost generalist of terms.Despite that insane ""low"" score from MAL (which I think is a lenient joke), is it a great watch though? Hell yes it is...only if you don\'t see this at face-value, and adding to that, the fanservice intensity, of which there are few.Harukana Receive is not a show for everyone, with its minimalistic approaches yet solid animation production that divides the audience all around. If you can put up with the rushed storyline and yet watch the characters grow from strength to strength, I say go for it, it\'s a good time. and relax, and watch this while not taking it seriously.

If you were to look through all of my favorites and the shows I rank highly you would find a lot of CDCGT that I gave a high score to. I also like sports shows and find them as a good way to get hype and experience the highs and lows of competition without the negative ramifications of death or other dark results like with some shounen. A pairing between the two seems odd and when combined with the echii tag there are a lot of distinct parts that are mixed together. And while I think it can be done...well sadly Harukana Reviece missed the mark.The show starts off with drama and while I did like the drama it had and the exploration of the characters it provided it did pose a problem. Part of the joy of a CGDCT is the cute meaningless antics that the characters get into and while there were some, there wasnt enough for the genre it was in. Furthermore because the start was drama and the end consisted of 3 episodes worth of one match this led the show to be strapped on time. In fact it pretty much did a time skip askewing a lot the more SOL moments to get to the volleyball.While the volleyball was good, it made the show feel incomplete. While it talks a lot about the strength of the characters bonds and relies a lot on attachment to the characters, it's hard to get the true feeling of attachment when many of those attachment gaining moments were breezed over. The problem is sports anime tend to be long and focus a lot on moments of high tension. While this can work with CGDCT if they alternate, they both need time in order to shine. And for this combo one cour isnt enough. Not if both peaks are to be fit in well. And while the matches were nicely animated and fun to watch, the tournament structure was boring and really only one match had all of the tension. Not to mention the way that, that match came about was lackluster imo. While the idea behind it was good I felt like it was forced to happen sooner due to time and increased drama more than anything else.The characters did have some good motivations and the starting idea was great. I liked the development of Kanata, and how she was able to overcome her previous shortcomings and get out of her funk, but the rest of the characters really could have used some more time to focus on them. Their initial characterization was promising but for the show to do what it wanted to do well I feel like more would have been helpful.Overall there's a lot of good ideas in Harukana Reviece and the fanservice and visuals are nice, but in the end the pacing let's it down and I'm left wishing it had two cours to properly explore its ideas. It's still a good show but ultimately leaves with promise it couldn't capitalize on. well sadly Harukana Reviece missed the mark.The show starts off with drama and while I did like the drama it had and the exploration of the characters it provided it did pose a problem.

The subject matter? Beach volleyball!C2C are the makers of literally nothing else important and certainly nothing you've ever heard about.Much like New Game! and other cute girl shows, Harukana features a grand total of 0 male characters.The premise is that Haruka Oozora, a very tall athletic girl, moves to Okinawa to live with her grandmother and cousin, Kanata Higa. It was chance, or perhaps fate, that had her witness a game of beach volleyball one morning and immediately fall in love with the sport. Simultaneously, she also learns...that Kanata used to be a very talented player, but she quit because of an inferiority complex regarding her height. With the Junior Tournament just weeks away, will she succeed in learning the intricacies of competitive beach volleyball in time? Will she be able to help Kanata shake off the crippling anxiety she feels towards the sport she used to love?Harukana Receive made for a strange viewing experience because it constantly tried to be something it’s not. Let me be frank. This is a fanservice show. To pretend otherwise is to be delusional. One MAL reviewer writes: “I went into this show expecting it to be a full-on fanservice machine, until I was quickly proven wrong in that it has a well-grounded story behind it.” Oh, shut up. A well-oiled fanservice machine is exactly what it is. There's enough cameltoe, ass, tits, jigging, bouncing, and yuri bait (oh, so much yuri bait) in here to make Tatsuya Egawa proud. Am I upset about that? Not at all! The drawings are a cut above the average ecchi show in terms of polish, and the sex appeal in and of itself is an order of magnitude more tasteful and natural-feeling. It looked extremely sexy and I must confess I very much enjoyed it.What I did not enjoy was how seriously the show took itself and how seriously it expected you, the viewer, to take it as well. No, I’m not going to take your drama seriously while you constantly throw girls with giant heads and enormously colorful eyes in my face, incessantly exclaiming things like “Kya!” and “Teehee!” while frolicking around on the beach in amazingly tight swimsuits. The constant somber tone, the emotional flashbacks, the melodramatic backstories, it just got to be too much after a while and I simply tuned out. If you want to make a show about hot girls wearing bikinis 2 sizes too small and swinging around tits too big for their age, by all means, go forth and do the Lord’s work, my fellow man of culture – but then don't try and turn around and pretend you've made Captain Tsubasa.I am reminded of Bill Burr’s wisdom in regards to plastic surgery. There's nothing wrong with being 52 and looking 52, but there is something unnerving about being 52 and looking like a 28-year-old lizard. Stop it. Just be who and/or what you are.Just like Showgirls will never be Citizen Kane and Caitlyn Jenner will never be a woman, so, too, will Harukana Receive never be Slam Dunk.Besides, it's fucking beach volleyball, yo. As an individual who is personally not at all interested in sports, I have found sports anime to have the amazing ability to make all manner of sports interesting to me in the context of the given show. My middle name is Raul, but it’s supposed to be pronounced Raúl. My father named me after Raúl González, the famous Spanish football player. My old man hoped that I would grow up to be a football fan like him. Suffice it to say that it did not go his way. However, while I would not be caught dead watching an actual football match, I've gone an entire day without food because I was too busy binging Galactick Football (yes, I know it's a French cartoon, not anime, shut the fuck up). Same goes for basketball. I've never had an interest in it, but Kuroko no Basket has become one of my favorite anime of all time.But fucking beach volleyball, yo? Like, I understand that I'm somewhat of an exception in that I do not care about any sports, not even the popular ones, but honestly, who in the world actually gives a shit about beach volleyball? Don't get me wrong, I’m sure there are people who care about it and take it seriously, but enough to center an entire TV show around it??? Would anyone have watched this show had it not been for the half-naked girls posing suggestively every 30 seconds? Don't answer that. It's a rhetorical question.This kind of felt like the 2007 film, Pride. “They were Philadelphia’s first all-African American swim team! Pride, determination, and resilience!” Really? It’s all the way down to swimming, is it? Yeah, you know what, I don't think I really give a shit anymore. I'm all out of white guilt.The very first line in Harukana is some esoteric speech about how there are only two kinds of sports, solo sports and team sports, and among team sports, beach volley is unique in that teams consist only of 2 players, which is why it is of paramount importance to find that one special irreplaceable partner whom you can trust with your life, not unlike a marriage – I told you there’s is a lot of yuri bait in here. Setting aside the overly dramatic musings of the author, that's not even factually correct. Beach volley is not the only sport played in doubles. There’s doubles badminton, curling, tennis, pickleball, footvolley, squash, table tennis, and then a variety of other competitive sports that do not have a direct adversarial format, such as pair figure skating, synchronized diving, motorcycle sidecar racing, bobsleigh, kayaking, and so on, and so forth. Granted, none of these sports are widely known mainstream iconic activities, but then again, neither is beach volley.All the talk about dreams, goals, rivalries, becoming better, stronger, faster, evolving, the trauma of defeat, trust & betrayal, putting everything on the line, dedicating one’s self to the craft, and lifelong ambitions left me completely cold. What lifelong ambitions, bro? You've literally not been alive long enough to have any of those. Why are you crying after losing a match in some random inconsequential local tournament like you just watched Old Yeller get shot? When Haruka once ignorantly states in jest that maybe she’ll become an ace, an out-of-proportion edgy character gives her a smoldering death stare and declares in the most hard-boiled way possible that there is no such thing as an ace in beach volley – somehow making another esoteric point about the selfless nature of the sport. Yeah, ok, relax, Hot Topic. You’re not storming Normandy here. It's just fucking beach volleyball, yo. It does not matter. Does this make me a hypocrite given how invested I get in video games and how emotional I get when others tell me “It’s just a game!”? Perhaps, but it doesn't change how I feel. The simple fact of the matter is that I wasn’t sold.Speaking of hypocrisy, there is another very similar show towards which I have been much more positive. Free! is a Kyoto Animation production about a bunch of ridiculously attractive young guys swimming. While I don't want to belabor the point of Free! too much here, for I will write a proper essay about it in the future, there are 4 key differences between the two shows to consider.First, swimming is just straight up a significantly more mainstream and relatable sport than beach volley. I'm not saying that swimming is some kind of international phenomenon like football or golf, but compared to beach volley, it may as well be. Second, male sexuality and female sexuality are not equivalent and I have neither the time, nor the patience to pretend they are. Third, with very few exceptions – 2 or 3 if memory serves – what I have seen of Free! (the first 2 seasons) does not feature any creepy close-up shots of the guys’ abs or pecs. You get to see them shirtless a lot, but given the subject matter, it never feels unnatural. Put another way, Free! features precious little shots or camera angles that would get a real-life cameraman fired at, say, the Olympics. Take the key visuals of this show as an indication that Harukana Receive, well… does. Fourth and last, the difference in animation between Harukana and Free! cannot be overstated. I often make this point, but the value of presentation mustn’t be overlooked. As DigiBro famously said, aesthetic is narrative. Kyoto Animation could make a show about watching grass grow and there isn't a shadow of a doubt in my mind that it would still be intensely compelling and interesting purely on the merit of how beautiful the animation and artwork would be.Still, as long as you're fine ignoring the pretentious themes and tone of the show, it's a surprisingly competent production considering its relative obscurity.If you like cute girl shows and especially sexual fanservice, you'll have a good time with this one! If all you're looking for is something to scratch an itch for thicc anime bitches, I would argue there are other ecchi shows that are more… direct in their approach, but Harukana’s artwork is difficult to beat. Additionally, if you're passionate about beach volleyball, you'll love it. Keep in mind, though, that it does not have much of anything to offer aside from that. that Kanata used to be a very talented player, but she quit because of an inferiority complex regarding her height. With the Junior Tournament just weeks away, will she succeed in learning the intricacies of competitive beach volleyball in time? Will she be able to help Kanata shake off the crippling anxiety she feels towards the sport she used to love?Harukana Receive made for a strange viewing experience because it constantly tried to be something it’s not. Let me be frank. This is a fanservice show. To pretend otherwise is to be delusional. One MAL reviewer writes: “I went into this show expecting it to be a full-on fanservice machine, until I was quickly proven wrong in that it has a well-grounded story behind it.” Oh, shut up. A well-oiled fanservice machine is exactly what it is. There's enough cameltoe, ass, tits, jigging, bouncing, and yuri bait (oh, so much yuri bait) in here to make Tatsuya Egawa proud. Am I upset about that? Not at all! The drawings are a cut above the average ecchi show in terms of polish, and the sex appeal in and of itself is an order of magnitude more tasteful and natural-feeling. It looked extremely sexy and I must confess I very much enjoyed it.What I did not enjoy was how seriously the show took itself and how seriously it expected you, the viewer, to take it as well. No, I’m not going to take your drama seriously while you constantly throw girls with giant heads and enormously colorful eyes in my face, incessantly exclaiming things like “Kya!” and “Teehee!” while frolicking around on the beach in amazingly tight swimsuits. The constant somber tone, the emotional flashbacks, the melodramatic backstories, it just got to be too much after a while and I simply tuned out. If you want to make a show about hot girls wearing bikinis 2 sizes too small and swinging around tits too big for their age, by all means, go forth and do the Lord’s work, my fellow man of culture – but then don't try and turn around and pretend you've made Captain Tsubasa.I am reminded of Bill Burr’s wisdom in regards to plastic surgery. There's nothing wrong with being 52 and looking 52, but there is something unnerving about being 52 and looking like a 28-year-old lizard. Stop it. Just be who and/or what you are.Just like Showgirls will never be Citizen Kane and Caitlyn Jenner will never be a woman, so, too, will Harukana Receive never be Slam Dunk.Besides, it's fucking beach volleyball, yo. As an individual who is personally not at all interested in sports, I have found sports anime to have the amazing ability to make all manner of sports interesting to me in the context of the given show. My middle name is Raul, but it’s supposed to be pronounced Raúl. My father named me after Raúl González, the famous Spanish football player. My old man hoped that I would grow up to be a football fan like him. Suffice it to say that it did not go his way. However, while I would not be caught dead watching an actual football match, I've gone an entire day without food because I was too busy binging Galactick Football (yes, I know it's a French cartoon, not anime, shut the fuck up). Same goes for basketball. I've never had an interest in it, but Kuroko no Basket has become one of my favorite anime of all time.But fucking beach volleyball, yo? Like, I understand that I'm somewhat of an exception in that I do not care about any sports, not even the popular ones, but honestly, who in the world actually gives a shit about beach volleyball? Don't get me wrong, I’m sure there are people who care about it and take it seriously, but enough to center an entire TV show around it??? Would anyone have watched this show had it not been for the half-naked girls posing suggestively every 30 seconds? Don't answer that. It's a rhetorical question.This kind of felt like the 2007 film, Pride. “They were Philadelphia’s first all-African American swim team! Pride, determination, and resilience!” Really? It’s all the way down to swimming, is it? Yeah, you know what, I don't think I really give a shit anymore. I'm all out of white guilt.The very first line in Harukana is some esoteric speech about how there are only two kinds of sports, solo sports and team sports, and among team sports, beach volley is unique in that teams consist only of 2 players, which is why it is of paramount importance to find that one special irreplaceable partner whom you can trust with your life, not unlike a marriage – I told you there’s is a lot of yuri bait in here. Setting aside the overly dramatic musings of the author, that's not even factually correct. Beach volley is not the only sport played in doubles. There’s doubles badminton, curling, tennis, pickleball, footvolley, squash, table tennis, and then a variety of other competitive sports that do not have a direct adversarial format, such as pair figure skating, synchronized diving, motorcycle sidecar racing, bobsleigh, kayaking, and so on, and so forth. Granted, none of these sports are widely known mainstream iconic activities, but then again, neither is beach volley.All the talk about dreams, goals, rivalries, becoming better, stronger, faster, evolving, the trauma of defeat, trust & betrayal, putting everything on the line, dedicating one’s self to the craft, and lifelong ambitions left me completely cold. What lifelong ambitions, bro? You've literally not been alive long enough to have any of those. Why are you crying after losing a match in some random inconsequential local tournament like you just watched Old Yeller get shot?

She revitalizes her cousin and together they learn from each other and build friendships.  Opposing teams have backstories that show the dynamics of every match, and everyone finds each other's strengths and plays to them.

The way they portrayed Okinawa, it\'s very vibrant. It makes you want to visit the place.

A group of cute girls in their swimsuits playing the game they love at the beach. No execces drama, bad sportsmanship or bitchy rivalry (coughs Hanebado).Plot: 7The plot is simple and the characters may not be the most complex, however I feel this show does a lot of things well.The story is about a transfer student Haruka and her ex pro cousin Kanata, who used to play volleyball after some circumstances. It’s not long till Haruka embraces her newfound love for beach volleyball and...convinces Kanata to step back on the sand again and team up with her to form the beach volleyball pair, Harukana.Characters: 7The characters are all distinctive, memorable and receive a decent amount of character development. The show especially deals well with Kanata’s past, her relationship with Narumi and the reason she stopped playing volleyball.Animation: 8The animation was great. Theres some great close ups of volleyball shots. I appreciate the use of slow mo’s, but I think they’re should have been a lot less as it slowed the pace of the match at times.Sounds: 8The opening and osts are fun, energetic and lively which work perfectly for a sports anime about beach volleyball.Overall: 7I’ve always said Harukana receive is like the spirit sister of Haikyuu!

I only made it through the first six episodes before dropping it. Because it's only twelve episodes long, I was planning on finishing it even if I wasn't enjoying it but the amount of genuine anger this show made me feel for some reason caused me to stop half way through.To start with, let's talk about the characters. As I just said, I dropped the show at episode six and at this point in the show there is not a single character who I don't find obnoxious or annoying....I did start off liking some of the characters when they were first introduced, like Kanata, but as I continued watching the show I just grew to dislike them.I'd also like to talk about the random introductions of new characters that supposedly know the pre-established cast but, honestly, they seem kind of shoehorned in because the plot needs them to be there. None of the relationships between the characters seem genuine and it's hard to get invested in them because of this.Also, there were moments between characters who are supposed to be related, such as Haruka and Kanata (first cousins) and Emily and Claire (sisters), with had romantic or even slightly sexual undertones that just made me extremely uncomfortable but I could've been reading these moments wrong.Personally, I found it to be confusing to follow the plot at times due to the random skips in time that aren't really acknowledged at all, you're just expected to know that there was a time skip when you watch it. Like, one moment they're on the beach, then they're at school, then they're at some indoor gym all in the space of five minutes. It's confusing and makes the flow really choppy which is one of the many reasons that I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this show.I just wish I could've brought myself to finish the show but I really don't think I can continue it without getting angry again.

If you look past the ecchi zoom-ins and treat it as a sports anime, it's actually not that bad. Heck, I'd even consider removing the ecchi tag. The characters are cute and have a decent head on their shoulders, and the sports action animation is decent (the ball animation seems iffy to me). Character development is shown through skill improvement and we are shown their efforts through their trainings and matches. The anime also focuses on the dynamics of beach volleyball - on how it is (should be) played, the tactics involved, and its difference from typical indoor volleyball. Overall,...I give it a yes. I give it a yes."", 'When they titled this ""Harukana Receive"" original creator  Nyoi, Jizai knows exactly whats he is making, and  yes it\'s about a city slicker Haruka Oozora and a former beach volleyball aficionado who already hanged up her mantle , Kanata Higa, who found themselves competing in a beach volleyball tournament with the latter finding himself going back to the very sport that she used to play before with her former partner, Tooi Narumi, Though ""receive"" maybe a volleyball term, here (be it in the manga or anime) it also means that they receive the mantle of being Japan\'s best in the sport of Beach...Volleyball.

However, I continued watching this show because the story and action were really well done and hooked me in to the experience.This show isn’t anything ground breaking in terms of visuals but the action looks fairly intense and the designs are honestly great. Lots of simple things made me like the style from the eyes to the girls themselves and even the sky summer atmosphere.The story is a slight twist on a beginner suddenly getting good through...trial and error, which is nice. They add in a cousin who had previously played and suffered hardship. I think this helps the girls grow together and become a great pair. I like the aspect of having a rival at the top and having the second best teach them to get there.This anime isn’t without flaws though. I felt they spent too much time with the bonding of characters sometimes with random scenes and an introduction to a girl later in the show felt completely unnecessary, minus one plot point. I felt this time could’ve been better showing the progress of the girls to make their jump in power more believable. I say this because they seemingly get super OP with a beginner in a matter of months which frankly makes no sense.I felt more connected later in the show with the Emily and Claire pair because of their background stories and how they helped along our MC pair. The match between the two to go to nationals was great and I honestly didn’t know who would win or who to root for. I really wish I could get more of this especially with the ending scenes. trial and error, which is nice. They add in a cousin who had previously played and suffered hardship.

I like the voice acting, graphics, and the music was fine. There was a coloration of some of the anime characters' eyes that I had not seen before. Can’t say if it was good or bad, just personal preference on how you like the eyes of anime characters drawn, but do give them points for at least trying to be original. I thought it was an interesting concept to not have any males aside from small children in the show, but dude to block out the face of...Kanata’s deceased father while showing the mother is just messed up. I actually thought the show up to the end of the first tournament was quite good. Then the show just starts going downhill. Overall, I have three major complaints with the anime.The first is that it is very long-winded and can be very slow - it was downright boring at times. There is very little character development in the show and it relies too heavily on flashbacks. They should have just spent the first three or four episodes using flashbacks but then left them alone for the rest of the show. They also pull that stunt where they will replay the last few minutes of the previous episode, like we didn’t just watch it. You can tell the writers and director were having a difficult time filling twelve episodes worth of story.The second is the lack of character behavior diversity in the show. I noticed that pretty much every volleyball team had players that acted nearly the same. Each team has an outspoken hothead and a subdued coolheaded individual. Every team ends up feeling pretty much the same; characters feel just way too similar at times. Haruka, Claire, and Ayasa almost feel like the exact same character.My third complaint is actually the development of Haruka, and Kanata to a lesser extent, in regards to volleyball ability. Basically, they are too good. You are telling me a rookie with one year under her belt and someone who had not been active in years, who only won one match in last year's tournament ends up defeating the defending champions and the second best team in Japan?! A team that has never stopped training and has a pro volleyball coach as a mother?! GET OUT OF HERE! I would be fine if it was a close match due to them training together, but Haruka and Kanata winning the tournament? That is too hard to swallow and breaks the immersion.I really enjoy volleyball myself and had high hopes for this show as I really enjoy Japanese sports anime. However, with slow plot development, characters with little diversity in the way they behave, and Mary-Sue like characters that are somehow able to beat top athletes with a fraction of the time and training everyone else had put in, this is unfortunately one anime I cannot recommend.

Harukana Receive focuses on Haruka Oozora voiced by Kana Yuuki a rather tall individual who is of the genki variant but is rather shy about her height, when she comes across beach volleyball and the fact of her cousin Kanata Higa voiced by Saki Miyashita used to be a pro-beach volleyball player, gets Haruka\'s blood rushing to playing beach volleyball.Harukana Receive gives us for the...most part, character development or more precisely relational development between several of the cast members, the most prominently is of course Haruka and Kanata as they grow their teamwork and cover each others weakness in matches. Haruka being as tall as she is has her advantages, however being a beginner has her downsides in not knowing the tricks of beach volleyball at the start. On the other side, due to Kanata\'s experience in beach volleyball she knows the ""court"" much better even with her short stature, thus the pair help each other cover their weakness and even learn something about their weakness in the process of their matches they face. Because of this the statement at the start of this review of ""there are no aces in beach volleyball"" rings true.Thing is even if the anime is mostly focused on Haruka and Kanata growing as a pair in order for Kanata\'s goal of wanting to face off with her ex-partner Narumi Tooi voiced by Miyuri Shimabukuro and be champions, character development isn\'t merely isolated towards Haruka and Kanata as even some of the pairs opponents are given some glimpses as to why they want to win as well as Haruka and Kanata\'s similar theming of having each others back with covering their weakness as well, so not only does the opponents make for ""rivals"" but good contrast to Haruka and Kanata. On speaking of the entire Narumi situation, besides character development there is a bit of backstory towards the entire ordeal between Kanata and Narumi which is a BIG focal point of the anime and what the anime and the main cast are striving to get to and though the anime never really gives us the ""proper"" match up between Haruka and Kana vs. Narumi, ultimately, it\'s not what Harukana Receive is about, yes plot-wise but for characters, it\'s more about their growing friendship and teamwork that\'s the center focus.Opponents and rivals aside, the support members do their fair shake, most prominently Akari Ooshiro voiced by Chisa Kimura, an ""idol"" wanting to play beach volleyball but through happenstance becomes a sorta manager to both Karuka and Kana pair as well as the Thomas pair, really her reaonsing to be in this anime and not be a typical supporting character is that she\'s the glue that sticks the Haruka and Thomas pair together which comes into effect latter down the anime and Akari is integral to the theming of friendship in this anime. Of course with supporting characters in a sports anime comes in the typical family support mainly in the form of Kana\'s grandmother.=, the supporting characters do what they do best in Harukana Receive and really it\'s the best they do, considering the anime is focused on it\'s main characters and rivals, so this is to be expected.Character-wise, most of the cast have their funny personality quirks, but in terms of LA\'s favourite character it\'ll have to easily be...Claire Thomas voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki, mainly her personality and shameless fanservice girl status but LA loves her for that for breaking the tension and being the best comedic relief in the anime. LA\'s second favourite would be Ayasa Tachibana voiced by Kanae Ito for being the sound of mind personality wanting to help mend Kanata and Narumi\'s relationship on the background. Now as LA did say that most of the cast have quirky personalities, for the most part none of the cast members were annoying or the rivals were annoying or intentionally evil, as LA said this is the lighter sports anime and it sticks to it and even the lighter sports anime can be like this and still succeed in being a good sports anime and that is all through the characters and their developments which Harukana Receive generally excels at.Beach volleyball = fanservice well no shit, but with the general moe aesthetic C2C used for animation in this anime, it\'s actually works in favour of the lighter sports anime genre which LA is completely fine with. Character designs have the spark of moe and exotic character designs so they are distinct even in different wears. The action which is mostly consisting of the volleyball matches are for the most still but fluid in all respects like C2C uses moving stills in some of the more intense moments but then ratchet things up when animating the volleyball matches. All in all, with the good character designs and good action beats of the volleyball matches, the animation done by C2C is pretty decent.Voice work has the fairly typical moe cadence from the entire cast though with their archetypes along with them. Kana Yuuki as Haruka is fairly genki and was LA\'s favorite seiyuu in the cast though Kanae Ito and Atsumi Tanezaki was pretty close too. Really there wasn\'t much on the voice work. Expected moe even for a sports anime.""Beach volleyball = fanservice"" and really the fanservice only gets as deep as a 24/7 bikini anime and lots of yuri undertones...*ahem* yuri tones all over the place, but nonetheless Harukana Receive doesn\'t push the fanservice in your face considering the outfit is kinda a default for this kind of anime and they keep the shots tame really, with some intentional ass shots (no really).Harukana Receive may be the laxxed sports anime compared to Hanebado! but nonetheless Harukana Receive is still pretty strong with it\'s own elements, from the theming of partners, decent animation and voice work, interesting characters (including rivals) within a typical underdog sports plot line but more focused on it\'s characters. Harukana Receive is a good slice of life, sports anime that doesn\'t need to be all intense and dramatic and instead has the...interesting characters, relationships, plot and the FANSERVICE and yuri undertones to back it up. LA doesn\'t think this isn\'t in LA\'s guilty pleasure animes either, it\'s actually good enough not for LA to feel guilty about it, Harukana Receive is pretty focused on it\'s characters and plot and little on it\'s fanservice thus it\'s a fairly competent sports anime featuring beach volleyball. most part, character development or more precisely relational development between several of the cast members, the most prominently is of course Haruka and Kanata as they grow their teamwork and cover each others weakness in matches.

There's not much to dislike. The art is bright and cheerful, it has an amazing, summer-y soundtrack, and there's a good mix of decent volleyball matches interspersed with butt/boob/implied yuri shots. What's not to love?The biggest issue with the series is just that...it's kinda dumb. There's nothing special about it whatsoever. The characters all have one of two personalities: aggressive, go-get-em genki, or a quiet intenseness that eventually...gives way to a good-natured kindness. Beach volleyball actually only takes up a small portion of the series, and the more slice-of-lifey bits are ho-hum. But beyond all that, my biggest gripe for the series is that you pretty much know after episode 1 how the season would end. I guess I kinda hoped things might play out in a more dramatic or tantalizing fashion, as they do in other gems of the sports genre -- Haikyuu!!, Chihayafuru, Prince of Tennis, etc. -- but no dice here.Oh well. Even with some 'meh' characters and a completely predictable outcome that passes for a plot, you will probably enjoy yourself when you watch this. Like summertime at the beach, it's light, fun, a chock full o' bikini buttslaps. gives way to a good-natured kindness.

Yes. Is this a story about people overcoming obstacles, both past, present and from within and external forces? Also yes.Outside of this the story is visually gorgeous, I particularly found myself falling in love with the over embellishment on the eyes and hair.About the only major elements where this story falls flat is sound and character. The beach volleyball sounds used...are solid, but definitely sound synthetic compared to the rest of the animes more organic sounding elements. The characters, while also solid do somewhat fall flat into typically overused tropes of ""tragic back story."" It\'s not too tropey as to prevent enjoyment or make you roll your eyes, but it\'s there.The fact that Harukana Receive provides both a level of fanservice one would expect and on top of it having an very touching story is nothing short of a miracle, but it leads to one of the most refreshingly unique anime I have found myself watching in a long time.

Sad because I tore my rotator cuff so badly my arm would never swing again like it did.

In addition to players movements, their body's  flexing , relaxing and bouncing moments calmly but passionately attract us. This animation reproduces the same things.Story is quite awesome. The awesomeness is not included in the first impression, but when you re-watch this series, you must notice it.Two examples are here.First one is Kanata's receive. Was she able to receive because Haruka believes in Kanata? It...seemed so. But the thing is bit more deep. In her memory, Kanata herself ignored the ball and Narumi received. Now Kanata is positioned to receive the ignored ball by her partner.For the second, Ai-Mai pair from the fourth story. That was Haru-Kana pair's first winning. The Ai-Mai pair is introduced just for the opponents?  No. At the time the two pairs first met, Ai, the taller girl, stared at both Haruka and Kanata. That scene implied Ai thought Haru-Kana has same problem as Ai's. So, the scenario which two sets of tall-short pairs were featured implies that Haru-Kana pair is not special at all.In this series, character development is not achieved by new special techniques,ie. Hissatu, or buffing status. Instead, MCs say gooby to the older herself and change their play style when it is required. The awesomeness is here. seemed so. But the thing is bit more deep.

As someone who both enjoys cute girls and haikyuu, I decided to give it a shot.From the preview, and length of the season, it was apparent this wasn't going to a tense, emotionally gripping sports anime, full of camaraderie and blood pumping moments.  This is very much the junk-food sports anime of the season.  While it manages to fill that role nicely, its ultimately forgettable anime that you will find yourself consuming, being satisfied just enough to warrant watching the next episode, and then forgetting it exists until you see...its name on your anime list.  Not bad, not good, just completely serviceable in what it was putting out.Solid animation, cute girls, cute girls wearing bikini's, cute girls in bikini's playing fuckin' volleyball.

To be honest, that was my first impression and one of the reasons I started watching it. Let's get it out of the way now - the girls are all very cute indeed and this is what drew me in. However, the show is much more than just cute girls wearing bathing suits. In fact, after a few episodes, I wasn't really paying all that...much attention to the service and found myself enjoying the plot - yes, the real plot.Story: The girls are all interesting and fun to watch, and for someone who doesn't really care too much about sports, I was thouroughly entertained and gripped by the story and competition. I give it overall an 8. My only real complaint here is that the series ended on a cliffhanger of sorts. For this reason, I did pick up the manga.Art: For a studio that I never heard of, I found the art and animation pretty good overall. There is quite a bit of CGI and sometimes it doesn't blend as well as it could have with the regular animation, but this is typical. As a manga reader, I felt the art was a bit of a step-up actually. The manga suffered from some inconstancy, especially when it comes to character bodies, whereas the anime did not. Also, did I mention these girls are extremely cute? Overall, I give the art a 7.Sound: Nothing really stood out to me here. The OP and the ED are fine. Nothing is great about the sound, but it's not bad either. The soundtrack does give off a good summer vibe. Overall, a 7 here as well.Characters: This is where the series shines. The girls are all really lovely. They have developed personalities and character traits that go beyond just their physical appearances - which, did I mention, these girls are extremely cute! Overall, a 9.Enjoyment: As you can probably tell by now, I enjoyed this series quite a bit. I think if you give it a chance, you will as well!

I honestly don\'t know why so many people think this anime is an ecchi or consider it extremely fanservicey; the sport is played in swimsuits, and as a result the girls are in swimsuits a majority of the show, which in my opinion isn\'t fanservice at all. If talk of fanservice is turning you off I\'d suggest it anyways, especially as there is little to no ""traditional"" fanservice in the realm of unnecessary shots and unbelievable physics.I\'ve tried so hard to find good sports anime with girl...protagonists that don\'t reduce the girls to just horny (Keijo!!!!!!), cute (Uma Musume: Pretty Derby), or disappointing (Hanebado!). While I do enjoy those shows, its super frustrating as a girl athlete to only see high quality men\'s sports anime, which is where Harukana Receive comes into play.While the premise may seem a bit straightforward, the way it plays out is super enjoyable, and it\'s really fun to see the girls grow better as well as their love for the sport growing. The story all in all isn\'t the driving factor of the show, but it definitely serves its purpose and makes for an exciting climax. The dramatic elements are realistic and played out well, and at no point did I feel that it was melodramatic in any way. The style is super pleasing and really fun, and really serves to push the setting of Okinawa by making everything seem even brighter than you might think it could be. One of the standout components was the composition, with music fitting the feel and setting fantastically thanks to the work of Machida Touko. Overall, the most shining part has to be the characters, all of which are fantastic to see grow and change through the show as they carry it with their own developments. My only complaint is the pacing, which can feel a bit strange at times, skipping months between episodes at times, but it\'s about what can be expected from a single cour show.All in all, I highly recommend Harukana Receive to anyone who enjoys either sports anime or the slice of life genre. I hope for more like it in the future, and would honestly love a second season! Until then I\'ll be waiting for the Spring 2020 season with Tamayomi, directed by Fukushima Toshinori, the director of Major S3-6 and featuring the same composer as Harukana. protagonists that don\'t reduce the girls to just horny (Keijo!!!!!!), cute (Uma Musume: Pretty Derby), or disappointing (Hanebado!).

Expect for booty shots and volleyball but don\'t expect ecchi stuff!', ""I have to be honest with you guys: I only watched this show because I heard Rasmus Faber would do the OST. I really dislike moe/CGDCT shows, I absolutely despise fan-service, and I have no interest in sport shows. That's why I dismissed Harukana Receive as another one of those shitty otaku pandering shows that come out every season when I first heard about it. When I found out about Faber's involvement, I was really afraid that his musical talent would get wasted again on some otaku trash (like with Asterisk War). However, to my pleasant surprise, this show was actually pretty good.The story wasn't...anything special but it was interesting enough to keep me engaged. What you see is what you get: a girl transferring to the oceanside and discovering her passion for beach volleyball.One thing that I really appreciate is the nuanced drama. While other sport shows tend to have over the top melodrama as context for the sport matches to keep the viewer engaged, Harukana Receive manages to do the same thing without relying on any batshit crazy twists/misunderstandings/any other drama causing scenarios. While there is drama it mostly doesn't create any unnecessary problems and when it does, they resolve quickly.Another thing I liked about this show is how the art encapsulates the feeling of summer really well. The brightly colored backdrops and character designs do add a lot to the aesthetic. While there are some awkward CGI moments they don't detract from the show much.Now to the main point: the music. And holy shit is it amazing. Rasmus Faber is really one of my favorite artists and he has proven himself once again with this OST. The tropical percussion, piano and guitar really lends well to the acoustic summer house vibes he creates. The main theme (the one that is used in the trailer) has an amazing vocalist to top it off. Faber's usage of certain jazz/bossa nova chord progressions just works so well to instill auditory extasy. I had moments where I just zoned out when the OST came in just so I could take it all in without any distractions. A few of the OST highlights include the airport goodbye scene and the drum and bass rendition of the main theme during the first few minutes of the last episode. I can't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack when it releases on September the 26th.So, to summarize: decent story, good art, 10/10 music. If I don't take the OST into account I would probably give Harukana Receive somewhere between a 6.5 and a 7. But with Rasmus Faber's godly talent I give it a 9/10. anything special but it was interesting enough to keep me engaged.

Nothing really stands out about, character wise, music wise, plot wise.  It\'s just a typical sports anime where sports-type people play sports.If you like sports, well, you might like this.If you like girls in swimsuits with parts flopping around, you might like this.As far as sports anime with girls in swimsuits, it\'s not all that bad.  But that\'s all it is, and that\'s why I rated it so low.  If you take away the toned bodies, the swimsuits, the flopping around parts, and the volleyball, you...basically have... well... girls eating dinner.Seriously, I can\'t think of anything else that happened in this anime that doesn\'t involve girls in swimsuits flopping around and hitting balls, other than, maybe, fighting over swimsuits.  Yeah, that happened.  At least it didn\'t involve a catfight where the swimsuits were forcibly swapped around, so there\'s that.  I guess.  They resolved it civilly.That\'s the thing about this anime - it\'s pretty much entirely based around fanservice, but it takes itself so seriously that the fanservice is integrated as part of the plot.  That kind of makes it a work of art... in its own way.  I\'m not sure that\'s a compliment.The swimsuits are well drawn.  The parts flopping around are well drawn.  The hitting of balls is well drawn.  Everything\'s well drawn, and is nothing at all but very attractive girls in swimsuits flopping around and hitting balls, with a tiny amount of sports and swimsuit related drama tossed in.  That\'s all you\'ll get.  If that\'s what you\'re looking for, then by all means, douzo.  You\'ll love this.  Otherwise, maybe find something a little less like fast food and a little more like an actual meal.  I would personally ""not recommend"", but knowing the tastes of many people who watch anime, who am I kidding.

Inazuma Eleven Go: Galaxy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18097/Inazuma_Eleven_Go__Galaxy,"[""I find it odd that despite being the best written of the six Inazuma seasons, this is the one no one talks about. Sure, it's not outstanding compared to a lot of other anime out there, but it's nothing to be ignored.The plot is a little rocky and predictable at worst, but as a children's anime, it's actually very well done and doesn't needlessly drag on certain points for many episodes, especially after around episode 18. The flow was a little too predictable about midway through the anime, but towards the end it definitely got interesting.The new eight characters on the main team are...developed super nicely, which is something we haven't really seen in Inazuma since Fubuki Shirou and Kidou Yuuto. All eight characters are given a reason to be there, and backstories that while are not deep, get the job done and fill in the reasoning behind their personalities. For instance, Nozaki Sakura's self-centered behaviour and need to be number one on the team is due to her parents always pushing her throughout her childhood to be the absolute best, and that there is no room for her to make mistakes. It definitely strains her relationship with her teammatesThe characters that weren't in previous seasons aren't so lucky, as aside from main character Tenma, we don't see much new development in Tsurugi or Shindou. I found Kuroiwa's backstory to be very frustratingly lacking. Very few of the aliens are very well developed at all, which was very odd as they were the true main focus of the anime. A select few aliens such as Bitway and Lalaya are interesting characters as they are, but more insight into their history (especially Bitway's) would've been fantastic.Art and animation is very good throughout the anime especially compared to the very first season of Inazuma Eleven, though I feel the bright colours became a little hard on the eyes after a while. The art style is still slightly cringe-worthy at times, but it's nothing too bad. Scenery was very pretty, the CGI throughout the anime blended much better with the animation cels in Go Galaxy than it did in the previous five seasons.This anime has possibly one of my favourite OSTs in anime. Nothing to rival Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji, Free, or Fullmetal Alchemist, but it definitely has a very captivating musical score, everything from fast paced rock with violins to slower piano melodies. Several tracks from the previous five seasons are reused (I recognized several from Chrono Stone at various instances), but several tracks from the new score top a lot of the old stuff.The voice acting is all very nice and emotions are captured very nicely, but something that really stands out to me are the sound effects. Particularly, there's a scene in episode 42 where the main team plays against the final antagonist team, the captain of the main team falls victim to a sliding tackle, and lands on the ground with a sickening crack. I've never heard anything in an anime so vibrantly painful enough to make my stomach turn, even after seeing gory animes like Higurashi and 3x3 Eyes.You don't notice it as much in other seasons, but you can actually hear small sounds very distinctly such as the vibrations of the rubber of a ball being kicked, footsteps in different environments, and other little things like that. A lot of the sounds used in space and on alien planets are very nice to the ears.All in all, as a fan of Inazuma for a few years, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Aside from very few factors like Kuroiwa's backstory, Zanakurou's personality compared to Zanark's from Chrono Stone, and some of the early stuff that happened between the three main characters, I think it could work very well as a standalone anime if you haven't seen the other seasons. Despite being targeted towards children, there's several factors that I feel make it enjoyable for all ages. developed super nicely, which is something we haven't really seen in Inazuma since Fubuki Shirou and Kidou Yuuto.

In the first act Shin Inazuma Japan is definitely the main focus but after that the enemy teams get more focus which should be equal.

Galaxy left me feeling unsatisfied compared to the other seasons, which, in my opinion, were flawless. Firstly, there are a few positive points to note. The concept of traveling through the galaxy is interesting in itself, staying true to the spirit of Inazuma Eleven, and the introduction of novelties such as Soul adds a welcome diversity in terms of strategy. But then, it's a series of disappointments and poor decisions.Firstly, the concept of inviting random characters such as Nozaki Sakura (Cerise Blossom), Hayato Matatagi (Falco Flashman), Shin Tetsukado (Frank...Foreman), Jinichirō Manabe (Zippy Lermer), Ryūji Kusaka (Buddy Fury), Konoha Morimura (Trina Verdure), Munemasa Ibiki (Terry Archibald), and Kazuto Minaho (Keenan Sharpe), who cannot play football besides the trio Arion, Riccardo, and Victor, is ridiculous! And even if that's not a big deal, it just needs to develop the new characters and train them thoroughly (Shonen spirit!). Well, no! It's exactly the opposite! For most of them, they have no interest in football. Moreover, despite their participation, their motivations are purely financial or familial! In the end, the new characters introduced didn't leave as much of an impact on me as the previous ones, lacking charisma, attachment, and especially depth.Furthermore, I found the plot less captivating and less well-developed, with less gripping stakes. The anime presents a succession of fantastical and science-fiction elements like exotic planets, extraterrestrial creatures, Celestial Kings, and even a black hole. To me, these elements are sometimes a bit far-fetched and hard to believe, which can affect my ability to fully immerse myself in the story and feel the characters' emotions. Moreover, this can create inconsistencies in the plot and give the impression that the writers are taking some shortcuts, which, for me, undermines the credibility and overall quality of the anime. For example, the anime follows a repetitive and predictable pattern where Earth Eleven team successively faces different planetary teams such as Faram Obius, Gurdon Eleven, Ratonîk Eleven, Sandorius Eleven, and Sazanâra Eleven, solving their problems one by one. This repetition can sometimes make me feel like the anime lacks originality and surprises, and it diminishes the tension and suspense a bit because I know in advance that Earth Eleven will always end up winning and befriending its opponents. On the other hand, the shift in tone towards a more fantastical approach made me lose the emotional aspect and the relationships between the characters that I enjoyed so much in the earlier seasons. As a football fan, I'm disappointed that the sport is relegated to the background.Although Galaxy has its strong moments, it failed to match the excitement I had for the anime's previous seasons. Furthermore, the lack of support for the video game makes it difficult to fully enjoy. It's really regrettable to see that many fans of the anime, myself included, have abandoned it, hindering its potential for success. This also deprives the gaming community of the enthusiasm necessary to thrive, thereby limiting its ability to generate engagement and success among dedicated fans.

Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ,https://myanimelist.net/anime/86/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_ZZ,"['This is a direct sequel to Zeta, but not only as that, I think of them as one big series itself despite the opposite nature of the first half ZZ that no reviewer should over look when reviewing this anime. Apparently some of the audience, executives of Sunrise and Bandai, and Tomino&rsquo;s wife thought that Zeta was way too dark and gritty which is something many fans thought was what made that series distinguishing. Plus Tomino even felt bad about the nature of Zeta and thinks anime should make people happy. Then again, he was going through a depression. While with the first half of...Double Zeta, he makes it very campy and childish. It&rsquo;s pretty bad to the point where it has driven fans away from the show. Granted it is annoying, sorry to bring this as a spoiler, but it eventually goes back to the dark and gritty nature of Zeta, which I thought was enough to redeem itself. Thankfully this transition gives opportunities where the characters will develop and they become likeable. But I think you should understand Tomino&rsquo;s mentality and approach to things to truly appreciate the story and characters.The contrast of this anime is a little brighter and the designs are more neon in a very 1980s manner. Especially the hair styles and costume designs. It&rsquo;s just more childish to truly make it more cartoony in comparison to Zeta and thus being more kid friendly. And of course some of the battles in the beginning are more comedic and ridiculous and untradtitional of what you can say is Gundam, though not as cheesy or over the top as G Gundam of course. But it&rsquo;s nice to see that the Zeta Gundam, and other suits from Zeta are still in use and present, but they don&rsquo;t have the same charisma which is a bizarre way to describe it as they did in the first season. But I do think the Double Zeta is pretty nifty and it&rsquo;s bulkiness and style brings another kind of likeable distinction mostly because it&rsquo;s different. But the battles eventually go back to the quality it had in Zeta and what most hardcore Gundam fans would like.Some of the music is also of course more campy and childish though it still retains some of the background music from Zeta Gundam. The first opening theme, Anime Janai is very ookie and geeky, but despite that, I naturally have to agree that it did compliment the nature of the series at that time, but still went well with the presented imagery. But the 2nd opening theme, Silent Voice where the series gets better is more traditionally of something you&rsquo;d rather hear in anime. It&rsquo;s very high spirited and intense and energetic.The seiyuu cast is still top notch. Yao Kazuki, the voice of Jedau sounded a little old for a 14 year old and the childish nature of his character. He was also the voice of Iketani of Initial D, Takeda from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi, and Fei Long in Street Fighter II V. It&rsquo;s hard to take him seriously in a more comedic role and as an early teenager. And I enjoyed the voice of Sakakibara Yoshiko as Harman. She had a passion and charisma to her character as well as this intimidation to her voice. So I got nothing much to complain in the voice acting department.Just like One Piece, this series takes a while to get into and get into a certain pace to truly appreciate it. I don&rsquo;t think the initial episodes despite how insulting it was after going through Zeta should not refrain you from watching the whole series since it does redeem itself. I was only able to survive and enjoy the series because I gave it that chance. Afterall, this isn&rsquo;t Gundam SEED Destiny, which is what I personally found as the worst Gundam series of all time and got progressively worse. Anyway, I say this is something more for the likes of dedicated Gundam fans, and not necessarily for casual anime fans. Just give this series a chance.

Just give this series a chance.', ""Mobile Suit Gundam Double Zeta.It gets a lot of bad press. &quot;Worst Gundam Ever&quot; is a common phrase when ZZ comes up in conversation. However. I'm going to go and stand out on a lonely, creaking limb and say I liked it. Say I liked it better than Zeta. Now let me tell you why...The Characters:The main difference between Zeta and ZZ is that a majority of the main characters are teenagers. Judau Ashta - the protaganist and pilot of Gundam Double Zeta - isn't interested in piloting or fighting at all in the beginning. When the badly damaged Argama lands at...their colony, he and his friends are simply interested in the Gundam for its scrap value, as they have been left to fend for themselves while their parents have presumably gone off to (or died in) the war. His younger sister Leina worries about him sacrificing his education to earn money and doesn't like him hanging around with the somewhat inscrupulous Beecha and Mondo. Along with feisty girl Elle and unassuming Ino, Judau and his friends get caught up in the activities of the Argama during their attempts to rob it, and form the core of the series from beginning to end. While it's hard to warm to them all at first, you can't help but feel happy for Beecha as after doubts about the war and attempted defection, he finds his calling as a Captain rather than a Mobile Suit pilot, or get caught up in their personal battles when grief causes Mondo to have no thoughts except revenge.The idea of the Cyber-Newtype is carried on from Zeta in the guise of Elpeo Puru. A young girl similar to Four Murasume and Rosamia Badam, Puru can go from child-like over dependance on Judau to ace pilot bent on destroying him. My main problem with the cyber-newtypes in Zeta was that firstly I felt that having Four, Rosamia and Sarah was overkill, and that they could have been combined into one memorable character. Secondly I never really felt very much for them (which also made it hard to empathise with why Kamille did) as they never got much screen time. Puru however spends a lot of time with the main characters during the middle of the series which gives her character a chance to develop much more than Four or Rosamia did.Haman Karn is back again as the main antagonist of the series, along with the new characters Glemy Toto, Mashymyre Cello and Chara Soon. Mashymyre is the first foe Judau and friends face - initially almost a comic relief character, a chivalrous villain who refuses to play by anything other than the rules for the sake of his hopeless infatuation with Haman. Indeed, this is really the only thing which saves the untrained (and inept) Judau from death in the early episodes. Later we see a different side to Mashymyre when he is the architect of a colony drop on Dublin. Chara follows a similar (but more sympathetic) path - possesed of particularly overt sexuality she is always a source of humour, but there is also the feeling that something is not quite right in her mind - a personality split which makes it equally likely she will behave in a fun-loving or cruel manner. Glemy Toto, Judau's main nemesis, we see first as he too naively enters his first Mobile Suit battle, and watch as power gradually comes to corrupt him utterly. Sadly he never gets the kind of character development or sympathetic scenes that Jerrod Mesa got in Zeta, which makes him a weaker character as we never really learn what (if anything) drives him to make the decisions he does.The Story:I enjoyed Zeta Gundam, but I often found myself picking holes. The most pervasive problem I had was the short lived and duplicated storylines. For example; Someone develops feelings for an enemy. Someone is kidnapped. One episode later they escape. Wait, they've been captured again. Kamille meets Four. She's gone. Here she is again... etc. With ZZ some of the same ideas are there, but they are slowed down to a speed which actually allows for some character development. Leina is kidnapped by Glemy and is gone for 10-15 episodes, and Puru joins the Argama and stays for a good 20. Chara and Mashymyre dissappear completly to be returned towards the end only when they are relevant, they aren't kept around needlessly or killed off and replaced with yet another generic villain.As with all Gundam series, ZZ has it's tragic moments. But it picks them carefully and neither milks them for pathos nor glosses over the characters' emotions making them seem cold. People suffer, some moreso than others and some cope with loss better than others. The ::slap:: &quot;get over it, this is war!&quot; attitude to emotion seems to have gone - indeed Captain Bright even says at one point, when berated for the fact that the main characters still behave like kids; &quot;I gave up trying to make them anything else.&quot; Which seems to be as much a lesson that the writers of ZZ have learned as he has.I can understand why people react badly to ZZ at first. The first few episodes on the Shangri-La colony have a lot of humour in them - they don't take themselves seriously and even gently parody ideas from previous Gundam series. Quite a contrast to the dark final episodes of Zeta, but Tomino has said that it was his intention to cheer the audience up, as he felt that more of the same would depress them. And that's perhaps it, the fact that Double Zeta feels more hopeful than it's predecessor, not afraid to have a little fun along with the war and the tragedy, has endeared it to me. their colony, he and his friends are simply interested in the Gundam for its scrap value, as they have been left to fend for themselves while their parents have presumably gone off to (or died in) the war.

Among such lists, you might sometimes see Gundam ZZ being thrown around, and it’s very understandable as to both why one would give it such a label and as to why one would defend it as something that becomes good over time. Regardless, most fans who see it tend to agree that the first 20 or so episodes of ZZ are terrible,...hindering what they consider to be an otherwise fine enough installment.Gundam ZZ is a case of “too little too late”. While the latter half on its own is a decently serviceable installment in terms of quality, with a few surprisingly good moments, the former half is probably the worst I’ve seen of the franchise to date. It is genuinely terrible, insufferable even. It would take a lot for me to find the series remotely tolerable after 22 episodes of intense suffering on my end thanks to absolutely abysmal characterization, franchise betrayals, and many more grievances that utterly destroy this first half, and while the second half is fine enough, “fine enough” doesn’t cut it when trying to salvage an otherwise 1/10 series, especially when after episode 36, the second half stops being “fine enough” and goes back to being horrible, as if turning over a new leaf was a ruse. This is Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, the black sheep of Early Universal Century and the bastard successor to Zeta Gundam. Let’s dive in, shall we?Part 1: Brutal downgrades of old characters and what ZZ does to ZetaIt\'s easy for some to look at the show and say “the second half makes the show decent though the first half is bad”, and that only really works if the first half isn\'t insanely horrific and if the second half is really, really good. Neither is the case, and the first half of this show is either a doubt the absolute worst this franchise has to offer, even now when comparing it to Twilight Axis and SEED Destiny. The thing is, at least those don\'t go out of their way to piss all over their predecessors.Say what you will about Zeta Gundam, you cannot deny the growth some of the characters had over time. That makes it all the more infuriating when important characters such as Fa Yuiry and Yazan Gable get nerfed ridiculously, losing to and all around being completely outclassed complete newbies like Judau Ashta early into the show. Fa became a competent pilot at the end of Zeta Gundam and Yazan was one of the scariest, more formidable forces of that show too. To see them become bad pilots is aggravating and beyond nonsensical.Hell, the very second episode starts off with a middle finger as well. Note that I said second episode since episode one is a weird recap of 0079 and Zeta with Char Aznable doing some Mobile Suit quiz for some reason. It has apparently been two weeks since the end of Zeta and the beginning of ZZ if what I was told was correct. Knowing that: how is Yazan still alive? To be honest, they didn\'t exactly make any fanfare of his supposed death in Zeta but there was no way he could\'ve survived the attack he was faced with that destroyed his Hambrabi. Here he is, passed out in his escape pod, seemingly not having eaten any food or drank any water, which is impossible for a human to survive. Also, within this time, the Argama seriously couldn\'t find a single hospital or colony at all for Kamille to rest in? Oh, and instead of being reduced to a childlike state without memories of the series like at the finale of Zeta, he now can\'t talk and is barely even conscious enough to transfer his newtype powers to Judau. Way to be inconsistent right out the bat!Haman Karn was the most charismatic, commanding, intriguing, and intimidating character introduced in Zeta Gundam towards the later part of its run. She was as evil as she was cool and sexy. Here she does retain a lot of that, but she is far more vulnerable, particularly around Judau. Episode 27, in particular, made it much harder to take the character seriously as a badass threat. They do try again towards the final 7 episodes, and it does work, but even still, she won’t be as much of a powerhouse on screen after episode 27. She doesn\'t have it the worst in terms of downgrades, however, and we already discussed Fa. The only major character left to discuss in terms of that is Captain Bright, but I\'ll save him for when I discuss the new characters, especially since the one responsible for his downgrade is only notable for that.The downgrades aren\'t just in terms of the returning characters either: the visuals animation and especially the music took a hit as well. ZZ has far less of the impeccable shading often present in Zeta Gundam, though for a long (for the time) anime beginning weeks after another long one by the same studio, it still holds up well minus a few egregious errors like one particular clip with the Hyaku Shiki in episode 23. There is unfortunately some more reused footage than Zeta, which has very little, but most of it is for the transformation of the ZZ and whenever a Qubeley (or anything directly part of the Qubeley line) launches its funnels. The character designs are also slightly inferior, especially thanks to a certain character I’ll cover. Even still, it\'s clear that the production values here are a bit lower than previously, as understandable as it is, especially when the new mobile suits introduced on the whole still look very good, especially the one introduced in episode 37.The music however cannot be forgiven. In terms of the old tracks, they are rarely used effectively since 80% of the time, they do not remotely fit the scenes in ZZ, unlike in Zeta where they complimented nearly every action scene. The new OST is pretty mediocre on its own with fewer scenarios that could hope to compliment them in this show. Even worse is later down the line when those new tracks stop fitting most of the scenes present in the show altogether whereas some of the worked constantly in the first half of the show, as bad and repetitive as those tracks are. The OST is just as repetitive as before but now nothing works so it just becomes much harder to tolerate the repetition. If there is one improvement, however, it would be the OPs (“Anime Ja Nai: Yume wo Wasureta Furui Chikyuujin yo (アニメじゃない-夢を忘れた古い地球人よ-)"" by Masato Arai” and #2: ""Silent Voice (サイレント・ヴォイス)"" by Jun Hiroe) and EDs (""Jidai ga Naiteiru (時代が泣いている)"" by Masato Arai and ""Issenmannen Ginga (一千万年銀河)"" by Jun Hiroe) with the OPs being decent if going on for too many episodes, and the EDs being just meh. That isn\'t remotely enough to make up for the brutally lackluster, ill-fitting, and repetitive OST.Part 2: Irritability of the humor, stupidity, and cast of the first 24 episodesExcluding the admittedly odd recap first episode, the series starts off...not half bad, actually. Episode 2 is a decent enough episode minus the bullshit I mentioned earlier. The humor that would characterize the rest of this anime was controlled and not horribly in our face just yet, especially when there was major consequence involved. Killing off even one of the minor Zeta characters (Saegusa) so early was risky though. We meet the new guys, and there is one hilarious reaction joke regarding Captain Bright connecting the dots about Judau. Episode 3 doesn’t start off half bad either, especially since the humor was still pretty funny. Then, something happened. Mashymre appeared. Then we get the bad attempts of humor that dwarf the series, repetitive as hell humor on top for that, and the fact that it becomes basically a Saturday morning cartoon. This is Universal Century Gundam. I get that Tomino wanted to make sure this installment at least started lighter than the constantly heavy and unhappy Zeta, but its like they went to the other extreme. It’s mainly due to the horrible new cast, which I’ll get to.The sappy drama that occurs occasionally regarding Fa, or the MoonMoon people is just pathetic as well. To be fair, episodes 18 and 19, where Ple (or Puru) is introduced, are decent episodes with better action and less stupidity but episodes 20-22 ruined that. There are so many individual moments in the first 24 episodes that are so wrong that I’d need to compile a list of them, not including the bits I mentioned earlier, assuming I was able to track down everything I’ve said over those episodes, such as retarded character decisions in episode 11 and 12, not using mobile suits that are perfectly functional and available for them (MK.II in episode 13), not shooting or attacking enemies that are in front of them because the writers want to keep their protagonists alive (episodes 16, 27, and 38 but there it was shooting an ally that was shooting an enemy), Shinta and Qum announcing their plan in front of a bitch they don’t want to know heard their plans (episode 18), and so, so much more. Plus, the entirety of the MoonMoon arc and Cecilia arc (the first time the show tries to go back to the darker, more melodramatic tone of Zeta) is stupid. Oh yeah, this show has story arcs, and they\'re rather hit or miss.The new cast is absolutely abysmal, and this will take quite a while to get through. The od cast got fucked and these new guys are among the worst new casts in the franchise. Let’s start to the top for this first half only, with Judau Ashta. He starts out completely insufferable. Imagine Kamille Bidan but unjustifiable and more than willing to attack even those who aren’t being assholes or otherwise very harsh to him (even resorting to attacking Fa when she slaps him for being a cunt to his sister in episode 6). He and his friends are total shitbags to each other, though around the time he stupidly gets Leena kidnapped by Glemy and soon after, meeting Ple, he actually becomes remotely tolerable and responsible. Still, the damage is insane, too much to be easily rectified. Beecha and Mondo start off as just the worst. They’re cowardly, traitorous sellouts willing to actually kill Judau over some cash, and they’re just supposed to be seen as troublemaker friends and not complete and utter scum. Needless to say, I hated them the most out of the entire group. Lino is basically this powerless, wimpy character and faint voice of reason, so he’s basically just kinda there. Roux is the most tolerable (and attractive) of the bunch but is basically the lancer of the group...full of lancers...huh. Elle is kinda a bad character who really is just the amalgamation of many of literally every other member of the group’s traits so of course she sucks. Lastly, there’s Leina, Judau’s little sister who is basically a damsel in distress and a nag. Of course she sucks...The antagonists don\'t fare much better, especially in the first half. We start off with Mashymre, who is a complete pathetic tool and cartoon of a character. It’s not a stretch to say that in the first half especially, he is a one-dimensional Saturday morning villain who is all about chivalry for his lady, in the most repetitive gags in the franchise. It was funny seeing Judau call him pretentious though and I did grow to empathize him for one reason I’ll get to. Glemy doesn’t start off that much better, just being kind of a typical nobleman character meant to teach Leina “some manners” and become a pathetic loser around Roux. There’s this fucking fatass named Guzin who is both a Saturday morning villain and an obnoxious scumbag, and that combo works horribly and I wish he was dead. We never see the fucker after the crew leaves Shangri-la anyway, and it’s pathetic that Yazan had to work with him; how far the man has fallen…Here we go. Rev up that harsh DOOM 2016 music and put it on full blast because here’s where I get truly violent! Remember when I said I empathize with Mashymre? Well, he said a line about wishing death upon this character. CHARA SUNE!! FUCK CHARA SUNE!!!! This bitch, this whore, this harlot...his Jem and the Holograms reject BIMBO…deserves all of my hate! Never have I met a character so insufferable and brutally inconsistent in my life, and she is definitely a contender for the worst character in Gundam history! She has no concrete personality beyond being an insufferable cunt whose sex appeal is flaunted to obnoxious degrees. I get why that is but not only does it never make any sense (apparently some cyber newtype bs and I’ll get to why all of that falls apart soon enough) but she flip-flops constantly with no real catalyst for it beyond Judau towards the end. The worst has to be her insufferable and wince-worthy behavior when piloting a mobile suit and I am glad she disappeared for a good 20 episodes after episode 21 because I could not stand her for any second she was on screen. Fuck you, Chara Sune, for single-handedly making most of the 2nd quarter of the show impossible to bear! I’m glad she\'s dead! Plus, her voice was horrific and the acting was equally terrible; who hired her seiyuu and who was their seiyuu?The only other character left is Emary and her only character trait for a large majority of this series is being super lovestruck over Captain Bright, who has a wife and kid, and he gets really awkward around her. This is all she serves in the narrative for most of the run of the show and it looks bad on such a good and prominent character like Bright. What happened to Bright, man? Not only this but he is decidedly less harsh and strict with the new guys than he was with Amuro or Kamille, despite them being way worse than those two, and it hasn\'t been long since he had been with Kamille. Another way of being less dark and heavy? Fuck off, ZZ, you take that back after 19 episodes anyway.Part 3: Quarter 3 and what it improved/did rightThere is much debate as to where the show started getting consistently better. May say episode 19, some go 23, but to be perfectly honest, I’d say 28 was when the show started getting consistently good episodes. This means that while the third quarter is decent, it takes a good way into that quarter for consistently improved quality. For the sake of semantics, I’ll start at the episode where the Argama crew first land on Earth: episode 23, which is roughly the halfway mark.23-27 is sort of a mixed bag. 23 and 24 are decent episodes and show that these cretins can be a functional and tolerable unit, especially episode 23. 25-27 is why I don\'t cite 23 as the changing period and instead cite 28. 25 is a decent skirmish with a few slip-ups but 26 makes 25 look stupid since while in 25, the crew engage in their first desert battle against veteran soldiers of the one-year war and win without too much trouble, one girl in a Gelgoog in 26 gets the crew’s balls rocked. 27 is where I couldn\'t take Haman nearly as seriously anymore when Judau pulls some crazy newtype bs out of his ass and Haman pusses out of shooting him (she had a lot of opportunities too since she came with intent on shooting him). 28 was the first good episode since 23 since Leina “dies” (I\'ll touch on that bullshit later); not only do I not like her but it was a real interesting and dramatic moment for the cast at large, even if they do not progress much as characters beyond a few patched up melodrama bits and Judau becoming more responsible.The Blue Corps and Dublin arcs are actually good. Around this time, even a few episodes earlier, ZZ became a conventionally enjoyable series, though not exceptional. The stories make actual sense for most part until episode 36, characters such as Kamille and Hayato return and are still engaging, and we actually see characters grow and see the main team actually have some semblance of teamwork, which some people pride this group on (despite them almost never having any remote semblance of teamwork or camaraderie at all throughout the show). They also develop Glemy’s darker more manipulative and ambitious side and even capitalized on his lovestruck loser side for better comedy, as well as using it against him. The action scenes were cooler too. What these arcs, in particular, did especially good is getting us to have a reason to care. We care about the Blue Corps and how Glemy gets sucked into the incident, as well as Kamille, Hayato, their situations, and the colony drop, off of which were some of the highlights of the Dubin arc, which, barring the final part of that 3 episode arc, was the best part of the show. If the show were more like this, it would be a decent, maybe even good show, since 9 of these 15 episodes were actually good. All of the antagonists I hated were gone for these sets of episodes and Glemy became a formidable and interesting villain, exploring more of the whole Ple stuff introduced short after Ple’s introduction in episode 18, even if little makes sense (I’ll address all of the newtype and cyber newtype stuff that would become the biggest problem of the second half when I get to part 5, as that is where it’s at its worst). Killing Hayato after he ends up knowing what happened to Katz was an unfortunate move though.Ple is one of the only decent characters of the show and while we see her in the first half and get to know that despite being this unfortunate cyber newtype, she’s just a kid at heart, it’s here where she becomes more prominent, though more annoying in the leary part of this quarter. Even many of the protagonists get sick of her shit, though it’s not so easy to stay mad at her when she still has competence and is a kid, especially after Lina’s “death”, where she has his arc about trying to fill the void Leina left after trying to usurp Leina for so long. Shame it doesn’t get a proper conclusion and everything this show had going for it that was established with these episodes gets fucked, especially since Ple dies in a bullshit way after Ple-Two becomes a thing and Mashymre comes back (admittedly cooler than before but still a bad, one-dimensional character) in episodes 36 and 37.Part 4: Before I knew it, the first half of quarter 4 betrayed meLeina lives...and the emotional impact of episode 28 dies. Just...why? How? Oh, and now she’s a newtype even more powerful than Kamille since she can communicate from...somewhere on Earth whilst the crew she is communicating with is in space. Oh, and for some unknown reason, they made Beecha captain instead of Judau, the one man with more leadership qualities than the rest of the group. It\'s interesting that Beecha thinks that something is wrong with Judau in either a mental or emotional way and they probably would\'ve been interesting if that were the case now that there is no one left to fill Judau’s “Leina” void even remotely, now that Puru is dead.For some reason, Mashymre has a new crew with Illya and other people and they battle Judau and co.of course but the dumbest thing in episode 38 happens just like in 37 with the Leina stuff. This one Zeon guy has disobeyed an order but is still completing the objective and is not even a second away from shooting the bridge of the Nahel Argama, and his superior, Illya, kills him. It\'s obviously a retarded way by the writer(s) to keep the protagonists alive but believe me; it gets worse. Episodes 36-38 have has some dumb shit happen, some of which were especially bad but they weren\'t enough to make me rescind every positive thing I\'ve ever said about the third quarter of ZZ, until I get to the Rasara arc. The Rasara arc (episodes 39-41) is hands down the worst piece of Gundam fiction I have ever encountered! Each episode in this arc is worse than the last and it feels like some of the worst of what the already abominable first half of this show provided, and barring what it does to Mondo, this arc is completely pointless. It\'s meaningless and all it adds to Mondo is sadness that only really has any relevance to anyone in episode 45, but I\'ll get to the laughable final 5 episodes later. For now, how about we rip this arc apart for betraying me so!Somehow, Haman disguises herself and is now in a refugee ship that her forces attack in an attempt to lure the Nahel Argama. How did they know they were coming? Don\'t say “Haman can sense Judau” since that\'s an automatic two-way street for the both of them and Judau can\'t sense Haman, even when he is touching her and she gives off her newtype vibes and speaks to him! This is episode 39 and it\'s pretty bad, but it\'s definitely the best episode in this arc. Oh, did I forget to mention that the MoonMoon tribe from the god-awful MoonMoon arc just randomly pop into the arc and stay with the crew for the remainder of it? Why?! No one liked the MoonMoon arc! Even worse, Sarasa of that arc notices Haman and bites her as having an evil suspicious aura, re no one questions/interrogates her! How stupid are these people?! Then episode 40 rolls around and we get introduced to the absolute worst character in the second half of ZZ: Stampa Halloi! He is just the worst: some fugly fatass generic dog of a man, and barring being a complete fucking coward, this is his only character trait! He is worse than Gemon! He is Chara Sune levels of bad! Thank fuck he’s only here for two episodes, and hopefully, he died when Mondo stabbed his mobile suit! We also get introduced to some troublemaking punks that end up being a parallel to the protagonists in their own introduction, but nothing is done with it; they don\'t even stay once the arc is over, and once everyone meets Stamps and fight his goons, and Judau finally recognizes Haman from her voice, how do they escape? I\'m serious. How? Because fuck it, that\'s why!Then episode 41 begins, and it is...unspeakable. Anyone who has made it this far knows that Mondo loves Rasara, so what is the right thing to do? Kill her off of course! I mean, there are interesting ways to do that to make him grow, but here’s where things get fucky: she was getting a bit weak at the beginning, and when Stampa is chasing Mondo in a mobile suit, he dived down, and she dived down on top of him to protect him from harm; she somehow died almost immediately afterwards. Sure, rubble falls down around then, but none of that hits either of them! And then her body looks like it has taken a beating on the front, for no reason! As bizarre and stupid as Puru’s death was, at least it had a catalyst! This? No! Not one thing that could lead to her death here. It\'s not like she was fatally ill or anything, so how the fuck did she die?! Then an action scene begins and for anyone who could ever enter, their beam weapons were covered up entirely and not allowed to be pulled out, and it keeps that tradition during the fight scene...until Illya and Beecha use their beam sabers, contradicting all of that. Thankfully Mondo finally stabbed Stampa’s mobile suit, possibly killing him...only for it to not explode. Fuck it, I\'m done, this arc is over! It was an exercise in punishment, suffering, and the utmost betrayal, and every second of it was as bad, if not worse than every single insipid episode that came before! This arc and this show can rot in hell, and anything and everything good about the previous episodes has been utterly obliterated!Part 5: Glemy’s revolt, the mishandling of the newtype concept, and the glorious retardation of the final 6 episodesThe final 6 episodes of ZZ are an exhibition of glory, both in terms of how epic they were and how monumentally imbecilic they were. These episodes are gloriously bad due to the brutally terrible foundation for these episodes and the fact that there are integral parts, scenes, and explanations missing here, mainly for two specific things that utterly decapitate these episodes: Newtypes and Glemy’s revolt. Let’s do Glemy’s revolt first since there are fewer things to talk about as to why this fails massively.We do in fact see that Glemy had ambitions of usurping Haman to rule Neo Zeon. Problem is: we don\'t see how his rebellion starts. We don\'t see how he is able to convince a myriad of soldiers under his belt or otherwise, to go along with him instead of Haman. Given that this is the impetus for the conflict of the final 5 episodes, in particular, ignoring something so important to this part of the plot is quite a bad move. Hell, they could’ve skipped the Rasara arc entirely to focus on expanding on this much-needed origin of rebellion, especially since there are only minor inklings of potential for this revolt prior to Glemy’s next appearance which is to effectively begin it. This intertwines with the next thing that kills the rest of this show. It’s finally time for the climax of this review; it’s high time I talk about: the Newtype shenanigans.Where do I begin? There is so, so much to cover here. How about starting with Chara, just to get the dead bitch out of the way. Oh yeah, she dies retardedly in the final episode while shouting her name triumphantly. Apparently, there is something wrong about her and how she is a cyber newtype to the point where this is used to explain all of her inconsistent behaviors throughout her appearance in episodes 10-21 and the final 6 episodes. Obviously, it doesn’t fly since she has no concrete personality this cyber newtype stuff is supposed to deal with barring her being a demanding bitch...which she is no matter what unless she’s smothering Judau in her bosom. A similar treatment is given to Mashymre after his departure around episode 12 and I don’t know why. We don’t see how he keeps getting roided, and we only ever see one newtype facility and that was for the purus that I’ll cover after this. Zeta bothered to show some of that shit, why not ZZ? He even has this happened between episodes of this section of the show offscreen. This is important and compromising information that we are missing out of. He overloads and commits the coolest act in this entire show and the most epic suicide in all of anime, if not all of fiction. The only thing I know to remotely rival this is the famous scene from Independence Day with the guy that crashed into the mothership. It\'s ineffective, sure, but he does it with such gusto the tits cool regardless, and literally, everyone takes notice.Speaking of Ples, before I dive into this particular shitsow, how about I say that Ple-Two is a decent enough character who goes through the typical “choose between brainwashing and freedom side while your head hurts” plot. Also, she is literally fucking impossible, her and the Ple army. Did they simply create Ple clones or something? We don\'t know. How come Haman knew nothing about any of this? No spies or mandatory reports? Somehow Ple (and eventually Judau) can channel newtype energy so powerful as to deflect beams entirely, and that literally makes no conceivable sense ever, and fuck episode 36 for including such retardation. Ple-Two controlling her mechs with her mind makes sense; RC control of them with her mind (aka doing it outside of the mech, like remote control with her mind) is a stretch, especially for giant mechs and those other shooting funnels being controlled all at once.In general, they keep adding new, absolutely stupid bs to the newtype business and even among that, it\'s wildly inconsistent at times. Also, somehow Judau does the same bullshit Kamille did at the end of his series which was always baffling and stupid because the final few episodes of Zeta were also retarded but this is next level shit. The last two episodes are especially riddled with stupidity however and make for a laughable bad finale. They also add forced romantic stuff between Beecha and Elle (who had no inkling of it and when Beecha said he was trying to be nice to her, everyone in the audience should call bullshit when they were all jackasses, especially him, Luke when he and Mondo tried to actively get Judau killed in the first half) for no real reason other than trying to make us feel happy and go “what a long way these guys have come” (though the second time they try that tactic, this time with the final episode with Judau and then saying one more goodbye before he faces off Haman was good). We don\'t how how Leina survived that incident in episode 28 of a mobile suit crashing and exploding into her shack where she was resting, setting the whole thing on fire (Sunrise…) but apparently now she’s with Seila Mass...who just happens to be on Earth somewhere and we don\'t even know where. Also, Ple-Two dies in the final episode (or at least passes or and is never seen again but come on, that\'s most likely death) and no one gives a fuck. Haman dies in a retarded way as well, and Glemy’s death scene makes no sense either both in terms of the Gundam that killed him and the fact that after Ple-Two rejected him to go with Judau, she jumps to save him as he disintegrates and his Mobile Armor blows up and she dies soon after (why?). Oh, and nothing is resolved about this war other than the two tyrants dying but that\'s apparently good enough for this anime...bleh!EpilogueSo that was Mobile Suit ZZ. A broken, stupid, largely insufferable mess of a series that took far too long to only temporarily become remotely decent, all the while downgrading everything positive about Zeta such as the visuals to some extent and especially the music. What a chaotic shitshow. The only reasons this isn\'t the worst in the franchise are that Twilight Axis exists now, almost ⅕ of this series was good and some parts weren\'t all that terrible, but when over half of your series, especially in the first half, is a 0/10, then there really is little hope for salvation, since it not only compounds every issue Zeta (an infinitely better anime) had but had its own heap of issues to fill a space colony.To be honest, I see little reason to watch this unless you really want to complete every Gundam anime out there, as it\'s among the worst-written of them all. This is also the longest anime I\'ve completed that I personally detest. As bad as SEED Destiny and 00 Second Season are, I don\'t outright hate them like I do with this one. It is one of two in this franchise I actively despise thus far; ZZ is truly the most loathsome this franchise has ever been. Now, with all that said, I bid you adieu. hindering what they consider to be an otherwise fine enough installment.Gundam ZZ is a case of “too little too late”. While the latter half on its own is a decently serviceable installment in terms of quality, with a few surprisingly good moments, the former half is probably the worst I’ve seen of the franchise to date. It is genuinely terrible, insufferable even. It would take a lot for me to find the series remotely tolerable after 22 episodes of intense suffering on my end thanks to absolutely abysmal characterization, franchise betrayals, and many more grievances that utterly destroy this first half, and while the second half is fine enough, “fine enough” doesn’t cut it when trying to salvage an otherwise 1/10 series, especially when after episode 36, the second half stops being “fine enough” and goes back to being horrible, as if turning over a new leaf was a ruse. This is Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, the black sheep of Early Universal Century and the bastard successor to Zeta Gundam. Let’s dive in, shall we?Part 1: Brutal downgrades of old characters and what ZZ does to ZetaIt\'s easy for some to look at the show and say “the second half makes the show decent though the first half is bad”, and that only really works if the first half isn\'t insanely horrific and if the second half is really, really good. Neither is the case, and the first half of this show is either a doubt the absolute worst this franchise has to offer, even now when comparing it to Twilight Axis and SEED Destiny. The thing is, at least those don\'t go out of their way to piss all over their predecessors.Say what you will about Zeta Gundam, you cannot deny the growth some of the characters had over time. That makes it all the more infuriating when important characters such as Fa Yuiry and Yazan Gable get nerfed ridiculously, losing to and all around being completely outclassed complete newbies like Judau Ashta early into the show. Fa became a competent pilot at the end of Zeta Gundam and Yazan was one of the scariest, more formidable forces of that show too. To see them become bad pilots is aggravating and beyond nonsensical.Hell, the very second episode starts off with a middle finger as well. Note that I said second episode since episode one is a weird recap of 0079 and Zeta with Char Aznable doing some Mobile Suit quiz for some reason. It has apparently been two weeks since the end of Zeta and the beginning of ZZ if what I was told was correct. Knowing that: how is Yazan still alive? To be honest, they didn\'t exactly make any fanfare of his supposed death in Zeta but there was no way he could\'ve survived the attack he was faced with that destroyed his Hambrabi. Here he is, passed out in his escape pod, seemingly not having eaten any food or drank any water, which is impossible for a human to survive. Also, within this time, the Argama seriously couldn\'t find a single hospital or colony at all for Kamille to rest in? Oh, and instead of being reduced to a childlike state without memories of the series like at the finale of Zeta, he now can\'t talk and is barely even conscious enough to transfer his newtype powers to Judau. Way to be inconsistent right out the bat!Haman Karn was the most charismatic, commanding, intriguing, and intimidating character introduced in Zeta Gundam towards the later part of its run. She was as evil as she was cool and sexy. Here she does retain a lot of that, but she is far more vulnerable, particularly around Judau. Episode 27, in particular, made it much harder to take the character seriously as a badass threat. They do try again towards the final 7 episodes, and it does work, but even still, she won’t be as much of a powerhouse on screen after episode 27. She doesn\'t have it the worst in terms of downgrades, however, and we already discussed Fa. The only major character left to discuss in terms of that is Captain Bright, but I\'ll save him for when I discuss the new characters, especially since the one responsible for his downgrade is only notable for that.The downgrades aren\'t just in terms of the returning characters either: the visuals animation and especially the music took a hit as well. ZZ has far less of the impeccable shading often present in Zeta Gundam, though for a long (for the time) anime beginning weeks after another long one by the same studio, it still holds up well minus a few egregious errors like one particular clip with the Hyaku Shiki in episode 23. There is unfortunately some more reused footage than Zeta, which has very little, but most of it is for the transformation of the ZZ and whenever a Qubeley (or anything directly part of the Qubeley line) launches its funnels. The character designs are also slightly inferior, especially thanks to a certain character I’ll cover. Even still, it\'s clear that the production values here are a bit lower than previously, as understandable as it is, especially when the new mobile suits introduced on the whole still look very good, especially the one introduced in episode 37.The music however cannot be forgiven. In terms of the old tracks, they are rarely used effectively since 80% of the time, they do not remotely fit the scenes in ZZ, unlike in Zeta where they complimented nearly every action scene. The new OST is pretty mediocre on its own with fewer scenarios that could hope to compliment them in this show. Even worse is later down the line when those new tracks stop fitting most of the scenes present in the show altogether whereas some of the worked constantly in the first half of the show, as bad and repetitive as those tracks are. The OST is just as repetitive as before but now nothing works so it just becomes much harder to tolerate the repetition. If there is one improvement, however, it would be the OPs (“Anime Ja Nai: Yume wo Wasureta Furui Chikyuujin yo (アニメじゃない-夢を忘れた古い地球人よ-)"" by Masato Arai” and #2: ""Silent Voice (サイレント・ヴォイス)"" by Jun Hiroe) and EDs (""Jidai ga Naiteiru (時代が泣いている)"" by Masato Arai and ""Issenmannen Ginga (一千万年銀河)"" by Jun Hiroe) with the OPs being decent if going on for too many episodes, and the EDs being just meh. That isn\'t remotely enough to make up for the brutally lackluster, ill-fitting, and repetitive OST.Part 2: Irritability of the humor, stupidity, and cast of the first 24 episodesExcluding the admittedly odd recap first episode, the series starts off...not half bad, actually. Episode 2 is a decent enough episode minus the bullshit I mentioned earlier. The humor that would characterize the rest of this anime was controlled and not horribly in our face just yet, especially when there was major consequence involved. Killing off even one of the minor Zeta characters (Saegusa) so early was risky though. We meet the new guys, and there is one hilarious reaction joke regarding Captain Bright connecting the dots about Judau. Episode 3 doesn’t start off half bad either, especially since the humor was still pretty funny. Then, something happened. Mashymre appeared. Then we get the bad attempts of humor that dwarf the series, repetitive as hell humor on top for that, and the fact that it becomes basically a Saturday morning cartoon. This is Universal Century Gundam. I get that Tomino wanted to make sure this installment at least started lighter than the constantly heavy and unhappy Zeta, but its like they went to the other extreme. It’s mainly due to the horrible new cast, which I’ll get to.The sappy drama that occurs occasionally regarding Fa, or the MoonMoon people is just pathetic as well. To be fair, episodes 18 and 19, where Ple (or Puru) is introduced, are decent episodes with better action and less stupidity but episodes 20-22 ruined that. There are so many individual moments in the first 24 episodes that are so wrong that I’d need to compile a list of them, not including the bits I mentioned earlier, assuming I was able to track down everything I’ve said over those episodes, such as retarded character decisions in episode 11 and 12, not using mobile suits that are perfectly functional and available for them (MK.II in episode 13), not shooting or attacking enemies that are in front of them because the writers want to keep their protagonists alive (episodes 16, 27, and 38 but there it was shooting an ally that was shooting an enemy), Shinta and Qum announcing their plan in front of a bitch they don’t want to know heard their plans (episode 18), and so, so much more. Plus, the entirety of the MoonMoon arc and Cecilia arc (the first time the show tries to go back to the darker, more melodramatic tone of Zeta) is stupid. Oh yeah, this show has story arcs, and they\'re rather hit or miss.The new cast is absolutely abysmal, and this will take quite a while to get through. The od cast got fucked and these new guys are among the worst new casts in the franchise. Let’s start to the top for this first half only, with Judau Ashta. He starts out completely insufferable. Imagine Kamille Bidan but unjustifiable and more than willing to attack even those who aren’t being assholes or otherwise very harsh to him (even resorting to attacking Fa when she slaps him for being a cunt to his sister in episode 6). He and his friends are total shitbags to each other, though around the time he stupidly gets Leena kidnapped by Glemy and soon after, meeting Ple, he actually becomes remotely tolerable and responsible. Still, the damage is insane, too much to be easily rectified. Beecha and Mondo start off as just the worst. They’re cowardly, traitorous sellouts willing to actually kill Judau over some cash, and they’re just supposed to be seen as troublemaker friends and not complete and utter scum. Needless to say, I hated them the most out of the entire group. Lino is basically this powerless, wimpy character and faint voice of reason, so he’s basically just kinda there. Roux is the most tolerable (and attractive) of the bunch but is basically the lancer of the group...full of lancers...huh. Elle is kinda a bad character who really is just the amalgamation of many of literally every other member of the group’s traits so of course she sucks. Lastly, there’s Leina, Judau’s little sister who is basically a damsel in distress and a nag. Of course she sucks...The antagonists don\'t fare much better, especially in the first half. We start off with Mashymre, who is a complete pathetic tool and cartoon of a character. It’s not a stretch to say that in the first half especially, he is a one-dimensional Saturday morning villain who is all about chivalry for his lady, in the most repetitive gags in the franchise. It was funny seeing Judau call him pretentious though and I did grow to empathize him for one reason I’ll get to. Glemy doesn’t start off that much better, just being kind of a typical nobleman character meant to teach Leina “some manners” and become a pathetic loser around Roux. There’s this fucking fatass named Guzin who is both a Saturday morning villain and an obnoxious scumbag, and that combo works horribly and I wish he was dead. We never see the fucker after the crew leaves Shangri-la anyway, and it’s pathetic that Yazan had to work with him; how far the man has fallen…Here we go. Rev up that harsh DOOM 2016 music and put it on full blast because here’s where I get truly violent! Remember when I said I empathize with Mashymre? Well, he said a line about wishing death upon this character. CHARA SUNE!! FUCK CHARA SUNE!!!! This bitch, this whore, this harlot...his Jem and the Holograms reject BIMBO…deserves all of my hate! Never have I met a character so insufferable and brutally inconsistent in my life, and she is definitely a contender for the worst character in Gundam history! She has no concrete personality beyond being an insufferable cunt whose sex appeal is flaunted to obnoxious degrees. I get why that is but not only does it never make any sense (apparently some cyber newtype bs and I’ll get to why all of that falls apart soon enough) but she flip-flops constantly with no real catalyst for it beyond Judau towards the end. The worst has to be her insufferable and wince-worthy behavior when piloting a mobile suit and I am glad she disappeared for a good 20 episodes after episode 21 because I could not stand her for any second she was on screen. Fuck you, Chara Sune, for single-handedly making most of the 2nd quarter of the show impossible to bear! I’m glad she\'s dead! Plus, her voice was horrific and the acting was equally terrible; who hired her seiyuu and who was their seiyuu?The only other character left is Emary and her only character trait for a large majority of this series is being super lovestruck over Captain Bright, who has a wife and kid, and he gets really awkward around her. This is all she serves in the narrative for most of the run of the show and it looks bad on such a good and prominent character like Bright. What happened to Bright, man? Not only this but he is decidedly less harsh and strict with the new guys than he was with Amuro or Kamille, despite them being way worse than those two, and it hasn\'t been long since he had been with Kamille. Another way of being less dark and heavy? Fuck off, ZZ, you take that back after 19 episodes anyway.Part 3: Quarter 3 and what it improved/did rightThere is much debate as to where the show started getting consistently better. May say episode 19, some go 23, but to be perfectly honest, I’d say 28 was when the show started getting consistently good episodes. This means that while the third quarter is decent, it takes a good way into that quarter for consistently improved quality. For the sake of semantics, I’ll start at the episode where the Argama crew first land on Earth: episode 23, which is roughly the halfway mark.23-27 is sort of a mixed bag. 23 and 24 are decent episodes and show that these cretins can be a functional and tolerable unit, especially episode 23. 25-27 is why I don\'t cite 23 as the changing period and instead cite 28. 25 is a decent skirmish with a few slip-ups but 26 makes 25 look stupid since while in 25, the crew engage in their first desert battle against veteran soldiers of the one-year war and win without too much trouble, one girl in a Gelgoog in 26 gets the crew’s balls rocked. 27 is where I couldn\'t take Haman nearly as seriously anymore when Judau pulls some crazy newtype bs out of his ass and Haman pusses out of shooting him (she had a lot of opportunities too since she came with intent on shooting him). 28 was the first good episode since 23 since Leina “dies” (I\'ll touch on that bullshit later); not only do I not like her but it was a real interesting and dramatic moment for the cast at large, even if they do not progress much as characters beyond a few patched up melodrama bits and Judau becoming more responsible.The Blue Corps and Dublin arcs are actually good. Around this time, even a few episodes earlier, ZZ became a conventionally enjoyable series, though not exceptional. The stories make actual sense for most part until episode 36, characters such as Kamille and Hayato return and are still engaging, and we actually see characters grow and see the main team actually have some semblance of teamwork, which some people pride this group on (despite them almost never having any remote semblance of teamwork or camaraderie at all throughout the show). They also develop Glemy’s darker more manipulative and ambitious side and even capitalized on his lovestruck loser side for better comedy, as well as using it against him. The action scenes were cooler too. What these arcs, in particular, did especially good is getting us to have a reason to care. We care about the Blue Corps and how Glemy gets sucked into the incident, as well as Kamille, Hayato, their situations, and the colony drop, off of which were some of the highlights of the Dubin arc, which, barring the final part of that 3 episode arc, was the best part of the show. If the show were more like this, it would be a decent, maybe even good show, since 9 of these 15 episodes were actually good. All of the antagonists I hated were gone for these sets of episodes and Glemy became a formidable and interesting villain, exploring more of the whole Ple stuff introduced short after Ple’s introduction in episode 18, even if little makes sense (I’ll address all of the newtype and cyber newtype stuff that would become the biggest problem of the second half when I get to part 5, as that is where it’s at its worst). Killing Hayato after he ends up knowing what happened to Katz was an unfortunate move though.Ple is one of the only decent characters of the show and while we see her in the first half and get to know that despite being this unfortunate cyber newtype, she’s just a kid at heart, it’s here where she becomes more prominent, though more annoying in the leary part of this quarter. Even many of the protagonists get sick of her shit, though it’s not so easy to stay mad at her when she still has competence and is a kid, especially after Lina’s “death”, where she has his arc about trying to fill the void Leina left after trying to usurp Leina for so long. Shame it doesn’t get a proper conclusion and everything this show had going for it that was established with these episodes gets fucked, especially since Ple dies in a bullshit way after Ple-Two becomes a thing and Mashymre comes back (admittedly cooler than before but still a bad, one-dimensional character) in episodes 36 and 37.Part 4: Before I knew it, the first half of quarter 4 betrayed meLeina lives...and the emotional impact of episode 28 dies. Just...why? How? Oh, and now she’s a newtype even more powerful than Kamille since she can communicate from...somewhere on Earth whilst the crew she is communicating with is in space. Oh, and for some unknown reason, they made Beecha captain instead of Judau, the one man with more leadership qualities than the rest of the group. It\'s interesting that Beecha thinks that something is wrong with Judau in either a mental or emotional way and they probably would\'ve been interesting if that were the case now that there is no one left to fill Judau’s “Leina” void even remotely, now that Puru is dead.For some reason, Mashymre has a new crew with Illya and other people and they battle Judau and co.of course but the dumbest thing in episode 38 happens just like in 37 with the Leina stuff. This one Zeon guy has disobeyed an order but is still completing the objective and is not even a second away from shooting the bridge of the Nahel Argama, and his superior, Illya, kills him. It\'s obviously a retarded way by the writer(s) to keep the protagonists alive but believe me; it gets worse. Episodes 36-38 have has some dumb shit happen, some of which were especially bad but they weren\'t enough to make me rescind every positive thing I\'ve ever said about the third quarter of ZZ, until I get to the Rasara arc. The Rasara arc (episodes 39-41) is hands down the worst piece of Gundam fiction I have ever encountered! Each episode in this arc is worse than the last and it feels like some of the worst of what the already abominable first half of this show provided, and barring what it does to Mondo, this arc is completely pointless. It\'s meaningless and all it adds to Mondo is sadness that only really has any relevance to anyone in episode 45, but I\'ll get to the laughable final 5 episodes later. For now, how about we rip this arc apart for betraying me so!Somehow, Haman disguises herself and is now in a refugee ship that her forces attack in an attempt to lure the Nahel Argama. How did they know they were coming? Don\'t say “Haman can sense Judau” since that\'s an automatic two-way street for the both of them and Judau can\'t sense Haman, even when he is touching her and she gives off her newtype vibes and speaks to him! This is episode 39 and it\'s pretty bad, but it\'s definitely the best episode in this arc. Oh, did I forget to mention that the MoonMoon tribe from the god-awful MoonMoon arc just randomly pop into the arc and stay with the crew for the remainder of it? Why?! No one liked the MoonMoon arc! Even worse, Sarasa of that arc notices Haman and bites her as having an evil suspicious aura, re no one questions/interrogates her! How stupid are these people?! Then episode 40 rolls around and we get introduced to the absolute worst character in the second half of ZZ: Stampa Halloi! He is just the worst: some fugly fatass generic dog of a man, and barring being a complete fucking coward, this is his only character trait! He is worse than Gemon! He is Chara Sune levels of bad! Thank fuck he’s only here for two episodes, and hopefully, he died when Mondo stabbed his mobile suit! We also get introduced to some troublemaking punks that end up being a parallel to the protagonists in their own introduction, but nothing is done with it; they don\'t even stay once the arc is over, and once everyone meets Stamps and fight his goons, and Judau finally recognizes Haman from her voice, how do they escape? I\'m serious. How? Because fuck it, that\'s why!Then episode 41 begins, and it is...unspeakable. Anyone who has made it this far knows that Mondo loves Rasara, so what is the right thing to do? Kill her off of course! I mean, there are interesting ways to do that to make him grow, but here’s where things get fucky: she was getting a bit weak at the beginning, and when Stampa is chasing Mondo in a mobile suit, he dived down, and she dived down on top of him to protect him from harm; she somehow died almost immediately afterwards. Sure, rubble falls down around then, but none of that hits either of them! And then her body looks like it has taken a beating on the front, for no reason! As bizarre and stupid as Puru’s death was, at least it had a catalyst! This? No! Not one thing that could lead to her death here. It\'s not like she was fatally ill or anything, so how the fuck did she die?! Then an action scene begins and for anyone who could ever enter, their beam weapons were covered up entirely and not allowed to be pulled out, and it keeps that tradition during the fight scene...until Illya and Beecha use their beam sabers, contradicting all of that. Thankfully Mondo finally stabbed Stampa’s mobile suit, possibly killing him...only for it to not explode. Fuck it, I\'m done, this arc is over! It was an exercise in punishment, suffering, and the utmost betrayal, and every second of it was as bad, if not worse than every single insipid episode that came before! This arc and this show can rot in hell, and anything and everything good about the previous episodes has been utterly obliterated!Part 5: Glemy’s revolt, the mishandling of the newtype concept, and the glorious retardation of the final 6 episodesThe final 6 episodes of ZZ are an exhibition of glory, both in terms of how epic they were and how monumentally imbecilic they were. These episodes are gloriously bad due to the brutally terrible foundation for these episodes and the fact that there are integral parts, scenes, and explanations missing here, mainly for two specific things that utterly decapitate these episodes: Newtypes and Glemy’s revolt. Let’s do Glemy’s revolt first since there are fewer things to talk about as to why this fails massively.We do in fact see that Glemy had ambitions of usurping Haman to rule Neo Zeon. Problem is: we don\'t see how his rebellion starts. We don\'t see how he is able to convince a myriad of soldiers under his belt or otherwise, to go along with him instead of Haman. Given that this is the impetus for the conflict of the final 5 episodes, in particular, ignoring something so important to this part of the plot is quite a bad move. Hell, they could’ve skipped the Rasara arc entirely to focus on expanding on this much-needed origin of rebellion, especially since there are only minor inklings of potential for this revolt prior to Glemy’s next appearance which is to effectively begin it. This intertwines with the next thing that kills the rest of this show. It’s finally time for the climax of this review; it’s high time I talk about: the Newtype shenanigans.Where do I begin? There is so, so much to cover here. How about starting with Chara, just to get the dead bitch out of the way. Oh yeah, she dies retardedly in the final episode while shouting her name triumphantly. Apparently, there is something wrong about her and how she is a cyber newtype to the point where this is used to explain all of her inconsistent behaviors throughout her appearance in episodes 10-21 and the final 6 episodes. Obviously, it doesn’t fly since she has no concrete personality this cyber newtype stuff is supposed to deal with barring her being a demanding bitch...which she is no matter what unless she’s smothering Judau in her bosom. A similar treatment is given to Mashymre after his departure around episode 12 and I don’t know why. We don’t see how he keeps getting roided, and we only ever see one newtype facility and that was for the purus that I’ll cover after this. Zeta bothered to show some of that shit, why not ZZ? He even has this happened between episodes of this section of the show offscreen. This is important and compromising information that we are missing out of. He overloads and commits the coolest act in this entire show and the most epic suicide in all of anime, if not all of fiction. The only thing I know to remotely rival this is the famous scene from Independence Day with the guy that crashed into the mothership. It\'s ineffective, sure, but he does it with such gusto the tits cool regardless, and literally, everyone takes notice.Speaking of Ples, before I dive into this particular shitsow, how about I say that Ple-Two is a decent enough character who goes through the typical “choose between brainwashing and freedom side while your head hurts” plot. Also, she is literally fucking impossible, her and the Ple army. Did they simply create Ple clones or something? We don\'t know. How come Haman knew nothing about any of this? No spies or mandatory reports? Somehow Ple (and eventually Judau) can channel newtype energy so powerful as to deflect beams entirely, and that literally makes no conceivable sense ever, and fuck episode 36 for including such retardation. Ple-Two controlling her mechs with her mind makes sense; RC control of them with her mind (aka doing it outside of the mech, like remote control with her mind) is a stretch, especially for giant mechs and those other shooting funnels being controlled all at once.In general, they keep adding new, absolutely stupid bs to the newtype business and even among that, it\'s wildly inconsistent at times. Also, somehow Judau does the same bullshit Kamille did at the end of his series which was always baffling and stupid because the final few episodes of Zeta were also retarded but this is next level shit. The last two episodes are especially riddled with stupidity however and make for a laughable bad finale. They also add forced romantic stuff between Beecha and Elle (who had no inkling of it and when Beecha said he was trying to be nice to her, everyone in the audience should call bullshit when they were all jackasses, especially him, Luke when he and Mondo tried to actively get Judau killed in the first half) for no real reason other than trying to make us feel happy and go “what a long way these guys have come” (though the second time they try that tactic, this time with the final episode with Judau and then saying one more goodbye before he faces off Haman was good). We don\'t how how Leina survived that incident in episode 28 of a mobile suit crashing and exploding into her shack where she was resting, setting the whole thing on fire (Sunrise…) but apparently now she’s with Seila Mass...who just happens to be on Earth somewhere and we don\'t even know where. Also, Ple-Two dies in the final episode (or at least passes or and is never seen again but come on, that\'s most likely death) and no one gives a fuck. Haman dies in a retarded way as well, and Glemy’s death scene makes no sense either both in terms of the Gundam that killed him and the fact that after Ple-Two rejected him to go with Judau, she jumps to save him as he disintegrates and his Mobile Armor blows up and she dies soon after (why?). Oh, and nothing is resolved about this war other than the two tyrants dying but that\'s apparently good enough for this anime...bleh!EpilogueSo that was Mobile Suit ZZ. A broken, stupid, largely insufferable mess of a series that took far too long to only temporarily become remotely decent, all the while downgrading everything positive about Zeta such as the visuals to some extent and especially the music. What a chaotic shitshow. The only reasons this isn\'t the worst in the franchise are that Twilight Axis exists now, almost ⅕ of this series was good and some parts weren\'t all that terrible, but when over half of your series, especially in the first half, is a 0/10, then there really is little hope for salvation, since it not only compounds every issue Zeta (an infinitely better anime) had but had its own heap of issues to fill a space colony.To be honest, I see little reason to watch this unless you really want to complete every Gundam anime out there, as it\'s among the worst-written of them all. This is also the longest anime I\'ve completed that I personally detest. As bad as SEED Destiny and 00 Second Season are, I don\'t outright hate them like I do with this one. It is one of two in this franchise I actively despise thus far; ZZ is truly the most loathsome this franchise has ever been. Now, with all that said, I bid you adieu.', ""Here is the short part:To me there will be 3 types of people who will watch ZZ.1.Those who enjoyed the angst of Zeta2. Those who didn't (Me)3.Those who have never watched a UC Gundam series beforeTo the 1's I say: This may not be the series for you as it is very lighthearted and sometimes campy from the beginning and doesn't really lose touch of these roots as it grows from it....Tot he 2's: I sympathize with you, and say that you will most likely enjoy the fresh characters and their passion in what they do.To the 3's I say: Why are you starting here? Go watch the original Gundam or at the very least Zeta. Please.The long of it:So as you may or may not already know, this series is the 3rd in the Universal Century (UC) Timeline. With the ending of Zeta very... grim, we reach a more light a and fun series with our protagonists.According to some this first part of the series is hard to get through, to others it is a very good up turn from the Zeta. To me I think this is a great addition to UC timeline.All throughout the Gundam franchise, angst has been hanging over the heads of all the characters, death of loved ones, betrayals, doubts of living through the next battle. And while this does help add depth to characters, this in retrospect however means that to tell a good story no one can be properly happy.ZZ topples this idea with spirited fun and characters with good growth and change throughout the series. And while some characters don't grow they still are enjoyable to watch as they exhibit the humanity that people can show throughout war without having to regress into some sort of puddle of angst and sorrow for however long.In terms of technical stuff, the art is what you'l expect and is well done; Sound is well placed and used; And the story is a very interesting one to say at the very least with characters that can be very tragic.

I've even read that some fans accuse Tomino Yoshiyuki, the director of the Gundam metaseries's first group of series including ZZ, of intentionally trying to ruin the franchise. That's pretty harsh, but I don't think it's truthfully quite as bad as it's believed to be.The plot takes place directly after Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and stars a group of teenagers who are junk collectors, the main character being another Newtype by the name of Judau Ashta. Now here's where things get a little different story-wise....The first half or so of the series is very lighthearted and comedy filled, contrasting greatly to its predecessor Zeta's intense drama. Then the story later takes on a more serious persona, which causes some little inconsistencies. There have been a lot of shows that integrate comedy with seriousness very well, and Tomino claims that he did wish to cheer up audiences, but the comedy-seriousness shift wasn't all that great here, causing the show to suffer some points.The deaths, which are a part of every Gundam series of course, weren't really handled very well in the series either. The overall tragedy and impact of the events was just missing a tad, which is definitely a disappointment because those moments deserve some good emphasis.Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ aired very shortly after Zeta finished, and thus the art is just of the same caliber. It's pretty good animation for the time, which is to be expected of a Gundam title. The sound department, however, falls a bit short of Zeta's outstanding musical quality. Not to say that it is bad, but it does not touch Zeta's work here. But, I will add on a positive note, that the first opening theme, &quot;Anime Ja Nai&quot;, is a very memorable song. Also, elaborating on that point, the contrasting theme songs display exactly the difference between the two halves of ZZ. The former, &quot;Anime Ja Nai&quot;, is close to a kid's tune, whereas the latter, &quot;Silent Voice&quot;, exhibits a more somber mood.Due to the whimsical first half, the characters aren't quite as developed as they probably could have been. Some of the main crew aren't really too appealing as characters, but there are some significant persons that deserve mention; Chara Soon being the first one to immediately come to mind. Several characters from the past series make appearances as well, but most of the said appearances are just cameos, with the exception of everybody's favorite captain Bright Noa and the Axis leader Haman Karn.The enjoyment factor is a little hard to judge, again because of the split tones of the show. The comedy half is enjoyable, but in my opinion the serious half is much better. That is of course just a matter of opinion though that will vary from person to person, depending on if you find the first half a nice change of pace, or if you condemn it for not living up to the previous stories.Overall, I think Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ gets cut down a tad too much because it simply doesn't match up to the standards and strong qualities set by Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. However, it is still definitely worth the watch for any Gundam fan, and you could certainly turn out loving it if you're the right person.

However, it is still definitely worth the watch for any Gundam fan, and you could certainly turn out loving it if you're the right person."", 'One of the things that gives Gundam ZZ a bad rap is the way it is so jarringly different in mood from its direct prequel, Zeta Gundam. Zeta Gundam is a great, brooding anime and a testament to how anime could tell a serious space drama. Bracing myself for what I knew would likely be a more upbeat anime, I gave ZZ a chance to impress me with an open mind.The collection of characters in ZZ, particularly the new group of protagonists, aren\'t terribly deep and aren\'t incredibly original, but they do have a kind of chemistry together that can carry the show during the...low points. Judau Ashta is our hero, a typical rash teenage boy pilot that we have seen a hundred times and will see a thousand more. Haman Karn returns from Zeta as the main antagonist, now seemingly more powerful and determined than ever. One of the surprising bright sides of ZZ is the unique chemistry that develops between Judau and Haman. Half the time, Haman is trying to kill Judau, and the other half she is trying to seduce him. While the series as a whole lacks enough tense moments, Haman and Judau seem to supply a few fireworks when they are in close proximity.Not all of the characters are nearly as tolerable, unfortunately. The first ten or so episodes heavily feature an antagonist named Mashymere Cello. His entire schtick of comedy through romantic fantasies of Haman gets old at a rapid pace. I was relieved when the focus shifted away from him. If you have seen Zeta Gundam, you might have been annoyed as I was with the bratty kid Katz. Gundam ZZ introduces a major character named Elpeo Puru who is lightyears more spoiled and intolerable than Katz could\'ve ever dreamed to become. Puru is supposed to be one of the good guys, too. We\'re supposed to like her, but it\'s almost impossible. Mashymere and Puru stand out as two of the worst characters, but rest assured they aren\'t the only people bringing this series down. Nearly the entire cast shares some quality that is a boon to viewers\' interests, whether they are boring, poorly developed, shallow, unoriginal, or just plain unlikable.The story of ZZ definitely lacks the scope and intrigue of other Gundam titles. Haman\'s troops chase Judau around space. Then they fight on Earth. Then they fight in space again. Then they have a final battle. There are some sub-plots surrounding the fate of Judau\'s sister Leina, and a planned coup d\'etat by one of Haman\'s underlings, which offer interesting tidbits. However, far too many of the episodes are complete throw-away stories, as the main plot isn\'t complex enough to fill a 47 episode series alone. Sometimes, a series makes the best of stand-alone episodes. Cowboy Bebop did this excellently. Gundam ZZ isn\'t crafty enough to pull it off.One last thing, as shallow as it might be, that I could not get over is the influence of the 80s on fashion for every character in the show. An Axis commander named Chara Soon looks like she wandered right out of a glam rock concert. Roux Louka has a spacesuit with a terrible Rainbow Bright-inspired star pattern on it. Judau\'s friend Elle dresses like a Madonna groupie, and Judau himself dresses like Michael Jackson. Except for our old friend Captain Bright, I don\'t think there\'s a single character who doesn\'t dress tacky on a regular basis. While this might not be a big deal to some, it was a little distracting.I admit that while starting out rough, Gundam ZZ does find legs and become watchable towards the latter half of the show. However, the first half of the show is really not much more than an unfunny comedy, which is bad enough for any anime but even worse when you\'re using the holy brand name of one of the most respected serious anime metaseries, Gundam. Also, even when ZZ does hit its stride, it only remains ""okay"" even at its highest moments.Does Gundam ZZ deserve a spot on some ""Shames of anime"" list? I don\'t think so. However, is it an above average series? I would say no. Other shows have better characters, more interesting filler episodes, and don\'t fail at comedy. Still, it is a believable continuation of the Universal Century storyline, so they could have screwed up worse. low points. Judau Ashta is our hero, a typical rash teenage boy pilot that we have seen a hundred times and will see a thousand more. Haman Karn returns from Zeta as the main antagonist, now seemingly more powerful and determined than ever. One of the surprising bright sides of ZZ is the unique chemistry that develops between Judau and Haman. Half the time, Haman is trying to kill Judau, and the other half she is trying to seduce him. While the series as a whole lacks enough tense moments, Haman and Judau seem to supply a few fireworks when they are in close proximity.Not all of the characters are nearly as tolerable, unfortunately. The first ten or so episodes heavily feature an antagonist named Mashymere Cello. His entire schtick of comedy through romantic fantasies of Haman gets old at a rapid pace. I was relieved when the focus shifted away from him. If you have seen Zeta Gundam, you might have been annoyed as I was with the bratty kid Katz. Gundam ZZ introduces a major character named Elpeo Puru who is lightyears more spoiled and intolerable than Katz could\'ve ever dreamed to become. Puru is supposed to be one of the good guys, too. We\'re supposed to like her, but it\'s almost impossible. Mashymere and Puru stand out as two of the worst characters, but rest assured they aren\'t the only people bringing this series down. Nearly the entire cast shares some quality that is a boon to viewers\' interests, whether they are boring, poorly developed, shallow, unoriginal, or just plain unlikable.The story of ZZ definitely lacks the scope and intrigue of other Gundam titles. Haman\'s troops chase Judau around space. Then they fight on Earth. Then they fight in space again. Then they have a final battle. There are some sub-plots surrounding the fate of Judau\'s sister Leina, and a planned coup d\'etat by one of Haman\'s underlings, which offer interesting tidbits.

After all I had managed to eventually finish Zeta Gundam - so how bad could this be? I guess the tag wasn\'t exaggerated. Now, while the other reviewers may have liked this, I have to beg to agree to disagree. Read on for a ""keeping it real"" review.Story wise, ZZ follows the generic gundam story line. Young hero, happens to ""fall"" into piloting the ""latest and greatest"" suit. Gets conscripted into fighting for adults whether willingly or unwillingly. Grows up, finds his own reasons to fight/not fight...which usually includes a love interest somewhere. Goes to space, comes back to earth, goes back to space and there is the inevitable big battle to end it all.However, despite having a good backstory with Zeta Gundam, ZZ fails to use the story framework to entertain the watcher.Judau is annoying. I know he started as a scavenger but after someone is kind enough to let you pilot their latest and greatest suit you and your friends should not be ""biting the hand that feeds"" by trying to turn in your rescuer\'s ship to the enemy for salvage. That ungrateful brat. Although I didn\'t particularly care for Camille B\'dan (from Zeta Gundam) because he was a whiny cry baby, let\'s just say by episode 10 I was PRAYING that he would come back and kick some sense into Judau.So, if I didn\'t like the protagonist why did I continue to watch this series? Well I\'m not a quitter, I honestly thought it would get better. But it didn\'t. The rest of Judau\'s friends were totally unlikeable too. Do they not know the meaning of the word ""LOYALTY""?? The villians were terribly whiny cry babies too. And weak. Not really villianous, more like Silly. Victory Gundam had more characters but they did it right, I\'ve honestly not seen another Gundam series with so many annoying characters.To top it all off, the plot was horrible and got worse. Judau cross dressing in the harem episode was surely the low point. The animation is dated with lots of re-use. Sound is average. And despite Gundam being known for good music they couldn\'t even manage to squeeze in JUST ONE good song into the series, that\'s not asking for much, right???So there\'s nothing there to really elevete or redeem this mess of an anime. I really wanted to like this and I gave it my best shot but let\'s just say by the time the anime ended I was relieved that it was over. If you don\'t have a lot of time to spare I would recommend watching some other Gundam Series and skipping this one. which usually includes a love interest somewhere.

The Arguma crew land on Shangri where they meet Judau Ashta a teenager who is taking care of his sister by dismantling mobile suit and selling...them for scrap for his buddies. As soon as the Neo Zeons attack the Arguma recruits Judau to pilot the latest mobile suit weapon the Double Zeta Gundam.Am just going say it right now the story of ZZ Gundam is hot garbage. I know that your all thinking but the show fixes itself in the second half, the finale was great and it returned Zeta roots. No. ZZ Gundam was always bad and the show did not improve all that much in second half.Before I tear apart the story of ZZ Gundam am going to tell you good about the story of ZZ GundamWhat I liked ZZ Gundam story.I actually thought the themes of growing up to be decently handed. It didn\'t become a preachy piece of shit and the show did a decent job at showcasing this because as much I hate most of the new characters they actually grow up as the show progresses.What I dislike from ZZ Gundam story.Everything else really due to the show being such a horrendous written show in almost every way possible.The first half of ZZ Gundam aka the 2 worst of Gundam content-wise.Many Gundam fans say that Seed Destiny second half is the worst thing from the franchise. I have to play an unpopular opinion on that because ZZ Gundam is easily the second worst thing I have even from the Gundam franchise only losing to Victory Gundam second half. I will get to the show soon because I have a lot of things to say to you.Back on topic. I was aware of ZZ Gundam goofy reputation because I been told by my friends and at first I didn\'t mind it the show has a different tone compared to Zeta. Then I watched it and now I just want to Bright Slap Tomino for directing this garbage.The comedic tone of ZZ Gundam is absolutely horrendous in every level.Not only it not appropriate for a Gundam show which keeps in mind it takes right after Zeta ended but it actually butchered the writing and pacing of the show. The comedy was cringe-worthy as we see characters and mechas put in retarded solutions like for example one of my favorite Gundam Zeta has was been reduced into a boxer thanks to Juadu. Who thought that was a good idea to write that.As for the episodes, the only episodes that I liked were the ones that featured Ple in it because she was honestly one of the only redeeming things about this shit show. Everything other episodes including episode 1 were horrendous to watch. Some of these episodes are just so horrendous they feel skippable because they are just that bad like the moon moon story arc which was the 2 episode arc which had no point existing.The second half is a bit better but not by much.The writing has slightly improved as the show has more stakes but it didn\'t fix everything that was wrong with the show.Overall the story of ZZ Gundam is hot garbage.The second half may be a slight improvement but the show cannot fix the travesty that is the first half.2/10Characters.Since the story of ZZ Gundam was absolutely horrendous how are the characters? Are they any better?NO! in fact, some of these characters are worse than the story itself.Judau is just a shitty Gundam protagonist. Imagine Kamile Bidan but without the charm and growth of this character.  He\'s an insufferable brat who is an asshole to people including his own sister. For example of his stupidity is where in one episode he aggressively tries to attack Fa after she slaps him for being a dick to his own sister. For whose asking Yes he does grow up in the second half and it he kinda matures as a character. The problem is that we the audience don\'t feel any sympathy or connection to this character because he was just an insufferable douchbag in the first half.  Now I like flawed characters because they actually have time to grow up and change as human beings.Judau is a perfect example to not write a flawed character and because of he just becomes just another one dimensional Saturday morning cartoon character. By the way, you will be seeing these words Saturday Morning Cartoon characters a lot during this selection of this review. Anyway, screw this character let\'s talk about Juadu\'s friends.They are all unlikeable, poorly written and they just felt like Saturday morning cartoon characters. Just horrible.Lenia is not a fucking character whatsoever She a plot device that only the plot going not to mention she\'s a fucking damsel in distress and a nag. How beautiful.Bright Noa. What did they do to you?You went from a proud and valiant leader in 0079 and Zeta and now in ZZ he devolved into a newtype babysitter.He is so less strick when you compare to him to 0079 and Zeta. What a wonderful way to ruin one of the main iconic characters from the franchise Tomino.The only good new character in ZZ is Ple. Unlike almost all of the characters in ZZ which are basically One Dimensional Satudary Morning Cartoons characters Ple actually has a personality and actually left like an actual character despite being a cyber newtype kid. She was honestly the only characters that I enjoyed from start to finish. It\'s such a shame that Ple is in this piece of shit show instead of Char Counterattack or even the prequel show Zeta.The villains in ZZ are pathetic.Before I start to roast these quotations ""villains"" let\'s talk about Haman Karn.She still a good character as still a badass and threating villain and she didn\'t get butchered unlike a lot of the previous characters. However, I question Haman\'s obsession with Judau. It was a bit out of character for Haman to have an obsession with Juadu an enemy. In the end of the day she still the best character in the whole entire show. I just wish she was in Char Counterattack instead of this shit show. She was clearly too good to be in this show.Now for the new villains. They are all horrendous.The first Saturday morning cartoon villain character list is Mashymre.He is a one-dimensional character, acts like a fool and he only exists to bring the most repetitive gags from the Gundam franchise where he always chivalry for his lady.Next, for the Saturday morning cartoon villain character list is that fat fucker Guzin who is an obnoxious scumbag. That all can say about him.Glemy is also not a good villain and he mostly exists to teach Leina in quotations ""some manners"" and become a pathetic loser around Roux. Least your not a Saturday morning cartoon character which is a blessing.Chara Soon is a horrendous excuse for a villain.  she has no concrete personality beyond being an insufferable bitch whenever she on screen. Also, the voice acting form this character. was ear bleeding? The only decent thing I can about this character that she, not a stupid Saturday morning cartoon villain. Other than that she a fucking mess.Overall like with the story the characters are hot garbage.2/10Visuals.Visually ZZ Gundam is almost identical to Zeta Gundam.The characters designs still have that 80s charm that I liked and the backgrounds scenery is still good.As for the mecha designs, I thought they were okay.The double Zeta itself looks cool but I feel it draws the line between real robot to super robot.The rest of the mechs range from good, mediocre to uninspiring.Overall the visuals of ZZ is still pretty good for what it is.7/10Sound.The music ZZ Gundam is pretty good overall.Most of the songs in Zeta make a return here but there are some new songs that fit  the light-hearted tone of the series. Some of my favorite tracks in ZZ Gundam include Arghama, Shangri La, Masshima Cello and Judau in Space (Track).Anime ja nai is a catchy song that fits comedic first half of the series while the second opening theme Silent voice fits the more serious second half of the series.The voicing, for the most part, is pretty good and most of the seiyuus did a good job for voicing each character minus Chara who sounds like dogshit.Overall the soundtrack is still good as ever. The opening and ending themes were good and the voice acting minus Chara was pretty good.7/10Final Thoughts.Train-wreck is the best way to describe this series.The first half was full of a lot of comedic garbage that felt like a poorly made Saturday morning cartoons Most of the characters sucked that behaved like Saturday morning cartoons and the show is a poorly written mess.The only good things from ZZ Gundam were the themes, Ple, visuals, and the music.ZZ Gundam is one of the worst Gundam shows that I have the pleasure of watching from start to finish.Is this worst than the Build Fighters Try, Wing and Seed Destiny?Yes because least those shows were fun to laugh at. ZZ Gundam is a fucking failure of a squeal.ZZ Gundam is one of the worst anime squeals I have ever watched in anime.I don\'t recommend this show to anyone unless you are a big Gundam freak such as myself.Final Score 2/10Anyway this was Shawn aka KurataLordStage and I will see you guys next time. them for scrap for his buddies.

I dipped my feet into UC Gundam and tried some AU, and in the spirit of what started as familiarizing myself with some of Super Robot Wars\'s most prominently featured series I decided to partake in the inevitability that is watching the notorious Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ. To know anything about ZZ Gundam at all is to know the reasons why it\'s so hated. Are they true? If you came here for my response, then the answer is yes and you can probably imagine most of the review...that follows. But I\'ll mirror the complaints that have forever followed ZZ Gundam regardless, because they always need to be acknowledged and never repeated. If you\'re a ZZ Gundam fan faint of heart, you may want to turn away. Also, please forgive me if any facts regarding the show\'s production are false, it was difficult to find concrete information.Let it be known that I\'m not the biggest fan of Zeta Gundam to begin with. It\'s a pretty good show but if I viewed it as the apex of the Gundam franchise there wouldn\'t have been much left for me to look forward to (thankfully, there was). For all the things it did quite well, it drunkenly stepped through them. You\'ve got your down-to-earth real robot series drama but with some occasionally inconsistent characterization and a regularly frustratingly childish cast. Some great Mobile Suit battles but far too many taking up screentime with some borderline monster-of-the-week Mobile Suits. You\'ve got a genuine space epic... but damn, would it have suffered any from being done faster? Zeta Gundam is very quirkily flawed yet is still a very fulfilling tale. Going into Zeta Gundam\'s sequel, you\'ll be pleased to quickly realize that all of these problems not only persist, but have been multiplied with some added new problems on top for flavor. Brace yourself, the legend begins here.Although many of his works are heralded as stone-cold classics, Yoshiyuki Tomino himself is seen far less favorably. I\'m going to cut to the chase and say that most people view him as a little bit crazy. If there\'s a good thing to say about him, it\'s that he at very least writes what he feels: the man is known for his mood swings that form the tone of the series he writes. He\'s gone from straight-up comedies (most innocuously Xabungle) and very serious melodramas (the most serious of which have earned him the loving nickname ""Kill \'Em All Tomino""). After ending his latest depressive state with Zeta Gundam, Tomino immediately began work on its more manic follow-up, the misnomered Double Zeta Gundam, and tries to do both.It\'s important we realize just what a bad idea the tone of ZZ Gundam was. This isn\'t a brand new Gundam series released with a significant gap between the others to help foster its own individuality; this is one of the very few direct sequel series. ZZ Gundam starts right where Zeta Gundam ended, and aired a week after Zeta Gundam\'s final episode. In a sense, this already ships ZZ Gundam as a second half to Zeta Gundam rather than its own series. It\'s perfectly reasonable why fans were alienated so much by episodes 51+ of ""Zeta Gundam"". The dumping or misuse of previous popular cast members as if they never existed and replacing them with incompetent children, stopping and then slowly murdering all momentum and intrigue built by the last series, and most importantly changing the tone to something entirely unrecognizable to no reward should be enough to make anyone think that Tomino is not simply creating a new Gundam series, but renouncing the previous series out of spite and contempt for it and its fans. A series many people loved and treated with seemingly more respect than the person who created it.It\'s unfortunate to both fans and detractors alike but also entirely fair (and only possible) to judge ZZ Gundam on the footholds of Zeta Gundam, because that\'s exactly what it prompts us to do. This is Zeta Gundam part two. The main situations the plot revolve around that vie for the viewer\'s interest are first planted in Zeta Gundam, so to fully enjoy all aspects of ZZ Gundam one has to have seen and have been interested in Zeta Gundam to begin with. But that\'s a genuine catch 22 as the writing of both series contradict each other and the person who can say they enjoyed the entirety of both equally has to be the rarest sort of Gundam fan. Ignoring Zeta Gundam while watching and judging ZZ Gundam is just not possible, because though the writing is different, the scenario is Zeta Gundam, the music is Zeta Gundam, the animation is Zeta Gundam, and the first Gundam is Zeta Gundam. To care about half of ZZ Gundam, you need to have cared about Zeta Gundam.To finally say something positive, the set-up of ZZ Gundam is actually pretty good on paper. The Argama is weary after Zeta Gundam\'s final battle and goes to rest up at the rundown space colony known as Shangri-La. Due to some contrived happenstance a group of ordinary junk dealers wind up as part of the Argama\'s dwindling crew. Needless to say, AEUG standards are slipping fast. But seriously, I rather like the idea of a ragtag cast composed of regular people in poverty with little education or Mobile Suit training. It\'s neat to watch these guys basically picked up off the street have to get their crap together and learn to be real soldiers. Or at least it would be if not for two things: One, that doesn\'t really happen, and two, they\'re direct replacements for a much more capable crew also comprised of some civilians not much more experienced than the ZZ crew. Again, comparisons are unavoidable. I also have trouble buying their acceptance by the Argama in the first place. Bright is noticeably mellowing out in what can be construed as character development, but he straddles the line between patient and naive, and naive is a negative aspect that you\'d normally never attribute to Bright. More on that later.After Kamille fucks off forever because Tomino doesn\'t care about him or you, the inept Judau Ashta takes his place as the protagonist. Judau\'s really not that bad compared to some other ZZ characters. As a matter of fact, he\'s one of the few new members that gets that character development I mentioned above, and his skill with a Mobile Suit increases at a noticeable and much more believable rate than that of Kamille\'s. If he wasn\'t such a routinely stupid jerk you might even root for him. But he is a stupid jerk. He regularly defies orders for no good reason and comes up with his own idiotic plans that should never succeed but do only because he\'s the main character. The best example I can give is when he and his genius friends come up with the plan to tie bombs to Judau and his Gundam and have him fly onto battleships threatening to blow himself up if the battleships don\'t do what he asks. This is real. On top of his adamant nature that could make Kamille look like the calmly collected Char, he also goes on even more of the same endless prattling about ""adults ruining everything"" that crosses the line from pubescent frustration into the cries of a 5 year old told they have to clean their room. Possibly the worst part is that if you\'ve ever read enough interviews with Tomino you\'d be inclined to think that he totally believes all this nonsense about ""soulless adults"" and ""kid power!"" that if I recall was a big theme in the Spongebob Squarepants movie.Rounding off the moron squad are Judau\'s also impoverished friends. Elle Vianno is by far the most valuable. She\'s a competent Mobile Suit pilot, completely reasonable, affectionate, charmingly friendly, and is one of the few main characters that never makes an ass of themself throughout the entirety of ZZ Gundam. In other words, she\'s a miraculous fluke and the best of the new characters, and the only reason she turned out so well must be because the writers simply forgot to make her terrible like everyone else. Beecha and Mondo are the troublesome shitheads that can\'t leave their former life behind and immediately resolve to try and sell out the Argama and get their lifetime friends murdered for nothing other than money (never mind Neo Zeon having no reason to pay them when they have power), and no one in the series gives a single fuck about this and lets them come crawling back later free of charge with very little said in the way of ""why the fuck did you just try and get your best friends killed?"". Remember all those unlikable characters in Zeta Gundam? Now imagine none of them ever getting their comeuppance and you have the frustration of those moments in Zeta Gundam stretched out indefinitely. Oh yeah, some guy named Iino is here too but I always forget his passive self exists until he\'s center screen. As said earlier, Bright Noa is the most significant returning character but is all of a sudden not reprimanding his asshole crew at all whenever they screw up (every episode) and just lets them do whatever stupid life-endangering activities they want (even when its his and the lives of others on the line). I guess he\'s just... getting so very tired... I know some people will want me to talk about Roux, Puru, Mashymere, Haman, etc. but I\'m wearing myself out just by covering the initial protagonists. I will, however, acknowledge Chara Soon, a female pilot who has an orgasm whenever she pilots a Mobile Suit and embodies the stupidity of ZZ Gundam more than any other character (a huge accomplishment), and Haman, a villain that gets props for having much more to do with the central conflict than Scirocco but isn\'t any more interesting.Of course, the characters all being screw-ups is directly related to ZZ Gundam\'s legendary tonal shift from Zeta Gundam, focusing more on comedy than drama. I mean, Zeta Gundam could get pretty melodramatic at some points and easing up on that could even do the serious moments some good by comparison, but ZZ Gundam\'s tonal shift offers absolutely nothing to it. At its best it\'s simply dry, boring slapstick, and at its worst it\'s clashing with the serious stuff and makes you want to murder the cast. The Neo-Zeon officer is explaining his plan to murder the heroes to the viewer, oh no! Oh look, as he was walking away he got his hand stuck in the door by accident. Well, all right then. And don\'t get me started on the hundreds of times in ZZ Gundam where a character is simply walking and for literally no reason just trips and falls on their ass. That\'s it. We\'re expected to roll over laughing because a character tripped or walked into a wall by accident or -charmingly- screwed up the Argama\'s plans thus risking the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians who don\'t deserve it. It\'s the laziest slapstick ""humor"" you could come up with, and it leads us to laughing at the characters and not with them. If the characters demanded the slightest ounce of respect to begin with this would be a much bigger problem, though.And therein lies the issue with a tone that\'s trying to pull in two opposite directions. ZZ Gundam\'s universe was already detailed to us in 0079 and Zeta as being very realistic, and the empathizable life-like characters were a big reason why the franchise became a hit, redefined the sci-fi genre in anime, and are why we care about anything that happens in the story. We see people on both sides of the war getting hurt and this matters to us because we know many didn\'t deserve it and were made victims of circumstance, as war is. ZZ Gundam sets us in the same realistic universe where death to innocent people is a very real and serious thing, then asks us to not mind and instead love it when our heroes put the lives of thousands, technically millions due to the scope of the war, at risk when they selfishly act on very poorly thought-out ideas because they\'re just a bunch of lil goofball kids and also adults suck. It doesn\'t work. The offscreen civilians and the former legacy of previous Gundam casts do not deserve to be jeopardized for the undeserved plot armor victories of the incompetent ZZ Gundam cast. You can\'t imply nothing\'s important in one scene then immediately demand something is one second later. ZZ Gundam has little to no control over its audience\'s emotions and violates basic writing sense for zero benefit. Its more light-hearted tone couldn\'t have been executed much worse and does nothing other than drag the series down because it\'s never even funny when it tries to be.Wait, it gets better? Dang, I guess you\'re right. In true ZZ Gundam fashion relating to the above, ZZ Gundam undergoes yet another tonal shift completely out of nowhere around the halfway point of the series. All of a sudden the indefensibly stupid actions of our heroes nearly cease and the comedy that remains is being executed out of the way of the more serious stretches, even if it still isn\'t funny. We\'re not reaching Zeta Gundam levels of angst or anything (again, not necessarily a bad thing), but what matters is that our characters are suddenly reestablished as mortal human beings with things at stake that we can understand and relate to. Although as if they\'re rising like a really subtle and lazy phoenix, nothing can repair the fact that we still view the groundwork laid in the first half of the series as the heart of these characters and that any real change to their attitudes is surface level because so much happens so suddenly without much of a transition in character. It doesn\'t feel like the cast grew up (because they always defended their actions and resisted criticism), it just feels like they\'re being written in a different way. Beecha and Mondo don\'t come back to the Argama because they realize they\'re hurting their friends, they come back because the Neo Zeon soldiers worked them too hard. Well, an improvement is an improvement.Regardless, the second half of ZZ Gundam still meanders with glacial pacing and endless diversions and sub-plots from the main storyline all the way up until the final three episodes. I\'m not kidding when I say ""major"" characters are written out for nearly twenty episodes and then are brought back with a literal plot device used to make them into competent characters. Even when ZZ Gundam tries to be serious it\'s so lazily done that caring about anything is just as impossible as it was before. Instead of spending several episodes fighting grunts in a desert or something, they could have had the sub-plots have to do with the main characters or the side characters they have suddenly returned when the series is almost completely over and give everything a more natural transition. Demanding anything from a show where the writing is so incompetent is pointless, and I don\'t think I would\'ve thought less of ZZ Gundam than I do now if it just stayed stupid the entire way through. In a way, it does. Even the finale of the series goes out with a whimper instead of a bang, and the showdown feels suddenly forced rather than built up to, as if the cast were just screwing around the whole time then just happened to find themselves in the final battle.I\'ve ragged on ZZ Gundam pretty damn hard here, but that\'s because I feel like it\'s important to reveal the conceptual principles that doomed the series from the very beginning and how baffling many of the choices made regarding the series are. If any single person realizes these mistakes and goes on to become a writer and avoids them themselves, then that\'s a success. At least ZZ Gundam is fairly far from being unwatchable. It\'s tolerable most of the time, albeit boring, but it\'s pretty screwed up that one of the nicest things I can say about it is ""it could\'ve been worse"". Is ZZ Gundam a failure? I don\'t see how it couldn\'t be. It fails as both a follow-up to Zeta Gundam and a stand-alone series. It\'s true that the series gets so much more of a bad rap for being compared to Zeta Gundam, but that\'s because it should. Even if you isolate it from its base (something you\'d have to consciously force) the things that make ZZ Gundam unique just aren\'t good. The slapstick gags and idiot characters are not fresh or funny. The drama is not very affecting as it revolves around characters we\'re unintentionally set up to dislike. Even the Mobile Suit designs feel played out after Zeta Gundam\'s similar Mobile Suits, and many are repeated. The most satisfying aspects of the story are the ones that relate to what was started before ZZ Gundam in better series. It\'s not the worst thing ever. It\'s not a hidden gem. It\'s not unfairly judged. It\'s Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam. that follows. But I\'ll mirror the complaints that have forever followed ZZ Gundam regardless, because they always need to be acknowledged and never repeated. If you\'re a ZZ Gundam fan faint of heart, you may want to turn away. Also, please forgive me if any facts regarding the show\'s production are false, it was difficult to find concrete information.Let it be known that I\'m not the biggest fan of Zeta Gundam to begin with. It\'s a pretty good show but if I viewed it as the apex of the Gundam franchise there wouldn\'t have been much left for me to look forward to (thankfully, there was). For all the things it did quite well, it drunkenly stepped through them. You\'ve got your down-to-earth real robot series drama but with some occasionally inconsistent characterization and a regularly frustratingly childish cast. Some great Mobile Suit battles but far too many taking up screentime with some borderline monster-of-the-week Mobile Suits. You\'ve got a genuine space epic... but damn, would it have suffered any from being done faster? Zeta Gundam is very quirkily flawed yet is still a very fulfilling tale. Going into Zeta Gundam\'s sequel, you\'ll be pleased to quickly realize that all of these problems not only persist, but have been multiplied with some added new problems on top for flavor. Brace yourself, the legend begins here.Although many of his works are heralded as stone-cold classics, Yoshiyuki Tomino himself is seen far less favorably. I\'m going to cut to the chase and say that most people view him as a little bit crazy. If there\'s a good thing to say about him, it\'s that he at very least writes what he feels: the man is known for his mood swings that form the tone of the series he writes. He\'s gone from straight-up comedies (most innocuously Xabungle) and very serious melodramas (the most serious of which have earned him the loving nickname ""Kill \'Em All Tomino""). After ending his latest depressive state with Zeta Gundam, Tomino immediately began work on its more manic follow-up, the misnomered Double Zeta Gundam, and tries to do both.It\'s important we realize just what a bad idea the tone of ZZ Gundam was. This isn\'t a brand new Gundam series released with a significant gap between the others to help foster its own individuality; this is one of the very few direct sequel series. ZZ Gundam starts right where Zeta Gundam ended, and aired a week after Zeta Gundam\'s final episode. In a sense, this already ships ZZ Gundam as a second half to Zeta Gundam rather than its own series. It\'s perfectly reasonable why fans were alienated so much by episodes 51+ of ""Zeta Gundam"". The dumping or misuse of previous popular cast members as if they never existed and replacing them with incompetent children, stopping and then slowly murdering all momentum and intrigue built by the last series, and most importantly changing the tone to something entirely unrecognizable to no reward should be enough to make anyone think that Tomino is not simply creating a new Gundam series, but renouncing the previous series out of spite and contempt for it and its fans. A series many people loved and treated with seemingly more respect than the person who created it.It\'s unfortunate to both fans and detractors alike but also entirely fair (and only possible) to judge ZZ Gundam on the footholds of Zeta Gundam, because that\'s exactly what it prompts us to do. This is Zeta Gundam part two. The main situations the plot revolve around that vie for the viewer\'s interest are first planted in Zeta Gundam, so to fully enjoy all aspects of ZZ Gundam one has to have seen and have been interested in Zeta Gundam to begin with. But that\'s a genuine catch 22 as the writing of both series contradict each other and the person who can say they enjoyed the entirety of both equally has to be the rarest sort of Gundam fan. Ignoring Zeta Gundam while watching and judging ZZ Gundam is just not possible, because though the writing is different, the scenario is Zeta Gundam, the music is Zeta Gundam, the animation is Zeta Gundam, and the first Gundam is Zeta Gundam. To care about half of ZZ Gundam, you need to have cared about Zeta Gundam.To finally say something positive, the set-up of ZZ Gundam is actually pretty good on paper. The Argama is weary after Zeta Gundam\'s final battle and goes to rest up at the rundown space colony known as Shangri-La. Due to some contrived happenstance a group of ordinary junk dealers wind up as part of the Argama\'s dwindling crew. Needless to say, AEUG standards are slipping fast. But seriously, I rather like the idea of a ragtag cast composed of regular people in poverty with little education or Mobile Suit training. It\'s neat to watch these guys basically picked up off the street have to get their crap together and learn to be real soldiers. Or at least it would be if not for two things: One, that doesn\'t really happen, and two, they\'re direct replacements for a much more capable crew also comprised of some civilians not much more experienced than the ZZ crew. Again, comparisons are unavoidable. I also have trouble buying their acceptance by the Argama in the first place. Bright is noticeably mellowing out in what can be construed as character development, but he straddles the line between patient and naive, and naive is a negative aspect that you\'d normally never attribute to Bright. More on that later.After Kamille fucks off forever because Tomino doesn\'t care about him or you, the inept Judau Ashta takes his place as the protagonist. Judau\'s really not that bad compared to some other ZZ characters. As a matter of fact, he\'s one of the few new members that gets that character development I mentioned above, and his skill with a Mobile Suit increases at a noticeable and much more believable rate than that of Kamille\'s. If he wasn\'t such a routinely stupid jerk you might even root for him. But he is a stupid jerk. He regularly defies orders for no good reason and comes up with his own idiotic plans that should never succeed but do only because he\'s the main character. The best example I can give is when he and his genius friends come up with the plan to tie bombs to Judau and his Gundam and have him fly onto battleships threatening to blow himself up if the battleships don\'t do what he asks. This is real. On top of his adamant nature that could make Kamille look like the calmly collected Char, he also goes on even more of the same endless prattling about ""adults ruining everything"" that crosses the line from pubescent frustration into the cries of a 5 year old told they have to clean their room. Possibly the worst part is that if you\'ve ever read enough interviews with Tomino you\'d be inclined to think that he totally believes all this nonsense about ""soulless adults"" and ""kid power!"" that if I recall was a big theme in the Spongebob Squarepants movie.Rounding off the moron squad are Judau\'s also impoverished friends. Elle Vianno is by far the most valuable. She\'s a competent Mobile Suit pilot, completely reasonable, affectionate, charmingly friendly, and is one of the few main characters that never makes an ass of themself throughout the entirety of ZZ Gundam. In other words, she\'s a miraculous fluke and the best of the new characters, and the only reason she turned out so well must be because the writers simply forgot to make her terrible like everyone else. Beecha and Mondo are the troublesome shitheads that can\'t leave their former life behind and immediately resolve to try and sell out the Argama and get their lifetime friends murdered for nothing other than money (never mind Neo Zeon having no reason to pay them when they have power), and no one in the series gives a single fuck about this and lets them come crawling back later free of charge with very little said in the way of ""why the fuck did you just try and get your best friends killed?"".

It\'s not unfairly judged. It\'s Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam.', 'The Gundam franchise continued to gain massive popularity due to the release of zeta Gundam. Its depiction of its heroes as flawed individuals who tried to reconcile their selfish desire with their sense of duty was a potent combination. In order to capitalize on his new found success, Tomino made ZZ Gundam which takes place right after the finale of Zeta Gundam. However, this entry into the franchise has to be the weakest one yet.Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam follows a group of misfits on a junkyard colony called Shangri-la. The Argama, the battleship which housed Kamille Bidan and Bright Noa from Zeta Gundam, dock the...ship there to get repairs. However, they brought remnants of the war onto this colony and it disrupts the lives of our protagonists. And there is the ever looming threat of Neo-Zeon led by Haman Karn and her plans to conquest the galaxy.The first you immediately notice is the glaring change in tone from Zeta Gundam. While Zeta Gundam had a very dense and dark tone, especially toward the end of the show, ZZ Gundam is much more light-hearted than its predecessor. This is much to the detriment of the show. The change of tone, in the beginning, is refreshing but its novelty quickly wears thin as the show progresses. You expect things to become more serious as we learn about the major threat that Haman poses to the galaxy but that tonal shift never truly comes. There are moments where the show becomes serious but quickly returns to that light-hearted tone.Another thing you may notice is the focus on comedy. Tomino decided he wanted to be a comedian and dedicated every 5 minutes to some slapstick humor. This ends up in a lot of hit or miss jokes, and the jokes mostly miss. The problem with the humor in this show is it is largely the same jokes being repeated without different execution. And the humor revolves around its characters and their personality flaws but if you do not like the characters, which I didn’t, the jokes become very grating as time goes on.Since this is a show directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, you can expect some character deaths. But the death scenes in the show were so poorly done as well as the scenes leading up to the deaths themselves, you will think ‘what the hell was he thinking?’ There is no emotional buildup to the deaths which makes the scenes themselves lack any impact. And spoilers, the characters you want to die end up living for the whole show. This left a very bad taste in my mouth as Tomino usually knows who to kill off in his anime.The art for this show remains high quality and very consistent. There are few moments where the animation falters and designs lack detail but those moments are few and between. There are also a lot of reused scenes but they are mostly the transformation scenes with the occasional scene from the Zeta Gundam opening being reused.Now let us talk characters. Tomino is known for making its cast relatively unlikable to the average viewer. They come off as reckless, hostile and sometimes idiotic. But these traits fall in line with their prior characterization and make a larger point about how immaturity has no place in actual combat. Also, their actions also came with consequences which add a layer of believability to the world and weight to their decisions. Forget about all of that in Double Zeta Gundam. The characters in this show are extremely unlikable, but they are written in such a way that we are supposed to like them. The show focuses on their comical hijinks more often than not and the humor is largely centered on their character. But these characters are so unlikable it becomes infuriating to watch them. And worst of all, with all their selfish decisions, almost everything goes their way. They never have to suffer for their selfish deeds and are often rewarded for it. This throws out everything that made Zeta Gundam so successful. This is especially true of Mondo and Beecha, my two most hated characters in the Gundam series thus far. These characters are spoiled and they never learn anything meaningful throughout the show. The gravity of their circumstances never causes them to have a major realization of life or themselves or their sense of duty. The majority of the cast treats everything so flippantly that you will undoubtedly be angered by almost everything they do.Another issue is the villains do not seem like believable threats for the most part. For the majority of the show, the villains come off as comical almost like Scooby Doo villains. You can practically hear them saying, “And I would’ve gotten away with it too if it weren’t for those darn kids!” every time their plans are foiled. But what the show does to Haman Karn is very upsetting. She still maintains the elegance, beauty, and intelligence that she had in Zeta Gundam. But the show makes it seem like surrounds herself with idiots on purpose which contradicts her planning nature. But still, she remains the best character in this show.Next is Judau Ashta, the pilot of the Double Zeta Gundam and the character that is most focused on in the show. All of those traits present in most of the main cast are present in him but to a lesser degree to where he becomes tolerable. One of the major issues I had was the bastardization of Bright Noa. What was a once a proud and valiant leader during the pivotal battles of the Gundam franchise, was now an impotent babysitter. The kids that he has to take care of are constantly ignoring him and humiliating him to a point where it becomes sad to watch.Is Mobile Suit Double Zeta Gundam Worth a watch? I would say no. It does not add anything substantial to the lore of the universe nor does it have any interesting characters. Watching 47 episodes becomes a test of one’s patience. The best thing for you to do if you are that interested is to read the plot summary on Wikipedia so you know what happens. Tomino, you done messed up now. ship there to get repairs.

The best thing for you to do if you are that interested is to read the plot summary on Wikipedia so you know what happens. Tomino, you done messed up now.', ""It is deeply horrible. The plot is a mess, the characters are a mess. Don't even bother trying to watch this like I did. Just read the wikia pages for Haman Karn and Judau Ashta, and that should pretty much give you the knowledge to not get confused with the U.C. Timeline Lore. I don't give it a lower rating just because it's competent at a technical level. But everything else is pitiful, dreadful. Pathetic.Really, don't even try.

Though the comical first half was shit I'll grant it that. It's probably why it gets so harshly bashed. But once you survive that, it gets back into Gundam form like you'd find in the original series and Zeta Gundam. However you still can't forgive its bad opening episodes of the Shangri-La arc. Especially if you're coming off of watching Zeta Gundam. You still get a great cast of characters, but they just take more time to evolve, much like the story did.But its in no way superior To Zeta Gundam.

It follows closely after the end of Zeta Gundam. Many say that this is the worst UC Gundam (not the worst Gundam) ever made. Well I that's what I think as well, though that doesn't mean that this show is bad.Story: 7What made people hate this episode is certainly the humorous story and the many filler episodes. That's what I think as well. Even so, I think that the core of the story quite good. The core story actually have some good conflicts, politics, corrupt government, conspiracy etc....Too bad that the filler and comedy episodes are just too many. Like, if this was made to be 15 episodes or so, it would be much better, since the core story only happens at around that number of episodes. The rest is just filler and comedy episodes, that didn't really feel like it contributes anything to the story nor to character development. I still give a 7 (good) since if I only took account the core story, it's actually a good continuation of Zeta.Art: 7Maybe it's just me but it seems the art is a bit lower than Zeta. Kinda like the animation quality is abit lower. Protagonist mecha is mostly the same as Zeta with ZZ and Mega Rider as addition, both unit doesn't really strike my fancy. On the other hand, enemy mechas are more interesting, units like Qubeley, Zaku III,  Quin Mantha, in my opinion is pretty cool. A matter of preferences though. Character design is still not a problem, although some of the sidekicks designs are a not that good.Sound: 7There's only two soundtracks that sticks to my head: the battle theme and 'Anime Ja Nai!' Well yes it's old, even at first I thought 'What the hell is this song?!' But like the 'Tobe! Gandamu' somehow it kinda sticks in the end. Othe soundtracks are just average. Sound effects is still the same as previous ones, not much changes here.Character: 6I think this is where this series kinda fails the most for me. Most of the protagonists are annoying. They don't have qualities that a protagonists in a war story should have. Even Bright is disappointing, he is not as strict as he was before. Maybe that's why the characters didn't grow much from being an annoying character. Most good characters are from the antagonists side, like Haman Karn, Ple2, and even Glemy Toto and Mashmyre Cero, the two had an awful introduction but at the end they become formidable enemies. Still, most of the characters are kinda annoying, like Chara Soon, Moon Moon sisters, etc.Enjoyment: 6The points above kinda kills the enjoyment for this series. While watching this. all I thought was 'When will something happen?' Really, the filler is just to much. Even the fillers in the original Gundam is still more enjoyable. Though I quite enjoy it when the plot did get a move. Mecha battles aren't quite as interesting as Zeta, though sometimes good battles does happen.Overall: 6Hmmm, when I gave this score, somehow it seems like this is bad. Actually, 6 is fair, which means it's not bad, it's still above average. With the many flaws it had, it still has a good point, namely the core of the story plot which serve as an excellent continuation of Zeta. That alone made it worth to watch. I thought of dropping this series at first, but I persevered, and after I finished it, I'm glad I didn't dropped it, since I got to see a good story (when I only take into account the core of the story), which wraps Zeta nicely, and sets up a good base for Unicorn's story.

The plot and art suits me very well, as well the mobile suits. But the porblem is when I was encountering Mondo and Beecha, its driving me nuts. I just had to stop right here and then to comment that those pricks ruins all the moment in this series. ', ""UPDATE: 2/7/24 AFTER BECOMING A COMEDY/SHOUNEN PATRICIAN MY OPINION OF THIS GUNDAM INSTALLMENT PUTS IT NECK AND NECK WITH ZETA AS MY FAV GUNDAM. That being said I have otherwise kept this review the exact same as when I originally wrote it, which was long before I posted it to MAL, and the rating of 10 I originally gave it, remains! Enjoy~Saying I was left aghast after the ending of Zeta is an understatement. I thought what a tragic, and non-glamorous way to depict war. Murdering the innocent, using the lives of family as blackmail, backstabbing, making brash decisions in the heat of the moment....It was like watching a car crash in front of you, and you just couldn’t turn the other cheek. Zeta was unpredictable, heartbreaking, and over before you knew it. I still hold my initial viewing in very high regard. Once I had reached the end of the final episode, I was crushed. Knowing that Kamille was left in a vegetative state, I could only postulate what the sequel would be like. Would Char use some newtype ability to help Kamille snap out of his dilemma? Would Kamille die off screen? Would all war in the universe cease after the Gryps Conflict? How would Tomino follow such an emotionally heavy finale? Well, clearly with a sequel with casual viewers and slapstick comedy in mind. Upon my initial viewing, I could not believe what I was watching, this had to be a joke right? And right I was, ZZ was a joke, a big joke that the series prides itself on. How does this light-hearted romp of a serious series carry the torch of its predecessor?In short, we follow a teenager named Judau Ashta and his group of ragtag junkers who sell mechanical scrap for money. Judau does this to put his little sister Leina through school, since their parents are no longer in the picture. One day, Yazan (former titan) persuades Judau and Co. to steal the Zeta Gundam, but it doesn’t take Judau long to realize that Yazan is no good. This leads to a battle between Judau and Yazan, where Bright Noa see’s Judau’s newtype potential (not long after Judau made contact with Kamille by accident when stealing a vehicle with Yazan that carried both Fa and Kamille in it) and begins to try and recruit him. Judau refuses to be a part of Bright’s fleet until his sister convinces him otherwise. From here we follow Judau and the rest of Bright’s daycare center as they battle Haman Karn who's trying to reclaim the Zeon’s former glory by conquering the galaxy.As I said earlier, this is much lighter in tone compared to both 0079 and Zeta. I cannot express my shock when Mondo, Beecha, and Lino fight off Cpt. Bright with oranges in episode one. Or the amount of slapstick humor that ensues in the first ten or so episodes where we follow Judau fighting off the world’s coolest simp, Mashymre. Yet despite its comedic tone, I still found myself looking forward to the next episode. In fact, upon a rewatch I found myself unironically laughing at some of the more subtle jokes throughout the series that I missed on my initial viewing. Judau ignoring Bright’s handshake and any interaction he had with puru come to mind. Actually, I found myself being able to draw more parallels between this and zeta the more I watched. It’s nowhere near as frantic as Zeta sure (or has as many children being slapped), but it’s not trying to and that’s not a bad thing. The only hindrance in it being more comedically driven (even past the second half which people often say is when it gets “serious” but I disagree, despite a few instances of civilians being massacred, but I digress) is that this paves the way for arcs that are pure-filler. That being said, I didn’t hate the moon moon arc. And I felt a legitimate sense of intrigue and compassion towards the civilians and soldiers in the arc that takes place in Africa.It’s not often that a series like Mobile Suit Gundam takes time away from the main forces duking it out to focus on those indirectly/forced to be involved in the war, much like the people of Dakar and Africa. And even if I must admit that some of these arcs dragged on a bit longer than necessary, I always looked forward to the interactions between my favorite characters as well as the bombastic battles that are flashier than ever. And I can assure you that each episode was chock full of them. As juvenile as it may seem, if the way a mobile suit directly reflects that of the emotions of the person piloting it, then I’m hooked. Even better if there’s stakes at play. The battles hold much more emotional weight with each passing episode.As I said, a large part of my enjoyment of ZZ aside from, “ooooh, big robots!”’ Comes from its characters, their intrinsic development, and or their interactions with each other. The best character arcs for me had to be: Judau’s, Beecha, Kamille, and Mondo’s. And the best character interactions involved: Bright, Puru, Chara, Mashymre, Judau. There were characters like Emary, Ino, Elle, Glemy, Roux, and others that weren’t fleshed out enough for me to care about them. Even with Mashymre, and Chara being largely gag characters still ranked as highlights of the series. Something about the dedication they have for their cause, plus their naive perspective on the majority of the situations they find themselves in, made them very amusing. Watching Kamille develop and staggeringly reclaim what he lost with the aid of Fa is harrowing and grand to watch. As is Judau’s development, who’s lampooned as a Gary Stu at times. I wouldn’t go that far, as I felt that each Gundam protagonist has an innate trait that they either conquer or grow out of. Amuro is loyal almost to a fault, Kamille is insecure and hyper-impulsive, and Judau is stubborn. Judau going from ragtag junker to a soldier that Haman tries to seduce, is satisfying to watch. Even the times when he’s in an emotional lull, he’s never thrown off his path for long. I’m sure this was intentional as even in emotionally heavy moments, there’s a character or event that tries to alleviate the tension.And that’s what this series was trying to do, present a story that’s still an MSG tale, but not one that doesn’t allow itself to have some fun every once in a while. Speaking of fun, we’re introduced to a multitude of new mechs with fun and unique designs. From the water mechs in Dakar, to Stampa’s Gundam garden. Even if the show may like to stay in one place for too long at times, much like the new mech designs, it too has a diverse array of locations shown throughout the show. Speaking of music, talk about a great soundtrack. The tracks that play during the show aren't too memorable, especially when compared to Zeta, but the OP/ED for both halves of the series are stellar and do a great job of communicating the vibe the show is going for.Much like previous installments, ZZ hits its stride in its character interactions and relationship developments along with its larger than life mecha fights. And this show is jam packed with that. And while I was already enjoying the show prior to Puru’s inclusion, I garnered an even bigger level of appreciation for this installment once she came on screen. Her initially awkward relationship with Judau is a highlight of this series for me. And while not every joke lands, in fact I’d say they hit a little less than half the time, I still manage to respect and appreciate that ZZ managed to tell a great and harrowing Gundam tale despite the comedic shift in tone. There’s still plenty of moments where characters act super off-kilter and impulsive like in Zeta, and it’s these moments that remind me that the occasional crazy spice in the story is just what was needed. And though the jokes can be a bit much at times, especially early on when I felt they were taking time away from moments that could’ve been used to either flesh out a character or the plot, it never reached a point where it didn’t feel like Gundam.Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam isn’t interested in carrying the torch that Zeta handed it, as it’d rather turn that torch into an ice-cream cone to see if its titular MC could eat it in one bite. Though the show has its share of slogs, unfunny jokes, janky-animation, and making Bright a bit much of a push-over at times. It more than makes up for it with its visual flair, legitimately funny moments, character arcs, and larger than life mech battles and stakes. I kept the review spoiler free as I think this an installment worthy of your watch time, as even if you don’t laugh at all the jokes I can guarantee that you’ll be emotionally invested in at least one situation the show presents. Whether that be a gleeful or sorrowful emotion, depends on the viewer and their stance on the series. It was like watching a car crash in front of you, and you just couldn’t turn the other cheek.

The main issue I believe people have with this show is the tonal whiplash between it and Zeta, which is especially present in the beginning. The unseriousness of Zeta gradually grew into an amazing war drama, and the similarly silly ZZ feels jarring in comparison, even if it follows a similar trajectory. The character writing and worldbuilding present in Zeta and 0079 are still here as well, you just have to look harder than usual for them. The difficulty in...parsing them in Zeta came from how understated and subtle they were, but the difficulty here is because the show keeps sticking out its tongue and making funny faces at you to distract you from them. While these conflicting sides of the show are divisive, anyone who tells you to skip ZZ in the timeline is crazy.The greatest failure of ZZ is the failure to commit to either comedy or seriousness, in the attempt to appeal to everyone. For those who disliked the melodrama of Zeta, the comedy is refreshing, but for people looking for drama, there isn't enough of it. This lack of commitment to its two sides splits the fandom into groups believing Gundam should be one or the other, and leaving only a small camp who fully accept the oddball hybrid nature of the show for what it is. ZZ is not bad, it's just different, and I've realized I prefer the approach of Zeta.With that said, ZZ is a part of Zeta. It wouldn't be amiss to compare Judau to someone like Luffy, whose optimism and resilience serve to distract the viewer from the horrors of the universe around them; after Zeta, ZZ is a necessary bit of levity and hope in the maelstrom. The jokes land pretty frequently, animation and fight choreography have noticeably improved, and the goofy cast is endearing. More importantly though, it completes the story of Zeta, and on a larger scale, ZZ is an essential part of the thematic development of UC gundam as a whole. When gundam is good, really good, it sets my brain on fire, and I can't stop thinking about it for days. If Zeta was the make-or-break of my involvement with gundam, ZZ had to solidify my love for the series, and it did it beautifully. parsing them in Zeta came from how understated and subtle they were, but the difficulty here is because the show keeps sticking out its tongue and making funny faces at you to distract you from them.

If you know anything about Gundam - indeed if you\'re checking this page - you have probably heard of the infamous ZZ before. You might be wondering whether it truly is as bad as people say it is and are reading this review to find out. Let me tell you right off the bat that ZZ is exactly as bad as it sounds. It\'s a frustrating and miserable experience watching ZZ coming off (what seems to be) the series high point of Zeta.The oft-cited comedy is not just tonally inconsistent, it\'s unfunny. It\'s bad enough that the...serious themes of Zeta are reduced to a joke but they could at least try to make the joke funny. The early episodes of ZZ (and many of the later ones for that matter) feel like a fever dream even mere days/weeks after watching them and so much of the run time is wasted on so many pointless detours that the bits that are good and feel like they will actually matter later often flash past in an instant to get back to the dragging low points. It\'s almost to the point where I\'d feel comfortable recommending you skip ZZ except that so many important things happen over the course of it. I won\'t go into them here in detail but suffice to say that the next piece of the franchise (Char\'s Counter Attack) almost certainly won\'t make any sense unless you watch it - or at least read a detailed summary of the events.A much repeated sentiment in the area of ZZ analysis is that the show ""gets good"" after approximately episode 20. This is true but there\'s an important caveat that has apparently been left out of the \'group consensus\' - It gets bad again after episode 36. It\'s almost like watching ZZ is going through a hurricane; you make it through the initial destruction and think that the disaster has passed however you have really only entered the unfortunately all too brief eye of the storm and waiting for you on the side is more of that same despair. Mercifully, ZZ never quite reaches the same lows after that potentially Zeta quality middle section but it\'s still a huge let down to return to many of the same frustrating characters that barely seem to have grown as the series evidently has.Speaking of the characters it\'s very difficult to like any of them. By the end I sort of found myself attached to a few of them but I almost want to attribute that to Stockholm syndrome more than anything else. The main cast takes ages to develop if they do at all and there are so many teenagers running around at many points that even stable characters we already know seem to take a nose dive out of maturity (I\'m looking at you, Bright).What can we say in terms of the good here? Well it looks pretty good most of the time. Zeta did as well of course so ZZ isn\'t doing anything special here but at least it\'s not simultaneously as visually frustrating as it is intellectually. I can only imagine that if - for example - ZZ had come in 0079s place (with the questionable 70s animation and sound design and all that comes with that) the series never would have gotten off the ground to become the behemoth it now is.All this is to say that unless you\'re a completionist you can probably do without ZZ in your life. It\'s ultimately just not really worth it. If you do think you want to watch ZZ:1. Be prepared for it to be really bad right from ignition and stay that way for a good 20 episodes.2. Be aware that the good does not stick around forever and that the ending leaves much to be desired.3. I\'d highly advise that you try and locate a list of episodes that are skippable and then do so. serious themes of Zeta are reduced to a joke but they could at least try to make the joke funny. The early episodes of ZZ (and many of the later ones for that matter) feel like a fever dream even mere days/weeks after watching them and so much of the run time is wasted on so many pointless detours that the bits that are good and feel like they will actually matter later often flash past in an instant to get back to the dragging low points. It\'s almost to the point where I\'d feel comfortable recommending you skip ZZ except that so many important things happen over the course of it. I won\'t go into them here in detail but suffice to say that the next piece of the franchise (Char\'s Counter Attack) almost certainly won\'t make any sense unless you watch it - or at least read a detailed summary of the events.A much repeated sentiment in the area of ZZ analysis is that the show ""gets good"" after approximately episode 20. This is true but there\'s an important caveat that has apparently been left out of the \'group consensus\' - It gets bad again after episode 36. It\'s almost like watching ZZ is going through a hurricane; you make it through the initial destruction and think that the disaster has passed however you have really only entered the unfortunately all too brief eye of the storm and waiting for you on the side is more of that same despair. Mercifully, ZZ never quite reaches the same lows after that potentially Zeta quality middle section but it\'s still a huge let down to return to many of the same frustrating characters that barely seem to have grown as the series evidently has.Speaking of the characters it\'s very difficult to like any of them. By the end I sort of found myself attached to a few of them but I almost want to attribute that to Stockholm syndrome more than anything else. The main cast takes ages to develop if they do at all and there are so many teenagers running around at many points that even stable characters we already know seem to take a nose dive out of maturity (I\'m looking at you, Bright).What can we say in terms of the good here? Well it looks pretty good most of the time. Zeta did as well of course so ZZ isn\'t doing anything special here but at least it\'s not simultaneously as visually frustrating as it is intellectually. I can only imagine that if - for example - ZZ had come in 0079s place (with the questionable 70s animation and sound design and all that comes with that) the series never would have gotten off the ground to become the behemoth it now is.All this is to say that unless you\'re a completionist you can probably do without ZZ in your life.

Mainly, it was a departure from the dark melodrama that its predecessor (and my favorite show in the franchise), Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, had introduced. The show takes a kid-friendly approach in its first half, which I found to be unbearable. However, the dark drama that Zeta packed is still here and it\'s thrilling. There\'s a lot to talk about ZZ, so let\'s get started.Story- The story immediately takes place after Zeta Gundam. The Titans have been defeated and the Axis Zeon threat arises. The...Argama and its crew are in bad shape after the battle so they drop by a nearby colony, Shangra-La, for repairs. The story follows junk collectors, Judau Ashta, and his friends. Together, they plan on boarding the Aragama and capture the Zeta Gundam in hopes of selling it to make a living. I found the first few episodes to be unbearably campy since it\'s targeted at children. However, during the second half, things get very climactic and interesting. Without spoiling much of the plot, ZZ get\'s better later during it\'s run.Characters- Most of Zeta Gundam\'s cast make a return. Captain Bright, Kamille, Fa, and even Axis leader Haman make a return. Similar to Amuro and Kamille, Judau may start as a jerk at first, but gets well-developed as the show progresses. He\'s a good pilot with noble intentions and I took a linking to him in the end. We also get to learn more about Haman Karn and her objectives. As for Judau\'s pack of friends, they\'re alright. I liked Rou, Puru, Lino, and Elle. While some of them such as Mondo and Beecha tend to be extremely annoying at first, they were OK in the end.Presentation- Much of the presentation remains intact compared to Zeta. The visuals are the same, however, I noticed that they take a dip in quality here and there. In terms of mobile suits, the Mk. II, Zeta, and Hyaku-Shiki make a return and they\'re still looking good. However, it\'s the ZZ Gundam that steals the show with it\'s sheer power and awesome look. The audio is subbed, but the voice cast does a great job of portraying the characters. The soundtrack is just as neat as Zeta\'s. Tracks such as ""Anime Ja Nai"" fits the kid-oriented tone of the fist half while ""Silent Voice"" fits the more serious tone of the second half.Overall- Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ is a polarizing show that takes time to get used to. The comedic fist half falls flat, but the second is more dark and developed, which I found to be awesome. I was tolerant of it during the first 20 episodes and by the time the show reached its end, I ended up liking it. Nevertheless, if you can get past some of it\'s shortcomings, you\'ll end-up having a good time.

Yeah I get it Zeta was kinda of dark but it\'s better than the first one and Gundam is a story about War and violence it\'s suppose to be a little dark...To Compare Zeta with ZZ:Zeta is a frowny faceZZ is a cheesy smileIf you like being slapped in the face in the end this is the Anime for you!If you watch Zeta then went directly into ZZ be prepared. The first like 20 some episodes we completely like a happy fun time show, it kind of reminded me of galaxy...express a few times for it\'s weird little stops that made no logical sense in the Gundam U.C. The next like 15 episodes were a little better as it move more in the direction of normal gundam u.c. It really kind of picks up after they get a new ship but it is still like WTF.... They tried to implement romance in the story line as well however it is kind of like wow  really at the end... And you know how they don\'t show the epilogue well in this one they do but epilogue is like ok why is he doing that?Definitely a low point for Sunrise express a few times for it\'s weird little stops that made no logical sense in the Gundam U.C.

There are actually many points where I began enjoying this anime more than Zeta, despite how whacky it can get. But overall, the anime just falls flat on so many points.Story: Basically, the story is about a group of teenagers that are -partly- forced to join the ranks of the military. It has a mostly comedic feel to it, with the plot getting slightly darker as it reaches towards the end. First off, the story is chock-filled with filler and events that barely affect...the overall plot that it gets to be a real drag. The pacing is horrible and it gets difficult to take anything serious until around the second half. It tries too hard to mix comedy and serious elements together that it just ends up being a complete mess. Throughout the whole show, I could hardly really care about it all, but I gave it a 3 because it at least still contributes to the lore of the Gundam universe.Art: The animation was pretty good for its time, and in some ways still shines in the present day. The art in general was pretty rough, considering it's from the 80's, but at times it honestly looked more detailed than even today's anime. There really is a lot of spirit packed into many of the scenes, and I feel obliged to appreciate that, so I'll give it a 7.Sound: Not much to say here. The soundtrack wasn't anything impressive, but I'll give it a 6 since it had 2 great opening themes.Character: Here is where ZZ had the greatest chance to shine. It honestly brought up some great opportunities for amazing character development. Judau overall remained to be a very intriguing protagonist with his confident and ambitious character having a ton of personality compared to 0079 and Zeta. Pretty much any character that had a strong relationship with him felt well written. There was his sister, who he had a wonderfully touching relationship with, Puru who tried to fill that sister role, and Haman who had a mysterious connection with Judau. The characters of this show as a whole had so many chances to create dynamic developments, but Judau was probably the only one to actually feel satisfying, unfortunately.Enjoyment: I flat out bored myself throughout this anime. There were a few bits here and there that I enjoyed, but the rest of the time I felt like I was forcing myself through it.Overall: I would have gave this anime a 1, but I had to at least recognize some of the -good- elements it had. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anybody, just go look up a digest somewhere or something. the overall plot that it gets to be a real drag.

At its core, this series is a true gundam series with similar themes to its predecessors and successors. However, the creators have tried to be creative and throw in new elements not common to the Gundam series at the time that appears to have disgruntled long-time fans of Gundam, namely comedy, slapstick, zaniness, and lighthearted fun.As such, the series was bombarded with undeserving negative reviews for straying from the typical Gundam atmosphere which has historically carried serious tones and a heavier focus on war themes.Looking past...all that, Gundam ZZ is a good anime that I would encpurage all fans of the series to stick out and watch at the very least the first 20 episodes before deciding whether to drop it or not (yes, it takes a while to pick up, but in my opinion it's worth it).Gundam ZZ takes a fresh approach, introduces some much welcomed light hearted fun and slapstick comedy to create a show that is much more focused on the characters, their development, than the overarching war themes.As a result, we see strong and unique characters like Judau, Ple, etc. coming into the field. No longer the typical whiny Gundam MCs like Amuro and Kamille, Judau enters the show by establishing his strong convictions and morals early, being a likeable MC that knows what he wants and where he's going.Another great (and my favourite) character is Elpeo Ple. She does suffer from being pushed into the same tragic Cybernewtype archetype that the Gundam series is infamous for, but everything else about the character is superbly well done to the point that this single character manages to create an entirely new character archetype based around her that future animes continue to use to this day. Adorable, cute, mentally unhinged, and sporadic, Ple is a bundle of unrestricted fun in the same sense as seeing the genuine and innocuous smile of a child in real life that has yet to face or see the cruelties of life. all that, Gundam ZZ is a good anime that I would encpurage all fans of the series to stick out and watch at the very least the first 20 episodes before deciding whether to drop it or not (yes, it takes a while to pick up, but in my opinion it's worth it).Gundam ZZ takes a fresh approach, introduces some much welcomed light hearted fun and slapstick comedy to create a show that is much more focused on the characters, their development, than the overarching war themes.As a result, we see strong and unique characters like Judau, Ple, etc. coming into the field.

Following the dark and intense storyline delivered from Zeta Gundam that delivered some shocking developments with remnants of the Zeon Empire taking root and Kamille's comatose state, ZZ attempts to go for more light-hearted and kid-friendly storytelling in its focus on Judau Ashta, a young junk collector recruited by Bright Noa to be a Gundam pilot for the Argama due to Kamille's comatose state. The light-hearted mood for ZZ is felt in much of its first half as slapstick comedy and lack of intense violence are a regular...sight for much of ZZ's first half. While the comedy can have its moments at times, it clashes poorly with the dark mood and war themes established from the first two Gundam TV titles.From what I gathered of the series history, series director Yoshiyuki Tomino attempted to give the series a more lighter mood and would have eventually had Char Aznable make an appearance as a major enemy threat. But when he got the okay to do production for Char's Counterattack, Tomino changed plans and restored Gundam's normal mood and themes to ZZ's storyline as the show went into its second half. This led the series to take a major improvement in quality as Neo-Zeon leader and main villain Haman Karn became more active in the show's plot and major dramatic events take place from the escalating conflict between members of the Argama and the Neo-Zeons that include the franchise's penchant for killing off major characters. Both sides in the conflict get their fleshing out to show that members among the factions have their redeemable traits and tragic character elements that result from fighting in war with characters such as Haman and Ple. The second half still suffers somewhat with some points where ZZ's comical mood from the first half of the series rears its ugly head and the usual Newtype gimmickry that leads to convenient plot developments when lead characters like Judau seem to be nearly down for the count.Visually, Gundam ZZ is an improvement over Zeta Gundam as it sports more cleaner lining and details with its mecha and spaceship designs. A number of the character designs, particularly those with Judau's group and some Neo-Zeon members, were made in mind to fit popular 80s trends of the time period such as clothing and hair styles, but look ridiculously outdated to modern audiences. The battle choreography for ZZ is creative and diverse for the most part as characters deploy different types of mecha for varying battle tactics and capacities, and some technologies get deployed to aid in battle strategies such as the dummy asteroids and funnels used by Newtype-powered mecha.Still for some of the positives offered by ZZ, the series still suffers greatly from the tonal shift that its first half offered up with its lighter mood and slapstick comedy clashing badly with the more serious mood, themes, and story developments established from earlier Gundam titles. While still a necessary watch as the series continues events from Zeta Gundam and has developments that contribute to Char's later actions from Char's Counterattack, I would be hard-pressed to watch it more than once. sight for much of ZZ's first half.

The first half started off god awfully slow, there was a lot of cheesy comedy and pretty much no threat of death or any good narratives . I don\'t think first half was bad per say, but just really generic for the most part .Show gets a hell of a lot better near the mid point of the series, during the Earth arc . I really enjoyed pretty much all the Earth episodes, it really seemed to reflect the brutality of war quite well and we get some interesting stories about how different people are effected...by the war.  It almost feels like a totally different series than the rest of the anime .When the crew left earth , and the show started gravitating towards its conclusion,  it was still decent but not the same level quality of the earth episodes by any means. The fights were pretty well done,  but I found most of the events that happened were just predictable and couldn\'t get that invested into the last battles because I wasn\'t that interested in the characters to begin with .The main cast of the show, the kids from Shangri-la, were sub-par for the most part. I didn\'t find a single one of them to be particularly interesting. They do quite a bit of arguing in general and walk into their fair share of traps and  bad choices,  but then again they are mostly middle school aged teenagers so I can\'t be that hard on them I guess.  If I had to pick one I liked the most it would have been Roux, since she kicks more ass than all the other kids and usually was the voice of reason when not arguing with Elle. I will say that the one thing I liked about the main character of ZZ Judau is that he is much less whiny and not anywhere near as angsty as either of the first two gundam protagonists Amuro or Kamile. Judau is a lot more carefree but I think he is also a more simple and less interesting character as well.I thought the artwork and animation were okay for this show, nothing special. The two opening songs I thought were really good and catchy tunes .Double Zeta really is missing that ""oomph"" factor that that the two previous series had , I think it was missing really good interesting or charismatic characters, and missing outside of the Earth episodes much of a gripping plot to really keep you invested .Something I particularly didn\'t like towards the end of the series is all the newtype ghosts and too many characters have newtype abilities , it kind of ruins the novelty of newtypes when so many characters are all able to sense telepathic messages.There is even an important reveal made near the end of the anime that made me question what really was the significance of ZZ Gundam in the overall time line of the Universal Century . I don\'t want to say what the reveal was in fear of spoilers but damn it pissed me off . by the war.

So naturally, I was expecting the worst when I decided to watch this. And I could not have been more wrong.I would highly recommend watching ZZ, its a really good anime and in my opinion it doesn\'t deserve the hate it gets.it starts off pretty bad, there was way too much comedy in the beginning and the whole thing just felt like a bad and childish joke. But don\'t be fooled, just because the first few episodes are bad doesn\'t make it a bad anime. Id say it starts...getting pretty good when they leave the colony and go into space. and from that point it just gets better and better.and this is coming from someone who loves Zeta Gundam, I still like Zeta more but I feel that ZZ comes pretty close to it. sure its different from Zeta, but this doesn\'t mean that you will automatically not like ZZ just because you liked Zeta. I think both are amazing.There are a few bad things about it, like the horrible comedy, and some characters being very annoying at firstand also of course that it was absolutely horrible in the beginning.but in the end I really don\'t understand where all the hate ZZ is receiving is coming from, sure it has a few problems, but overall its very good. If you\'re thinking about giving it a try then I say go for it, I understand that the ""worst ever Gundam"" label that some people have given it might scare people away, but I suggest that you at least try watching it. and if you think its unbearable to get to the good part then that\'s fine but in my opinion, you\'re missing out. getting pretty good when they leave the colony and go into space. and from that point it just gets better and better.and this is coming from someone who loves Zeta Gundam, I still like Zeta more but I feel that ZZ comes pretty close to it. sure its different from Zeta, but this doesn\'t mean that you will automatically not like ZZ just because you liked Zeta.

Fans who were outraged to see their favorite characters turned into parodies of themselves. The viewers wanted something more brutal and darker than Zeta and were horrified to see Bright chasing chickens around like a maniac and Gundam fights involving boxing and goofy, bonking sound effects. The serious tone went out the window, and at many times felt like the looney tunes writers were advising Tomino.Despite all that, I was able to appreciate this new, bold, and risky approach. It wasn\'t supposed to be taken so seriously, and yet people...got angry because Gundam had been very serious up to this point. The first part of ZZ is comedic, until it decides to crush you later on when it starts to get serious. Songs from Zeta started to reappear, and death followed. After a beautiful ending, I felt assured that this continues the glory of this timeline in Gundam history.The comedic approach takes the series and makes it into a parody of itself for the most part. It felt as if the writers were making fun of and pointing this out when Bright sees his command center turned into a daycare center, and wonders ""what is going on?"" as his crew fools around immaturely. I had a theory in the beginning that the war broke the characters minds and resulted in the type of humor it approached with how ridiculous Bright and the rest were acting.At the front and center is Judau, an optimistic Junker who finds himself in the Zeta Gundam after trying to steal it and gets dragged into Haman\'s war. The two become rivals, and maybe she felt close to him, but their ambitions clearly don\'t match up and they have to fight. Judau had never known war, and he becomes frustrated with the war mongering of the adults, their cowardice, and the needless deaths he has to witness. Judau is a strong person who brings a light hearted spirit to ZZ. But he has to suffer, and this series tells how painful his life has to become during his struggle.On the brighter side, his character is very different from Amuro and Kamille. Unlike the others, he isn\'t a punching bag, and even those like Mr. Wong can\'t control him. I enjoyed his rebellious personality that is much more rational and free spirited.Puru is another great character that adds charm to the series. The dynamic between her and Judau is great until the writing turns it into a disaster.ZZ introduces a large cast of new characters to replace the previous crew. Of the older characters, Bright appears as the most consistent one. As harsh and unforgiving as he is, it\'s necessary to tame the type of wild spirits he has to deal with as a captain. They did fix one of Zeta\'s shameless mistakes of leaving important characters in the background with no lines. Once the story gains more intensity, it will feel like Zeta all over again. The new music for this is amusing because it\'s set to the tone of the comedy, but overall feels weaker than Zeta\'s soundtrack. The animation is as consistent as Zeta was, and is refreshing to see after watching all this CGI madness from last year\'s seasonal anime. You can say it\'s limited to its time. Despite that , there\'s no denying the great effort put to detail in expressions, body language, and Gundam fights. It may be old but the effort is there that makes it feel more natural than a lot of the soulless anime that is made even today.My biggest complaint for this is a very specific character death that was handled terribly. After the fact, it was as if nothing had happened and the person felt forgotten for the most part. It was almost as if nobody cared. There are some other odd deaths such as a person dying because a large rock fell next to them, confusing the viewers. Also, some characters just disappear and are never seen again. The animation though is overall good does take some embarrassing shortcuts such as the infamous ""stomping mobile suit."" There is also the obscene topic of ""Bright\'s potential adultery."" After the series becomes serious, it went back to the goofy comedic approach near the end which felt unnecessary. The Newtype powers, of course, continue to evolve. Some viewers are on the fence about this because of how silly it can look when Gundam\'s begin having forcefields and demonic spirits start coming out of the Newtypes. There are some characters like Mashymre who are embarrassing as villains but hilarious to watch. Some characters suffer what feel almost complete personalities changes that I tried to understand but felt odd regardless.If you came here for Char or Amuro, you will be disappointed, regardless of the fact that they are in the opening sequence. Still, the cast is large and likeable enough to be able to go on without them; at least for now. By the end, all the characters became great after their goofy beginnings in the early episodes. Kamille is here, but has suffered a tragic fate as was revealed at the end of Zeta.The center of the story involves the reemergence of the Zeon. The Zabi family is trying to make a comeback after the fall of the Titans in Zeta. Lead by Haman, they try to seize space and trigger a new war. The Earth Federation of course are slimy cowards who are more concerned with their own safety, comfort, and luxuries. Judau sees this cowardice and calls it out. The tragedy of Haman is that she could have been one to unify space instead of doing this. Somewhere in the past she was associated with Char, and the two are similar in that they have strong ambitions coming as Zeon soldiers, but have some kind of ulterior motive in the background that isn\'t well meaning.After some Tom and Jerry tier Gundam fights, endless jokes and slapstick comedy, ZZ does begin to horrify the viewers once the story begins to show it\'s more brutal side. The deaths here felt more impactful than in the original and Zeta. Some of them actually upset me, and that had not happened before. This is because of the comedic approach. It softened up the viewers in an almost deceitful way. I felt tricked. The light hearted comedy and character development made some character deaths even more brutal to watch.By the end, I felt satisfied with that ZZ had to offer. It deserves more praise and less misunderstanding. By the end, the struggle reaches a new phase, but a red comet is on its way. got angry because Gundam had been very serious up to this point. The first part of ZZ is comedic, until it decides to crush you later on when it starts to get serious. Songs from Zeta started to reappear, and death followed. After a beautiful ending, I felt assured that this continues the glory of this timeline in Gundam history.The comedic approach takes the series and makes it into a parody of itself for the most part. It felt as if the writers were making fun of and pointing this out when Bright sees his command center turned into a daycare center, and wonders ""what is going on?"" as his crew fools around immaturely. I had a theory in the beginning that the war broke the characters minds and resulted in the type of humor it approached with how ridiculous Bright and the rest were acting.At the front and center is Judau, an optimistic Junker who finds himself in the Zeta Gundam after trying to steal it and gets dragged into Haman\'s war. The two become rivals, and maybe she felt close to him, but their ambitions clearly don\'t match up and they have to fight. Judau had never known war, and he becomes frustrated with the war mongering of the adults, their cowardice, and the needless deaths he has to witness. Judau is a strong person who brings a light hearted spirit to ZZ. But he has to suffer, and this series tells how painful his life has to become during his struggle.On the brighter side, his character is very different from Amuro and Kamille. Unlike the others, he isn\'t a punching bag, and even those like Mr. Wong can\'t control him. I enjoyed his rebellious personality that is much more rational and free spirited.Puru is another great character that adds charm to the series. The dynamic between her and Judau is great until the writing turns it into a disaster.ZZ introduces a large cast of new characters to replace the previous crew. Of the older characters, Bright appears as the most consistent one. As harsh and unforgiving as he is, it\'s necessary to tame the type of wild spirits he has to deal with as a captain. They did fix one of Zeta\'s shameless mistakes of leaving important characters in the background with no lines. Once the story gains more intensity, it will feel like Zeta all over again. The new music for this is amusing because it\'s set to the tone of the comedy, but overall feels weaker than Zeta\'s soundtrack. The animation is as consistent as Zeta was, and is refreshing to see after watching all this CGI madness from last year\'s seasonal anime. You can say it\'s limited to its time.

Bandai Entertainment USA had announced a US release prior to them shutting their doors several years ago, but now that RightStuf has been working to bring out various Gundam series to the US, which means that fans here can finally take a look at the show legally.As a head’s up, there are some spoilers for the show here, but I’m going to work to keep them to a minimum. There will be some heavy spoilers for Gundam Zeta, which are somewhat essential due to how...the show starts.Double Zeta had something of a mixed reputation, even going back to its original ending, in part due to the tone of the series. Double Zeta aired not long after Zeta concluded, and picks up mere days after the conclusion of Gundam Zeta.  So, I do need to get into the events of Gundam Zeta.Following the One Year War (the original Gundam Series), the Earth Union started up the Titans – a paramilitary organization tasked to hunt down remnants of Zeon throughout the system. However, the Titans are granted way too much power and end up being corrupted, committing various atrocities, and labeling anyone who pushes back as Zeonic sympathizers – leading to the formation of the AEUG, the Anti-Earth Union Group, who sets out to oppose the Titans – backed by Anaheim Electronics, the company who developed the original Gundam, and with one of their military commanders being Quattro Bagina, who is secretly Char Aznable/Casval Deikun.Ultimately, the AEUG is joined by Noah Bright, who joins after being unable to challenge the Titans from inside the system, and Kamille Bidan, a young man (about Amuro Rey’s age in the first Gundam series), who ends up in over his head after an act of juvenile rebellion pisses of the Titans and leads them to murder his parents.The AEUG overcomes the Titans, but at great cost – many members of the AEUG are killed, and Kamille himself is left comatose by the psychic enemy of the series villain. Additionally, the Titans joined forces with the Neo Zeon – the remnants of Zeon (which they were formed to fight), lead by Zeon’s regent, Haman Karn, providing Zeon with an influx of men and material with which to become active again.This leads to Gundam ZZ. The Agarma, the surviving ship from the events of the last series, has pulled into the space colony of Shangri-La in Side 1, to repair and resupply, and to get medical attention for Kamille. And then, coming right at the heels of the very heavy conclusion of Gundam Zeta, it turns into something of a slapstick comedy for about 6-8 episodes. The show introduces new protagonist Judau Ashita, and a group of his friends from the colony who are all junk dealers, who end up getting caught up with the Argama and her crew.This is probably the point where people bounced from the show – hard. Most of the story arcs with these characters for a significant chunk of the series side towards the comedic. Judeau and company have something of a mercenary attitude, which they eventually grow out of, with them wanting to steal the Zeta Gundam to sell for parts. It’s later made out that this is a front, but it’s a pretty dumb front.On top of this, two of Judau’s friends have a rather annoying ongoing plot, involving trying to betray the Argama to Neo-Zeon, then disliking how they are treated with Neo Zeon, and trying to get back. It’s rather frustrating, and with these two plot threads combined, it turns the series opening into something of a rough start.After the first quarter to third of the series, things picks up, in terms of action and quality, with a big moment in the show’s halfway point where things start to get more serious. However, I can completely understand why this is too large of a barrier of entry for viewers, in terms of having to wait that long for that for the show to get good.I did enjoy the show once I got past that earlier, excessively jokey section, and it helped that I knew going in that the series wasn’t going to retain that tone and style for the entirety of the show, and that it was going to get some of the same weight and gravitas of Gundam Zeta.The character designs, animation, and robot designs for the new series, especially the design of the Gundam Double Zeta also helped, along with the fact that Judeau did not have some of the more obnoxious elements Kamille or Amuro had in their series, with Amuro in particular being the previous target of mecha fans screaming “Get in the goddamn robot!” at their TVs, well before Evangelion came out and everyone decided that they hated Shinji Ikari more.If I was going to give a pitch for why you should push past Gundam ZZ’s awkward, jokey opening portion and to give it a chance to find its footing, is that this show really gets across the themes of Gundam that Tomino is going for much better than the earlier works, and it also makes for a much more satisfying conclusion to the original Universal Century Arc than Char’s Counterattack does.It’s not that Char’s Counterattack isn’t good – it’s that it sacrifices characterization for spectacle, having Char posturing as a Spacenoid Supremacist Demagogue like Gihren Zabi, for what turns out to be the sole purpose of having one last showdown with Amuro for all the marbles, in spite of having seemingly buried that beef during Gundam Zeta, and it loses the thrust of the main series.Specifically that thrust is that Newtypes, humans who have grown up entirely in space colonies and who have developed psychic abilities, are better not because they’re psychic, but because those abilities make them more in touch with their fellow humans, and in turn have as stronger sense of empathy. It’s not that they’re better at fighting (the thrust behind the Cyber-Newtype project), but because they can look past their differences with other people and thus there will be no need to fight.This comes to a head at a midpoint of the series, when Haman Karn drops a colony on Dublin, Ireland. Tomino has been accused of cribbing the concepts of Newtypes from Star Wars and the Jedi, and it fits here because many of the Newtypes among the protagonists, particularly Judeau and Kamille, take a psychic beating from this event. It’s not just emotionally traumatic, it’s psychically traumatic as well.Gundam Zeta is regarded as the best of Tomino’s Universal Century Gundam series, but I’d say that Gundam ZZ is more satisfying the show starts.Double Zeta had something of a mixed reputation, even going back to its original ending, in part due to the tone of the series.

You would enjoy this show if you try to watch this show with a mind of a kid. ZZ actually helps to do it by including various comical scenes in the first few episodes. After it reaches around 10 episode or so, the mood gets bit by bit more serious. It started to talk about the ""war is bad"" moral just like other Gundam series, and it\'s on a more micro perspective, which means ZZ talked about how wars affect the lives of individuals. This perspective is more friendly...to younger audience since it does not require as much political knowledge to be known to understand the author\'s stance. Everyone who watches ZZ would get something out of it. to younger audience since it does not require as much political knowledge to be known to understand the author\'s stance. Everyone who watches ZZ would get something out of it.', 'Beginning this series and even through the halfway point I could of just gave it a 6 because I started this series July 1st, 2019 and it took me all the way till March 28th, 2020 to finish 47 episodes. Guess you could say I wasn\'t feeling too invested into it, but I\'m happy I stuck around and finished it.Story - 7 (Pretty good, not as good as previous series.)  Axis vs AEUG.Characters - 6 (Bright is a shell of his former self unfortunately. Some characters return that really made me happy.) You don\'t feel as much of a connection with the...characters in this series as compared to Zeta and 0079 Gundam. You do warm up too them though later on!Sound/Music - 8  (Standard and Solid music yet again along with good sound effects for its time.Art - It is very similar to Zeta and looks good for its time!  Earth looks very good, pretty locales / etc.The way deaths are handled could of been alot better, some stupid arcs and lots of filler to be found.First 20 episodes are comedy based and plot doesn\'t really ""begin"" until then.Characters mature over time, start off as immature and they become a great team, kind of reminiscent of White Base maybe? I guess that\'s all opinion. They eventually make a good team and Bright allows them to make their own decisions.While this Gundam is heavily criticized for being too comedy based and takes too long to get too the story, it will always live in the shadow of it\'s predecessors. This is the weakest of Trilogy without a doubt, but there\'s still good moments too be had. Lots of solid enjoyable moments whether they be from a comedy perspective or war/battle. The ending made me happy aswell, actually had a good ending.I think this series gets trashed a little too much and isn\'t given the best of chances due too it\'s long comedic introduction and lack of solid characters/beginning plot or great villains as it\'s predecessors. BUT I do think this series was worth the watch. It makes me really appreciate how timeless this series is (specifically 0079 Gundam and Zeta.) Give it a watch!

The tone has a more campy Sci-Fi feel, reminiscent of Star Trek, but there are still plenty of serious moments, especially in the second half, so it doesn’t feel completely detached from Zeta.The characters are what really sells the show for me.

Mobile Suit Gundam Double Zeta is the title hot off the press after the acclaimed Zeta Gundam. I already knew that people had a large disdain for this series. Now I LOVE Gundam... but I'm going to make the case here that unless you strive to be a completionist like myself you should not waste your time watching a series this abysmal.---Story---This is by far the weakest link within ZZ. If you didn't know, the first half of this show doesn't mean anything important in the UC timeline. You could skip it if you really wanted to. Now of course you wouldn't get...the into to the characters which I will say is needed... but you could even watch the first 5 episodes and get the impression of who everyone is. Half of this show is comedy, most of which falls completely short and is a pain to watch. The 2nd half of ZZ barely makes up for the first half... but it's still a giant mess. Everything that happens in the series just feels inconsequential. The only enjoyable arc was on earth when the colony thing happened (no spoilers for you). This entry in the Gundam franchise really feels like it never knew what it was supposed to be. I dare say that it never should have been created in the first place. I can honestly say I actually enjoyed about 10 episodes from this 47 episode long anime. Not good.Story score: 1 (Appalling)---Art---The art is extremely sub par. I'm not sure what happened but I think Zeta just looked better. It wasn't a big step back by any means... it just didn't feel as like there was any effort put into ZZ. Now that is to say, there were some scenes that were oddly animated for no real reason at all. An example would be thrusters on one of the ships. It looked amazing. But then the things that actually mattered were done seemingly as quickly and easily as they could be. Just very average across the board.Art score: 5 (Average)---Sound---The worst use of music I think I have heard in almost any anime. Some of the OST is phenomenal and if used correctly would be a fantastic portion of this show... too bad thats not the case. Music is rehashed too many times to count and placed in sequences where they do not complement what's on screen. It was charming in the original MSG. It doesn't work here and is yet another detriment to this already garbage installment.Sound score: 3 (Very bad)---Characters---The one good quality I found in this anime were its characters. For the most part the cast is extremely like-able. It even has my favorite (for the most part) protagonist in Judau. Honestly not enough Qum and Shinta. Oh.... Puru is best girl.Character score: 7 (Good)---Enjoyment---I only enjoyed a handful of scenes from this anime. I would not recommend anybody watch this installment unless they absolutely feel like they must. I happen to be addicted to Gundam so it was a no brainer for me. Happily I can say I will never have to watch an episode of this garbage show again. MSG and Zeta were leagues above this shit show. Still...

IT GETS A 4 (BAD)"", '---Preface:When you come into a show expecting the worst, the best it can do is surprise you. ZZ definitely surprised me, but not in a good way. I very rarely write reviews, and i only do so if i believe that there is something to be said, and there is a lot to be said about ZZ. Firstly, it is not as bad as people make it out to be. It\'s still an okay Anime, it has it\'s moments that make it worth watching. However, it is incredibly flawed. Secondly, i believe it is worth a watch if you intend to continue watching the rest...of the Gundam UC timeline. You can not substitute it with a summary or a set of bullet points. However, if you do not intend to intend to watch the entirety of UC then i recommend you skip ZZ.I will first list the flaws i found in this show, then i will list the things i liked, i will try and avoid spoilers to the best of my ability.---Flaws:1-Shift in tone:The drastic shift in tone between Zeta and ZZ, and between the first half of ZZ and the second half of ZZ. This is the main complaint most people have with this show, and it must be mentioned. Zeta maintained a consistently depressing theme from start to finish, and it\'s incredibly jarring to jump from Zeta to ZZ and feel like you\'re watching a comedy/action show. This is especially apparent when you remember that the events of ZZ take place immediately after the events of Zeta, and as such, it makes the actions of certain characters almost inexcusable. Furthermore, the subsequent shift in tone around episode 20-ish is again very jarring. You start getting used to the lighthearted atmosphere and then you\'re suddenly back to watching an actual Gundam Anime. This back and forth is inexcusable, and i honestly barely made it through to the ""good part"".2-Confusion:The show is confused. It doesn\'t know what it wants to be. Even after the show goes into ""serious"" mode, it still has these out of place lighthearted moments. Do you know how awkward it feels to watch characters go from mourning to giggling within 3 minutes of their friend dying? Also, you\'ll have these random slapstick moments in the middle of serious life or death fights. It\'s as if the creators are trying to say ""hey guys, we\'re still fun! it\'s not all doom and gloom!"". It ruins the atmosphere.3-Death:The way this show handles death is simply awful. I will try not to spoil, but a certain important character dies and there was absolutely no reaction from any members of the cast. One character reacted (briefly) and then life went on. That\'s not how you kill off a character. Also, when the characters do react to death, it\'s almost always in this dismissive ""man up! move on NOW!"" manner. There was a specific scene where an INCREDIBLY important character was presumed dead and instead of giving the grieving protagonist time to mourn, the side characters were berating him for being sad. It\'s just painfully annoying to watch. Admittedly, this was a flaw with other Gundam shows, but it felt particularly egregious in this show.4-Cop outs and trying to salvage the show:(SOFT SPOILER) Halfway through the show an important main character dies. Then, about 10 episodes later, they\'re suddenly alive again. This was INCREDIBLY cheap, and it was probably the worst part of this show. You either kill them or you don\'t, you can\'t have it both ways. The way they reintroduced the allegedly ""dead"" character was also so awful. They literally just show a frame of them at the end of an episode. ""Hey guys, they\'re not actually dead! haha! just kidding!"".5-Perpetual blue balling:You know how a story arc has to have rising tension and then a climax with a payoff? This show gets the rising tension and climax part, but no payoff. They make it seem like things will happen, then things do happen, but nothing comes out of it. It\'s difficult to get into this without going into spoilers territory. However, i\'ll try and not get into too much detail.  (SPOILERS) A character gets kidnapped, then they remain kidnapped for a long time. Every episode, that character almost gets rescued but it never happens. Then that character dies, then gets magically un-killed. That single series of events destroyed any sense of tension i had in the show. (END OF SPOILERS)6-Uninteresting side characters:This goes opposite of most Gundam shows. Usually, in UC Gundam, the main character starts out insufferable and the side characters and antagonists are what carry the show. This is not the case in ZZ. I honestly believe that the main character is the saving grace of this show, while the side characters simply drag it down. The way they handle returning characters from the previous show is especially awful, and in some cases retro-actively made the previous shows worse. Also, the new characters introduced were very forgettable. They\'re all fairly interchangeable and one-dimensional, especially when compared to side characters from any of the previous shows (Reccoa, Fa, Bright, Char, Paptimus, Jerid and Emma from Zeta. Kai, Hayato, Sayla, Bright, Char, Lalah, and Mirai from MSG.).---Positives (but not really?):1-Judau Ashta:I really like the protagonist. He\'s not as much of an angst-ridden child as Kamille (Zeta) and Amuro (MSG) were at the start of their shows. He\'s likable for the most part. However, the events that happen around him and the way he reacts to them is still kinda bad.2-Returning characters:The best part of this show is when they shift focus (momentarily) to characters from the old shows. That\'s honestly kinda sad.---Actual positives:1-Fantastic animation and sound design:There were some scenes and frames that were genuinely breathtaking, and the music is fantastic. The new music is great, and the old music is used sparingly enough that it never gets boring, but is simply a welcome change. Sadly, some episodes looked kinda awful, but those were few and far between. It looked great when it mattered.----Conclusion:If you plan on watching the rest of the UC timeline, then it is a must watch. However, if (for some reason) you\'re wondering if this show in particular is worth watching as a stand alone, then i do not recommend it. Personally, on my first watch through i was not able to make it past episode 5. I had just finished Zeta and was (understandably) not in the mood for lighthearted fun and gags. I took a long break, about 2-3 months, then when i came back to re-watch it i managed to power through it in a few days. As such, try and space it out from Zeta. Give yourself a few days/weeks between Zeta and ZZ. If you really want to watch it, don\'t immediately jump in after finishing Zeta. of the Gundam UC timeline. You can not substitute it with a summary or a set of bullet points. However, if you do not intend to intend to watch the entirety of UC then i recommend you skip ZZ.I will first list the flaws i found in this show, then i will list the things i liked, i will try and avoid spoilers to the best of my ability.---Flaws:1-Shift in tone:The drastic shift in tone between Zeta and ZZ, and between the first half of ZZ and the second half of ZZ. This is the main complaint most people have with this show, and it must be mentioned. Zeta maintained a consistently depressing theme from start to finish, and it\'s incredibly jarring to jump from Zeta to ZZ and feel like you\'re watching a comedy/action show. This is especially apparent when you remember that the events of ZZ take place immediately after the events of Zeta, and as such, it makes the actions of certain characters almost inexcusable. Furthermore, the subsequent shift in tone around episode 20-ish is again very jarring.

I really like the main character Judau Ashta, I think he got more character than the last few pilots. The main Gundam, Gundam ZZ is also amazing, the show pretty much shows the capability and most weapons of Gundam ZZ. Also, They still show the past mobile suits in Gundam Zeta.Now for the story, The beginning was slow but fun, the middle was strong and interesting but the last 10 episodes are kinda bad. I really liked the beginning because it's...more comedic than the usual Gundam format, It's really interesting and unique. Half of the series became quite serious and the conflict and motivation of Judau are great and reasonable. The last few parts I didn't like because it doesn't make any sense, most of the character development of others is pretty rushed, the conflict isn't resolved and I think that the author is scared of hurting the audience.The show has its flaws but it's not worthy of skipping.

Keeps up with the gundam timeline very well. Again we have the same method to get boys to fight the war because they have special abilities. By necessity and by the plot. Taking this out seems to me a wonderful work because at the end of the day we see how the protagonist goes from not wanting to fight to fighting so that there is peace. Always trying to find a method of not killing, killing being his last option. At the beginning it is kind of boring because as I mentioned the protagonists...are boys and they have that conflict of what to do if they are having a good or not.

Given how this one isn’t looked upon as highly as Zeta is, I thought it was gonna be boring but I had the most fun watching this. Judau and his friends have a chemistry that feels realistic, like they’re actually friends. That’s my favourite sort of dynamic too, so maybe I’m a little biased.This one also has the best villains so far. Haman Karn and Glemy Toto are truly evil but they’re not without depth. They have clear goals and ideals that make sense.It also has the most overall...good quality. I probably like some stuff better in Zeta but overall I think it’s just a little bit too long and the middle of it kinda drags. ZZ is the perfect length for what it’s trying to do.It’s not flawless, but I just love these characters too much for the flaws to really matter. Even in the episodes I didn’t quite like, the characters are constantly bouncing off each other’s dialogue in such a way that it’s never boring.The music in gundam has been pretty consistent through 0079, zeta and this one, but I’d like to add that the Second OP is an absolute banger.

Initially, it was meant to be Zeta\'s second season (to be honest, it sounds like a much better option); keep in mind that Kamille wasn\'t in comatose until ZZ, in the Zeta ending he seemed to have his memories erased instead.One thing that didn\'t make it into the final cut was return of Char Aznable, whom we seen in both openings and who was supposed to play much bigger role. Then, however,...the movie - Char\'s Countterack - was greenlighted and he was reduced to once being mentioned near the end of ZZ.About the actual show itself.For me, the first few episodes were kinda a pain a to go through; there wasn\'t any actual story, just main characters trying to steal the Zeta Gundam, until Bright makes them into Argama\'s crew since he doesn\'t have any pilots (Fa got nerfed and can\'t pilot at all for some reasons).After that, the actual plot begins, however it was only after about dozen of episodes that I actually started to enjoy the show. Suddenly the tone changed with episodes 20-21, and ZZ was actually getting better and better up to EP36.After that, however, while the rather serious tone remains, ZZ became rather messy. It felt that some arcs were out of nowhere, and some of the cast started acting out of character.For last ten episodes, there are arcs that feel unnecessary and prolonged; the finale itself is an ""okay, I guess"". Again, some characters act ooc, some are totally changed, etc.While some characters lost their lives, their deaths were mostly silly and instead of getting sad, I was getting confused by how they even died.As for the cast themselves, the new one initially wasn\'t really likeable. Actually, I was rooting for the antagonist, the Neo Zeon commander, as he was more sympathetic. Of course, Judau, the protagonist, grows up and has some development, but it felt rather forced, with his character changing seemingly between episodes.There\'s no actual growth for the rest of the cast either; Beecha and Elle get some lines at the end of the show to make them look like they developted, and Roux doesn\'t really need to change at all. Some other characters, like Iino and Mondo are just there. I don\'t really get where they were going with Chara and Mashymre, but in the end they felt underutilised/unnecessary as well.Of course, there are also characters that shine, like fan-favourite Puru(s), or the antagonist, Haman Karn.Animation is still good, especially if you consider the show\'s age; however, there are lots of reused animations (especially of mechas\' transformations, looking at you Gundam ZZ), it feels like Zeta had higher production value.I liked music in ZZ, it is worth mentioning that there was a lot of soundtracks from Zeta too; however, there\'s this one song with high-pitched sound that\'s way too loud and will probably catch you off-guard.Is the Gundam ZZ worth watching? It\'s not as bad as some people say, but it\'s definitely a weaker entry of Universal Century; however, there\'s still a lot of important stuff going on, and if you plan to watch the whole UC, it\'s better to not to skip the show.

I think there's a good amount of energy, but it just drags on for way too long.Once the show gets more serious it starts to come into it's own, but it still feels just a little too...silly for its own good at times. The characters become much more interesting and the shows improvements over Zeta become more apparent. The things I think ZZ did better than Zeta mainly come down to the energy and pacing; the battles no longer feel as repetitive (once the show stops goofing around, that is), it's overall more exciting to watch, and it also didn't feel as if they skipped important scenes just to fit everything in an episode. I will say that Zeta's story and characters are still better than ZZ, but it's very much worth noting that ZZ fixes many of the problems I had with Zeta. Other than this comparison to Zeta and the strange start, ZZ very much fits the Gundam franchise standards. I would also like to gush about how well they handled the remaining characters from Zeta, especially Kamille, who's scenes are easily my favourite in all of ZZ.If the show didn't take so long to get it's shit together, I think it would overall be a tiny bit better than Zeta, but that rough start is what cripples this show and provides a barrier that you'll have to get over if you want to enjoy it.

Originally it was supposed to resolve Kamille, Haman, and the Char/Amuro conflict. Midway through production CCA was greenlit and the plot was restructured, the result is a generally disconcerted and unfocussed narrative with some high-highs and terrible lows. The SoL is not executed masterfully but watching the Gundam team slowly (SLOWLY) mature and come together is nice. If you are a gundam fan you will probably be fine with this. Honestly what happens is inconsequential and you could honestly skip this and go right to Char's Counterattack. Fa deserved better, Kamille deserved better, Haman deserved better, and...Bright deserved to see his family.Anime Ja Nai. Bright deserved to see his family.Anime Ja Nai."", ""Despite picking up right after the end of Zeta, the first 20-or-so episodes of ZZ feel like a very different show. The comedy is cartoony with a lot of slapstick humour and villains who come across as goofy weirdos. It's a jarring transition if you come to it straight from Zeta, but it kind of works internally because these early episodes have relatively low stakes and small-scale conflicts. The comedy feels like part of an odd attempt to strip Gundam of its (at the time) unique selling points of 'real' robots and politics, and retool it into something closer to a traditional super-robot show. This...comes across strongest in the ZZ itself, which is formed by three aircraft transforming and doing a full-on combination sequence. It even gets a Gundam-sized jetbike to ride around on in the show's weirdest design decision. If you can adjust to the tone, these are all entertaining episodes in their own way, though it's nowhere near as refined as the positive tone that Tomino would later master in Turn-A. This part of ZZ has the air of trial and error of someone exploring something outside his normal wheelhouse.All this changes quite abruptly around the show's halfway point. It drops the comedy almost completely, the characters get involved in the larger conflicts in earnest, and the traditional Tomino Massacre begins. The lighter tone of the first half oddly help to enhance the impact of the latter. In Zeta, people tended to die in any dangerous situation, so I ended up bracing for it. In ZZ, people sometimes survive such situations, which adds more tension.The second half feels like a true continuation of Zeta in both plot and tone, and resolves many of the plot threads that the previous series left hanging. It becomes every bit as compelling as Zeta in both its ongoing and standalone stories. In particular, there's a two-parter called The Blue Corps that might be one of the best distillations of Tomino's entire attitude to war. The only thing that surprised me was that it does nothing to set up the events of Char's Counterattack. I always felt that I was missing some essential connective tissue to that movie by not having seen ZZ, but aside from resolving the Haman/Axis story it does nothing to establish the scenario that CCA begins in.ZZ does suffer the same problem that plagues most of Tomino's work, in that the overall series structure can feel a bit messy. A lot of characters are thrown around, and the story doesn't always place its emphasis on the ones you would expect, or necessarily give a satisfying pay-off for the ones it spends the most time on. It also repeats a lot of plot elements from earlier Gundam shows, though that doesn't have too much of a negative impact. The non-stop face slaps also continue, which never cease to be entertaining.Overall, ZZ feels like two shows fighting against each other, but fortunately all its better parts win out in the end. I'd give the first half 7/10 and the second half 8/10, but due to how internally conflicted the whole thing feels, I'll even that out to:7/10 comes across strongest in the ZZ itself, which is formed by three aircraft transforming and doing a full-on combination sequence.

Whilst I understand the reason why the series went for a more light-hearted tone, it's the way it was written, it could have worked but it does not. Other than the main character, who has more charisma and likeability than Kamille, all the new characters are either OK or are so unlikeable that you don't care about them. The majority of the series just didn't click with me and the only thing going for it was the Gundam fights, which are good but not great when compared to Zeta's fights. A massive highlight goes to Haman...Karn, for as weak as the series is, she's a great villain, and pretty scary in a lot of ways.In terms of characters I didn't like, Mashymre Cello's a SIMP, Glemy Toto's a SIMP but admittedly gets better, Chara Soon is annoying but later events with her is super bleak, Shinta and Qum from Zeta are surprisingly likeable in this series, seeing the stuff they've seen in Zeta probably made them more mature and don't make me want to hit my head on the wall.For those who say that the series gets better, yeah, it gets a little better when the series is almost over. A certain event in Dublin reeks of desperation to show that it's going to be darker now but it far too little too late. The ZZ Gundam Mobile Suit is not my favourite main Gundam in the series, it looks like it was made to be a toy right from the get go, it reminds me of the Megazord from Power Rangers. ZZ Gundam has some good moments, I won't lie, but I don't like the tonal shift and I don't think it was done well, it could have slowly shifted into that tone instead of the whiplash that ruined any chance of me enjoying it through to the end. But if you like it, then all the more power to you. As for me, I probably like my Gundam series where war is personal and messed up but with some humanity woven well. Karn, for as weak as the series is, she's a great villain, and pretty scary in a lot of ways.In terms of characters I didn't like, Mashymre Cello's a SIMP, Glemy Toto's a SIMP but admittedly gets better, Chara Soon is annoying but later events with her is super bleak, Shinta and Qum from Zeta are surprisingly likeable in this series, seeing the stuff they've seen in Zeta probably made them more mature and don't make me want to hit my head on the wall.For those who say that the series gets better, yeah, it gets a little better when the series is almost over.

To start, Z Gundam ends in a very dark manner, that i\'m pretty sure that everyone remembers, in contrast, since it\'s a direct sequel, ZZ Gundam starts in a very light-hearted manner. When I watched ZZ in the first time, I thought ""God, what is this?"" But rewatching it after rewatching Z Gundam and Gundam 0079, makes it a different, but welcome, experience. ZZ Gundam isn\'t inferior to Z Gundam, however it isn\'t superior either, they\'re both great series that can...be enjoyed greatly if you give it a little bit of patience. The cast is pretty good, Judau development shines from a ""funny"" boy from Shangri-la to a idealistic newtype like the previous ones, however, after rewatching the series, my favorite character is probably Elpeo Ple, she surely adds something more to ZZ Gundam.  ZZ Gundam is truly a remarkable series, even if it feels overshadowed by Z Gundam, If we avoid doing direct comparasions, ZZ Gundam is a 10/10, but if we compare with Z Gundam, it\'s a 8.5. be enjoyed greatly if you give it a little bit of patience.

It is in no ways anything close to the flawed but nonetheless “masterpieces” that are Zeta and the Original Gundam, but in the grand Gundam series, is still better than most.Story: 7The first 12 episodes are boring and you might as well skip them. Things get more interesting at Moon-Moon (the setting for Moon Gundam) and when Mashmar gets replaced for Chara...Soon, one of the most memorable villains of the show. The story gets even more enjoyable once Puru, a fan favorite character, is introduced and the crew go down to earth. Overall, the story is not as good as Zeta or the original Gundam, but is still far better than F91 or the first half of SEED for example. Points are also taken away for the goofiness in the first part of the show.By the way, not many people know this, but Char was supposed to return in the second half, and start a Zeon civil war against Hamadan, but halfway through ZZ’s run, Sunrise gave permission for the CCA movie, and thus Char was taken out of ZZ’s story. However, you can still see Char in ZZ’s first opening. Glemmy Toto took Char’s place as Hamaan’s rival. If Char was in ZZ, ZZ would have been much better but we may never have gotten CCA, so it’s hard to say which decision was better. Story: 7/10.Art: 7Not much improvement from Zeta. The MS designs are good (especially Zeon suits like the Doven Wolf and the Zaku 3 and the new Qubeleys), however they’re not as revolutionary as the suit designs in Zeta. Additionally, Qubeley is a Gundam Zeta mobile suit, and not a Gundam ZZ mobile suit, really. The character designs are pretty good. I think it was the right choice not to have Yasuhiko Yoshikazu do the character designs and have a new person do it. Art: 7/10.Sound: 6They reuse Zeta’s phenomenal music too much. Sometimes they use lighthearted music right after a tragic scene which is off putting (e.g. right after when Rasara dies there is upbeat happy music). Also, they had upbeat happy music right after Puru died to showcase next week’s episode. I found that very disrespectful and disgusting. Sound: 6/10Characters: 8I guess Judo is alright, though he’s pretty shallow and is unrelatable due to the fact that he never gets depressed. He seemed to overcome Puru’s death in a few minutes. Even when his sister “died” he just seemed to recover after a few hours. This is more likely the result of bad writing rather than Judo being a psychopath. The male characters were alright but nothing noteworthy. What really stands out are the female characters. ZZ has strong but likable female characters on both sides of the war. From Roux to Chara to Puru to Hamaan, none of them are Mary Sues although they are all mighty fighters. There is not forceful “feminist agenda” or “gender politics” to make female characters overly strong. Yet, they are still strong, independent, and very likable. Marvel and Disney’s “diversity team” should really learn from Gundam. This is how you do female character properly. Zeta had better male characters, but ZZ has far better female characters. Characters: 8/10Enjoyment: 8It’s a good series. If you ignore the first 12 episodes and the childish opening song, ZZ is a good. Although it is nowhere near the greatness of the original Gundam and Gundam Zeta, it can stand on its own as a solid entry. It’s far better than F91 or the first half of SEED or Narrative or most of AGE. I enjoyed it very much.Overall: 7/10It is a must watch if you want the full UC picture. It is also necessary to enjoy Gundam Unicorn to its fullest since it is much more of a ZZ sequel than a CCA sequel (with it having so many ZZ Zeon suits, the Nahel Argama, Puru Twelve etc…)I’d say ZZ is on par with SEED and CCA. Not terrible, and far better than the garbage that is Narrative, recongista, Twilight Axis, most of AGE, and the 00 movie, but nowhere near the level of the masterpieces that are the original Gundam and Zeta Gundam. ZZ, just like SEED and CCA, has tons of writing issues. However, it is still enjoyable as an anime, and that’s what really matters the most. Soon, one of the most memorable villains of the show.

However, it is still enjoyable as an anime, and that’s what really matters the most.', '[2nd Edit] Before I start: I know ZZ was made for younger audiences, and Gundam was yet to find its definitive tone back in the day, but the bad aspects of this show transcend this fact. From an enthusiastic Gundam fan, I must say this: ZZ is the worst Gundam I ever watched. Check my anime list profile, it is all Gundam reviews - I have a lot of Gundam knowledge to share and backgrounds to compare to say this. This is, by far, the worst Gundam I\'ve ever watched. Let me describe why. Please, if you think I am sounding like a hater or...something, check my other reviews and you will see that I never sound like I am sounding for this show. I tend to be pragmatic and objective, but I find this impossible for ZZ.Story: What story? So, imagine you are watching The God Father, something like that. Then, all of a sudden, the serious tone, changes abruptly to Bugs Bunny-level of humor. Imagine you are following an important plot point, then, in a snap, you see a pathetic character falling down a manhole while running (because he wanted to attack a Mobile Suit with a stick). Imagine that you are watching Berserk, but after Guts kills a demon, he farts after. Imagine Goku winning the fight against Freeza because he hit his head with a frying pan.Yes, that\'s how the story of ZZ flows, and the guy falling into a manhole example actually happens in the show. You have absolutely no rhythm to follow. You understand the colossal crap the anime will follow in the first two episodes. There is no more political background you need to understand (not kidding). Yes people, a Gundam in which the political aspects are completely irrelevant. The MS fights are downright pathetic. For example, the protagonist once defeated the antagonist with a flying kick that sent him flying away (just like the Rocked Team in Pokemon. NOT KIDDING).  You have no idea what is happening until you reach episode 20 or so because there is no continuity to nothing. The reasons the team gets together are ridiculous, the political plot is absent, the fights are dumb, and the characters act like immature twats until the end. Do you want to see the relevant parts of the story? No problem, jump to the last 10 episodes. You will even see kids in a school take down a mobile suit using ropes, stones, and frying pans... I am not kidding.Art & Sound: The art is OK, nothing stands out, but nothing is bad. But the sound is. The opening is lame, and the OST is something that looks like Looney Toons.Character: Brace for impact if you know the UC. Just, hold to something and take a deep breath. Ready? Ok. Remember how Bright was in MS Gundam? Yeah, that inexperienced captain, but growing as a soldier? Then, in Zeta, he became straight out War Hero and badass? Fine, Bright in ZZ took a deep sip of Dumbness Juice. He is a complete idiot. No leadership skills, not smart, nothing. The new characters are also obnoxious. Judau, Beecha, all those main guys are just immature twats to the bitter end. See, if you know Gundam, you understand that an essential part of all Gundam is character development. They start as something and always become something more. In ZZ they start as ridiculous obnoxious children with no discipline and end as one. There is no character development. I am only comparing ZZ with MSG and Zeta because of chronological reasons. Remember how Amuro started as a frightened kid who was afraid of war and felt the world on his shoulders, how Kamille started immaturely and with no disciple, and how both of them became something else entirely? Well, Judau starts as a prick and ends just like that. The same goes for every other character. As a final touch, the villain Mashyme is the most pathetic villain of the Gundam franchise. Imagine a fusion of Pepe le Pew, with Willy Cayote and Pisces Aphrodite. That\'s him. They are like drunk high-schoolers with mechas.Mechas: Although they are OK, they get a step back on the aspect of ""true mecha"". I know, MS is sci-fi (sometimes almost close to fantasy, when it comes to Newtypes) by default, but they try to stay true to the possible existence of these machines. They have proportions, explanations, and mechanical aspects that try to be cool and real at the same time, taking liberties when necessary. In ZZ, they lost some proportions, and became more cartoonish, with dumb designs that never appeared in the franchise again. Is like seeing robots in Dexter Laboratory.Overall: I know ZZ was made to appeal to younger audiences (back in the \'80s), but the lack of story, rhythm, development, logic, cool fights, the overall plot, and interesting characters are not an excuse. There were tons of anime for kids in the 80\'s that were awesome and funny at the same time. Take Yu Yu Hakusho as an example. It is downright funny, but you see a story, and you see characters changing. ZZ is the opposite of everything that made Gundam what it is today. If you skip this show, your understanding of the next one, Char`s Counterattack, is almost not affected. Don\'t waste your time with ZZ. If you want some kid-focused Gundam, go for Gundam AGE. something, check my other reviews and you will see that I never sound like I am sounding for this show.

Or they were actual morons with shit taste. I'm not quite sure which.Taking place literally right after Kamille got mind-raped by Scirocco, ZZ features Bright Noa being flanderized to unforgivable levels, one of the surviving villains from Zeta being flanderized to unforgivable levels, the entirety of Axis Zeon being flanderized to unforgivable leve-...okay you know what, ZZ is The Last Jedi of the Universal Century saga, taking everything great about MSG and Zeta and shitting all over it.The story is filler incarnate, and not the good kind of filler like in The Bad Batch. This is garbage filler that Tomino wrote to entertain children while he worked on Char's Counterattack. I admit that I laughed at the jokes in the first few episodes, but that got stale real fast. The villains were a complete joke, Kamille gets rolled off to a hospital in the first few episodes and disappears because screw actually seeing him recover from his PTSD I guess, and Char doesn't even fucking show up.

Night Wizard,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2970/Night_Wizard,"[""Night Wizard in no way a great anime. But it somehow ended up as one of my favorites and for one little reason: it's so simple. The plot is a straight forward one that is reminiscent of older anime where Yandere characters were but a far, far away thing and loli was not a genre of anime. Where it was the hero versus the bad guy on a mystical quest. Night Wizard is exactly that.The art in Night Wizard, although sometimes inconsistent (although quite rarely), is very nice. While the character designs are somewhat generic, they are done nicely and with style so that you...can get over the generic feel that accompanies them. The opening sequence is very simple and the song (sung by the wonderful Seiyuu who plays the main female character, Shihou Elis) isn't too bad either. The ending sequence is a series of still images but done really nicely so that the power of the beautiful ending song can really get it's point across.The characters work nicely as a team and go about fighting the weekly bad guys until the end of the series where the true villian is revealed and our two main characters have to go against their friends and the organization they worked very hard for. A turn of events you might not have anticipated at the start of the series.

I wanted to re-do this review too, since I finished this series some time ago.StoryNight Wizard. A term given to those whose mission is to protect the world from impending darkness. Renji Hiiragi is one such Night Wizard, who is constantly called on missions, even though all he wants is to be able to go to school and graduate.However, his latest order was to protect Elis Shiho, who is a new transfer student at his academy. Being dragged into the Astronomy Club by Renji's childhood friend, Kureha Akabane on her first day at school, Elis soon realises that she too, has the...power to become a night wizard, after possessing one of seven secret Jewels, the Jewel of Kindness.(AnimeNewsNetwork)I really liked Night Wizard's story, it's not the most original story that you'll see, I mean, we've probably seen alot of magic-animes.. But.. this had some really funny moments, action moments and serieus moments. The only thing that I'd missed was romance. If you want more romance than the usual, this isn't an anime that you should watch. Even though the lack of romance, I really enjoyed this series. Do not watch if you don't like magical gernes!ArtThe animation is pretty good. I wouldn't expect less from an 2007-anime. Ofcourse, we have some miss-steps in Night Wizard too, but every anime has some of these. Overall is must say that I have nothing to complain about the animation. We see some pretty good effects with is just okay.SoundWhat can I say about this? The Opening-song, ''Kurenai'' is very nice to listen to. I'm sure it won't bother you to listen to it through the 13 episodes. The Ending-song, which is ''Erinyes'' was the song where I got addicted too! It's really good for an Ending-song, I really miss to listen to it now. For the sound-effects, we have enough of them, also the seiyuu's did a goob job with their character.CharacterThe main characters of Night Wizard are probably Renji (Hiiragi) and Elis. Which I enjoyed very much is that Renji always was the victim! Everyone was always picking on him, awhh. Elis is probably the main female character, the one who turns out to have ''magical'' powers, like you see more in this kind of animes. Renji ends up as Elis's ''protector'' and Elis makes more friends. The other kinda like ''supporting'' characters are Kureha, Akari, Anzelotte and Bell. Kureha is Elis's first friend and drags Elis into the Astronomy Club, she's also a wizard who's been friends with Renji since childhood. Akari is the quite type of girl and ends up as being Elis's friend too, probably because she was touched by her kindness. Yes, Akari is a wizard too. Than, Anzelotte, Renji's ''boss''. It's very funny to see her commanding him, she always ignores his complaints. Bell is like the main villain of the story, she knew Anzelotte for a long time. She's not as bad as she looks, though. You should expect a suprise in this series. I think I've told you something about all the important characters, I really liked them. Let's continue with the next subject.EnjoymentI think that you'll enjoy this series if you like magic and comedy. Me, myself, really DID enjoy this. I don't regret watching it and waiting for the episodes to air. Think I'll dare to say that this is something that you should give a try. At least, if you like magic.OverallOverall I think that I give this a 8. The story turns out the be different than what you thought (somewhere at the end). My favourite through the series was Elis, she was really cute. I also loved Renji, he was so funny! Well, as you can see, if you ask me, this a good anime which has what an anime needs.Writen by: Erisu power to become a night wizard, after possessing one of seven secret Jewels, the Jewel of Kindness.(AnimeNewsNetwork)I really liked Night Wizard's story, it's not the most original story that you'll see, I mean, we've probably seen alot of magic-animes.. But.. this had some really funny moments, action moments and serieus moments. The only thing that I'd missed was romance. If you want more romance than the usual, this isn't an anime that you should watch. Even though the lack of romance, I really enjoyed this series. Do not watch if you don't like magical gernes!ArtThe animation is pretty good. I wouldn't expect less from an 2007-anime. Ofcourse, we have some miss-steps in Night Wizard too, but every anime has some of these. Overall is must say that I have nothing to complain about the animation. We see some pretty good effects with is just okay.SoundWhat can I say about this? The Opening-song, ''Kurenai'' is very nice to listen to. I'm sure it won't bother you to listen to it through the 13 episodes. The Ending-song, which is ''Erinyes'' was the song where I got addicted too! It's really good for an Ending-song, I really miss to listen to it now. For the sound-effects, we have enough of them, also the seiyuu's did a goob job with their character.CharacterThe main characters of Night Wizard are probably Renji (Hiiragi) and Elis. Which I enjoyed very much is that Renji always was the victim! Everyone was always picking on him, awhh. Elis is probably the main female character, the one who turns out to have ''magical'' powers, like you see more in this kind of animes. Renji ends up as Elis's ''protector'' and Elis makes more friends. The other kinda like ''supporting'' characters are Kureha, Akari, Anzelotte and Bell. Kureha is Elis's first friend and drags Elis into the Astronomy Club, she's also a wizard who's been friends with Renji since childhood. Akari is the quite type of girl and ends up as being Elis's friend too, probably because she was touched by her kindness. Yes, Akari is a wizard too. Than, Anzelotte, Renji's ''boss''. It's very funny to see her commanding him, she always ignores his complaints. Bell is like the main villain of the story, she knew Anzelotte for a long time. She's not as bad as she looks, though. You should expect a suprise in this series. I think I've told you something about all the important characters, I really liked them.

Well, as you can see, if you ask me, this a good anime which has what an anime needs.Writen by: Erisu"", 'Honestly Night Wizard is one of those anime that just fades from memory and becomes extremely obscure. There really isn\'t much in this show that is unique and really the only reason I even kept watching it instead of dropping it halfway through was because of the main character, Elis, who I just found really enjoyable to watch. Aside from her and the plot twist that happens around episode 9 and 10, the rest of this show is pretty much your stereotypical ""gather the items and save the world"" action-fantasy show.Story - 7/10It\'s not really that boring of a plot to have to go and...collect all of a certain kind of mystical items, but it\'s not very creative and has been done better. Still I will mention one thing that is really keeping this plot from being rated much lower: the ending is good, or at least better than the rest of the show.So, the show starts off with this girl, Elis, who starts attending a new high school, and obviously knowing that this is an action-fantasy show, gets caught up in the secret organization trying to save the world that several other students are in. There really is almost nothing that actually happens at their school in this show, though. So, in order to save the world, she joins the three other members in order to save the galaxy.That\'s about it aside from the twist later on. Pretty simple concept.Art - 8/10The art is good overall with some strange scenery in one dream episode as well as some very nice backgrounds for this kind of ""inter-dimensional"" headquarters their organization has. The biggest downside is that, aside from Elis, all of the main characters have very, very, very generic designs. Aside from Elis, only the villain looks cool.Sound - 7/10I don\'t remember the sound much but it\'s not bad. Good generic battle sounds and voice acting overall. I don\'t include OP\'s or ED\'s in ratings (the opening is about as generic as you can get) but I want to mention that I really love the ED because it\'s a strange eerie, not in syncopation song that just looks and sounds cool.Character - 6/10As I mentioned, Elis and the villain are the only non-extremely generic characters in this show.- main male character with very common build and personality- shrine maiden- quiet girl with a big gun- leader of the organization who is mean to the main male and nice to everyone else and looks very young despite being very old since she isn\'t humanBut that\'s enough about those boring people. Elis is a really likeable, shy girl with an awesome purple hair color (just mentioning that cause I noticed her design before watching it and really liked it). There\'s not really much to say about her that wouldn\'t spoil things, but I just personally thought she was a good main character and it was nice to see her as the actual lead and not the generic main male. It\'s not really much of a spoiler since it\'s really obvious that he is creepy and hiding something, but the villain is also cool. He\'s a lot like Nagisa Kaworu from Neon Genesis Evangelion. His relationship with Elis is also very strange and very good and is the main reason the plot twist was interesting.There are a few other minor characters who start out as villains but change side (they remind me of the background witches in Umineko no Naku Koro Ni and their relationship to the organization leader is similar as well) but they aren\'t very original either.Enjyoment - 7/10I was going to drop it halfway through if it wasn\'t for Elis, but thankfully it got more interesting around episode 9 and 10 which helps maintain it\'s rating. If you like action-fantasy shows like Legend of the Legendary Heroes, Yumekui Merry, or Hidan no Aria, then you may want to check this out (they\'re just some shows I thought were a little similar). If you get really turned off by generic plots and characters and can\'t wait through the first 8 or so episodes, then I would not recommend Night Wizard for you. collect all of a certain kind of mystical items, but it\'s not very creative and has been done better.

After a few episodes it is easy to differentiate them, and I have to say that this one is a lot better then it.  The plot is developed well enough that if you stick with it you will get a nice connection between the characters, and how they develop throughout the story.  At first I thought it would be somewhat predictable as well, even as far as to make predictions on how...it would end, I was wrong there is a major twist in the plot that will leave you completely shocked. All in all though I would recommend this anime, though its not the greatest it is still a good watch.Dr. R Dash: SO I did enjoy this anime for a few reasons the art was nice, The mystery part of the story made me anxious and it had humor to it as well. But i thought the story was a little different and sadly our group anime night just finished a anime called 11 Eyes which was not a favorite for ANY of our party members, and AS SOON AS we started Night Wizard certain parts reminded me of 11 Eyes which wasn't a good thing. But at least there wasn't any razor blades in Anzelotte's tea, LOL i did enjoy the fact that she described all the different teas she had which may not interest everyone but it made me happy :)Tadgh: I'd just like to reiterate the facts that 11 Eyes left a bad taste in regards to red moons, orphans, and amnesia. Night Wizard, however, used those same elements for good instead of evil. It was a short anime, but I feel like a lot happened. Each episode built towards the main story while containing a full resolution to the immediate issues. The characters were all very individual and each had their own bit of development. A very well rounded anime that gave laughs, serious thoughts, and a nice twist at the end.Rasanaph- It was good. it would end, I was wrong there is a major twist in the plot that will leave you completely shocked.

', 'Alright this is my first review I have done while being apart of this site. This anime is about magic, with the characters of Higarii, Elis, Akari, and Kureha.  In my opinion i thought it was good I like anime like this with magic involved.  If your looking for a simple plot anime with magic this is it.  The reason for me disliking it is simple, the anime was too short in my opinion and needs a second season.  I liked the characters they all had different personalities.  So as I mentioned if you like Anime and magic in a...combination, then this is for you. :-) combination, then this is for you. :-)', ""It's a mastaaapiece!! This show has no equal. It really is just incredible how daring and innovative, pushing the boundaries of the action genre to the limit with mind blowing animation and incredibly fluid transitions. The voice acting is top tier as well.The show is so good it's a mix of Little Witch Academia, Transformers, Re:Zero, TsukaTsuka, and of course Auschwitz.... and I forgot to mention Boku no Pico.Hawawawawawa?Hawawawawawa.Nah, for real though this show is terrible, but it's so bad you have to watch it. It's absolutely hilarious how bad it is. Watching this with a friend is an absolute blast. I haven't laughed this...hard in a longgggg time. Sooo yeah a it's a 9/11...

The whole ""let\'s collect stuff to save the world"" is nothing new and it\'s even less original the way is presented here. One thing I liked is that they didn\'t take until the last episode to collect all the jewels.The art is really simple. It\'s not crappy but it\'s miles away from being good. There\'ll be no surprises there, then.The soundtrack is really bad, it sometimes...feels out of place and it sounded really repetitive to me.The characters, oh, the characters.

The pacing was surprisingly subtle and the plot kept surprising me.  After the half-way point, the &quot;save the world&quot; theme was feeling less like a cheesy...James Bond plot (e.g. prevent Blofeld from firing a nuclear missile) and more like an epic story (e.g.  &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;).

Presentation being the visual artwork, the music, and voice acting. The presentation for night wizard was meh at best. The art is on the crude and poorly done side. Generic character design and low detail backgrounds and literally nothing special.  The music is uninteresting.

Mayoi Neko Overrun!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7590/Mayoi_Neko_Overrun,"['I have very mixed feelings about Mayoi Neko Overrun. It\'s quite something to say that a series is both generic yet still one of the more... unique harems to come out in a while. This all stems from the fact that the scriptwriter, director and key artist changed every single episode for the twelve week duration of the series. The result is that studio AIC squanders what little potential the series already had and gives the directors free reign to do one-shot episode experiments. What would have been a mostly cliche but still above average harem turns into possibly ""the"" trainwreck of the year.Starting off...with the positive: The most interesting part of this series was that despite a formulaic harem setting, the show had a motif; a constantly echoed theme that ties all of the characters and stories together. The theme is stray cats, both literally and figuratively. The show examines what it means to be abandoned and alone, what it means to search for and find a place where you can belong, and what it means to have a family and a home. While not as well-developed as it should have been because of the aforementioned trainwrecking, these ideas are woven into the plot and the backstory of every single character. It all starts when Nozomi, a blue-haired emotionless catgirl with abandonment issues, is taken in by protagonist Takumi\'s older sister. This unofficial adoption forces the other two members of Takumi\'s harem to reexamine their own lives. Blond tsundere Fumino grew up with Takumi in an orphanage, a victim of non-stop bullying. Even blonder ojou-sama Chise is surrounded by wealth and yes-men who abide by her every word, but the fame of her parents ensures that they are never around and she is always alone.Despite archetypal definitions, the characters in this series manage to have a little extra depth to differentiate them from other harems. Otome nee-san is far more mature and understanding than her carefree attitude would lead you to believe. Same goes for Kaho, a childhood friend and conniving corporate rival of Chise\'s, who in one episode fosters a misunderstanding in order to strengthen the bonds between all of the characters. Two seasons prior, AIC made Sora no Otoshimono a successful harem by playing up the fact that the protagonist was an unabashed pervert, proving an interesting contrast to the indifferent or wimpy male leads of most harems. Well, Overrun does the exact opposite here. Not only does Takumi try to weasel his way out of dealing with the girls, but his indecisiveness is actually justified by just how irritating and passive-aggressive the girls actually are. Nozomi is silent as ever, but the writers don\'t even attempt to push Chise or Fumino as moe or submissive. They are incredibly overbearing and often cause Takumi a lot more trouble than they\'re worth. The characters are not quite unlikeable (I was fine with them), but it was still interesting to see a show actually get away with making a guy not want his harem.Speaking of Takumi, for a male lead in a harem, he is surprisingly absent. The show is supposedly about his developing relationship with these girls. Yet even from the first episode, he frequently seems like a supporting character in his own series. Late in the show, there is an episode about the family taking care of a lost young girl (which again allows the characters to reflect on their own thoughts of loneliness) and Takumi doesn\'t appear at all. This is a mixed blessing but moves toward the positive. One, the show starts with Fumino and Chise already having a crush on Takumi, preventing any contrived or shallow origin story for their romantic interest in him. The chronic absence of the male lead also keeps the girls from fawning all over him like other harems (though like I said, their characterization already prevents this). The girls have a lot of scenes to themselves, where they meditate on their own thoughts and solve their own problems. If you are tired of seeing harem girls waiting around for their ""man"" to come and fix everything for them, this series can be refreshing occasionally.Describing the series like this, you\'d wonder what went wrong. And here is where we come back to the dreaded switching of directors every episode. The show is a mess. Every individual episode is solid enough, but the series itself lacks coherence and is riddled by random, one-off fillers in the midseason that fail to progress the story at all. This is probably the only harem I\'ve seen where one of the girls full-out confesses to the guy early in the series, in three episodes which build up to a nice climax despite starting off a bit shaky. And yet it takes this build-up and does nothing with it, opting instead to just go for random gag episodes. Four in particular stand out: 4 was from the director of Gag Manga Biyori and jumped the shark for many viewers, as it ignored previous plot developments, and ""all"" characterization up to that point. If you\'ve seen a lot of harems, you\'ll know the main guy always has an otaku sidekick to make him look good by comparison. Ever wanted to know what would happen if that idiot otaku ended up being the lead in a show? Well, Overrun gives you the chance to find out in episode 6. I\'ve gotta admit: that otaku\'s got guts. He literally wastes millions of dollars and still manages to troll everyone. The worst of these fillers was easily 7, which is the season finale of some super robot series. Here, Overrun subverts like no one has ever subverted before. The episode is not a parody, it is played completely straight. There is no humor, it is a completely different series featuring Mayoi Neko\'s characters, and it\'s absolutely boring. And then 8 is an episode of Saki. The final four episodes return to the main storyline, but even then: one of them doesn\'t feature half the cast, and two more juggle the generic school athletic competition plot. The series starts off promisingly, then proceeds to waste just enough time to make sure we don\'t see the fruits of that progress by the end. It\'s a shame because by the time the story comes back around, there are quite a few nice, sentimental moments that make you wish it went a bit further.The technical side of things is a mixed bag as well. In the visual department, the character designs (both male and female) are quite nice to look at. The artwork manages to keep a consistent style across all of the characters. For once, a series finally decides to give characters eye colors that don\'t match their hair; this complimentary coloring for the female leads is especially nice. Still, with the show constantly cycling through staff, the art suffers from notable inconsistencies across the series. Episode 1 has thinner lining and more shapely clothing, episode 5 has more angular faces and emotive shading, etc. A few episodes (4 & 6) have a lot of off-models, though some may have been deliberate (though it\'s contested whether it was worth it). For the most part, the art survived the episode transitions better than the storytelling did. The animation is below average and never really on par with the art, but being a comedy series, it doesn\'t really need to be.On the sound side: the voice acting is serviceable but as the actors are voicing archetypes, it never goes anywhere beyond the range you\'d expect. The OP song is average J-pop but the lyrics really have no rhythm and seem rushed all the way through. On the other hand, the ED has a tropical ring to it and actually sounds quite nice. What background music is present is usually done well. The problem is that there simply isn\'t enough of it. Entire scenes and large portions of the episodes are completely silent with no music at all. Sometimes it successfully contributes to the atmosphere, but sometimes the lack of music makes unfunny scenes even less funny. Still, the recurring piano theme played during all of the emotional scenes is commendable.My biggest disappointment with Mayoi Neko is that AIC basically sacrificed  the actual adaptation to create a display booth for the talent of the various directors involved. While it may have not been a big deal with just any harem, Overrun seemed to have started off doing just enough differently from the rest of the pack to make me think the show had some potential. The fact that it\'s based on a light novel series and not the usual ero-manga, and a popular one at that, adds to this notion. If that weren\'t enough, the more faithful manga adaptation has received near unanimous praise. If you can forgive its faults, there are a lot of nice emotional beats that make it a decent recommendation for sentimental rom-com fans. Otherwise, it\'s strictly for harem watchers and trainwreck gazers. There is simply no excuse for a show to have so much filler when it has a short run time and a wealth of material to adapt. It feels like I\'ve watched a four or five episode show when the series was slated for twelve. I shouldn\'t ever feel like that.EDIT: The Railgun maids get a 10. with the positive: The most interesting part of this series was that despite a formulaic harem setting, the show had a motif; a constantly echoed theme that ties all of the characters and stories together.

Well, the first three episodes were sweet and I actually enjoyed them. At that time Mayoi Neko Overrun! seemed like a typical harem with a good character development. I was even thinking that Overrun is worthy of eight points, no kidding. But then the randomness came.Y’know, randomness is not really equal to bad quality. Take a look at Galaxy Angel — that show is so damn random but it’s hilarious. It has good humorous episodes and equally good dramatic episodes in stock. But sadly I’m not here to speak about Galaxy Angel, I have Overrun to review. Thus...after three episodes of enjoyable story I got some stupid fanservice stuff, overblown instant drama, surrealistic comedy wannabe and so on… What the hell was going here? Did this show get flu or something? Overrun was trembling with fever between various plot bases. It looked to me that each episode was done by its own team of creators, and those teams never got a chance to talk and share ideas with each other. Judging by the giant list of Overrun’s episode directors here on MyAnimeList, I presume that I was right.Ah, I especially want to talk about the culmination, the zenith of all that randomness: the mecha episode, which was 7th if I’m not mistaken. The episodes from 4th to 6th already were fillers, but the mecha surpassed all my expectations. At first I thought that it’s going to be a parody of genre, but nope, the creators just took the character design from Overrun and merged it into some stereotypical mecha plot. They made the 26th episode of Grand Braver, a fictional anime series which some of Overrun characters watched. Well, I’m not against such spin-offs. Have you seen Kujibiki Unbalance OVA? Damn, that was fun. But again, here the creators didn’t even try. It’s a straight-forward last episode of a mecha show. Since you don’t have a clue what happened before, so there’s no deep plot, and you absolutely have no jokes to laugh at. Personally I’m not a mecha fan, so the Grand Braver was extremely boring. I watched this for about 3 hours, constantly pausing it and going to kitchen to make another cup of coffee or grab more snacks. No, seriously, I was about to drop Overrun but couldn’t. Sadly I’m a faggot, so I never drop anything. Sigh.It got better after the mecha but that’s just because you can’t do anything worse than that. Overrun never returned to the level of its beginning. Oh, and the last episode was a recap. So nice of them to remind me of all the horror I went through.Because of all those problems we have absolutely no character elaboration in this show. They’re just doing all the director wants them. Tsuzuki, the male lead, can be a borderline otaku freak or some dude who don’t give a thing about what happens around him; Umenomori ranges from spoiled whiny brat to depressed lonely girl; Kiriya switches from just strange and introverted type to gloomy and dispirited one for no apparent reason… Only three of regular cast are somewhat stable: Serizawa, residential tsundere, the otaku Kikuchi and that other guy, but he’s just furniture so he has no personality at all.By the way, let me put something straight. AIC decided to do 13-episode anime and had 8 volumes of ranobe to work with. So why did we get so filleresque  show, huh? I can’t believe that ranobe can have a plot so retarded. If there are any people here who read them, I want to know what they really consist of, so I beg of you to tell me.But okay, enough with the plot. Maybe Overrun has some strong sides on technical plane? Well, the artwork is decent, the music… Erm… There was music, right? I guess it’s decent too, since I can’t remember anything good or bad about it. So no luck here either.And thus it’s time to wrap up. Overrun is overrun with fillers, plot stupidity, clichés and lacks any noticeable good aspects except the beginning. I can recommend you to watch it only if you’re masochist.So at last, Overrun, here is your 5 points and sayōnara! Even the power of Umenomori zaibatsu was not enough to make you enjoyable. Hm, wait, maybe I should check my bank account or something…P.S. For this season I picked up Mayoi Neko Overrun! (with exclamation mark), Angel Beats! (with exclamation mark again) and K-ON!! (with two exclamation marks). I think it is a really good marketing move to make the viewer uncomfortable with all those titles constantly shouting at him. after three episodes of enjoyable story I got some stupid fanservice stuff, overblown instant drama, surrealistic comedy wannabe and so on… What the hell was going here?

The owner of the shop is a tennen (""natural boke"", someone who has zero common sense) woman who likes to find stray cats and sometimes kids, and provide them shelter in the shop. Our protagonist Tsuzuki Takumi is one of those human stray cats, and the story begins with the arrival of the second human stray cat, Kiriya Nozomi.STORY: 6/10Pretty common setting with plenty of parodies.As far as I can tell, only first and last three episodes were the main story with...Kiriya Nozomi as central focus, despite all the episode titles were about her.Just as with the animation, there was a different director for each episode. It seems like they were given the freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted to do with filler episodes from ep 4 to 9, and that\'s exactly what they seemed to have done.Episode 4: Possible \'FMP Fumoffu\' onsen parody with a sudden parody of Ping Pong (2002) movie?Episode 5: Went for character development with fan service.Episode 6: Entire episode on a PV shoot, reminds me of \'Haruhi\' movie shooting episode.Episode 7: Entire episode on mecha parodies.Episode 8: Entire episode on a custom Jenga game.Episode 9: Went for straight romance drama.Whether it worked or not is up for debate, but they all had great slapstick pacing, and I personally found the noticeable difference in direction to be quite entertaining.Final episode was a recap of the series, which is pretty rare nowadays. The commentary was pretty funny, and I think it represents the freedom in production of this series very well (since it shows that they were given total freedom even the series composition stage).ANIMATION: 8/10Notice the animation director and the production studio for animation work assistance is different for every single episode.Animation quality varied by episode, like episode 1 (Studio Comet) and episode 8 (Sunrise) were significantly better than the rest, but generally above average for harem comedy series.Character design was decent, with big-eyed attractive girls and signature features (cat ear hair, red cross-patterned ribbons etc) and comments. Despite great influence by animation director and work assistance, character animation consistency was better than average, with exception to episode 11 (Studio Blanc.), which had distinctly different drawing style that I think worked pretty well.You can tell none of the animation directors and studios wanted to be seen as a slacker (less deadline rush probably helped too), and we are treated to quality animation with subtle difference in style for every single episode, which I found to be very fun to watch.SOUND: 7/10Voice acting was very strong, especially for Serizawa Fumino and Kikuchi Ieyasu. Filled with emotion and highly motivated seiyuu staff.BGM was unremarkable, but that is expected for harem comedy series.OP/ED were extremely weak seiyuu songs. I can kind of imagine a bunch of NEETs dancing otagei to it. Three ""special EDs"" for episodes 6, 7, 11 were somewhat interesting though.CHARACTER: 7/10Picking a girl for the indecisive protagonist sure is difficult for this series. We have Nozomi, who\'s a tennen cat girl who\'s good at everything and goes along with everything. Then Fumino, a tsundere childhood friend (i.e. the ""invincible character"" if this was \'eroge\'). Finally Umenomori Chise, a super -pushy billionaire lolita. I have to say I liked the balance with tsundere and pushy loli fighting for the guy with tennen as a mediator.Yes, we have a lot of stereotypical character personalities here, but they\'re all so off-the-chart in each characteristics (like tsundere so much that Fumino always means the opposite) actually made very interesting story developments possible, though they do get a bit annoying after a while.Character development is not really expected in a slapstick series like this, but Fumino did start expressing her feelings, and Nozomi\'s gradual realization of friendship and family was depicted very well.ENJOYMENT: 9/10I personally liked the characters, and thought there were couple of really funny episodes. Just like Haruhi 2009\'s ""∞8"", most of the watch value was in subtle difference in animation styles and in this case, different director for each episode too.The original setting and story may be unoriginal, but there was abundance of creativity in production stage of this series made possible by one-episode-only staff and teams. Changing animation style, good pacing, hilarious gags, constant fan service, repetitive violent retribution, great directions.It\'s in a crappy genre where you can\'t expect any story, character development or value to begin with, but there was some of each in this series.As far as watch-and-forget comedy goes, this is as good as it gets. \'Mayoi Neko Overrun!\' was hands-down the best comedy of the season for me since all other comedies this season were plagued with horrible pacing and letdowns. Kiriya Nozomi as central focus, despite all the episode titles were about her.Just as with the animation, there was a different director for each episode. It seems like they were given the freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted to do with filler episodes from ep 4 to 9, and that\'s exactly what they seemed to have done.Episode 4: Possible \'FMP Fumoffu\' onsen parody with a sudden parody of Ping Pong (2002) movie?Episode 5: Went for character development with fan service.Episode 6: Entire episode on a PV shoot, reminds me of \'Haruhi\' movie shooting episode.Episode 7: Entire episode on mecha parodies.Episode 8: Entire episode on a custom Jenga game.Episode 9: Went for straight romance drama.Whether it worked or not is up for debate, but they all had great slapstick pacing, and I personally found the noticeable difference in direction to be quite entertaining.Final episode was a recap of the series, which is pretty rare nowadays. The commentary was pretty funny, and I think it represents the freedom in production of this series very well (since it shows that they were given total freedom even the series composition stage).ANIMATION: 8/10Notice the animation director and the production studio for animation work assistance is different for every single episode.Animation quality varied by episode, like episode 1 (Studio Comet) and episode 8 (Sunrise) were significantly better than the rest, but generally above average for harem comedy series.Character design was decent, with big-eyed attractive girls and signature features (cat ear hair, red cross-patterned ribbons etc) and comments. Despite great influence by animation director and work assistance, character animation consistency was better than average, with exception to episode 11 (Studio Blanc.), which had distinctly different drawing style that I think worked pretty well.You can tell none of the animation directors and studios wanted to be seen as a slacker (less deadline rush probably helped too), and we are treated to quality animation with subtle difference in style for every single episode, which I found to be very fun to watch.SOUND: 7/10Voice acting was very strong, especially for Serizawa Fumino and Kikuchi Ieyasu. Filled with emotion and highly motivated seiyuu staff.BGM was unremarkable, but that is expected for harem comedy series.OP/ED were extremely weak seiyuu songs. I can kind of imagine a bunch of NEETs dancing otagei to it. Three ""special EDs"" for episodes 6, 7, 11 were somewhat interesting though.CHARACTER: 7/10Picking a girl for the indecisive protagonist sure is difficult for this series. We have Nozomi, who\'s a tennen cat girl who\'s good at everything and goes along with everything. Then Fumino, a tsundere childhood friend (i.e. the ""invincible character"" if this was \'eroge\'). Finally Umenomori Chise, a super -pushy billionaire lolita. I have to say I liked the balance with tsundere and pushy loli fighting for the guy with tennen as a mediator.Yes, we have a lot of stereotypical character personalities here, but they\'re all so off-the-chart in each characteristics (like tsundere so much that Fumino always means the opposite) actually made very interesting story developments possible, though they do get a bit annoying after a while.Character development is not really expected in a slapstick series like this, but Fumino did start expressing her feelings, and Nozomi\'s gradual realization of friendship and family was depicted very well.ENJOYMENT: 9/10I personally liked the characters, and thought there were couple of really funny episodes. Just like Haruhi 2009\'s ""∞8"", most of the watch value was in subtle difference in animation styles and in this case, different director for each episode too.The original setting and story may be unoriginal, but there was abundance of creativity in production stage of this series made possible by one-episode-only staff and teams.

However MNO is catagorically meant to be an anime based on romance as well, which means at some point the humour has to back off a little to allow the romantic part of the story to progress.To be fair MNO does open up in reassuring fashion, conveying all the romantic gestures you'd expect from a romance-based anime, and it almost succeeds in pulling...some emotional heartstrings while stirring some deep curiosity in the personalities of the key characters. However, beyond episode 3, the promising plot disintegrates, and eventually to the point where it fails to even develop the hidden romance between the two main characters.The random style of some episodes is a nice diversion from what is otherwise a plot with as much depth as a sheet of tracing paper; it just never seems to address any meaningful conclusion, goal, or resolution regarding the relationship between a passive Takumi and a pretentious Fumino... surely a dissapointment for romantics. For that matter you might as well focus as much attention on the other characters, since their storylines have about the same depth as the main two characters.Having said that, MNO is by no means detestable - throughout the anime the characters remain somewhat likeable, thanks in no small part to the charming and high quality art, along with the usual winning (abeit cliched) anime poses you'd expect to see in harem type anime. Loosen your focus on the main characters and avoid trying to follow a goaless story here, and MNO is an enjoyable enough anime at least to pass the time on a rainy weekend. some emotional heartstrings while stirring some deep curiosity in the personalities of the key characters.

The one big problem I found with this anime is that it does not have a consistent plot (there was a plot but it was in and out).  Every episode in the middle of the series went off on a story of their own and they all felt like fillers.  From what I can remember this anime...was supposed to be a romantic comedy which I have no problem with, but I would actually like a little development each episode!  The ending however was actually quite decent because it went back to a plot point which they had in the beginning, orphans who are happy because of the ""family"" they create with each other.  Although the story messed up in tons of places, I think the ending was good enough to prevent from giving it a lower rating.Art -8/10I really have no complaints with this area, the animations looked fluent and although I\'ve seen better artwork I thought this one was alright.Sounds- 8/10Another area which I have no complaints about. It had an interesting opening song which I think a person would either hate or love, I personally loved it.  The background music was used at the appropriate times and the voice acting was alright.Character- 8/10A lot of the characters seem average in this anime with the exception of Fumino, who really stood out to me.  Fumino is not your ordinary Tsundere, I really can\'t explain what it is but she is different from the ordinary Tsundere (in a good way) and perhaps was one of the few good things the anime offered.  One problem I had is that there wasn\'t enough focus on Nozomi  which wouldn\'t be a problem if this anime wasn\'t named Mayoi Neko Overrun.  She did get a lot of focus towards the end but that was too little too late.Enjoyment- 6/10I really enjoyed the first 3 episodes and I found the last 2 alright, which leaves the middle episodes.  There were one or two episodes in the middle that advanced plot which I enjoyed but the rest I really couldn\'t stand.  All those fillers that they put in really weren\'t funny with me only occasionally chuckling.  I really don\'t know what happened, did they run out of ideas?Overall- 6/10Overall I really wouldn\'t want to recommend this anime to anyone.  It\'s a shame really because I really liked what they were going for in the beginning and I thought that this anime had potential to become something amazing but it fell well short of what I and many hoped for and it ends up as another let down. was supposed to be a romantic comedy which I have no problem with, but I would actually like a little development each episode!

It has a different episode director, animation director and key animation every episode. How does it matters?It actually doesn\'t matter. If you are one of those who hate ""generic"" otaku anime, PLEASE DON\'T WATCH THIS ANIME. It has everything you don\'t want to have in it, like tsundere, dense MC, harem, fan-services. If you get bothered by the major premise, there is no way you can enjoy the minor staff.But if you are one of those who actually appreciate and enjoy school harem anime, Mayoi Neko Overrun! will definitely be a refreshing and rare watching...experience for you, since there are 12 different styles of presentation. You don\'t see anime do this that often, especially in the harem category. Hope that you can match up with the ""Denpa"" comedy. That\'s how most of the anime by AIC works, just like Sora no Otoshimono, Oreimo, Haganai. They bear the weight of being entertainment gearing towards male otaku audience, but they still putting a lot of effort in the meticulous matters (that actually majority of the watchers do not cares, they don\'t even notice, Oreimo is the biggest example).Story: 6The overall flow of anime feels like Kotoura-san (another anime by AIC), 3 episodes of story, Slice of life for the middle episodes, then get back to telling story near the end of the anime. This pace changing is not very viewer-friendly and got a lot of complain in Kotoura-san, but it works out well here.Story is fair, actually the worse part of this anime is the story. I mean the first 2 episodes.The middle part is where this anime shine.

Not on Oreimo or Heaven\'s lost property level where you get a new ed every episodes. But you can expect there may be different ed in a few of the episodes. If you are one of those who skip everything then it doesn\'t matter.In episode 4 there are some very funny use of background noises and bgm, you can pay some extra attention to it.CharactersJust the characters you can expect from a harem anime. It\'s a cute and fun cast and so it\'s great. As much as I admire originality, there is no need to blindly search for originality in every aspect of a show.Kiriya Nozomi has a very cute and interesting design. I will not be surprised if Mashiro Shiina\'s design is inspired by her. Since Mayoi Neko Overrun is actually quite popular in Japan back in 2010.

Unfortunately, nothing improves from there. The show doesn\'t even pick a direction to go. Instead of looking like it will do something worthwhile it turns into ""The Random, Bizarre, Contrived, Episode-long Nonsense that Utterly Fails to be Funny or Otherwise Entertaining Show."" ', 'The anime is centered around ""Tsuzuki Takumi"", and the main characters are introduced during the first three episodes (Takumi is the only male main character).Serizawa Fumino (Takumi\'s Childhood friend), Kiriya Nozomi (a ""stray cat-girl""), and Unemori Chise are the main characters, which are introduced in the first two episodes. All three commonly have contradicting opinions and actions, and Unemori Chise gets in quarrels with Fumino quite often. It becomes apparent that the 3 of them fall for Takumi by the end of the first season, for the kindness and way he is (Season 2 is guaranteed, based on Manga to Anime comparisons).The dialogue is...very humorous, and the situations that Takumi is put in because of the three females makes you chuckle, regardless of how well you can suppress it. The scenes amplify the effect, since Mayoi Neko Overrun is an ecchi type anime. Episode 4 contains the most embarrassing scenes for the characters, and the way it is shown really makes you laugh.No real battles, similar to the anime Spice and Wolf, but with a Cat-Girl rather than a Wolf-Girl (although the main character describes Fumiyo, his childhood friend, as a Wolf).Animations are decent, could be slightly smoother and less... artifact-filled, and they could have extended the amount of time it took to go through the Season. Episodes 1-3 seem okay, as they are all for getting to know all the main characters, but it begins to feel rushed and compressed from the Manga afterwards. The main problems would be in the anime progression. The first three episodes were good. After that though, everything seems to go a bit off-topic. Randomness is very high, and you could begin to question why it was written this way.The sound and art would be the strongest points of the anime, in my opinion, but they could have used certain soundtracks for different scenes, as I feel that some of them aren\'t exactly appropriate for the scenes. Animation is smooth, but you can notice that they cut some corners around the last few episodes.Overall, I rate it 8 out of 10.

Till 8 there are a lot of parodies featured, starting to feel like Seitokai ?? ??, the parody show. It;s still ok if the individual eps have good storyline , even as fillers. But they do not have anything commendable at all. Except sound and art, and enjoyment for some.The only hope left is its future eps. Left 3, any hopes? Nope, for me.Art:7It's not bad, but even with special effects all seem very 2D. the colours used were pleasing to the eye but not spectacular. Character designs were decent.Sound:7Both OP and ED were special, and sounds effects were ok. Voice acting was quite good for the girls.Character:3Nice introduction of characters but bad follow-up. Plus characters sometimes change personalities a little, esp during filler eps. Character development is quite little esp for Takumi.With so much filler eps showing little or no unique personalities of the characters, other than the most obvious ones, and hardly any surprises or development, the characters went stagnant. That is still ok, PROBLEM IS that in some eps the characters changed personalities. This is bad... very bad. Take ep 7 for an example, our main protagonist Takumi turned evil along with his 2 male buddies.I cut this score from 6 to 3, from ep 6 to 8. So, be warned.Enjoyment:7Depends on your type of humour. Some parts were ridiculously funny and some comedy presented were literally out of this world. Up to ep 6 that is. Ep 7 and 8 was a turn-off for most of the community.Overall:6My main purpose of watching this series is enjoyment and seeing if the original storyline presented would be continued. And you might like this if you like Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu.Btw this series changes directors every ep.

But still, it is decent enough to be watched because what it lacks in plot makes  up with couple of good slap-stick  comedy, As for the art of this anime, I find it very good because it kinda look like a...typical manga that has come alive, never mind if there are some differences between the two. The characters, well, I'm focusing on the schools uniform for girls. I like the way that it matches with the female characters  especially when it's Fumino who's wearing it, her long black socks really accentuate her very well, as if the two are mend for each other (the girls uniform and the long black socks), I also find Othome very attractive in a bikini, the way she's drawn really makes her versatile to wear any of the characters clothing from her everyday get up to her work clothes, she'll probably look good wearing the school uniform  or one of Chise's maid's uniform or in some rare cases be in the nude. The bike shorts in the last 2 episodes of the anime really does give the girls (most of them that is) that professional sporty look, since the bloomers kinda makes things too ordinary even if it's sexier that the bike shorts. So, even if this anime has it's share of twist and turns that you can't seem to make of, it is still decent enough to be watched so I give it a rating of 4.Trivia:Bike shorts or spats (as they were called in the anime) were first made up of black knit wool before being made out of spandex.Bloomers (as they were also called in the anime) are also called Boyshots. typical manga that has come alive, never mind if there are some differences between the two.

IT HAS DEPTH AND PLOT... is what i wouldve said if they didnt COMPLETELY derail off course after episode 4. If what you are looking for is just oppai and pantsu, then u definitely came to the right place....Mayoi Neko is like the little child that got abducted by strangers after being put through the dilemma of whether to listen to your parents about not taking candy from strangers or ""OOH BOY CANDY!"".After the first 4 episodes, I was convinced for the most part that I was right in picking this anime to watch for...it had some depth and that family and bonds and all that good stuff was something this anime can develop on, but surely I have been proven very wrong immediately after episode 4. Every episode has less and less to do with being orphans and going through struggles, and more about fan service and love triangles or squares or whatever polygon for that matter. The series even begins to become strictly episodic and some even have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and even tries to satire other genres in the process. Not that this was why it sucked but at least do it properly.The characters are shallow, the art is attractive as expected(it did get me to watch it). Music was catchy, but all of which wasnt enough for me to enjoy it.

Things get crazier though when a mysterious third girl who acts just like a cat enters the fray and wacky adventures ensue. Yeah, so basically it\'s just like any other ecchi comedy.Story 4/10Every episode has our characters going on a different adventure whether it\'s going to the hot springs or going to the beach. However, the biggest problem I have with this anime is the lack of comedy; what makes other...ecchi/harem anime so great is how funny the characters are, but these characters just aren\'t that funny. For example, an episode where the characters go to the beach has a lot of potential, but instead they just do everything people normally do when they go to the beach.I think the writers believe fan-service and comedy are the same thing, they aren\'t, they\'re completely different. Flashing a girls panties is not a joke, showing bouncy boobs is not a joke, it\'s sexy, but it isn\'t funny.The show does have some good jokes (guy sees girls panties, girl punches guy is always funny), but the jokes are too far apart and too few. Sometimes, while I\'m watching an episode, I\'ll be asking myself ""where\'s the next joke?""Characters 6/10Umenomori: Umenomori is the rich girl who can make almost anything happen (no matter how impossible) using the power of money. She provides the set-up for a lot of the characters adventures, but my biggest complaint with Umenomori is she isn\'t that funny. I feel like all the jokes are coming from the other characters like Fumino and Takumi.Fumino: Fumino is Takumi\'s childhood friend who has a short temper and always says the opposite of what she means. I always love tsunderes so naturally whenever Fumino punched out Takumi or got red in the face I laughed, but my problem with Fumino is the romance between her and Takumi feels so forced. Also, I\'m so sick of this cliche where the girl loves the guy, but doesn\'t say anything so there\'s just this awkward tension between them, and that comes up a lot in this anime.Nozomi: Nozomi is the cute innocent girl that acts like a cat by saying meow a lot and having hair that makes it look like she has cat ears. Yeah, that whole cat-act Nozomi does was cute at first, but after while it gets really annoying. STOP saying meow, talk NORMAL. Furthermore, other than looking cute, Nozomi does nothing except act more like a cat. Oh, and it is never explained why she acts like a cat to begin with.Otome: Otome is the big boobed owner of the bakery where the characters all work. Otome is a really funny and likeable character, but she\'s never around.Satou & Suzuki: Satou & Suzuki are Umenomori\'s two maids and my favorite characters. I know that sounds weird since they\'re mostly in the background and barely say anything, but they are both just so adorable and I love every joke they make with them.Overall 5/10I enjoyed watching this anime because it did have a few funny jokes in each episode, but I don\'t really like the characters and there needs to be more jokes.

The humor in this anime is certainly that only a tsundre harem can provide. It's has both unique aspects and jokes that you see so much its almost expected. But it still does not fail to make you laugh.The story is simple and humor filled. Only until toward the end does it get a bit on the feels side. still keeping a serious plot, it just manages to weaved well placed humor at the right times to make it all funny but not so funny that it's ridiculous.

As for the opening and ending, the beats and tunes are good but the vocals seem out of place or off putting compared to the music.Character development is slow but satisfying as the hero and heroines all get their fair share of development as well as knowledge of their past. The storys of each one get explained on a need to know basis when the episode calls upon why they do what they do.Overall enjoyment is great. Humor, mild fan service every couple of episodes and added feels in the end.

Nyanpire The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10197/Nyanpire_The_Animation,"[""To start off, I must admit that it's sort of intimidating writing a review for such a masterpiece. However, I will try my best to convey to you all as to why this show is truly a masterpiece that transcends the medium as a whole.GONZO is finally back in full force after a 2 year break. Now what do they have to show for after these 2 long years? That would be Nyanpire. During these past few years, anime has been filled with pointless moe, excessive fanservice, and are completely lacking of any substance. Because of this, Nyanpire is a bright light of hope for...the industry in these dark times.Moving on to the story. GONZO shows a certain brilliance that has been lacking in anime for quite some time. The ability to use such a simple premise, yet execute it flawlessly has been almost completely lost in today's world. At the same time, the messages that they are trying to convey are something to be admired. GONZO really does care about the anime industry, and I must say, they are here to save it.Yet again, GONZO shows that something so simple, if used properly, can become something great. The art style is so very simplistic, it seems like any average person with no prior experience could draw this show. What I draw from this (no pun intended) is that they are telling everyone that the art doesn't need to be excessive in any way (I'm looking at you, SHAFT) to serve it's purpose. Now, I'm not saying overly done art is bad, it just doesn't automatically make a show good, and they prove this with Nyanpire's art.Sound, what can I say about the sounds of Nyanpire other than it's simply perfect. From the Seiyuu chosen, to the miscellaneous SFX used, and even to the ending theme done by Hyadain. It just screams perfection and will not leave you disappointed.Now, for the main focus of the show, the characters. Nyanpire is truly a tragic character. Left to fend on his own after becoming a vampire-cat by drinking the blood of a vampire. His struggles to find blood to drink so that he may live on will truly fill your heart with sadness and despair, but at the same time, hope. Hope that he may one day get the blood he needs to continue living on in this world that shunned him long ago. The life of Nyanpire will truly strike the hearts of anyone who watches this. I personally cannot wait for the other characters to be introduced so that I may be immersed into this masterpiece more so than I am now. I can already tell things are going to get real heavy once Masamunya appears.The enjoyment factor of this show, to put it simply, is one that cannot be rivaled within this lifetime. It has everything you will ever be looking for in this medium, and only after 1 episode. If they continue on this course, there will never be a need for any other anime to be made. They will have obtained the unobtainable.I never imagined this day would come, when something so amazing comes along that it leaves me in complete awe. I've gone back to edit my score for this repeatedly, but I just cannot fathom a rating that suits it. A perfect 10 would never be enough. GONZO has finally done it.

Now it has become an anime. Nyanpire the Animation is a story which does not have much of a storyline, but it does execute it very well.Story: 10Nyanpire is about a kitten that almost died, but was saved by a vampire, who turned that kitten into a vampire. That's it. I'm sure a few will complain about the small storyline, but then why do many of us love Lucky Star?...Because the focus wasn't the story. It was the character's interactions with others, and the fun antics they get into. Nyanpire also has a rather original storyline. Even I never though of a vampire cat. Just vampire catgirls.Art: 10Nyanpire's artstyle is very simple. It seems a bit as if it were done on a computer, and although that sounds bad, the artstyle actually fits a story like this. It's very flawlessly executed and I think simplicity is actually very good in some animes. Nyanpire's focus seems to be more on the characters, rather than where they are, and in an anime like this, I think it works out very well.Sound: 10Nyanpire's background music fits in very well, and in a comical way, it will end the music at certain times for what many would call an awkward silence. At the end of every episode so far is a live theme song performance by Natsuko Asou, who has also done music for Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, and which I find to be a very catchy song. The voice actors do their roles very well, although I find Nyanpire's voice to be rather high for being a boy. And I'm having some trouble figuring out if he's a boy or a girl, due to the subtitles.Characters: 10Nyanpire doesn't have many characters, and most of them are cats. So far the characters haven't been developed much, but at the time of this review only 3 episodes are out, and there seems to be one more character to introduce, so this is minor. Each character is rather unique, and has a reason to love them. I'm hoping they'll flesh out every character even more, because I love cats, but I don't often watch animes ABOUT cats, since it's mostly cat girls.Enjoyment: 10Rarely am I able to watch an anime and get excited for every episode, since I lose interest so easily. However, since Nyanpire's episode are short and sweet and cute, I anticipate every new episode. I'm hoping this anime will be a little long, since I have little else to do and I need an uplifting anime. About cats.Overall: 10Yes, I know it's a little cheesy to give it straight 10s. However, Nyanpire is an anime in which I cannot find many flaws. Some animes do not really need a point. Lucky Star? Seitokai Yakuindomo? Two animes in which there was little character development but still captured to love of many, because their focus was comedy, and they executed their focus well. I'm one of those that didn't absolutely love Lucky Star, but they still did the show well, and it gave me some well-needed laughs during the time I was in.But now I'm getting off topic. The main point I'm making is, not every anime needs a strong, ongoing plot. Some just need an good original story that gives people a reason to anticipate it every week.

Going into this series expecting differently is begging for disappointment. While I'm not a fan of this genre, I did last through several episodes of Chi's Sweet Home, and figured this would be similar, but with fangs.The sound and character designs in Nyanpire have an edgier (loosely speaking) and more polished aesthetic than in Chi, and are generally successful. The characters themselves, however, talk too much. Nonverbalness is associated with babyhood and helplessness, both traits that enhance the perception of cuteness....The constant blather, rendered with mediocre voice-acting, detracts a lot from the cuteness needed to overlook the substantial limitations of the show, thus tipping the series from watchable to wastebasket.

My friend\'s recommendation had been a less-than-glowing ""we just watched Nyanpire; it was really freakin\' weird!"" Going solely off of that vague statement and the rather silly title (I mean really, Nyanpire?), I started watching it without high hopes. Fortunately, I can say quite confidently that my initial impressions turned out to be wrong.That\'s not to say that Nyanpire isn\'t exactly what it sounds like: a silly collection of short episodes about a cat vampire and his friends. It\'s exactly that - nothing more, nothing less. But Nyanpire takes this ridiculous concept and does...it well, managing to fit less than three minutes of deliciously cute story into four and a half minute long episodes. The remaining minute and a half is devoted to an ending theme that is as enjoyable, cute, and ridiculous as the anime itself.While there was no real overarching storyline (the final episode had the opportunity to set up an actual plot, but instead opted for the cheesy ending), the plots of the individual episodes were executed smoothly enough that I didn\'t really mind. Each episode moved along so quickly that I always found myself surprised when it was over, while at the same time feeling completely satisfied that it had been exactly as long as it needed to be.Combined with the light touches of orchestral accompaniment and adorably simple art, Nyanpire was the perfect short anime to watch between class and while doing work without having to worry about getting completely absorbed for hours. It really is just as it appears to be on the surface, but that\'s by no means a bad thing. Compared to anime which try too hard to be philosophical, or go way overboard with plot twists and complex character designs, Nyanpire is refreshingly honest and simple. If you\'re not into the cute and silly, then Nyanpire probably isn\'t for you. But hey, at less than an hour of total watch time, there\'s no harm in giving it a try. it well, managing to fit less than three minutes of deliciously cute story into four and a half minute long episodes.

I love all of the uniquity. There\'s no way you could guess the next episode after the first. I highly recommend this anime to anyone.

Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1597/Panyo_Panyo_Di_Gi_Charat,"['First of all, this series is supposed to be for kids. Thus, if you have something against childish characters and plots and totally can\'t watch them, then you should just give up on this one. I gave this series a high score not because I think it\'s amazing, but because I really enjoyed watching it – something that I doubt everybody can.Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat is supposed to be some kind of ""prequel"" to the original Di Gi Charat series in term of plot, even though it was created later. With that said, what comes after this series is actually Di Gi Charat Nyo,...which is an alternative version of the original Di Gi Charat. Therefore, you could say it\'s not directly connected to the original series it\'s based on.Plot:The story is set in the fictional world called Di Gi Charat and revolves around its princess – Deijiko. One day she reads a book and decides to help people around the planet. Thus, she sets out to help people along with her young sidekick, Puchiko, and a flying balloon which supposed to be a guardian - Gemma. They later meet two more characters who are willing to aid them in their mission. But guess what, there are also two evildoers who try to get in their way and cause mischief. That\'s the story in short and… well, that\'s pretty much the whole story. The series is simply a collection of different short stories which aren\'t usually connected to each other. While it doesn\'t have any complicated stories, because it\'s a childish series, each story is nice and cute in it\'s own way. At this point it\'s all up to you. You can either treat it as ""childish"" and think it\'s lame, or you can try to enjoy the stories as they are. If you capable of choosing the later, then you might see that the stories are actually pretty solid and are very entertaining. They can be funny, cute, touching and even somewhat dramatic. As long as they can make you smile at least a little bit, I believe they have accomplish their goal.Characters:In term of personality, most characters aren\'t something very original or coplex. But that\'s how it should be, because the series supposed to be ""light"" and ""simple"". On the other hand, the design is pretty good. The characters look nice with each of them having its own cute decorations such as Deijiko\'s bells or MeeK\'s stars. In addition, the characters tend to appear in many different costumes depending on the situation. The strong point about the characters would be the fact they are cute and each one of them in its own way. Also, every character ends its sentences in a different way such as ""nya"" or ""myu"". All this, combined with putting the characters in a variety of, sometimes absurd, situations makes them very enjoyable and adorable.Art:No much to say here, aside of the fact that everything is very cute and colorful. The characters are mostly cute chibi with big heads and their clothes, decorations as well as the backgrounds are very colorful. While not outstanding or amazing, it\'s definitely how it should be in this series, and I won\'t ask for something else.Sound:It has nice BGMs which can fit the different situation and sound both serious and cute at the same time. The voice acting is really great and aside from being cute, it\'s sounds just right in place and fits the cute chibi characters. For me, the voice acting played the most important part in delivering the cuteness of the series. What further great, especially in this series, is the fact that all songs are sung by the same people who do the voice acting. Sometimes they even sing during the episode itself. While the songs hardly have much sense, they sound nice and it\'s cute to see how cute characters sing.Enjoyment:To sum it up, I very enjoyed the series. It\'s not something outstanding and neither it\'s something amazing. But it was very enjoyable and I liked it. At least to me, it delivered it cuteness and managed to make me smile, and sometimes even laugh. Since every episode is very short, this anime is perfect for situation in which you have 10 spare minutes to waste. Even if you aren\'t sure you will love it, you can always try watching one episode when you have nothing else to do, and who knows – you may like it.

The story that it does have is that there's a planet called Charat and its Princess, Dejiko, decides to bring happiness to everyone because she read a book with a similar premise. Unknown to her, an evil entity called Deji Devil and his companion, Piyoko, are trying to bring sadness to everyone. Hilarity ensues.Broccoli entertainment is very skilled with zany comedy and it shows in series like Galaxy Angel. That being said, Di Gi Charat is not nearly as funny as Galaxy Angel. To its credit,...it is a funny series. It also has what might just be the funniest chase scene I've ever seen. The main problem is that the episodes are really hit or miss. Most are funny but some are just stupid. Without going through every episode again and actually taking a tally, I would estimate that about a sixth of the episodes are misses which still leaves forty episodes worth watching but is something of a problem.I'm not going to say much about the art Simply because I hate the art direction they take. I'm sure that it's competently done for what it is, but I really don't care for it. The voice acting is a bit over the top and kind of grating. I know that Sawashiro Miyuki, Sanada Asami, and Enomoto Atsuko are all capable voice actresses so I'm going to say that this is probably the director's fault.I think a lot of what held Broccoli back on this project is that Di Gi Charat is a family comedy. So they couldn't use a lot of their more complex, adult humour that made Galaxy Angel so amazing.I'm going to give the series a yuri factor of 4/10. It has no yuri, but you could easily interpret the relationship between the girls that way. Although they're supposed to be little kids so I don't know why you would want to.My final rating is a 6/10, above average. The episodes are pretty funny overall and some are even clever. The problem is that they stick to the same theme for four episodes and sometimes the theme simply isn't funny. It's also held back by the art and the sub-par voice acting. It's still worth watching, especially since each episode is only eight minutes but it isn't Broccoli's best work and there are a lot of better comedic anime. it is a funny series.

What is the legendary Inoue doing writing the kiddy spinoff of Di Gi Charat? Meaningful content, that's what he's doing. This is a very different series from Di Gi Charat and Nyo~. There is a more earnest weight to the younger versions of the characters and their little quests to better their planet. This is a very important anime within the larger Dejiko sphere of influence.Also MadHouse pulls off a slick move every once in a while during all of these series that...leaves you wondering what you're watching at all.Miyuki Sawashiro fans must watch all of DiGiCharat to see her roots in the industry. Puchiko's voice and character are interesting, aren't they? It's not what anyone would ever expect!

Ooi! Tonbo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55194/Ooi_Tonbo,"['It is a real shame that so many people seem to be missing this particular show this season. A shame, though not surprising.It is a shame, however, because Tonbo is quite different from most other Sports Anime; indeed, although the show is about golf—a sport quite a lot of people seem disinterested in, and I am one of them too—it is important to note that Tonbo isn\'t REALLY about golf. No, what Tonbo is about is rather ""Wasted Potential,"" which I would call a far more interesting focus for a sports anime to have than average.As the plot synopsis for the show describes, Tonbo is...about an ex-professional golfer who travels to a nearly deserted island to leave his former life behind. However, as he arrives on the island he finds not only a golf course there, but also a young girl with incredible but also highly unconventional golfing skills. The ex-golfer soon develops the desire to bring the girl into the wider world so that she might experience golf on a greater scale. However, the girl is completely disinclined towards this idea, viewing golf not as a competitive sport as such, but rather as something akin to a casual game a child might play on the playground—while also being a way for her to ""deal"" with her own past traumatic experiences.What the show is then REALLY about is the two main characters basically butting heads through the playing of golf. And this is a highly compelling semi-life-philosophical confrontation to see play out—even if the characters are only partially aware of this confrontation themselves.Now, with all of this being said, it is important to acknowledge that the art-style and animation of the show is somewhat underwhelming, frequently reusing pieces of animation during the golf-playing scenes. So the show is by no means a feast for the eyes. It is without question the characters and story-telling that does the heavy lifting.I am not here to say that Tonbo is the greatest anime of all time, or even the best sports anime around, but what I do think it offers is a cast of some rather compelling main characters, who in turn deal with some truly interesting personal struggles. All while simultaneously managing to juggle a decently lighthearted tone throughout most of the show.I hope this review has been helpful. about an ex-professional golfer who travels to a nearly deserted island to leave his former life behind.

Tonbo and Igarashi\'s growth is a slow burn, it takes time for these characters to adjust and leave their comfort zone but there\'s a real sense of excitement to see how the characters will develop not just in golfing skills but their mentalities and approaches to both golf and life.It\'s a show heavy on set-up which vastly improves on the early source material to allow these brilliantly written characters to be explored one piece at a time.Character\'s struggles feel grounded and enthralling. The...atmosphere of the show and Hinoshima Island as a location is relaxed, but you can see how heavily these self-reflective questions weigh on our characters in the quieter scenes. It\'s a story which is slowly building our characters up rather than rushing into key moments of growth.There is lots of golf jargon and the animation isn\'t always the most dynamic, but if you\'re willing to be entertained by this world then it may connect with you deeply. The world is relaxed and charming and the environments are gorgeous. atmosphere of the show and Hinoshima Island as a location is relaxed, but you can see how heavily these self-reflective questions weigh on our characters in the quieter scenes.

She already got great talent and experience for the sport that she loves, the only things that she lacks of are proper equipment and, more importantly, a strong competitive and determined mindset.I was able to enjoy this particular kind of character development despite the mediocrity of the technical aspects of the series (however, for my personal preferences, I really appreciated the attention they put in the construction of the scenography), but I can understand why many people couldn\'t be able to ignore that.P.S.I\'m sorry for my poor and bad english. step by step.
