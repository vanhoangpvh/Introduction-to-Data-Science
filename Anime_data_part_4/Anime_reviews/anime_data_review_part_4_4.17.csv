Kekkai Sensen: Soresaemo Saitei de Saikou na Hibi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30915/Kekkai_Sensen__Soresaemo_Saitei_de_Saikou_na_Hibi,"[""If you have not watched the actual show and you planned on watching the recap instead, please don't do that. The recap is helpful, but the show is really good and fun to watch. This is episode 10.5. I recommend watching the recap after catching up to episode 10.This recap pretty much reminds us of each little detail we need to know. For people that are very lost in the plot of the series, but are still enjoying the show, I recommend that you check this recap out. Not only does it remind you everything you need to know for the next two episodes,...but it tells it in a very funny and enjoyable way.The soundtrack is a big plus in this recap, too. If you like the music in the show, you'll love it here, it's great.If you are very aware of what is going on in the show, you won't be missing out from much if you skip this, but if you like/love the show, watch it. It's more of what you love.Overall, it's a fun recap, I liked it and I recommend you actually watch it to get ready for more Kekkai Sensen! but it tells it in a very funny and enjoyable way.The soundtrack is a big plus in this recap, too.

It often feels like these exist to add more runtime or as complication videos (which is not far from the truth). This episode mostly involves combining scenes from the actual anime, to form a jumbled up, barely understandable 20 minutes of animation, which does a poorer job at cathing-up newcomers to the story than a 20-second synopsis. And what is really soar to me, they fail to capture the actual...feel or essence of the anime.I can count on my hand the number of recap episodes that are not total misses to me. And out of all, BBB is the BEST recap episode that I have ever seen. It not only serves as an excellent recap but also a way to introduce newcomers to the story. It is so well made, expertly edited and directed, and teeming with personality that it can even qualify as one of the main episodes of the show.Without spoiling anything, Leo would tell or think of all the different things and people he saw and experienced in his time in Hellsalem`s loot This is a smart way to make the episode fit in the actual timeline of the anime instead of making it feel awkward and out of place, and it was done similarly in NGE as well.Instead of going through the entire plot, the episode show scenes from many of the episodes, but they mostly only speak about and elaborate on the main plot and characters. This keeps the episode focused and only gives you just the jist, encouraging you to still watch the whole anime.And the thing I was most happy about, the episode perfectly captures and introduces the world of the anime and its people, and manages to keep their charm and appeal intact. The direction style is still just as unique, and the jokes and dialogue, both old and new, still work just as well. And best of all, the intrigue and mystery of the main plot still feel just as interesting and heartwrenching.I love this episode and think it seta new bar for me for Recap episodes. It`s extremely well done. And this is coming from someone who has watched every episode of BBB multiple times before even finishing the anime for the first time. If you want to introduce the anime to someone, who doesn`t have time or enough desire to watch the whole show, this is a good choice (but still not an ideal one though and I still recommend everyone to watch the anime in its entirety).It is able to summarize the main plot and quickly introduces the characters. Though I recommend against it for multiple reasons, You can watch this and the last two episodes and not feel lost or left out, plotwise at least. For those who are planning to watch it whole or are currently watching it, do watch this after episode 10. This episode feels less like a recap and more like an intermission. A great way to hold you over to the finale.Thank you for reading and have a nice day or night. feel or essence of the anime.I can count on my hand the number of recap episodes that are not total misses to me.

Jiu Tian Xuan Di Jue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49873/Jiu_Tian_Xuan_Di_Jue,"[""The success of Empyrean Xuan Emperor is a story where Wang Fan, a commoner student at Yuan Wen Liao Academy encounters the Empyrean Xuan Emperor's Knack after investigating his older brother's death. It is said, the holder of this Emperor's Knack will become the successor to Empyrean Xuan Emperor. The Knack increases cultivation levels which allows Wang Fan to break the human barrier of cultivation (Golden Martial God Stage 5) Currently, at 16-19 years old Wang Fan reaches Peak Stage 2 or even Early Stage 3 but hides his powers to catch his brother's killer. Wang Fan makes an incognito persona called Silver Tiger King...to investigate his brother's death. His brother's killer is found and executed along with the killer's family which puts Wang Fan's mind at ease but the different races are now involved with the human race and the Silver Tiger King. Furthermore, the more the story progresses the more willing other clans are to join hands with the demons and warmonger races to fight the humans and Silver Tiger King which pressures Wang Fan to cultivate peerlessly.Story: 4/10This story is just aimless. None of the events hold real meaning in this story, all we as a viewer needs to know is that Silver Tiger King is more powerful than the demons and warmongers and other smaller clans and the more the story progresses the more impossible it is to take down Wang Fan. The entire premise of this story is for the characters to underestimate Wang Fan's ability and what is set aside as progress is just characters from the demon race or other clans dying left and right because they underestimated Wang Fan's plot armor. Every few episodes, it feels like we are briefly introduced to a new character that wants to fight Silver Tiger King because of some random grudge in the past but when they get to fighting they change their minds and another person intervenes in the fights to fight Silver Tiger King. It's an endless cycle of circle jerking antagonists. Especially toward the end of each so-called 'arc' where Wang Fan leaves the Academy/City/Pavilion to explore the next location without a established goal, this series is bad because it lacks purpose after the Academy arc.Art & Sound: 5/10Poorly timed background music and poorly rigged character animation, it's no wonder this series hasn't reached 500 users after it's completion. Even with the best character design, animation and suspenseful sound design it would be hard for this series to get more users interested with the atrocious story and characters.Character: 4/10The characters in this series lack motivation and personalities; Many of them especially antagonists exist for Wang Fan's cheap character development and aren't focused on when they leave the frame. In the case an antagonist isn't eliminated, they usually are saved by their masters which further delays the story and when it happens several times in the span of this short season, it can be very frustrating to watch. When Wang Fan isn't fighting his enemies, he usually just lets them loiter in the background waiting to catch him off-guard and when they do, there's no suspense or meaningful development since the antagonists are likely small-fry dispensable characters. We also see a lot of running scenes where Wang Fan flees from danger only to discover something more dangerous and flee from that (the bloodthirsty bats, the goat that walks on water and literally all the smaller demon clans in the forest he's in during that arc)One of the worst aspects in character occurs when the characters somehow don't suspect Wang Fan to be the mysterious Silver Tiger King despite practicing spear-play, being the proxy and grinding his cultivation in seclusion - Only 1 character managed to piece his hidden personality and they were forgotten after Wang Fan left the Academy. This characters feel very vaguely introduced and have 1 dimensional, superficial personalities.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10This was one of the worst series to be adapted in the Donghua industry for 2021. Not only did the story lack any milestone goals but it also had some very empty characters. The series is getting heavy praise by eastern audiences from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam etc. but I just don't see eye to eye with their experience of the show.

Some of the character's lines and animations were hilariously awkward.Despite all of that, I really enjoyed the anime. This anime started off kinda rocky but the storyline turned out to be pretty engaging. The MC's effort to disguise himself but still put on displays of his total mental and martial dominance carry on throughout the whole season. He casually crushes martial geniuses like they are newborn babes. He casually just utters words of wisdom that change the whole situation on the...battlefield or answers questions that were almost rhetorical because most people wouldn't possibly know the answer. I think the studio maybe rushed the storyline a little bit but it doesn't even matter because the MC is so charismatic and unassuming but inclined to demonstrate his dominance when it counts that I can look right past it.Overall this anime definitely could have been better but at the same time I would absolutely recommend giving it a watch. battlefield or answers questions that were almost rhetorical because most people wouldn't possibly know the answer.

Kiddy GiRL-AND,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3349/Kiddy_GiRL-AND,"['Initial Impressions:Kiddy GiRL-AND. First of all Kiddy GirlAnd is not Kiddy Grade. I know that when I first picked up this series I was expected it to be more of a Kiddy Grade 2. I wanted a new great series in the same vain as Kiddy Grade that I could enjoy as much as the original. Kiddy GirlAnd did not deliver. If you\'re a fan of the original Kiddy Grade like I am then this series might not be for you. It just doesn\'t compare. If you\'ve not seen Kiddy Grade, or if you have and you\'re just looking for a mildly entertaining way to...kill some time then Kiddy GirlAnd may be your thing. My initial impressions of Kiddy GirlAnd was that it was a dumbed-down, moe rehashing of the Kiddy Grade universe. As the series progressed onward I realized that it was even less than that. Kiddy GirlAnd exists almost entirely to exploit the popularity of Kiddy Grade. I kept watching the series with hopes that somewhere along the line this fact would change, and I was utterly disappointed.Story/Characters:Kiddy GirlAnd doesn\'t even give an honest attempt to make it seem as thought it not meant to be a Kiddy Grade tie in. This is clear by ""plot"" which can basically be summarized as this: Eclair and Lumiere from Kiddy Grade have frozen a certain area of time and space to stop a large bomb from going off. Now 25 years later, the GTO must help them diffuse the bomb before it finally goes off. The several appearances  Kiddy Grade heroines Eclair and Lumiere help to cement their roles in the story. The main protagonists Ascuer and Q-fuille make it blatantly obvious from the beginning of the series that they are essentially place holders for their Kiddy Grade counterparets. Ascuer and Q-fuille\'s personalities and special abilities are almost exact copies of Eclair\'s and Lumiere\'s. Many other carbon copy characters appear throughout the series driving home the idea that Kiddy GirlAnd is by and large a glorified fan fic. In addition to this there is almost no character development for anyone in the series save one or two characters.Notes:A point to note in Kiddy GirlAnd is the ""fan service."" There\'s a LOT of it. It is fairly gratuitous and is not done in a clever or engaging manner. It\'s just thrown out there in a very blatant and inelegant manner. I have to say that personally this ""fan service"" did little in the way of bettering my thoughts about the series. That being said, Kiddy GiRL-AND is a relatively good series considering what it\'s purpose was: an extended ""fan service"" special tacked onto the end of Kiddy Grade. kill some time then Kiddy GirlAnd may be your thing.

It has some unique and interesting jokes thrown amidst all the chaos, like the cut-to-commercial screens, the fujoshi/seiyuu cafe half-episode, and taking G-Society\'s point of view for a few episodes, but these miniscule innovations are undercut by the show\'s utter banality.In short, this show offers nothing new, nor does it go anywhere. I\'d heard that they followed this pattern for the first few eps in Kiddy Grade, but GiRL never escapes from this quagmire. At least every other episode is filler, and sometimes the ""plotpoint"" episodes aren\'t even worth watching.For example, in episode 12 where...you can tell the show is starting to go somewhere, all Ascouer and Q-Feuille do is go out to where Eclair and Lumiere are trapped and listen to a trite story from Ecliar\'s adopted son. If that wasn\'t lame enough, the next episode is a swimsuit ep, in which there is literally no plot development. I simply implore you not to watch this. you can tell the show is starting to go somewhere, all Ascouer and Q-Feuille do is go out to where Eclair and Lumiere are trapped and listen to a trite story from Ecliar\'s adopted son.

It  was funny and nice to watch. Second episode was even better, so i was really waiting for next episode (which came to be not as good, as i thought), downloaded it, and when i done watching it, i thought: 'Ok, this ep was not good, but maybe another one will be good, just stay positive'. But my thoughts came to be wrong. All episodes, starting from 3rd and going further, were...total pieces of s**t... nothing good happened, nothing interesting... Oh, and one BIG problem of this anime was the actors voices... they were so bad, that i just couldn't listen to them, for example a girl who look like 16-17 year old teen,  has a baby's voice.... Its so lame... ! Another factor is that anime story is boring, characters are very stupid and doesn't look good..All in all i can say, this anime is bulls**t. I give it 5/10, just for respect for its creators. total pieces of s**t... nothing good happened, nothing interesting...

Well Kiddy Girl-And is exactly that.The story takes a while to start (around ep 12) but at least there is some good  and fairly extended character development with a copious amount of fan service (which slow down after). Both Q-Feuille and Ascoeur are great! I mean the bound between them makes the whole story revolve around them and keep it tied up. They complement each other nicely, exactly like Kiddy Grade.When the story start to move, there is multiples points of view and it help understand...the whole story a bit (although they, sometime, keep it confusing) and a some point you just HOPE the characters figures it out.The art and sound stay good all the way through the end with minor skip here and there. I really like the effect of some of the power (like stop time) and some backdrop.This is an easy watch for everyone, including kids since the fan service isn't all that bad. the whole story a bit (although they, sometime, keep it confusing) and a some point you just HOPE the characters figures it out.The art and sound stay good all the way through the end with minor skip here and there.

A fanfiction anime about two girls with a strange past, trying to save the world.In the first couple of episodes they aren't in danger that much, there are even episodes they are just being themselves and doing nothing to save the world or something.But they have to be ''human'' right? Like, you can't save the galaxy your whole life. O.oAround episode 20 I really had to cry, those episodes are really showing how unbelievable strong their friendship is, how strong friendship can be.The end was absolutely amazing, really, when you're thinking it can't going more bad than this, you're...realizing ''Oh yes, it can!''When you're relieved the big problems are solved, it's even getting worse.I  respect this anime, for the unbelieveable twists in it. realizing ''Oh yes, it can!''When you're relieved the big problems are solved, it's even getting worse.I  respect this anime, for the unbelieveable twists in it."", ""I went into this thinking it was a direct sequel of Kiddy Grade with basically the same characters, main and otherwise, like many other people.

It didn't really have too much filler to it, and the filler it did have...was entertaining, and the more meaningful episodes were nice, too.Art and sound was fine. I think both were really nice, actually.So, my rating is 9/10.

Some examples of this issue were Code Geass and Durarara!! These both turned out to be on my top 5 list.This anime did not have this problem. It starts out almost like a splice of life set in the future, with two girls who work at a trannies (Side note, what in the HELL is...with animes and their trannies?) restaurant, when the president of this universes, well, security force, whatever! It doesn't matter, minor character, but basically she's a VIP and terrorists storm the restaurant and make an attempt on the president's life. After this point it kicks into a high gear with a very fast paced action scene where Ascouer, one of the two girls, takes out the terrorists and their metal dragon bakugon thingy with a bunch of high tech gear like a energy weapon in the form of a blade and tranquilizer darts. Oh and her ability to teleport.After this the anime becomes very interesting with a semi-original plot line with some interesting characters. And Yuri. There will be Yuri.Overall I found this to be an intriguing anime but if you want something like Kiddy Grade you will be VERY disappointed. The cast includes some of the original characters like Twiddle-Dee and Twiddle-Dumb, but the storyline focuses on Ascouer and Q-Feuille. Eclair and Lumiere do come into play later, but their role is very minor and only in the first and last episodes. The storyline is almost completely different from Kiddy Grade and doesn't resemble it at all, so it's almost like a sequel reboot, if that makes any sense.Pros:+ Great characters+ Decent storyline+ Nice animation+ Well done fight scenes.+ Doesn't suffer from Bleach Syndrome.+ Yuri.Cons:- Ending was eh.- Lolicon.- Tried to tie into Kiddy Grade, when it should have just referenced it.Anyways, that concludes my review of Kiddy Girl-and, and I would suggest you go watch it. with animes and their trannies?) restaurant, when the president of this universes, well, security force, whatever!

While it can be enjoyed independently, it heavily draws upon characters from its predecessor, albeit omitting crucial concepts like characters\' agelessness. Instead, it introduces fresh ideas such as power resonance between partners and alterations in character abilities.Navigating the ties to ""Kiddy Grade"" proves challenging, requiring viewers to keenly observe visual cues to grasp the storyline spanning recent decades, with pivotal details gradually unveiled. Unlike its precursor, this sequel offers less narrative payoff despite exploring themes of loyalty and societal exploitation, lacking the same depth and impact.The central duo, Ascoeur and Q-feuille, pale in...comparison to ""Kiddy Grade"" protagonists Éclair and Lumiere. Ascoeur lacks Éclair\'s boldness and charisma, occasionally verging on annoyance, while the bond between the main characters lacks sufficient development.Nevertheless, the supporting cast shines brightly, with returning teams from the first series alongside new likable characters like Trixie and Troisienne. Even the formidable G Society teams evoke sympathy, though the main antagonist, Gaecht\'er, loses allure once his motives are unveiled as mundane.Structurally and in pacing, ""Kiddy Girl-AND"" mirrors its predecessor, with initial episodes focusing on episodic narratives before unveiling the overarching plot. Themes of memory, loyalty, and brainwashing resurface, albeit with some familiarity. Animation quality is decent, leaning more towards drama than action, with noticeable disparities due to changes in animation studios.Musically, the series revisits themes from its predecessor, yet lacks innovation in other aspects.

Picking up where the first series left off, Jubei-chan 2 adds a few more interesting characters, but in the end turns out to be a carbon copy of the previous season. Jubei-chan is unsuccessful in...creating a coherent plot and is a complete letdown to the series.The first season laid down the building blocks for the possibility of a great sequel. Jubei-chan 2 fails to capitalize on the great opportunity and ends up being a huge disappointment to fans of the first Jubei-chan. At first glance, the series looks like improvement, as the characters and art are much more refined. Jubei-chan 2 also manages to keeps the comedic style that made the first one humorous, although, the good news stops there.It would appear that the creators of the series had the creativity sucked from their very souls The 300-years of revenge wished upon Yagyu Jubei by the Siberian Yagyu are exactly identical to the last series. The story follows a similar archetype leaving viewers with a feeling of deja-vu. Thus, leads us to one of the most serious offenses, the incredibly repetitive plot. The plot may not have been such a bad idea, had it not been done exactly the same way the first time. A few new characters were added, but it does nothing to change the overall makeup of the story. It is unacceptable that a sequel does nothing more then regurgitate what we saw in Jubei-chan 1.Adding insult to injury, elements in the story make absolutely no sense. As the tedious trek through this anime continues, often a viewer can find themselves looking for some kind of explanation to how and why exactly everything is happening. It's simply like having a puzzle with pieces that do not fit. It's stupid. Random events and sub-plots that go nowhere are the theme of this ridiculous sequel. In a 13-episode series, it simply is amazing that there was room for an ungodly amount of filler. In attempt to get a few laughs out of the audience, this useless filler only serves to scar the plot further and honestly, no one is laughing. Side characters purposely do nothing except take up screen time and their antics quickly grow tiresome.The final pitfall for this failure of a sequel is the lack of development between Jiyu and her attendant from the previous series, Koinosuke. With the abundance of flashbacks and emotional reminiscence of their relationship you would assume some kind of closure was due. But, no, the creators essentially give a huge slap in the face for those fans who stuck this series out. What they give us rather, is his more annoying daughter who could never recreate the same relationship between Jiyu and Koinosuke.Jubei-chan 2 is an utter failure and a sad joke. It is shows like this that make me lose all faith in sequels that attempt to recreate what made the prequel successful. The best part left over from the first series is completely ignored for a stale, repetitive and absolutely teeth-grinding story. Do not be deceived by the good looking Jubei and Freesia, because it's a trap. In this author's humble opinion, this is one of the most awful sequels of all-time and a complete waste of time.

Now that I've finally started purchasing anime for my own collection, I decided to get the sequel, hoping to once again enjoy some nice modern-samurai comedy.One word: Disappointed.The art is still nice and clean, and the battles are intense, but that doesn't really make up for the lack of other interesting parts to the show.While I say the battles are intense, this may not be considered a good thing by all, as the battles now consist of simple power Vs power, high-energy fights, which I cannot remember being...a focus in the last series. And even then, the fights are few, and they are usually over all too quickly.Outside the fighting, there is the story, the supporting characters, and the comedy. The story itself is decent enough, following in the footsteps of the previous entry, though this one seems shallow in comparison, and many of the serious scenes seem unnecessarily drawn out, along with seeing the same flashback a couple too many times.A fair number of the supporting characters from the original have been made almost inconsequential, taking with them a number of interesting and amusing personalities, in particular, Koinosuke no longer being a major character has left a large hole that the writers don't seem to have been able to fill. A few more still present, who were amusingly silly in the previous series, still seem to be silly, though less amusingly so, and are possibly getting a bit too much screen time than they should. On the flipside, the few 'important' supporting characters returning from the last series are well implemented and deserving.As for new characters, well, if you count the Siberia Yagyu group as one character (since they always appear together), then there really aren't many, not even with the inconsequential ones, and none are interesting enough to make up for characters lost.And lastly, for comedy. Well, apart from the previously mentioned silliness of some characters, and a few jokes repeated from the previous series (reminders of how good the first series was), there really isn't much to talk about, though what little there is that works, works well.Despite all that negativity, I don't believe it's a horrible series, but if you're a fan of the original, don't be too excited by the prospect of more Jubei.Before I go, I'd just like to say, that 3D animated......'thing' is freaky, and should never have existed.

The first Jubei Chan story wasn\'t spectacular, but it\'s approach was kind of cool, the humor was pretty good, filled with lots of jokes that break the third wall, bright character designs, and some really cool battles. Jubei Chan 2 is almost the exact, same show with the same premise, trying nothing at all new and completely wasting the viewer\'s time!STORY: (4) Just a pathetic rehash of the first story, except that this time, someone else has shown up with a lovely eye patch and...is claiming to be the real Yagyuu Jubei successor. Okay, this here just whizzes what was already established in the first story of Jubei\'s successor had to have ""plump, bouncy, bon bons"", which was never brought up at all in this series. Outside of the mysterious, patch-wearing imposter, it\'s pretty much thirteen episodes of this:Someone: Miss Jiyu, please fight! You\'re the only one!Jiyu: I don\'t want to! I\'m Jiyu!Someone Else: Miss Jubei, you have to fight! Put on the eye patch!Jiyu: I don\'t want to! I\'m Jiyu!Another Person Bleeding: Miss Jubei, I\'m dying! Fight that person!Jiyu: I don\'t want to! I\'m Jiyu!There\'s way too many flashbacks to same scenes to the point that nothing gets established and gets marred in medicority. They don\'t answer anything that you don\'t already know and pad the show for at least four of the thirteen episodes. There\'s just a lot of stuff in this plot that doesn\'t make any sense or really gets fleshed out.ART (8): The character designs are still very good, and the backgrounds are nice and colorful. Some of the new characters like Freesia look adorable, but uninspired compared to Jiyu or Mikage. The battles still look nice, but have regressed into over-the-top, explosive battles as opposed to the solid kitana duels that the first series focused on, as well as these fights are too far and few in between to enjoy.SOUND (5): The English dub isn\'t too good, but I\'ve heared worse. My problem is that the voice cast was changed from the Bandai dub to Geneon. Jiyu sounds like she\'s 21, and the comic relief characters are incredibly grating. Only Mikage sounds really good and expresses genuine emotion in her voice. Freesia has a decent dynamic going of displaying two personalities at times, but sadly this is never really played into as much as you think it would.CHARACTER (3): Nothing good here. At all. Jiyu herself is a selfish, shallow lead who has not progressed from the first story, resorting to the same spoiled little brat that I grew to hate intially. She never takes the severity of the situation at hand and the fact that Mikage, for the second time, puts herself in danger for Jiyu. Her father Sai  is probably the star of this series, going through the most character development than anyone else and is one of the few bright aspects of the show, but this is overlooked constantly. Mikage, who I\'ve mentioned several times, is still awesome, and is the only other person next to Sai who I enjoyed.Freesia could\'ve been a nice antagonist, but doesn\'t quite live up to the standard and just turns out to be a mild nuisance who Jiyu eventually battles with. She\'s nowhere near as intimidating as Hajime from the first series and her only selling point is to offer PG-rated fan service. Her goal is to make Jiyu suffer, but I was thinking ""why not kidnap the father and hold his life at stake for a duel?"". There is so much more they could\'ve done with her, but her backstory makes no sense and you don\'t feel any real hatred from her. Just way too underdeveloped.AND NO KOINOSUKE! Easily the best character from the first series has been replaced by his boring daughter!? He was the heart of the first series and you get rid of him? Why does his daughter have the eyepatch? Why is she trying to give it to Jiyu instead of him?! It makes no sense!! You killed the franchise! Thank you!ENJOYMENT (3): It\'s surprising just how boring this show is and that\'s what makes it so bad. There\'s just no reason to care for anything,ANYTHING, that\'s happening. The plot makes no sense, the villian is stock, the comedy is not funny, and for thirteen episodes, it feels like it goes on forever.OVERALL (4): If you\'re a fan of the first Jubei Chan, you might be very disappointed with this lackluster sequel.

Nothing about it is better than the first.', 'This is highly disappointing.Everything I took in from the first season was an incredible comedy that was serious, but not too serious; and frequently misconceived by many as something else.But, this was a joke. Right off the bat, they repeat the same plot and the theme song is just the original with a slightly updated violin theme and visuals. Did not mind that too much since I normally do not care for most opening and closing credits of anime, anyway.But, HOW can the humor and quality drop so much? It seems like they sacrificed their decent writing, excellent comedy and more just to improve the...animation; leaving in the fight scenes to be the parts to look forward to now.But, it turned into a generic comedy EXTREMELY quick. They actually changed the design of one of the characters and only voice actors of Jubei and Sai returned in the dub. The other characters themselves also underwent significant, unnecessary personality adjustments.I am glad I did not impulse on getting this one too, because it disappoints right off the bat. It started out good and the improved animation was very nice, but as soon as I heard the new voice actors something felt off. And, just like that, everything got worse as it progressed.I do not recommend this at all, but if you saw this first, do not judge its prior season; which is a million times better. Give that a go and end it there, as that one already ended on a good enough note and had beautiful composition in some areas as well. It is worth watching, but not its sequel. animation; leaving in the fight scenes to be the parts to look forward to now.But, it turned into a generic comedy EXTREMELY quick.

Jitsu wa Watashi wa,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29785/Jitsu_wa_Watashi_wa,"['It seems there may be a new trend in anime in recent years. The concept of monster girls who lives in the human world is becoming more and more of a trend. Rosario + Vampire, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, and even to an extent, To Love Ru Darkness display traits where its main character cast composes of non-human female characters. So where does that put Jitsu wa Watashi wa? Nowhere too different really. To sum it up easily, this is a series about a guy who discovers that there are non-human beings living in his world. And one of...them is not so far away as much as he thinks.Adapted from the manga of the same name, Jitsu wa Watashi wa (Actually, I am…) is a harem rom-com. There’s two ways the series goes about this. One is the way the characters are introduced, one by one in oddball fashions to the main character. The second is how the main character connects with them with a variety of feelings. And if you can guess, it mostly steers into a road of romance. However, it is also interesting to note that the series takes itself more as a comedy rather than human drama. How can human even fit into the same phrase here?Well, there’s the one human protagonist we meet from the very beginning. Known to his friends and peers as Kuromine and others as “Eromine” (there’s reason for this explained comically later), he is essentially the average teenager you can expect to see in any school related series. One day at school, he discovers a startling secret. He discovers that his secret crush, Shiragami Youko is actually a vampire. The key word here is ‘actually’. This is because the show is a matter of not ‘if’ but ‘when’. By predictable plot standards, it’s easy to guess that Kuromine will find out the secrets of other characters too. But for starters, his discovery of Youko lands him into some awkward waters. The way the show sets their relationship essentially begins as a form of pact. Kuromine likes Youko and vows to keep her secret from others. In turn, Youko begins to understand Kuromine and naturally begins to develop similar feelings. And as far as that goes, their school life begins to take into a road of misadventures as others get involved with their “relationship”.As a series about rom-com, the main protagonist is hardly outstanding. He is the typical nice guy, the beta harem type that you can find literally in any similar series. What does make him slightly interesting is that he is honest and loyal. The first few episodes establishes this as he promises to keep Youko’s true identity as a secret. If not, Youko would have to be change schools in order to avoid shame. His personality seems to have influence on others as well as the characters encountered by him understands his intentions more than they originally had thought. This seemingly also attracts others towards him as they see Kuromine as a sincere person. Characters such as Nagisa begins to have conflicting thoughts about him as the series progresses, Youko falls further and further in love, while he attracts other weirdos like self-proclaimed pervert, Shiho Shishido. As amusing as this sounds, there’s hardly any good characterization on them. The series easily makes its point that it’s more of a comedy gag show rather than something to take seriously. The plot is also structured in episodic-like nature with some episodes that have little to no connections with the rest.Despite this, I do have to admit that the show has genuine comedy. This comes mainly from the character face expressions. In essence, we get two types. The first is human-like ones from Kuromine and his childhood friend Mikan. Their reactions to many events in the show is priceless and often seems like a work of art. Although it’s not as powerful as to the manga, it still retains its clever facial tone. The second is the dialogues. Because Kuromine is helping to keep a secret, there will be a lot of times where he gets into complicated scenarios where he may have to make up something in order to avoid trouble. Think of it more as “lying with the truth” and the dialogues that comes from it is hilarious. Of course, expect misunderstandings and events to get complicated more than they seem.The series ultimately can be a hit or miss for fans when it comes to adaptation. To me, it’s a bit of both. I wouldn’t say it’s a failure but neither is it compelling. Rather than following the manga straightforward, the adaptation reshuffles certain chapters to make the overall story flow better. While this seems like a positive at first, it can also lead to important elements of the original omitted or parts added in too quickly. The good part that comes with this is the better pacing as some of the episodic scenarios can be frustrating and almost like if it’s testing the patience of the audience.TMS Entertainment is not a powerhouse but their involvement for this show does have some good values. The character designs aren’t outstanding as the characters looks generic and lacks the compelling feel of the manga. However, it makes it up for the facial expressions in particular Kuromine and Youko. Every episode has them and it’s hard to ignore. Otherwise, background work such as the school, neighborhood, and communities lacks concrete in detail. There’s also some bits of fan service used mainly for comedy gags. Don’t really expect much though as the show again often emphasizes comedy rather than eye candy.In similar terms, the soundtrack is just fine as it is. The OP and ED theme song plays on note with comedy although can be easily forgettable. There’s also some spoilers in the theme songs so fast forwarding them if you want a better experience as an anime original viewer. There’s also a problem with Youko’s voice as she sounds like a character that is younger than she actually is. It will take some time to get used to as I did throughout the show. On the contrary, character voice mannerisms during “climatic scenes” are easily laughable for its comedic intent. When combined with the face expressions, the show really brings out a colorful side to the humor.So what’s to say about Jitsu wa Watashi wa in the end? It’s probably a better idea to watch it for yourself. The show is something that should be watched if you want a fun laugh rather than any sort of realistic drama. The romance is almost like a satire at times as it feels dense yet amusing as the story progresses. And of course, who can forget about our colorful cast of monster girls? In retrospect, this show is more like an imaginative storytelling that can strike as peculiar when a guy learns what actually is… them is not so far away as much as he thinks.Adapted from the manga of the same name, Jitsu wa Watashi wa (Actually, I am…) is a harem rom-com.

The plot is decent, the characters are funny, and the anime is without flaw... OK, it isn\'t flawless. But it does have a certain charm to it, and I never even had the thought of dropping it. It was really entertaining. But the ending left room for improvement, and the characters\' sub-par performance, in terms of uniqueness, quality and improvisation, could have been avoidable. If it gets a sequel, I\'d watch it, though.Story: 7/10The plot takes a very rough road to its destination. Once you\'re in a few...episodes, you\'ll start noticing you\'ve picked a favourite girl (or guy, I suppose) subconsciously. And you\'ll be routing for that girl (or guy...). But then that character loses all its screen time, and ""vanishes"" as a ""supporting character"". And that can be irritating at times. So, all in all, the plot is something you either like, or you don\'t. And the character development is slow, if not non-existent. You\'ll start noticing after they mention how much Asahi ""changed"", that he didn\'t really change at all. Honestly, the only characters that sort of changed are Nagisa and Mikan. The rest stay the same, more or less, until the end. It really does depend on your point of view, but despite the ups and downs, this anime is generally likable. And so is the plot, albeit with little progress. It could have been better. But it wasn\'t.Though it does have similar jests in respect to other anime, it is nonetheless interesting. If you are looking for a slice-of-life anime, or a serious and/or malicious plot, you\'re out of luck. If you\'re a fantasy fan like me, and are interested in the supernatural, then this may or may not be for you, as it lacks the seriousness some people prefer in fantasies (i.e less comedy, more battle). But if you love anime without a greater goal, in other words, simple yet moving stories, then this anime might be a great opportunity for you.Art: 8/10It\'s interesting how something so simple can be so very fitting to a single series. I cannot say I saw a single mistake in the animation, albeit through my untrained eyes. In my ever so humble opinion, in terms of quality, it really hits the mark. For example, the running animation is particularly detailed, and the facial expressions are hilarious. I cannot say they did a bad job converting the manga art, either. To be honest, it\'s great. And, as the Japanese like to say, Omoshiroi (For reference: 面白い).Sound: 8/10The OP and ED were splendid! The voice actors were really good, as well. Though one highschooler sounded like a thirty-five year old man. Overall, the soundtrack was brought to life in a unique way, seeing as how I can\'t think of any similar songs. Simply put, the OP outweighed the anime, in a sense. One of the few that I didn\'t skip, and it fits to the theme very well, as well. (Too many \'well\'s... Oh, well...)Characters: 7/10I can\'t say I was completely satisfied. They could\'ve been better. But overall, I\'d say they were good. If only Mikan and Nagisa had been portrayed better. It felt to me like they were lacking enough impact of sorts in the plot.Enjoyment: 8/10The lightheartedness is refreshing, especially after last season, so this is certainly the anime to watch if you\'re in the mood to relax. The comedy is only a bit better than average, though. The romance leaves room for improvement, as well. But to me, this anime is one of the highlights of the season.Overall: 8/10This anime is, or can be, very funny at times, and dull at others. But depending on the viewers\' mood, this anime could be the best way to cheer yourself up, or the best way to fall into despair. Now, when I say something like that, you\'d be thinking: ""What the hell are you talking about!? This anime is awesome!"" or ""This series is so abysmal, I can\'t wait for it it to fail miserably!"" Both statements are correct. Both are false. This anime is better than average. It\'s also worse than average. It\'s a better than average comedy. It is a worse than average harem. It has worse than average characters, but better than average personalities. I could go on, but you get my point. Depending on the person you are, you may like this, or you may not. Now, to be completely honest, this anime gets an 8/10. Not because I gave it that score, but because the anime genuinely gives you a homely feeling. It does. Really. It\'s not something you really notice at first. Or in all situations. But you\'ll notice when you\'re really tired (mentally, and physically), perhaps after a long day of work. It\'s relaxing. And extremely so. If you lower the volume a bit, once Asahi starts shouting, you\'ll know what I mean. I personally can say out of experience that most people will overlook this show. And it\'s their loss. No anime is perfect, but this one was great, to say the least. It\'s also a great way to get into the manga itself. If you really hate anime like this, then I can\'t say you are wrong. But if you try it out, you might actually come to like it.Alright, lastly, to add a few recommendations, let\'s list some similar anime:■ Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou■ Himouto!

Yeah the general premise of it isn\'t by any means original, but given the circumstances of the show, it could have been a decent rom/com. Ironic enough the score I\'m giving it is classified as ""decent."" The show has a promising first few episodes, filled with comedy more than anything else.Really, there isn\'t too much to say about this adaptation because it lacked a lot of development in every aspect. The story seemed to follow the usual trend of...boy meets girl, they fall in love with each other, beat around the bush for 10 episodes and then conclude with a cute scene at the end. Certainly I thought it was going to be like this but the last 2 episodes decided it was okay to do the inexplicable. Not going to spoil it, but what happens pretty much kicks everything prior down the drain. Makes me think that whoever did the anime adaptation decided (from what i heard) to change it from the manga. If the manga was like this then -_-. Overall for the story: worked up to nothing, falls flat and leaves a lot to be desired.Characters are all very generic. We got the goody two shoes male protagonist, the dense main heroine, the jealous kuudere heroine, the childhood friend, and the hentai heroine. Nothing special by any means and as a matter of fact, this show really revolves around the male protagonist and the dense and jealous heroines. The other two seem to play no part in progressing the story and seem to be in on screen for no particular reason. All the other characters are generic side characters as well. The most interesting character to me was the principal, but she had very little screen time and it would\'ve been nice to know more about her. Yeah the characters lacked a lot of originality, but some redeeming qualities were their interactions. It was funny for the most part, but most of the drama filled scenes seemed forced. Characters were not memorable.Sound was overall decent. The opening animation seemed to give off the wrong impression of the show, but it was catchy. The ED has to be one of my more favorite ED\'s out there. Most of the soundtrack was forgettable, one stand out though being the one @ the pool scene. VA\'s were eh sound effects eh.Animation in this show is different from a lot of other shows where it really focuses on the facial features of characters. It is really bubbly and does a good job projecting the emotions our characters are feeling. Action scenes could have been better.I liked this show for the first 9 episodes, but it definitely dropped the ball with it\'s pacing. A lot of questions were left unresolved and some (what i think) key scenes were brushed over just to be one of those ""remember when"" moments. There were too many removable characters for me to really give a crap about the 3 main ones. I really am disappointed in how it ended because I was enjoying the slapstick humor. Too many plotholes and too many plotpoints that were completely disregarded. boy meets girl, they fall in love with each other, beat around the bush for 10 episodes and then conclude with a cute scene at the end.

Jitsu wa Watashi wa, or ""Actually, I am..."", is a romantic school anime which incorporates supernatural elements as well as comedic ones to enhance the narrative.As mentioned earlier, the story is simple and centers around Kuromine Asahi, the ""leaky basket"", and Shiragami Youko, who happens to be a ""dense"" vampire. Having a person who can\'t keep secrets can only lead to problems. The anime utilizes these situations to its advantage to present amusing situations and develop their relationship. However, the...comedic situations are often similar, getting old quickly; the same applies to the story, which seems to have the same approach as other similar anime.New characters are introduced as the narrative progresses, all with one common aspect: all have a supernatural background, whether it is an alien or a transforming werewolf. This is an interesting aspect that provides diversity to the characters and story, yet as the story unfolds, instead of exploring the supernatural nature of these characters, it just focuses on the romantic aspect and feelings these have for the lead character. I found this personally a letdown, making it not much different from the other romantic school comedies.The cast of characters presented in Jitsu wa Watashi wa were unique in their own way, each with a supernatural background, though with generic personalities. There is Kuromine, who is a clumsy, shy, ""leaky basket"" but with a good heart. Then there is the vampire Shiragami, a dense and unaware person of her surroundings, who in the beginning seems to be very shy and unsocial person. There is the perverted werewolf who has double personalities,Shishido Shido; the alien Aizawa Nagisa with a very serious attitude, and the childhood friend, whose glasses are possessed. Not to forget the demonic director and her sister, as well as the usual cast of supporting characters such as friends.Character development is not the strongest point in the anime, though throughout the anime the spectator observes how the romantic feelings for Kuromine affects the different characters.The animation is well done, as well as the characters, who have a distinctive design comparing with the other modern anime. The comedy is enhanced through amusing face expressions. The eyes of the characters were toned down a bit to make the characters more appealing, comparing it to the manga. Some of the soundtracks used in Jitsu wa Watashi wa fits well, such as the rock themes, with other less interesting themes which is common in other anime. I personally enjoyed listening to some of the voice actors, as I like the Kansai accent. The opening had a catchy tune, though nothing outstanding.Jitsu wa Watashi wa was overall an enjoyable experience, with interesting character designs, though failing into exploring these to its full potential, making the narrative itself rather dull and generic. Nevertheless, the occasional comedic situations managed to keep the story interesting. What could have been a good romantic comedy with interesting characters and interesting story progression, turned out to be rather lackluster in comparison, but entertaining.Thank you for reading. comedic situations are often similar, getting old quickly; the same applies to the story, which seems to have the same approach as other similar anime.New characters are introduced as the narrative progresses, all with one common aspect: all have a supernatural background, whether it is an alien or a transforming werewolf.

He finds out her secret and tries to keep it despite being a ""leaky basket"", to prove so he ends up being friends with her instead of just confessing his feelings.Moreover other girls come into the story to make things more difficult ... more complicated for him to get closer to ""the girl"" who is pretty dense when it comes to her feelings and romance, and then mistakes his affection for her thinking he\'s in love with THE OTHER GIRL.Comedy wise... not so funny it got me yawning most of the time, I...simply couldn\'t find it funny nor cute. But hey it\'s my personal opinion, others might have found it funny I just didn\'t.In the END he never confesses. I must say it was 1 of the few animes I didn\'t enjoy at all.It\'s a hangup story with no end. simply couldn\'t find it funny nor cute.

It followed a simple story that was easy to follow, without the emotional commitment. It's a pallet-cleanser anime. I had just bawled my eyes out after watching AnoHana, and I need something to ease the pain. I decided to try it on a whim, and ended up watching the whole thing in one sitting.It delivers a refreshingly light humor that let me just relax while I watched. I credit much of that to the timing of its jokes, as well as the pacing of the story.This show is definitely a hidden gem.

The MC can't keep a secret at all, so they try to turn that into a plot device only to not make any other plot devices. That's pretty much the show.

Despite being quite a bit unrealistic in relation to the romance part, most rom-coms are very much grounded in reality. Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa is just the opposite with its non-sense comedy.Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa (Actually, I am…) is the anime adaptation of the rom-com manga of the same name, published by Shounen Champion and created, written and illustrated by Eiji Matsuda. The adaptation is directed by Yasutaka Yamamoto (Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru...Sou Desu yo?, Valkyria Chronicles).Asashi Kuromine is a high-schooler with a strange peculiarity: he can’t lie or hide his emotions. Also, he has a crush on Youko Shiragami, a mysterious girl from his class that never participates in PE class and is always the last student to leave school. One day, he decides to confess his feelings after-school. Because of that, he discovers that she is, actually, a vampire. Now he has to keep her secret, while trying to get closer to her and dealing with other supernatural beings and even aliens.Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa is not your usual rom-com, it has too much of a taste for the weird and nonsensical to be one. At first, the comedy is a bit weird, but it builds up on its own weirdness to become something that reminded me a bit of Monty Python, with all of its craziness and novelty. As crazy as it sounds, air-headed vampires, randomly appearing ice-creams and a devil with a sweet tooth are normal occurrences in Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa . The comedy never becomes stale, as, with each new character, new interactions and situations become possible. While they don’t evolve much in terms of development, all of them are instantly likeable with a decent degree of depth. Also, most of the characters are twists in the “normal” horror monsters: vampire, werewolf… Still, it is a rom-com, and, as a result, most of the development is based around the fact that characters fall in love with each other.The characters’ interaction is wonderfully crazy and, somehow, they always outdo themselves, with crazier and crazier situations arising. This is only possible because of the great variety of the characters and their (sometimes conflicting) personalities. “Sexiness” contests, meteors’ attacks, spicy bread russian roulette and even plain old festivals are just some examples of the type of stuff that happens in Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa.The visuals are vibrant, but take some time to get used too. After the initial reactions, it becomes pleasing to look at, but never reaches anything other than that. Likewise, the character design is colorful and eye-catching, creating a unique style.As an adaptation, it was pretty good. It changed the order of the events depicted on the manga, but stayed faithful most of the time. Unfortunately, it is not as great as the manga, simply because of the way the comedy’s “snowballing” nature. Given a second season, it could reach the same levels of the manga.Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa strength lies not in its story or characters, but its unique comedy. Despite its great quality, its enjoyment depends on the viewer’s own sense of humor. As a result of loving wacky comedy, I enjoyed the comedy of the series, but, again, it may not be for everybody.I would recommend Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa to people looking for an unusual rom-com that focus mostly in its comedy aspect and also to people looking to a Japanese-styled Monty Python.

Everyone has a secret, and it\'s because of these little factoids about ourselves that make us different...and make people want to know about them even more.  So, with Jitsu wa Watashi wa, or ""Actually, I am..."", what kind of secrets will we learn about today?Story: Kuromine Asahi is a relatively average guy in school.  He\'s normal, but has one fatal flaw to his character, and that is, he can\'t hold onto someone\'s secret for the life of him.  As such, he has been called the ""Leaky Basket"" by all of his peers because...any kind of secret he is told immediately comes out in a blaze of glory.  But, Asahi has a secret of his own; he likes Shiragami Youko, a girl who acts very distant from the rest of the class with weird habits like leaving school in the evening and sitting out during P.E.  So, on his way to confess to her because he knows her weird habits like a creepy stalker, he bursts into the classroom and sees Youko...with wings coming out of her back.  Oh boy, here we go again...Jitsu wa, as the shorthanded way of saying this series\' name is, revolves around Asahi and his band of merry fellow main characters as they go through various antics that appear either in front of them, or just come to them from some god unknown force.  Since this is a school anime, the base storyline is a bunch of highschoolers spending time together, and that\'s really about it.  However, Jitsu wa\'s biggest draw comes from the way its seemingly random story is presented.Comedy is the main reason to be drawn to this series, as it\'s brand of comedy...cannot be explained in words very easily, so I will attempt to elaborate.  As the main focal point of the series, Jitsu wa\'s spectrum of comedy goes from sheer stupidity of the main cast (like accidentally revealing their respective secrets) and the following retorts ironically by our main protagonist who apparently can\'t keep a secret, to seemingly random, balls to the wall, what the fuck just happened scenes that again, cannot be accurately explained in words.  It\'s this blend of comedy that really makes the series unique compared to any other supernatural high school show.  The only issue I have is that they don\'t execute the jokes well enough to properly integrate them into the series, and as a result, sometimes feel a bit forced.The main issues this show has comes in a pair of two.  First, the show doesn\'t flow all that well.  The entire show is comprised of random chapters from the manga squished together to form an adaptation story of its own.  As such, a lot of the events that occur happen either much later or earlier than they should making for some uneven flow and jumps in how things happen, and the biggest problem, is that there are characters that feel like they just show up out of nowhere without much explanation.  (Cue Fuku)  The other issue is the fact that the show plays itself more as a generic romcom more than anything else which doesn\'t translate well when compared to the source material.In the end, this adaptation of one of the more out there stories in anime today fumbled a lot with how it wanted to present itself.  Acting more as an allusion to the Jitsu wa Watashi wa series, this adaptation failed to properly explain certain things with what it wanted to show us, and made some progressional issues that seemed a bit rushed.  While it still has the comedic charm with its inexplainable brand of comedy, there were still aspects to it that didn\'t have as much of an impact as it should\'ve.  Plus, it kinda ended in a weird place.  That would not be the chapter that I would say you should end the series on.Overview:+/-  Random but hilarious comedy (Positive or negative depending on your perception of funny.)-  Bland base story (Highschool, again.)-  Pacing and explanation issuesCharacters: With its brand of comedy, Jitsu wa provides us with some interesting characters to fill in the bubbles as to who says what.First, we have Kuromine Asahi, the main protagonist of the series, and the leaky basket.  As the person who can\'t hold a secret to save his life, Asahi spends the entire series trying to keep the girl he befriends but secretly loves, Shiragami Youko.  (As well as other characters because honestly, everyone in this show is a genuine idiot.  It\'s not an insult.  They are legitimately stupid.)  Ironically playing as the straight man, Asahi retorts back any kind of stupid statement or idea that is suggested by any of the other characters, before being promptly sucked into said idea and thus, is plagued with the stupidity of the people around him.  Really though, that\'s all Asahi\'s character is.  Throughout the whole series, Asahi says to everyone that he loves Youko, and he stays that way with every passing episode.  There\'s no growth for him because he starts at the point of saying he\'ll protect her secret, and ends with saying that he\'ll protect her secret.  So really, there\'s no difference and as such, there\'s no development for his character.Then we have Shiragami Youko, the vampire (or Dumpire as I like to call her.  Dumb Vampire = Dumpire) and main female protagonist of the series.  First seen as a distant and reserved girl, Youko is actually really cheerful and absent minded most of the time.  Rather than the male being completely oblivious to the girls\' feelings, Youko is a girl who is dense herself and can\'t see Asahi\'s feelings.  As such, she, with help of Asahi shooting himself in the foot at the confession, thinks of him as nothing more than a friend.  But not only that, a PRECIOUS friend.  The whole show plays around with this idea of these two characters dancing the waltz of ""Will they or won\'t they"" while also having other players to the mix of this strange semblance of a romance show.And finally, we have Aizawa Nagisa, or Screw Girl, as I like to call her.  (You know, cause she has a screw on the back of her head?)  As an alien who is about as tall as a nendoroid, Nagisa is the stoic member of the cast whose slightly militant-like personality causes her to lose any credibility that she was taught in the military because she reveals her secret about 10 minutes of her existing.  (Like I said, everyone in this show is stupid to some extent.)  Nagisa mostly plays as the secondary female of the series and, with the help of another character, Mikan, create the harem aspect of the series which is rather prominent in the series in the grand scheme of things.The rest of the characters in Jitsu wa play mostly supporting roles for the series, which is a real shame because some of the best characters of the entire series either get shelved off to the side as supporting cast, or show up so late that they won\'t have enough time to make much of an impact.  It\'s this treatment of the cast members that disappoint me because a lot of these ""supporting members"" are actually the ones that bring a lot of joy in the manga, which would\'ve help boosted this adaptation from being what looks like a generic romcom.Overview:+ Unique, interesting, and above all, wonderfully stupid characters-  A lot of the cast members were just casted off to the sideArt: Art for Jitsu wa is a bit of a touchy subject.  Made by TMS, this adaptation brings the Jitsu wa series to life through a style of animation that is both similar, and different to the original style in the manga.Contrary to the goofy and overall wacky artstyle that this series has, filled with very unique facial expression oddly never seen in any series ever, as well as overdramatic events that make the series well known, TMS opted for a more moe artsyle where the characters look a bit more ""normal"" and didn\'t have that goofy looking style that the original show had.  This artstyle is just average in its own right, with nothing really outstanding about it to make it stand out as a series visually.  Sure we get some of Jitsu wa\'s signature facial expressions, but there\'s really nothing that special about it.Overview:+/- Mediocre, moe-style artSound: As for the soundtrack, the OP for Jitsu wa is a perfect representation of the series.  With a very upbeat track that skips to its own tune, this track is, while not extraordinary, is pretty memorable.  It\'s catchy, it\'s fun, and overall pretty nice to listen to.The ED on the other hand is a bit of a random style to fit with this show.  With a kind of rapping/melancholic style of music to it (I have no idea what to call it.), the ED admittedly isn\'t something that I would call good, but it\'s pretty unique for a song style/choice, I\'ll give it that.Overview:+ Catchy, memorable OP+/-  Odd ED (Has good and bad aspects to it.)Personal Enjoyment: As someone who has read the Jitsu wa manga to the most recent chapter, I was mystified about seeing the adaptation.  Since the series look rather different than what it looked like in the manga, I assumed that there were going to more than just stylistic changes to the entire series and was a bit scared about how things would turn out.  In the end, it wasn\'t an Isuca incident, but I still don\'t like it.What did I like about this series?Sure I got a few laughs out of the whole thing but honestly, I didn\'t really like this adaptation.  The show felt like a romcom or harem anime, not Jitsu wa.  They took chapters from random parts of the manga\'s timeline and turned it into the series (sometimes completely out of order too) which made me wonder why they did that in all honesty rather than just sticking with the inherent plot.What didn\'t I like about this series?This adaptation didn\'t feel like Jitsu wa.  Jitsu wa is a series that for me, is one that has twists and turns on every corner with complete balls to the wall and random crap that happens so out of this world that busting your sides is just a norm for people who read the series.  They didn\'t use a lot of the characters to their full potential and as such, made the series less special on account of the lack of screentime for some of the best characters of the entire series.  I\'m also not a fan of the stylistic change of the artstyle and where the anime ended, because that is a very awkward place to end it.Would I recommend this anime?All in all, Jitsu wa is another anime vs. manga scenario.  Even though I say that this adaptation doesn\'t completely feel like Jitsu wa, there are enough elements of it to allude and at least explain the main story of the series.  (Even though they still did screw it up a bit.)  As such, if you want to know about the Jitsu wa series without reading 90+ chapters and see the random antics in animated form, go for this adaptation.  Just be warned to see some crazy shit.  Because things can go from 0-100 FAST. any kind of secret he is told immediately comes out in a blaze of glory.  But, Asahi has a secret of his own; he likes Shiragami Youko, a girl who acts very distant from the rest of the class with weird habits like leaving school in the evening and sitting out during P.E.  So, on his way to confess to her because he knows her weird habits like a creepy stalker, he bursts into the classroom and sees Youko...with wings coming out of her back.  Oh boy, here we go again...Jitsu wa, as the shorthanded way of saying this series\' name is, revolves around Asahi and his band of merry fellow main characters as they go through various antics that appear either in front of them, or just come to them from some god unknown force.  Since this is a school anime, the base storyline is a bunch of highschoolers spending time together, and that\'s really about it.  However, Jitsu wa\'s biggest draw comes from the way its seemingly random story is presented.Comedy is the main reason to be drawn to this series, as it\'s brand of comedy...cannot be explained in words very easily, so I will attempt to elaborate.  As the main focal point of the series, Jitsu wa\'s spectrum of comedy goes from sheer stupidity of the main cast (like accidentally revealing their respective secrets) and the following retorts ironically by our main protagonist who apparently can\'t keep a secret, to seemingly random, balls to the wall, what the fuck just happened scenes that again, cannot be accurately explained in words.  It\'s this blend of comedy that really makes the series unique compared to any other supernatural high school show.  The only issue I have is that they don\'t execute the jokes well enough to properly integrate them into the series, and as a result, sometimes feel a bit forced.The main issues this show has comes in a pair of two.  First, the show doesn\'t flow all that well.  The entire show is comprised of random chapters from the manga squished together to form an adaptation story of its own.  As such, a lot of the events that occur happen either much later or earlier than they should making for some uneven flow and jumps in how things happen, and the biggest problem, is that there are characters that feel like they just show up out of nowhere without much explanation.  (Cue Fuku)  The other issue is the fact that the show plays itself more as a generic romcom more than anything else which doesn\'t translate well when compared to the source material.In the end, this adaptation of one of the more out there stories in anime today fumbled a lot with how it wanted to present itself.  Acting more as an allusion to the Jitsu wa Watashi wa series, this adaptation failed to properly explain certain things with what it wanted to show us, and made some progressional issues that seemed a bit rushed.  While it still has the comedic charm with its inexplainable brand of comedy, there were still aspects to it that didn\'t have as much of an impact as it should\'ve.  Plus, it kinda ended in a weird place.  That would not be the chapter that I would say you should end the series on.Overview:+/-  Random but hilarious comedy (Positive or negative depending on your perception of funny.)-  Bland base story (Highschool, again.)-  Pacing and explanation issuesCharacters: With its brand of comedy, Jitsu wa provides us with some interesting characters to fill in the bubbles as to who says what.First, we have Kuromine Asahi, the main protagonist of the series, and the leaky basket.

Because things can go from 0-100 FAST.', 'Jitsu wa Watashi wa is indeed a surprising unexpected gem for the summer season, and has a certain thing that makes you to keep watching it even with its mediocrity. I won\'t say it is totally mediocre, but most of its elements are rather seen in other anime which makes it not suitable for other viewers. Despite those, it is still a fun romance to watch because of good and proper pacing and execution.The story is set to be in an ideal school harem setting, it is about a generic brown-haired guy named Kuromine Asahi who can\'t keep secrets. Together with the introduction of each...girl the anime progresses fast. Just like any other harem, there is this ""main girl"" who will likely end up with the main guy but as you watch this you may also root for the others, as they are likable and you won\'t have the reason to hate them. About the plot, it\'s common and generic but a few twists like different attributes to the abilities each character have and being an entertaining romcom make it somewhat special. There is also this clashing of romance and comedy that some viewers may not like, but only a little.Nothing to complain about the art, it\'s really plain and ordinary and doesn\'t leave any good or bad impression. Scenes aren\'t that detailed but the character designs are pretty and clever. What makes the art good I think are the colors used for details and character designs. It makes it more lively and vivid, which is what a comedy anime need. It contributes to the atmosphere greatly. Lastly, who can forget their facial expressions? They are very funny, fresh to the eyes, and can make you laugh.Each voice actor did a great job portraying their respective characters. The soundtracks are really forgettable, though they are also responsible for setting the mood of each scene. The opening is somewhat catchy and makes you jumpy, it really suits the anime\'s playful and cheerful atmosphere. The ending is a gorgeous song, with it\'s calmer melody it portrays the drama and romantic side of the anime. My only complain about the sound is the insert music in every later half of each episode. Although it is not a bad song, it gets quite out of hand and becomes annoyingly unnecessary.Now for the characters, they each have their own traits making them easy to distinguish from each other. Being a harem, one would expect that each character have their screen time one by one each episode. But this is not the case in Jitsu wa Watashi wa. Not only each character have their backstories, they are mostly part of each episode and no one gets left out. The main characters\' personalities like being dense and bucket with holes spark a unique kind of chemistry which is good for an effective romance. Being a Romcom developments are slow, but you can see in each episode how well the creators execute scenes and dialogues for their developments.I\'m not sure if this can give any laughs, but man, this is pretty entertaining for me. Some jokes are recycled, but most of the time you may get something you won\'t expect. Jitsu wa Watashi wa is a friendly supernatural Romcom that can stand on its own merits.The summer season was fun indeed, but Jitsu wa Watashi wa was just left out in the corner and was overlapped by more mainstream anime. It is quite underrated and it deserves more than what it gets. Overall, it has a few flaws but it\'s still covered by its own shines. It is certainly not bad, but it has its limits for being good as well.Story - 8Art - 7Sound - 7Character - 8Enjoyment - 9Overall - 8 girl the anime progresses fast.

For example, a lot of anime involve vampires, secrets, harems, and mutual feelings to never be confessed, and those are just among what this anime contains. Even though I knew this, I really looked forward to watching this particular anime when the July 2015 season rolled around; I couldn\'t shake off the feeling that it was going to be fun to watch. Sure enough, I was right, although I wasn\'t able to catch up to it in time for it to end. Well, now that I\'ve finally been able to...finish it, what do I think now?Ladies and gentlemen, it\'s no secret that I\'m now reviewing ""Jitsu wa Watashi wa"", known as ""Actually, I Am...."" in English!Jitsu wa Watashi wa follows a boy named Asahi Kuromine, who is referred to as a ""leaky basket"" due to how bad of a liar he is. One day, he finds himself faced with an important secret; his classmate and crush, Youko Shiragami, is actually a vampire! In order to avoid getting her pulled out of school due to her secret being exposed, Asahi tries his best to keep Youko\'s secret and ends up befriending her in the process. *coughfriendzonecough* Along the way, he discovers the supernatural secrets of others, such as the class rep, Nagisa Aizawa (an alien), and Youko\'s childhood friend, Shiho Shishido (a ""wolf man""), and he must keep those secrets, too. Geez, that\'s a lot of secrets for one leaky basket to keep!I bet you\'d look at the summary and think, ""Haven\'t I seen this somewhere before?"" As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, Jitsu wa Watashi wa is packed with cliches from fellow romantic comedy anime. You know what, though? That didn\'t stop the comedy from being hilarious or at least amusing; even if a joke didn\'t get me laughing out loud, I would at least be smiling the whole time! Its cast of characters helped this show, too; most of them are very fun to watch. Even though the romance between Youko and Asahi ends up not progressing much throughout, it was still fun to see them together.The animation for this anime was pretty great. I haven\'t seen too much of TMS Entertainment\'s anime, but out of the ones I have seen, this is definitely some of the most appealing I\'ve ever seen out of them, with its bright colors. The voice actors definitely nailed their roles, as well. I especially liked Inori Minase as Nagisa; I really felt that her voice fit her character. The opening theme, ""Himitsu wo Choudai"" by Ars Magna, is such a fun song to listen to and one that definitely fits this anime; the ending theme, ""Ienai Ienai"" by Hilcrhyme, is also a very nice song to listen to.Overall, Jitsu wa Watashi wa is definitely a fun anime to watch.

Lets download some comedy anime so that I have something to watch while I\'m there. Lets see... A guy who can\'t lie has to keep a secret about a vampire girl? That sounds hilarious! The only way they could possibly screw it up is if they added completely needless... They added god damned slapstick...You see people, the point of slapstick comedy is to take hard, painful, boring situations and turn them to funny ones. A cat chasing a mouse for example...is mundane, but when you add slapstick to it, it becomes funny. Now in a situation that\'s already comedic on its own, such as an idiot who can\'t lie trying to keep a vampire\'s secret, SLAPSTICK DOESN\'T FIT.So as you can guess, the scenario revolves around a guy who can\'t lie, who accidentally finds out the girl he likes is in truth a vampire. It is decided that since she got caught she should give up on high-school, but upon hearing this, the protagonist swears to keep her secret, essentially sealing a pact between them. Except the vampire girl is a dumb idiot who friendzones him from the start and the way the series goes it\'s a wonder she hadn\'t got discovered already, with her moronic behavior. Along the way things get slightly more complicated when the protagonist\'s previous crash also turns out to be a weirdo (a chibi alien in this case, operating a human-sized robotic version of herself) and she is also discovered. So basically it is a trio of the alien chick liking the protagonist but the protagonist being oblivious to it, the protagonist liking the vampire but the vampire being oblivious to it, and the vampire trying to support the alien girl hooking up with the protagonist.In  sort, the protagonist forms his own harem full of forced tsunderes or dumb morons. To sum it up, while original, it isn\'t the most likable of casts, especially since their performances come out really unnatural, because we REALLY NEEDED THE F@CKING SLAPSTICK. What\'s truly annoying though, is that the anime was clearly written by two joke writers with completely different ideas of what humor is. And the stupid one apparently outranked the smart one. I believe the dialogue below should explain this well:Writer 1: And just as the main character is in a moral dilemma between lying to his friends and letting his alien love interest have her skirt flipped...Writer 2: We\'ll add a chase scene to it!Writer 1:He...

But it is clear through all that chaos that really intelligent writing is hiding underneath all the trash, but it keeps getting interrupted for filler bullsh!t. The show follows tired cliches because it\'s afraid of venturing the more dangerous path, even though it clearly has the potential to do so. And if there\'s something I hate more than natural stupid crap, it\'s crap that had the potential to be smart, but instead got scared and joined the comfort zone of being stupid like all the others. And even worse it ends up being JUVENILE crap.Visuals have a fresh look about them and the voice acting is ok. But the show is too juvenile, too kid-focused to be of any real fun to a crowd that doesn\'t think hitting on doorbells and then running away is a good prank.

Stay away.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Jitsu wa Watashi wa loves its secrets. Many people (myself included) like secrets. It does not matter which side, either keeping or having them. Keeping them is all about trust between the parties, because once one person reveals the secret then it is a secret no longer. (This brings into question how many have to know a secret before it is no longer a secret, but that is a conversation for another day.) And having them is all about knowing who, if anyone, to tell.There is actually a third side: the people not in the...know. I found myself on this side once. For one of my birthdays, my parents and siblings told me that we were meeting up with my grandparents for a small dinner. I thought this was perfectly normal given we have done this in the past.But when we arrived at the restaurant, my entire family – uncles, aunts, and cousins – were waiting for me. Yes, a surprise birthday party. I was baffled that they were able to keep it a secret for so long. I will never forget that feeling when it first dawned on me what had actually happened: a weird, happy feeling of betrayal.In my case, the secret was ultimately harmless. In Jitsu’s case, the secrets it holds are more important than any birthday party could hope to be.STORYJitsu starts off innocently enough. Kuromine, a shy, unable-to-lie (contextually, keep a secret) boy has a crush on Shiragami, the silent, beautiful girl in his class. He musters the courage to one day give her a love letter, only to find her with wings out and fangs bared. In other words, he found out her secret: she is a vampire.This is how Jitsu sets up almost all of its encounters with the various girls in the harem. Said girl is hiding an absurd secret that, coincidentally, Kuromine stumbles upon. This is the first anime’s sign of its repetitive nature. Many of the jokes rely on the same shticks, such as “Ero-mine-kun” and the principal of the school getting ragged on by her great-great-granddaughter, the teacher. Many of the jokes also rely on the same premise of misplaced expectations: the characters say the opposite of what is about to happen next. (“There is no way this is going to happen,” followed immediately by it happening.)To be fair, the anime can get pretty clever with its jokes, especially when the jokes are based on the secret motif. The episode where Kuromine has to pretend that the small, actual Aizawa is a figure that he made – subsequently earning him strange looks from everyone, including Aizawa – is smart because the joke not only plays off of the premise of the show but also incorporates the aspects of one of its characters.Yet it is the constant avoidance of progressing the relationships that is the most egregious. As a romance-harem anime, little progression may be expected, but Jitsu does not stall the progression. Instead, the anime actively seeks to halt the progression. Kuromine, Aizawa, and Akemi each have feelings they want to share, but the anime never gives them that chance. And even when it does, they are either conveniently interrupted by a falling giant vampire or they are misunderstood after a character falls on another. Even the writing has the characters always fumbling over their words, preventing them from forming complete sentences to get their thoughts across.In a way, this halting is the point. The anime is all about secrets. The bigger ones are revealed, such as aliens and gender-switching wolf men. The other secrets – the real feelings of the characters – never getting revealed falls in line with the anime’s own motif in that, sometimes, secrets have to be kept private.Now, the anime goes about this in a roundabout manner when just the coincidental interruptions are stopping the secrets from surfacing. Meaning, the secrets are technically kept secret not by the characters but by random bad luck. Still, having this explanation cures some of the repetition within Jitsu.Looking at the anime on a broad scale, the overarching plot is simple: Shiragami is not allowed to have her secret known to anyone. Otherwise, her father will take her out of (human) school. Hence, Kuromine keeps this and the other girls’ secrets secret for the whole season, once again following the show’s motif.Still on a broad scale, the anime does not explore a definitive theme. This is not technically a negative since the anime wanted to be nothing more than a slice-of-life comedy. But refusing to be more purposeful in its presentation is not a positive, either.On a smaller scale, there is the romantic subplot (mainly) between Kuromine and Shiragami where Shiragami’s parents mirror their relationship – a human and a vampire falling in love. Such mirroring is nice, but, since the relationship between the new (would-be) lovebirds never blossoms, the subplot serves little purpose within the anime.Going to an even smaller scale, Jitsu is mostly episodic in its presentation. Individual episodes rarely follow one another, instead focusing on slice-of-life antics. The group trying to make chocolate to save the world from an impending asteroid, Aizawa teaching Shiragami to dodge the sun’s rays by utilizing the shadows, and Shishido demonstrating pretty clearly what it means to be “grown-up” are a sampling of the events.These slice-of-life events bring about the laid-back nature of the show, keeping the mood from reaching overly dramatic levels and hence maintaining the comedy throughout the season. The final episode is the only strange one due to it not feeling like a final episode for two reasons. One, there is (yet again) not a confession between Kuromine and Shiragami. And two, not everyone is included.So while the anime works as a slice-of-life, a myriad of issues bog down the show extensively.ANIMATIONOne of the better parts of Jitsu is, surprisingly, the art and animation.Due to the wacky nature of the comedy, the actual animation has a lot of movement involved. Characters running, blood flying, and explosions exploding are rampant throughout the season. Subtler movements, for hair and for eyes, are also present. The animation itself is nothing intricate, but the animation manages to consistently stay at a high level.In terms of the artistic direction, the art is a mix of negatives and positives. On the negative side, the locations visited are nothing special. The school’s classrooms, hallways, and nearby facilities are the most common, leading to a lack of detail and diversity. Shiragami’s room is also visited but only occasionally. Rarely does the anime include places outside of the school and Shiragami’s room – an amusement park and Shiragami’s father’s house are some of the only exceptions. The camera is similar in the sense that little experimentation is done with it throughout the season. Running segments in the hallways (there are a lot of these) are as fancy as it gets.On the positive side, Jitsu places a lot of attention on the reactions of the characters. A myriad of different eyes, mouths, and faces are used constantly, improving the comedy of the anime. Lighting is also given focus: shadowing on the characters and differing light sources for the backgrounds demonstrate this.The anime also employs subtle techniques. Akane’s auras that flow around her is one such technique, and Shiragami putting the back of her hand over her mouth by instinct is another. These are small details, but they add to the overall execution of the show.But it is the characters’ designs that come out on top. Kuromine is designed as a self-insert character (bland colors and boring features), but his design does not take away from the girls of the show. The girls, in contrast to Kuromine, have vibrant colors, pretty eyes, and unique features that make them look like actual characters.For example, Shiragami’s long, green hair, two sharp fangs, and black pantyhose with skirt and blue top give the vampire a quirky yet refined look. Aizawa is another character with a nice design: her short blue hair, her tie with collared shirt, and her bolt (her alien antenna when she is seen in her small form) paint her as both the professional class representative and the alien that she is. Shishido’s design, with her chained collar (for her wolf self) and her spotted jacket (contrasting with her sexy self), further proves the strength of the characters’ designs and the overall strength of the art.CHARACTERSJitsu does not create the most compelling of characters; they are what many would say are “not well-written.” However, the anime does provide a handful of characters whose personalities fit within the confines of the show and one character whose message is something that anyone can take to heart.Starting with Kuromine’s friends – the group of three boys who silently support him from the sidelines – they exist almost exclusively to balance out the male-to-female ratio in the show. This is not to say that they are unfunny or absent throughout the season, but they do not do much outside of giving Kuromine courage from time to time and subconsciously satisfying the audience.Speaking of the main protagonist, Kuromine, as his design indicates, is a self-insert character. He is kind to everyone, he always tries to make the best out of every situation, and he has every (weird) girl in the school vying for him. His unique characteristic, however, is his inability to have a poker face. For this reason, the students call him a “Leaky Basket” for never being able to keep a secret. So it is only right that he must keep the secret of every harem member. Unfortunately, since the anime does little else with Kuromine beyond his initial introduction, and the girls outshine him in terms of comedy, his character is as lackluster as they come.Aizawa is on about the same level as Kuromine. She is an alien piloting a human-sized robot that looks just like her. She tries to maintain order through her position as class representative, but she is perhaps the most spur-of-the-moment and most chaotic person in the group.Aizawa is cute and she is fun, but her character does little else besides impede the relationship between Kuromine and Shiragami. She develops feelings for the “Leaky Basket” halfway or so through the season – due to this kindness and because he kept her secret – causing her to feel distressed, both about hurting her two best friends and about hurting herself. By the show’s end, she (internally) says she will step aside for the other two lovebirds, yet it is clear that she is not completely over her feelings.Then there is Akemi, the childhood friend of Kuromine. Yes, she has a crush on him (the common childhood trope). And, yes, she has a secret that she hides from everyone else. (Her glasses harbor a spirit of fortune who is not-so-lucky.) Her character is actually not that important and even not that relevant to the anime. All that matters with her is her glasses which caused yet another situation in which Aizawa gets to mess up the prominent pairing of Kuromine and Shiragami.It is not until Shishido arrives that the characters start to gain some traction. She is Shiragami’s childhood friend, and, coincidentally enough, she is a wolf man. When the moon shines bright (or if she even sees a picture of the moon), she changes into her male self and vice versa. Still, her most known feature is her perverted nature: She regularly puts her head under the skirts of the other girls among other lewd activities. Though this is not what makes her character better than the rest.What does make her character better is her ability to read the situation. She is able to do this because of her perverted nature. She is, as she would say, “honest with her feelings.” Where the rest of the characters try to mask their feelings or play off the emotions they are feeling, Shishido is there to point out what everyone is really thinking. She is a funny and helpful person which is about all you can ask of from a side character.Surprisingly, Shiragami is the strongest character of the show for a reason that may not seem immediately obvious. Shiragami is a vampire, or, more specifically, she is a half-vampire. She tans easily in the sun, she cannot swim, and she does not own a coffin because it is too luxurious for her. Her most defining feature, though, is how dense she is. As the characters say, this feature is why she is a perfect match for Kuromine: She is too dense to understand his painfully obvious feelings for her (“opposites attract”).This is all that Shiragami’s character is. Like the others, she does not develop as a character. She may ever-so-slightly stray away from her path – calling Kuromine by his first name is as adventurous as she gets – but, for the most part, she remains the same quirky vampire girl from start to finish.But she reveals something through her thoughts. In episode nine, Shiragami has a heart-to-heart with Kuromine where she says the following line: “It’s important to keep my secret, but I realized that there are even more important things.” When she says “important things” what she means are friends.This a beautiful sentiment. Nobody should ever be lonely in life. There are strangers to greet, people to befriend, and relationships to share. For Shiragami, her secret stopped her from having these connections. She was not able to have the kind of school life that she wanted, and, indeed, the kind of life that everyone deserves.Kuromine is the one that allows her to realize her mistake in thinking a secret is more important than enjoying life with others. And through his persistence to connect with Shiragami, Shiragami makes friends with Aizawa and then Akemi and then everyone else in the show. In other words, she finally obtains those “important things.”The anime may not have the most compelling of characters, but, at the minimum, this message that life is best spent with others is truly wonderful.SOUNDOne of the best pieces of the original soundtrack is the transition music between the A and B parts of the episode. It is not many notes, and it is only an acoustic guitar accompanied by a flute, but the simplicity of the track and its wonderful slice-of-life feel make the track a joy to hear.The rest of the OST is standard for this type of anime. Slice-of-life tunes, triumphant ensembles, and sad compositions fill the air as the anime is watched. There is a notable track, however. Technically two tracks are worth talking about, but they are the “same”: the insert song and the instrumental version of the insert song. The former is annoying. It is used way too much, it is played at strange times, and it is formed of silly English lyrics. The latter is wonderful. It is used less frequently, it is played at the perfect times, and it is formed of just simple and soft sounds.Looking at the opening theme, it is a fun track which the water-droplet effect at the very beginning flags. The first half is somewhat mellow, contrasting nicely with Jitsu’s usually rambunctious self. The second half of the track still maintains the same pacing, but it chooses to ramp up the instruments and the vocals while also changing up the base beat. The track ends how it started, giving it a welcomed full-circle effect.The ending theme is arguably not just the best track among all of the music but also the best part of the entire anime. It is a hip-hop track, although, instead going fast and hard with the lyrics, the track slows everything down. The track itself is meant to reflect how much more fun everything is in a group (following the theme from Shiragami) which is corroborated by both the change in mood in the second half of the track and the visuals. Alongside the rhyming, the background singers, and the extremely catchy beat, the ED is a wonderful track to listen to both in and out of the anime. (Plus, it is fun to sing the “jitsu wa watshi wa” lyric.)As for the voice acting performances, they were fantastic, reaching the same level of quality as the ED. Yuu Serizawa as Shiragami does not have too many anime under her belt (approximately twenty), but she gives the cute vampire an innocent and charming voice. Inori Minase as Aizawa has been in more anime, using her slightly tomboyish voice to fit the “Iron Lady” extremely well. And Natsuki Hanae as Kuromine is just as formidable, providing the main protagonist with a lot of screaming and straining. Also, a special shout-out to Mao Ichimichi as Akane for giving the little devil a sinister yet adorable way of speaking.ENJOYMENTIt makes me a bit sad that this one did not reach a higher level of popularity because, regardless of its faults, this is still an entertaining show.I was drawn to this one due to the romance stuff. This anime is saturated in blushing, flirting, and loving, so many of the jokes – no matter how repetitive – were always making me laugh. Simple stuff like Shiragami sitting close to Kuromine when Shishido got clingy, and Kuromine and Shiragami’s private moment at the pool at night, made my heart flutter.The characters themselves were rather fun, too. Shiragami acting all cute when Kuromine was there to support her and be her friend. Aizawa always misunderstanding everything and her running gag with her “Memory Erasure Device.” Shishido caring about nothing but sexy or perverted acts.But if I am being honest, I did not particularly care much for Akemi due in part to her mean-spirited attitude towards Kuromine. I get that she was using a “teasing him so much because she likes him” mentality, and she does become less frustrating later on in the season. But the frequency of her meanness in the beginning made me dislike her. Luckily, the other girls make up for her annoyance handily enough.As for the other characters, I found Kuromine’s other friends to be fine, but Akane and Akari were right alongside Shiragami and the other funny girls. Akane and Akari’s constant bickering and insults and abuse towards each other was really funny to me because of just how far they would take it, like Akari throwing Akane by the horns or Akane blowing up Akari’s newly-purchased car.Jitsu wa Watashi wa is a comedy-fantasy-romance-school-shounen-supernatural anime, but that does not mean one should automatically discount its contents. The sound work is strong, the character designs are vibrant, and the main message of the characters is beautiful. Of course, this does not make up for the repetitive writing and the simplistic characters. At the same time, this does not take away from the laughs the show has in store. Putting it another way, it should come as no surprise – as no secret – that this one is just plain fun.SUMMARYStory: Bad, misunderstandings galore, gross repetition, and problems on each scale of the narrative obfuscate some of the cleverness the plot holdsAnimation: Good, above average actual animation, a mix of strong and weak artistic direction, and nice character designsCharacters: Fine, Kuromine, Shiragami, and the rest of the cast are individually bland, but their group’s message that life is better with friends is a beautiful mantraSound: Good, good OP, great ED, okay OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, lots of romance combined with fun characters create a high amount of entertainmentFinal Score: 6/10 know.

By the show’s end, she (internally) says she will step aside for the other two lovebirds, yet it is clear that she is not completely over her feelings.Then there is Akemi, the childhood friend of Kuromine. Yes, she has a crush on him (the common childhood trope). And, yes, she has a secret that she hides from everyone else. (Her glasses harbor a spirit of fortune who is not-so-lucky.) Her character is actually not that important and even not that relevant to the anime. All that matters with her is her glasses which caused yet another situation in which Aizawa gets to mess up the prominent pairing of Kuromine and Shiragami.It is not until Shishido arrives that the characters start to gain some traction. She is Shiragami’s childhood friend, and, coincidentally enough, she is a wolf man. When the moon shines bright (or if she even sees a picture of the moon), she changes into her male self and vice versa. Still, her most known feature is her perverted nature: She regularly puts her head under the skirts of the other girls among other lewd activities. Though this is not what makes her character better than the rest.What does make her character better is her ability to read the situation. She is able to do this because of her perverted nature. She is, as she would say, “honest with her feelings.” Where the rest of the characters try to mask their feelings or play off the emotions they are feeling, Shishido is there to point out what everyone is really thinking. She is a funny and helpful person which is about all you can ask of from a side character.Surprisingly, Shiragami is the strongest character of the show for a reason that may not seem immediately obvious. Shiragami is a vampire, or, more specifically, she is a half-vampire. She tans easily in the sun, she cannot swim, and she does not own a coffin because it is too luxurious for her. Her most defining feature, though, is how dense she is. As the characters say, this feature is why she is a perfect match for Kuromine: She is too dense to understand his painfully obvious feelings for her (“opposites attract”).This is all that Shiragami’s character is. Like the others, she does not develop as a character. She may ever-so-slightly stray away from her path – calling Kuromine by his first name is as adventurous as she gets – but, for the most part, she remains the same quirky vampire girl from start to finish.But she reveals something through her thoughts. In episode nine, Shiragami has a heart-to-heart with Kuromine where she says the following line: “It’s important to keep my secret, but I realized that there are even more important things.” When she says “important things” what she means are friends.This a beautiful sentiment. Nobody should ever be lonely in life. There are strangers to greet, people to befriend, and relationships to share. For Shiragami, her secret stopped her from having these connections. She was not able to have the kind of school life that she wanted, and, indeed, the kind of life that everyone deserves.Kuromine is the one that allows her to realize her mistake in thinking a secret is more important than enjoying life with others. And through his persistence to connect with Shiragami, Shiragami makes friends with Aizawa and then Akemi and then everyone else in the show. In other words, she finally obtains those “important things.”The anime may not have the most compelling of characters, but, at the minimum, this message that life is best spent with others is truly wonderful.SOUNDOne of the best pieces of the original soundtrack is the transition music between the A and B parts of the episode. It is not many notes, and it is only an acoustic guitar accompanied by a flute, but the simplicity of the track and its wonderful slice-of-life feel make the track a joy to hear.The rest of the OST is standard for this type of anime. Slice-of-life tunes, triumphant ensembles, and sad compositions fill the air as the anime is watched. There is a notable track, however. Technically two tracks are worth talking about, but they are the “same”: the insert song and the instrumental version of the insert song. The former is annoying. It is used way too much, it is played at strange times, and it is formed of silly English lyrics. The latter is wonderful. It is used less frequently, it is played at the perfect times, and it is formed of just simple and soft sounds.Looking at the opening theme, it is a fun track which the water-droplet effect at the very beginning flags. The first half is somewhat mellow, contrasting nicely with Jitsu’s usually rambunctious self. The second half of the track still maintains the same pacing, but it chooses to ramp up the instruments and the vocals while also changing up the base beat. The track ends how it started, giving it a welcomed full-circle effect.The ending theme is arguably not just the best track among all of the music but also the best part of the entire anime. It is a hip-hop track, although, instead going fast and hard with the lyrics, the track slows everything down. The track itself is meant to reflect how much more fun everything is in a group (following the theme from Shiragami) which is corroborated by both the change in mood in the second half of the track and the visuals. Alongside the rhyming, the background singers, and the extremely catchy beat, the ED is a wonderful track to listen to both in and out of the anime. (Plus, it is fun to sing the “jitsu wa watshi wa” lyric.)As for the voice acting performances, they were fantastic, reaching the same level of quality as the ED. Yuu Serizawa as Shiragami does not have too many anime under her belt (approximately twenty), but she gives the cute vampire an innocent and charming voice. Inori Minase as Aizawa has been in more anime, using her slightly tomboyish voice to fit the “Iron Lady” extremely well. And Natsuki Hanae as Kuromine is just as formidable, providing the main protagonist with a lot of screaming and straining. Also, a special shout-out to Mao Ichimichi as Akane for giving the little devil a sinister yet adorable way of speaking.ENJOYMENTIt makes me a bit sad that this one did not reach a higher level of popularity because, regardless of its faults, this is still an entertaining show.I was drawn to this one due to the romance stuff. This anime is saturated in blushing, flirting, and loving, so many of the jokes – no matter how repetitive – were always making me laugh. Simple stuff like Shiragami sitting close to Kuromine when Shishido got clingy, and Kuromine and Shiragami’s private moment at the pool at night, made my heart flutter.The characters themselves were rather fun, too. Shiragami acting all cute when Kuromine was there to support her and be her friend. Aizawa always misunderstanding everything and her running gag with her “Memory Erasure Device.” Shishido caring about nothing but sexy or perverted acts.But if I am being honest, I did not particularly care much for Akemi due in part to her mean-spirited attitude towards Kuromine. I get that she was using a “teasing him so much because she likes him” mentality, and she does become less frustrating later on in the season. But the frequency of her meanness in the beginning made me dislike her. Luckily, the other girls make up for her annoyance handily enough.As for the other characters, I found Kuromine’s other friends to be fine, but Akane and Akari were right alongside Shiragami and the other funny girls. Akane and Akari’s constant bickering and insults and abuse towards each other was really funny to me because of just how far they would take it, like Akari throwing Akane by the horns or Akane blowing up Akari’s newly-purchased car.Jitsu wa Watashi wa is a comedy-fantasy-romance-school-shounen-supernatural anime, but that does not mean one should automatically discount its contents. The sound work is strong, the character designs are vibrant, and the main message of the characters is beautiful. Of course, this does not make up for the repetitive writing and the simplistic characters. At the same time, this does not take away from the laughs the show has in store. Putting it another way, it should come as no surprise – as no secret – that this one is just plain fun.SUMMARYStory: Bad, misunderstandings galore, gross repetition, and problems on each scale of the narrative obfuscate some of the cleverness the plot holdsAnimation: Good, above average actual animation, a mix of strong and weak artistic direction, and nice character designsCharacters: Fine, Kuromine, Shiragami, and the rest of the cast are individually bland, but their group’s message that life is better with friends is a beautiful mantraSound: Good, good OP, great ED, okay OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, lots of romance combined with fun characters create a high amount of entertainmentFinal Score: 6/10', ""Jitsu wa Watashi wa (Actually I am...)To be honest with you all, I never expected to see such decent anime from the summer-season (Heat Season for Ecchi anime) of 2015 like this one.Okay. Let's be honest with ourselves. Arts for Jitsu wa Watashi wa was poor. There were number of my mates who thought the anime was going to be crap just by seeing the arts and genre under it, which was 'Romance' and 'Ecchi' and 'Comedy' and 'Vampires'.Oooh, is it going to be 'Twilight' all over again......

The story seems to take on tropes from other anime and could almost be considered a reverse Rosario to Vampire.Jitsu wa Watashi wa is set in an ordinary High School. Kuromine Asahi is known as a leaky basket to his friends because he is such an open book that he's unable to convincingly tell a lie. For the longest time, he has had feelings for Shiragami Youko who's one of his classmates. After a bunch of encouragement from his friends, he decides to try to confess to her after school.

While I can't say it totally fails at any of these things, it certainly doesn't excel at any of them. If you want to explore this setting further you should just get the manga. I give it a strong 6."", 'If you are romantic comedy fan like me -or even if you are not- you might have wondered what happens when two dense people fall in love with each other...The answer is simple: Jistsu wa  Watashi wa or \'Actually I am\' in English. This anime provides the EXACT answer to the question above- oh by the way it is an adaptation of a manga by the same name. Weird beginning? Check. Semi-introduction? Check. Informative information (doesn\'t have to make sense)? Check.Oh well I think I should be able to start reviewing now.Story 6/10.Since you probably already the story, there is no need for...me to try your patience and time rephrasing it.It is gonna take a better fanboy than I am to lie about the greatness of this story. It is no great at all. Basically Asahi (the guy) finds out the secret of his crush, and gets closer to her because of that. [Sounds kinda like Kaichou wa maid-sama]The two selling points however, is that the main character- whose name is Asahi I think- cannot tell a lie. Oh and that the female MC (forgotten her name) is even more dense than the already dense Asahi Kuromine.Now that I think of it, the plot development is not really bad; about one or two fillers in the entire show.[Side note] the plot seems comparable to that of Rosario + Vampire.Art 9/10Humorous.Aah, that is definitely the best way to describe it. The only thing that makes the cliche scenes tolerable are the expressions shown by the characters. You will love them. Trust me.Characters 5/10I am going to be brutally honest here: It is like the author copied and pasted random stereotypical anime characters. None of them are original whatsoever.To prove my point here are some of them:-Dense MC (x2)-Childhood friend who torments the mc.-Harsh TsundereI am not sure that if I said the characters\' names it won\'t count as spoilers.Asahi Kuromine (main character) is genuinely likeable.

GOING!', 'This is a fairly lighthearted comedy anime with a vampire and a bit of romance in it. Jt js worth watching for a comedy, some genuinely hilarious episodes, slightly unusual art style and because of Nagisa Azawa. Comedy is a bit on a blunt side, but is still entertaining.Detailed breakdown below.Story:The main reason for watching this is comedy. Comedy sorta reminded me of ""Gintama humor"", in the sense that comedic scenes often features one character freaking out or overreacting to something, while others are desperately trying to diffuse situation. Unlike gintama, jokes are fairly tame. At least one episode was incredibly funny. So the main...point of interest in this anime is laughs.Art:The art style is a bit unusual - characters feature fairly big, or should I say ""tall"" rounded eyes. It sorta reminded me of Urusei Yatsura and 1980s animes like Gunbuster, but at the same time there are elements of newer ""spikier"" style used in modern animes with faster, bolder lines (hope this still make sense) and triangular faces. Basically this slight quirk allows creation of very charming and innocent/amusing-looking characters. Animation is fairly fluid too. Characters and backgrounds aren\'t INCREDIBLY detailed, but they work great for the style selected.Sound:Interesting intro song, and some nice music in this anime. Also, Seiyuu voicing Nagisa Azawa did absolutely amazing job.Character:The most memorable character in the series is Nagisa Azawa. As far as I can tell, she is either supposed to be a ""Tsundere"" or ""Straight-laced"" girl, but her freaking out and overreacting looks cute, amusing and natural, and in the end she doesn\'t really fit into any archetype. Main duo is less interesting than Nagisa, and resemble archetypes more. Yoko is a classic ditz, while Asashi is a guy who is a bit clueless. In the end, even though characters were probably based on one or another cliche, their interactions look very interesting, due to heavy focus on comedy.Enjoyment:I found it to be very entertaining. One of the first episodes had me laughing, which doesn\'t happen often with the recent anime. I liked the art style (this minor detail with eyes added quite a lot of charm to the anime), and enjoyed watching Nagisa-related scenes. Basically, it was entertaining, funny and occasionally even hilarious.Overall:A solid comedy that is worth a watch. However, it never gets dark, and never really deals with any ""heavy"" subjects, so it is mostly worth watching if you want lighthearted fun. For ""heavy stuff"" you\'ll need something else. point of interest in this anime is laughs.Art:The art style is a bit unusual - characters feature fairly big, or should I say ""tall"" rounded eyes.

This show falls into the comedic harem genre as a semi-modern twist on Karin, where the protagonist was the heroine. This show is pretty out there with many crazy developments and ridiculous, comedic situations, but probably won\'t satisfy those who need concrete relationship progress or those looking for ecchi.In the show, we follow our protagonist, Asahi, who is literally an open book and can never...lie. He has a longtime crush on the quiet beauty in the class, Youko. However, when he goes to confess, he learns that she is in fact a vampire, and must now do everything he can to keep the secret or else she has to transfer out. Will he be able to hide this mega scoop from his childhood friend, the school newspaper president?I found the show a fun ride, perhaps mostly for the nostalgic ""do I really like him?"" element that is missing from the instant girlfriend harems of today. That said, it\'s definitely a goofy show with a lot of impractical elements I\'d say are comparable with the crazy latter half of Seto no Hanayome. If you\'re looking for a harem that is more focused on comedy than actual character development, here\'s your show.Animation:The animation in this show is rather unique. There are multiple aspects that would make this blend in as a show from the late 2000s; for example, the show has a rather saturated color palette and the character styling is also a bit dated with extra-bold eye liner- everything just looks a tad silly. The characters themselves aren\'t my choice for cutest design or styling; that said they are pretty unique in both appearance and ""special traits""- it will make sense once you watch it.In terms of action, there are some comedic chases but nothing to really get excited over. There is a bit of ecchi, especially later in the show with the introduction of the perverted Shiho. That said, with the likes of the latest iteration of DxD and Maou Testament, I\'ve grown completely immune to the level of ecchi here.Sound:The show opens with a playful guy song, though I don\'t particularly like the vocals or the verse transitions. The ED is a calm, light rap piece that I didn\'t particularly fancy either. The most memorable music piece of this show is the insert song Hologram, which plays in various instrumentations to fit the mood (the original electronic version is most clearly heard in episode 5). The BGM is otherwise supportive but not memorable.The VA cast is relatively junior. This is Yuu Serizawa\'s first major role that I\'ve heard, and she\'s sporting a Kansai accent. Inori Minase has been around awhile though this is also the largest role that I\'ve seen from her as well. Reina Ueda\'s role is interesting in that her character\'s personality is the exact opposite of what I saw in Taimadou, I didn\'t particularly like her character here though. I also paid a bit of attention to Mao, the school chairperson, as she\'s apparently going to be in like everything in the upcoming season. Honestly, I think the VA performance was relatively average here.Story:The show is fairly similar in plot progression as in Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. Basically, there is a central plotline that follows Asahi and Youko in their daily lives, which apparently become a lot more interesting after their meeting. The wild circus ride is pretty episodic and mostly just goofing off until the last few episodes. There we find a bit of rising action that quickly tapers off after an extremely predictable climax.Given the heavily supernatural aspect of this show and the sheer randomness of certain scenes, I consider this an extremely light harem, to the extent that it might be more fitting just to call it a romantic comedy. Don\'t take the show too seriously as there\'d be no way the characters\' secrets wouldn\'t have gotten out eventually given the way they act throughout the show.Character:If I were voting purely based on the amount of fun the characters have, this show would rate pretty highly. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near as strong in terms of actual development. Asahi is a dated protagonist who is (fill in your typical protagonist characteristics from the late 2000s here) nice, shy, weak, and completely unable to admit his feelings. He meets our vampire, Youko, who is actually very outgoing and playful, but suppresses her desires so that her secret doesn\'t get out. Unfortunately for him, she is slow when it comes to love and thus can\'t figure out Asahi\'s feelings despite his inability to hide his true feelings. There is perhaps a bit of a nice timeline parallel with Youko\'s parents made in the middle of the show but it doesn\'t come out to anything in this season.In addition to not making much progress relationship-wise, the show also has too many of the crazy-type in the supporting list. You have the childhood friend who apparently isn\'t disciplined despite bullying others for news stories and the mischievous school president who only answers to her relative, who happens to be Asahi\'s homeroom teacher, Akari.Value:Though there were some fun moments in the show, it\'s a bit juvenile in tonality overall. And I wish they had made a bit more progress in their actual relationships. If you\'re looking for comedy with a more modern and cute flair, I\'d consider Nisekoi to be a superior choice. If you\'re browsing for the vampire twist, I think Karin is still a better choice for actual character development.

It does not do quite enough to stand out from the rest, but it has enough character to not just feel like a carbon copy. Enjoyable, if you find the genre enjoyable, possibly underwhelming or disappointing if you don\'t.Story: 6Boy meets girl. Boy is dense, girl is dense. Harem are attracted to his ineffectual, yet kind ways. Hijinks ensue. You\'ve earnestly seen it all before, perhaps better, but do not let that keep you away otherwise. While the story definitely taps into ecchi waters (The Were-person character), I actually think this series is...a little sweeter than it is perverted (although, again, it is that too). The story is rather lacking in most senses, it\'s just a light school romance anime, that so happens to have paranormal girls in it. The show does not go much further than that, and the romance is never romanticized (bad sentence, but the best way I can describe it). It is ""sweet"", instead of""melodramatic"", and perhaps ""silly"" over ""funny"". I kind of watched it as an endearing copy of ""Rosario,"" and the like.Art: 8I don\'t really think any particular part stood out to shock and awe me, but it is just overall a good looking anime. Not terrifically full of budget shots, nothing too distracting for complaints.Sound: 7I don\'t really cover sound in my reviews, I do not think this section should only mean a review of the OP and ED music, but as I do not speak Japanese, any of the nuances in the voice acting are lost on me, and I am not musically trained, so the soundtrack to an anime series can only ever be registered as good background effect, of which almost all anime succeeds when the series is good enough.Character: 7As with all harem comedies, the characters all fall into their types, and it\'s hard to suggest any character truly stood out as being unique. Although I of course came to enjoy all the characters, I\'ve enjoyed their counterparts in a hundred other shows, so I gave it a 7 for keeping the status quo.Enjoyment: 8All that being said, I\'m a sucker for a sweet romance filled with laughs, so I enjoyed it just fine. It was losing me a bit at the end (the modern trend of never having a character actually progress in their declaration of love serves only to irritate me, but I understand why they keep writing it) but I laughed in probably every episode, so worth it.Overall: 7Overall, not a bad show, not a great show. A solid ""B"" series, getting ""awws,"" and ""lols,"" in equal measure from me as a viewer. As mentioned earlier, if you dig these kind of animes, you\'ll probably enjoy yourself. If you\'re not a fan of these cookie-cutter type series, probably steer clear.Recommendations:1. Rosario to Vampire. Same GENERAL idea as ""Jitsu wa Watashi wa,"" in that they\'re romantic comedies set in a school with a paranormal harem. Rosario is much more ecchi (as mentioned earlier) and Jitsu is a bit more sweet, and slice-of-lifey.2. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. You lose the school element, but you still retain the general premise of a slice-of-life comedic romance with a cast of paranormal females pursuing a normal, male human.3. Seto no Hanayome. While I think Hanayome is the superior title, both kind of revolve around the same principle of paranormal romance set against the backdrop of a overbearing paranormal father with gangster vibes (although Hanayome is explicitly so, and Jitsu is implicit, such as the scene where her father, while cleaning a katana, has the Wolf-person go out on a job). a little sweeter than it is perverted (although, again, it is that too).

If you\'d like to stop at the SPOILER-FREE section, go right ahead, if you want to keep trucking along, feel free to.Let me start off this review by breaking down my feelings of this anime into a simple description:This anime is pretty much a mediocre reverse Rosario + Vampire, where the monsters go to a human school and it\'s THEIR secret of being monsters that need to be kept secret, especially the main love interest, who is a bubbly, ditzy vampire girl.Now that that\'s out of the way,...let\'s get on with the review proper.STORY: (I *will* be describing the plot for the sake of highlighting an element that I feel went unused)Kuromine Asahi is a nice enough guy, going to high school, hanging out with friends, etc. However, he\'s become infamous for being unable to keep secrets to save his life, and everyone knows it!However, since he doesn\'t get bullied or picked on for it, that\'s not really all that big a deal for him personally. Sure, he might feel bad that he\'s never let in on the joke or trusted to keep his lips zipped, but he\'s overall accepted it.Unfortunately, that all changes when his little lime-haired crush, Youko Shiragami, turns out to be a vampire in disguise. What\'s especially dangerous is the fact that she\'s taken on an agreement with her father to come home should she be found out, which is something that neither she, nor Kuromine wants.You would think that with a plot like this, KNOWING that Asahi has been built up as an incompetent confidant would pay off with some good comedic bits and maybe even a bending of tropes by letting secondary characters in on it, stopping him from slipping up, right? Nope, regardless of this little quirk of his, Asahi never manages to let her secret slip unless he\'s speaking to another monster, which is incredibly boring and very disappointing.And of course, this is a harem show too, much like Rosario + Vampire, with a cold, yet endearing secondary love interest with cool-colored hair, a master of sexual promiscuity, and a mischief-maker involved in the harem. I\'m describing them fairly basically, but none of the harem are at all as near-identical to their R+V counterparts as Youko is to Moka.Not to mention there are teachers with somewhat quirky attitudes, basic and generic episodic harem plots, and a finale that isn\'t really all that grand, but still kinda beats out the rest of the series in quality.Overall, the story is fine enough on its own, but it got dragged down by all the parallels I was able to draw between it and Rosario + Vampire.That said, though, I did watch it all the way through and enjoyed it more than R+V, mostly because it doesn\'t have NEARLY as much annoying fanservice.ART:The art is pretty good, easily the show\'s best quality, in my opinion. Since it\'s a slice of life show, it\'s laid back and slower than what you\'d probably get from an action show, which is probably a good thing. Because if Youko launched into the air and tried to kick someone, my brain would instantly super-impose Inner Moka\'s ""Know your place"" catchphrase onto the scene.SOUND:Again, pretty good. I don\'t recall the OP or ED, but I think I remember being fine with them overall and with slice of life shows like this, I don\'t normally pay the music any mind, but with it being what it\'s supposed to be, background music, I think it did well.CHARACTER:Okay, time for a little game I like to call Rosario + Vampire or Not! The object of the game? Find as many parallels as you can!A main love interest who is a sweet, bubbly vampire on a crash course for the protagonist? CHECK!A perverted werewolf that has a penchant from promiscuous actions? CHECK!A mischievous character that doesn\'t have a snowballs chance in hell of being with the protag? CHECK! Or we could go with the idea of a mischief-making loli as well, which also fits the parallel! CHECKITY CHECK!!A monster boy that acts like a total street punk and tries to fight the protag? CHECK!A constant need for the main cast to keep a secret for the sake of one of the main characters? CHECK!I could go on, but I think you get the idea.ENJOYMENT:I enjoyed this anime well enough, enjoying the characters present, with the exception of Akemi Mikan and that stupid spirit inside her glasses. She constantly torments and embarrasses the main protagonist, which doesn\'t exactly give her chances of winning his heart very good odds.There\'s a point in the anime where she\'s feeling down and wistfully thinking about the protag, clearly wanting to be with him, but there comes a time where I can\'t help feeling like Asahi should\'ve called off any minute semblance of friendship the two have. Sadly, Asahi\'s kind of a pushover, as harem protags often tend to be.Regardless, the episodic plots, though somewhat generic, do have some highlights, especially when the principal of the school is brought into the limelight. She can be pretty hilarious when she wants to be.OVERALL:As I said, I enjoyed this fairly enough, but it could really be forgettable if not for the R+V comparison. Asahi is just another nice guy protag that becomes an utter pushover whenever any of the girls are involved, but he\'s totally got that inner courage to stand up to others for their sakes. Youko is pretty ditzy sometimes, especially when the most creative thing about her, her explanation of vampires, gets exploited for gags. Mikan is worst girl, period. Nagisa Aizawa is fairly creative from an surface level, but she\'s at heart a kind of typical alien character. The plot is basic and disappointing in some aspects and I wish the series the best in its original form.(SPOILERS SECTION!! LET\'S PLAY ONE LAST ROUND OF ROSARIO VAMPIRE OR NOT TO WRAP THINGS UP!!)So as things begin to get dramatic near the end of the series, Asahi has a misunderstanding about Youko and she disappears off to her home, making everyone think that she\'s been found out and has to leave the school. Asahi\'s intentions are laid bare to chase after her and bring her back even if he has to meet her father to do it. Some characters object, and he even finds an obstacle or two along the way, but he eventually arrives at her home and has an encounter with Youko\'s father, Mr. Big Bad Vampire Dad, but ultimately convinces him to let her return.Now, the parallel in this regard isn\'t perfect, in Rosario Vampire, the finale had Moka\'s rosary be used to save the school from being discovered, thus making Surface Moka disappear, leaving only her true self. After a little while, Tsukune decides to see her father to have him make a new Rosary so he can have his bubbly main love interest back.The obstacles Tsukune has to face along the way are the parents of Kurumu and Mizore, trying to force Tsukune to marry their respective daughters, but he makes it and straight-up struggles with Moka\'s father for the rosary.In Actually, I Am! Asahi has a misunderstanding about the circumstances of Youko\'s departure, that she was actually visiting her father who had come down with a fever or something, and it\'s only really after Asahi accidentally spills the beans about knowing about Youko\'s secret that things get rough. The obstacles that Asahi faces are mostly from Nagisa trying to stop him from pursuing her because she totes loves him. And the encounter with Youko\'s father is more akin to a big chase scene, which is more comedic in nature.These parallels to Rosario Vampire are kind of my main reason for making this review, and though I stand by those comparisons, I still think I overall enjoyed this more than R+V. Mostly because the anime of R+V fucking sucks when compared to its source material. let\'s get on with the review proper.STORY: (I *will* be describing the plot for the sake of highlighting an element that I feel went unused)Kuromine Asahi is a nice enough guy, going to high school, hanging out with friends, etc. However, he\'s become infamous for being unable to keep secrets to save his life, and everyone knows it!However, since he doesn\'t get bullied or picked on for it, that\'s not really all that big a deal for him personally. Sure, he might feel bad that he\'s never let in on the joke or trusted to keep his lips zipped, but he\'s overall accepted it.Unfortunately, that all changes when his little lime-haired crush, Youko Shiragami, turns out to be a vampire in disguise. What\'s especially dangerous is the fact that she\'s taken on an agreement with her father to come home should she be found out, which is something that neither she, nor Kuromine wants.You would think that with a plot like this, KNOWING that Asahi has been built up as an incompetent confidant would pay off with some good comedic bits and maybe even a bending of tropes by letting secondary characters in on it, stopping him from slipping up, right? Nope, regardless of this little quirk of his, Asahi never manages to let her secret slip unless he\'s speaking to another monster, which is incredibly boring and very disappointing.And of course, this is a harem show too, much like Rosario + Vampire, with a cold, yet endearing secondary love interest with cool-colored hair, a master of sexual promiscuity, and a mischief-maker involved in the harem. I\'m describing them fairly basically, but none of the harem are at all as near-identical to their R+V counterparts as Youko is to Moka.Not to mention there are teachers with somewhat quirky attitudes, basic and generic episodic harem plots, and a finale that isn\'t really all that grand, but still kinda beats out the rest of the series in quality.Overall, the story is fine enough on its own, but it got dragged down by all the parallels I was able to draw between it and Rosario + Vampire.That said, though, I did watch it all the way through and enjoyed it more than R+V, mostly because it doesn\'t have NEARLY as much annoying fanservice.ART:The art is pretty good, easily the show\'s best quality, in my opinion. Since it\'s a slice of life show, it\'s laid back and slower than what you\'d probably get from an action show, which is probably a good thing. Because if Youko launched into the air and tried to kick someone, my brain would instantly super-impose Inner Moka\'s ""Know your place"" catchphrase onto the scene.SOUND:Again, pretty good. I don\'t recall the OP or ED, but I think I remember being fine with them overall and with slice of life shows like this, I don\'t normally pay the music any mind, but with it being what it\'s supposed to be, background music, I think it did well.CHARACTER:Okay, time for a little game I like to call Rosario + Vampire or Not! The object of the game? Find as many parallels as you can!A main love interest who is a sweet, bubbly vampire on a crash course for the protagonist? CHECK!A perverted werewolf that has a penchant from promiscuous actions? CHECK!A mischievous character that doesn\'t have a snowballs chance in hell of being with the protag? CHECK! Or we could go with the idea of a mischief-making loli as well, which also fits the parallel! CHECKITY CHECK!!A monster boy that acts like a total street punk and tries to fight the protag? CHECK!A constant need for the main cast to keep a secret for the sake of one of the main characters? CHECK!I could go on, but I think you get the idea.ENJOYMENT:I enjoyed this anime well enough, enjoying the characters present, with the exception of Akemi Mikan and that stupid spirit inside her glasses. She constantly torments and embarrasses the main protagonist, which doesn\'t exactly give her chances of winning his heart very good odds.There\'s a point in the anime where she\'s feeling down and wistfully thinking about the protag, clearly wanting to be with him, but there comes a time where I can\'t help feeling like Asahi should\'ve called off any minute semblance of friendship the two have. Sadly, Asahi\'s kind of a pushover, as harem protags often tend to be.Regardless, the episodic plots, though somewhat generic, do have some highlights, especially when the principal of the school is brought into the limelight. She can be pretty hilarious when she wants to be.OVERALL:As I said, I enjoyed this fairly enough, but it could really be forgettable if not for the R+V comparison. Asahi is just another nice guy protag that becomes an utter pushover whenever any of the girls are involved, but he\'s totally got that inner courage to stand up to others for their sakes. Youko is pretty ditzy sometimes, especially when the most creative thing about her, her explanation of vampires, gets exploited for gags. Mikan is worst girl, period. Nagisa Aizawa is fairly creative from an surface level, but she\'s at heart a kind of typical alien character. The plot is basic and disappointing in some aspects and I wish the series the best in its original form.(SPOILERS SECTION!! LET\'S PLAY ONE LAST ROUND OF ROSARIO VAMPIRE OR NOT TO WRAP THINGS UP!!)So as things begin to get dramatic near the end of the series, Asahi has a misunderstanding about Youko and she disappears off to her home, making everyone think that she\'s been found out and has to leave the school. Asahi\'s intentions are laid bare to chase after her and bring her back even if he has to meet her father to do it. Some characters object, and he even finds an obstacle or two along the way, but he eventually arrives at her home and has an encounter with Youko\'s father, Mr. Big Bad Vampire Dad, but ultimately convinces him to let her return.Now, the parallel in this regard isn\'t perfect, in Rosario Vampire, the finale had Moka\'s rosary be used to save the school from being discovered, thus making Surface Moka disappear, leaving only her true self. After a little while, Tsukune decides to see her father to have him make a new Rosary so he can have his bubbly main love interest back.The obstacles Tsukune has to face along the way are the parents of Kurumu and Mizore, trying to force Tsukune to marry their respective daughters, but he makes it and straight-up struggles with Moka\'s father for the rosary.In Actually, I Am! Asahi has a misunderstanding about the circumstances of Youko\'s departure, that she was actually visiting her father who had come down with a fever or something, and it\'s only really after Asahi accidentally spills the beans about knowing about Youko\'s secret that things get rough. The obstacles that Asahi faces are mostly from Nagisa trying to stop him from pursuing her because she totes loves him. And the encounter with Youko\'s father is more akin to a big chase scene, which is more comedic in nature.These parallels to Rosario Vampire are kind of my main reason for making this review, and though I stand by those comparisons, I still think I overall enjoyed this more than R+V.

Best girl is Akane the horned demon girl. She is cute, sweet and sadistic.The show is a harem style comedic romance that has some great attributes. Firstly, the girls realise the harem lifestyle cannot happen so some push where others don't. Although it exists it is not blatantly obvious to the male lead. Secondly, although the male lead is oblivious to the most obvious advances by most of the girls he is also very set on a single girl throughout the show regardless of the past.It is nice to...see one that has a harem in a more realistic format but would be better had the lead been not so dumb.The art of the show is very nice and the art is consistent throughout the show. The OP skirt flick is pretty good too.The OP is great and catchy. ED is also good. General sounds are well done and support the show. Akane has a great voice actor.A variety of types for the girls exist.Youko our vampire girl is very cute but very much as stupid romantically as the male lead making for an interesting dynamic.Akane the horned demon girl who is obsessed with sweet things and is also sadistic as a demon is great.Mikan the childhood friend and heathen queen is unusual in that her feelings aren't so obviously known and it is great that she is able to actually hide it more or less. A silent harem member wanting to not ruin her friendship.Shiho the wolfman is difficult. Knowing that such an easy change turns her back into the male wolfman kind of loses her appeal as a woman but she is also very attractive and a fun pervy character that is consistent in her actions throughout.Asahi the main male character is read like a book with his feelings too honest which should have made his confession easier to see but yet not so because Youko is like a female him in that sense.Nagisa who tore Asahi down before is pretty cool. She is a very attractive girl with an interesting story. An OVA of her home would have been interesting.Touko the gem you see at the end properly as an adult being Youko's mum is a star. She is a cute design in the yukata and has the typical ruling mother attitude of the anime industry.Overall the show is very enjoyable. I know the Manga has the ending we all want so definitely reading that too.It is an enjoyable show that most will enjoy and episodes 11, 12, 13 on the synopsis read as super serious but is actually played out with the same energy of the show from before. see one that has a harem in a more realistic format but would be better had the lead been not so dumb.The art of the show is very nice and the art is consistent throughout the show.

Anyways onto the review.Story - 4The story is well, if I had to put it in words, decent.

Well... Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa's wasn't that bad, I mean... It was pretty ok, but still, absolutely nothing happened. Seriously, if they do a second season... please Asahi, confess already.Anyways, this anime kinda felt like some kind of To Love Ru but without ecchi (you know, couse every girl had a different thing n stuff). The characters were ok and the art style it's creepy as fuck at times. The story was acceptable and it had some good comedy in it, pretty predictable tho. I loved the opening btw, I'll give...em that. So, If you're into typical harem series, you should give this one a try em that. So, If you're into typical harem series, you should give this one a try"", ""It's a fun show to watch, but that is really it. There is no deeper dive into what could be potentially a better series as the show misses its mark.Specifically, the characters have basically little to no depth to them with so many side characters all of them have no back story or anything. Even the main characters their back stories are not touched much really it's enough to get an idea, but I didn't find very much value from them. Along with best girl, Class Rep, while she probably had more air time than most her story is barely touched on. It overall...felt the characters were rather lacking in making them have their own personalities and characteristics enough for them to stand out including the main characters.The biggest different between this show becoming another average school harem romcom was the non-human aspect, but this show seems to pretty much almost ignore that aspect and it is quite a shame since that would easily be a big appeal. In addition the world building was lack luster as the show focuses on the few individuals mostly and scenarios involving them.Sound was rather odd. The OP and ED along with music throughout the show sounded like something you would listen to on the radio. A modern sound sometimes even EDM style soundtracks would play in the episode and in my opinion they did not fit with the scenes. I liked the ED though and the OP ended up growing on me, but again they felt more like normal music you would hear.Comedy is where this show is strongest in, but even in that regards I found the jokes to be a bit lackluster. There was something about the delivery in many of them that felt rather weak and could have been better. The reactions were definitely superb and where I would say the show did an amazing job they were very expressive without a dull moment.The MC is unfortunately not that great in my view. He over reacts to everything and seems to have not many redeeming qualities besides existing or the occasional persistance in helping sometimes. I won't hold it that much against him since most of the characters are also rather not well fleshed out.Overall, this will likely be a forgettable show for me, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was fun and funny, there was just not much memorable about it to differentiate itself from others. It could have been much more if it pushed more on the non-human aspects but it really didn't go in that direction. felt the characters were rather lacking in making them have their own personalities and characteristics enough for them to stand out including the main characters.The biggest different between this show becoming another average school harem romcom was the non-human aspect, but this show seems to pretty much almost ignore that aspect and it is quite a shame since that would easily be a big appeal.

Be warned, there will be mild spoilers throughout the review, and at the end I\'m going to spoil something about the ending, but if you don\'t want to waste your time like I did you might want to read it. I wish I knew this information when I started.Story: 6/10The story is decent. It\'s all in the MAL summary; MC has a crush on a girl (Shiragami, Youko), only to find out she\'s a vampire. It\'s revealed in episode 1 (and the MAL summary) that Shiragami made a...promise to her dad (also a vampire) that if her being a vampire was discovered, she\'d have to go home and end her high school life. MC promises to keep her secret if she doesn\'t go back home, and in this exchange he friendzones himself. The MC friendzoning himself is a reoccurring theme in the show, which is mildly annoying. The rest of the story entails the MC discovering that all is not as it seems with all of his classmates, and he finds more secrets that others are hiding and he promises to keep their secrets as well. The show is a comedy/SoL/harem, so expect all your typical gags involved in that genre of a show. Not a bad story, but nothing groundbreaking.Art: 6/10The art isn\'t bad, just nothing amazing. The character designs are fairly normal, not great and not bad. Definitely not bad enough to not watch the show in my opinion. If you\'ve seen the preview art you know what you\'re getting.Sound: 7/10Again, nothing to write home about. The OP is decent, but I ended up skipping it after the first episode. To be fair, I do this with most shows unless the OP is absolutely amazing for times sake.Character: 8/10The characters are good. Just about every girl that interacts with the MC is a tsundere, which I\'m a sucker for. The MC is kind of a wuss, but not near as bad as other shows. He cares for all of his friends and wants to do right by them, which is a plus. However, he has a hard time telling people his true feelings, which I will get to at the end of the review. The characters are funny enough that I found myself smiling every episode, and several times found myself laughing to myself.Enjoyment: 7/10Let me preface this with a warning: THERE IS A SPOILER IN THIS SECTION. If you want to watch the show with no spoilers, then stop reading. HOWEVER. I WISH I KNEW THIS WHEN I STARTED WATCHING. I feel like this show was a waste of my time. I finished this show in 24 hours, which might not be a huge feat for many, but for me it was. As a full-time student and part-time worker, it oftentimes takes me 3-5 days to finish a 12 episode show. I liked this show for the most part, and it could have been a 7-8/10. However, it is overall a 5 for me. Ok, if you don\'t want to be spoiled, STOP READING HERE. I\'M SERIOUS, I\'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE CONCLUSION OF THE SHOW.----------Ok, here we go. Throughout the entire show, the MC is the MG\'s friend. As I said in the beginning of the show, when he finds out about the MG\'s secret (she\'s a vampire), he tells her that he\'ll keep her secret and be her friend. Right after saying ""friend"", he realizes he\'s just friendzoned himself. Props to the authors/screenwriters that acknowledge to the audience that the MC realizes that and regrets it. Throughout the rest of the show, he hangs out with the MG and is her friend, albiet a close friend. Close as in, it is obvious to the viewers and to every other character in the show (except the MG of course) that he likes the MG. However, something always comes up that keeps him from confessing to the MG. That was fine to me. While I always am hoping that the MC will confess to the love interest, earlier rather than later, I have found that shows that involve the couple getting together early on tend to not be as good as shows that draw it out. I was prepared to give this show a 7/10 overall, as I really did enjoy watching the show. HOWEVER. The 7/10 rating depended on the MC to confess to the MG and them start going out. The last episode is called ""Let\'s Go Home Together"", which led me to believe that in the last episode he would confess his love and she would reciprocate, ending the show with the viewers knowing that they would start dating and live happily ever after. Spoiler, that never happens. Seriously. If you are watching this show hoping to see the MC get together with the girl he loves, don\'t watch the show. It never happens. In the end, the MC never confesses, you don\'t know whether or not they will ever get together, and you\'re left with a hole inside of you. Oh sure, the show ends with them getting together and telling each other they\'ll be there for each other, but it specifically shows this as ""we\'ve been friends this whole time, we\'ll always be together like this"". But nobody who watches a romance show wants the main couple to be together ""as friends"". At least, nobody I know. If the show had concluded with the couple getting together, it would have been a 7/10 easy. Heck, they didn\'t even have to show them together. Just let the show end with them confessing their love to each other, smiling at each other as the scene pans into the sunset. Don\'t even add them kissing, just let them say ""I love you"" ""I love you too!"" and have them hug each other. Boom, end scene. However, the last lines in the show are the MC saying ""I\'ll always keep your secret, no matter what"" and the MG saying ""Ok"". Like, SERIOUSLY?!?!? If there was some kind of confession, this show would be a 7/10. However, with that horrendous ending it is a 5/10 for me. If the rest of the show didn\'t hook me and drag me along it would have been a 1/10 or lower, if that is even possible.OVERALL: 5/10OK YOU CAN READ NOW, NO SPOILERS IN THIS LAST SECTION. For reasons stated above in the spoiler section, this show is a 5/10. If the reasons stated in the spoiler section were different, this could easily be a 7/10, which in my opinion is a good show to spend time watching. Not S tier, not even A tier. But a solid B tier show. However, my overall rating has to be 5/10, which is a low C tier show. If you want something to watch quickly that will be enjoyable for the most part, watch this show. If you want a show that isn\'t going to feel like a waste of time by the end, don\'t watch this show.By the way, if you skipped the spoiler section and decide you aren\'t going to watch this show due to the overall score I gave, I\'d encourage you to read the spoiler section. After reading the spoiler section, you might decide to watch the show anyways. Like I said, this show had potential to be a 7/10. I just didn\'t like one specific part. Others might not care about what I care about. If you don\'t care about what I care about, you might end up really liking this show.Thanks for reading! promise to her dad (also a vampire) that if her being a vampire was discovered, she\'d have to go home and end her high school life.

However, the last lines in the show are the MC saying ""I\'ll always keep your secret, no matter what"" and the MG saying ""Ok"". Like, SERIOUSLY?!?!? If there was some kind of confession, this show would be a 7/10. However, with that horrendous ending it is a 5/10 for me. If the rest of the show didn\'t hook me and drag me along it would have been a 1/10 or lower, if that is even possible.OVERALL: 5/10OK YOU CAN READ NOW, NO SPOILERS IN THIS LAST SECTION. For reasons stated above in the spoiler section, this show is a 5/10. If the reasons stated in the spoiler section were different, this could easily be a 7/10, which in my opinion is a good show to spend time watching. Not S tier, not even A tier. But a solid B tier show. However, my overall rating has to be 5/10, which is a low C tier show. If you want something to watch quickly that will be enjoyable for the most part, watch this show. If you want a show that isn\'t going to feel like a waste of time by the end, don\'t watch this show.By the way, if you skipped the spoiler section and decide you aren\'t going to watch this show due to the overall score I gave, I\'d encourage you to read the spoiler section. After reading the spoiler section, you might decide to watch the show anyways. Like I said, this show had potential to be a 7/10. I just didn\'t like one specific part. Others might not care about what I care about. If you don\'t care about what I care about, you might end up really liking this show.Thanks for reading!', 'Normally I\'m all about the mecha and action shows and I write reviews for fans with similar tastes. So it seems odd that I\'d give a romantic comedy a five. But it\'s funny and heartwarming, plus it\'s not a typical harem show either. Yes several ladies are crushing on our main character but not in a manner that has you screaming [i]""JUST PICK ONE YOU IDIOT!""[/i]; nor does it make you stop and question why they\'d fall for him in the first place. It doesn\'t take itself too seriously by drowning you with it\'s romantic overtures and the comedy is never sidelined to advance the...plot. It successfully sells exactly what it offers; a romantic comedy that doesn’t sacrifice one aspect to satisfy the other. It\'s bright and vivid giving the show the kind of slick animation we\'ve come to expect in 2015. My highest recommendation plot.

My highest recommendation', 'Anime adaptation of an ongoing anime series...the most recent volumes are still in pre-order status as of this writing.  The series is basically one long advertisement for the manga and viewers should not expect a 2nd season.  It\'s a reasonably entertaining generic monster girl harem show.  The main character is a milquetoast, bland audience self-insert character whose main flaw is he stinks at keeping secrets and people can read him like a book.The tension in the show is he is forced by circumstances to keep the ""special"" (supernatural, etc) secrets of MULTIPLE girls at the school.  And this Zero is a...Hero because he\'s secretly adored by multiple girls...who each have their reasons.  The girls\'s sincerity is honestly the most touching thing about the show.  They feel DEEPLY for this guy and it\'s very tender and wholesome.The main pair (Asahi & Youko) are lovable, clueless idiots...they do become good friends and have mutual feelings that extend beyond friendship....but he\'s lacking in courage and she\'s not honest with herself and her own feelings.The show is a good mix of zany comedy and harem rom com and makes me look forward to reading more of the manga, so mission accomplished on that score.  There\'s nothing outstanding about this show, it\'s fairly average, but it is entertaining and the emotions it evokes feel genuine.  It will make you say ""awwww!"" more than once if you\'re a sensitive emotional person yourself. Hero because he\'s secretly adored by multiple girls...who each have their reasons.

It\'s a serious romance story between a human and a vampire. If there\'s an opposite version or vibe of it, I think this is the one, but seriously hilarious.So this anime was part of my getaway animes since 2015. Jitsu wa Watashi wa or Actually I am is a supernatural romantic comedy show about a love story of a human and a vampire. I just found this anime somewhere on google, and seriously, I didn\'t regret a bit watching it. Heck, I watched this anime numerous times and I never get tired of it.The story...was somewhat cliched. It\'s a story of a timid, yet honest boy named, Kuromine Asahi. He was known as ""the leaky basket"" by his friends and classmates because he can\'t keep a single secret. He\'s 100 percent honest. Even his secret that he had a crush on the mysterious Shiragami Youko and he planned to confess to her. But all things didn\'t end well when he found out Youko\'s secret that she\'s a vampire. She had a condition to her pops that if some people found her secret, she was going to drop school. But Asahi can\'t keep a secret so he swore with all of his heart to protect it. And the funny thing is, his confession was a failure. Because he ended up being her friend, which isn\'t a bad thing.Even though the premise was generic, the comedy and the humor sold me off. Especially when the other characters had unique personalities and characteristics. There\'s an alien, a perverted werewolf, a childhood friend wearing talking glasses, and a demon principal. All those women were a pain in the ass for Asahi because he couldn\'t keep a secret and how the heck is he supposed to keep it from everyone? Which the characters lead to a series of unfortunate events and how they would solve them. The funny thing about this show was the unexpected situations. And of course, the romance between the characters bloomed in their relationship with Asahi. I know Asahi will end up with Youko but I still ship him to Mikan or Nagisa. I haven\'t read the manga but the last episode was a cliffhanger and unsatisfying.The animation was decent. Surprisingly, it was animated by TMS Entertainment, known for its romantic comedy animes, especially shoujos like Fruits Basket. The art from the manga was not good but the animation style was improved. The expressions of the characters were solid, especially the humor expressions. It gave a good romantic vibe.I like the music and I didn\'t know it was composed by Nijine or Akito Matsuda. Akito Matsuda is good at composing music from light-hearted romantic comedy and I like the variations of HOLOGRAM insert song. It was cute and sweet, as well as funny. The OP was decent but the ED was forgettable. Heck, I haven\'t heard the ED since the first I watched it.The characters were solid. I like the uniqueness of the characters, especially Mikan. Although she always bullied him she kept her secret for a long time that she\'s in love with Asahi. She always supports his back. Other characters were good as well. I found Youko\'s speaking was a bit annoying, even her being air-headed. Asahi is a good character, as well as his development in how hard he tried in keeping secrets. The principal was kinda annoying though.Overall, this show was hilariously funny. The show had its best parts and some boring parts. But despite its flaws, in the end, I still really enjoyed it. If you want a supernatural rom-com about vampires, I might recommend this show to you.

Mirai Keisatsu Urashiman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2933/Mirai_Keisatsu_Urashiman,"['Future Policeman Urashiman is one of the more unique anime series to come out of the 1980\'s. Given that it\'s from that time frame, the artwork looks a little dated and the technology of the future may appear to be anachronistic compared to that of today. However, the series makes up for the flaws largely due the interactions between the antagonist (named only Fuhrer) and the protagonist (Urashiman). There is a backstory between the two that is explained in the series, but for the first half the show has a ""crime of the week"" feel to it.The character development of Fuhrer simply makes the show...work. Most of the time, Urashiman and his fellow policemen interact with a villain called Ludvich. Ludvich, given more episodes to himself, could have become one of those villains that you root for. However, the series decided to go with Fuhrer (Ludvich\'s boss in crime) and it was the best choice.Without spoiling too much, Fuhrer is a man who could be over 100. It\'s hard to tell but we know that he\'s old and he uses scientific means to extend his life. Fuhrer wants to use Urashiman\'s power to travel back in time in order to revitalize his body so that he won\'t have to face death. Urashiman becomes sympathetic to Fuhrer as a person, despite the fact that Fuhrer leads the largest crime organization in the world and Urashiman is a policeman who is constantly opposing that organization. No other series that I know of develops a situation in which the two opposing forces in the plot appear to be close to ending their hostilities and moving in a different direction.The supporting characters are about you might expect out of an anime show. Claude is a dashing police officer who likes to pick up the girls. Sophia is a former nun now turned police officer who still makes religious references now and then. Gondo, the chief of Urashiman\'s police unit, is an old fellow who is constantly shouting and ignoring his blood pressure. Urashiman\'s cat, Mya, also plays a role in the series since he (or she) came along for the time travel ride as the series began. It\'s unknown whether Mya has the same powers as Urashiman, but if so, the series isn\'t telling. Stinger Wolf is the guy on the scene for Necrime- the organization run by Fuhrer- and he is more often than not the one who leads the physical fighting that goes on. Not much is known about Wolf and not much is said one way or the other. He simply appears to be a guy who is in it all the way for the bad guys.The music within the show is very good. I particularly enjoy hearing Necrime\'s theme because, unlike a lot of police animes I\'ve seen, the villains are just as important to the story as the heroes. I\'m not a fan of the opening and closing themes, although this was the early 1980\'s so I can\'t really hold that against the series. Other than that, I found the soundtrack to be good enough to hold its own although it wasn\'t what I would call revolutionary.Despite this, the series was not given an American release- perhaps because the title ""Rockin\' Cops"" was too much of a departure from the original intent of the creators. The series itself seems to be one of many Tatsunoko Production projects that slipped under the radar for the most part.The series was made in a time when Japan took it\'s science fiction seriously and allowed a lot more room to navigate than they do today and the result is a free-form futuristic show that combines elements of police work, time travel and pathos on the part of the villains. At 50 episodes, the series is exactly as long as it needs to be and it provides a fun romp through a possible future through the perspective of a 1980\'s-era boy and his cat. work.

Like Tylor, this is a parody comedy based on tropes of the period, but it's simply not as good as Kouichi Mashimo's later work and very inconsistent between episodes. The only episode really that stood out to me is #32, which has a 3 minute sequence with the best callbacks to the silent film era I've ever seen in anime: they managed to reference at least 11 specific Chaplin, Keaton, and Keystone Cops moments...all mixed together brilliantly. all mixed together brilliantly.""]"

One day they decide to summon a witch, but in the end thinking it doesn\'t work. BUT it does, and she does come, Rurumo. And Shibaki gets a wish granted, which is a pair of panties. And many things happen after that in which Shibaki and Rurumo are bond together under a ""contract.""Things are cliche, like the witch outfit and having her familiar being a...black cat. In the beginning you realize it\'s a little ""ehh."" Shibaki is basically your classic pervert who likes to look under skirts and flips them so he can see the panties. He likes porn, that has been made clear. And this might seem offensive to the female audience, but as a female myself, this show is just hilarious.I mean this guys is actually really nice. There are sweet moments in which you you kind of tilt your head as ask yourself ""is that the same guy?"" With only being 4 episodes in, you can already see his character gradually change as his relationship with Rurumo deepens to some extent. Overall a cute & funny story!Art: 5/10- Though it is unique and has it\'s own style, I can honestly say this anime\'s weakest point is the art. I honestly dislike it. But it\'s nothing too terrible, but not my cup of tea.But if you can get past that aspect, then you\'re good to goSound: 7/10- The music in any anime is always a hit or a miss with people. Whether someone hates it, doesn\'t mind it, or loves it, is all in opinion. But I don\'t dislike the OP & ED. I can honestly say it\'s soothing and nothing ear-bleeding.But like most OPs & EDs, people normally skip it after the first time listening to it, so it\'s okay if you hate it haha.Character: 9/10- The character\'s are just hilarious. Shibaki is so dense and clueless at times that it\'s interesting to watch him wander around aimlessly. His whole personality is based on his pervert antics but with a slow change in attitude. I mean he really cares about Rurumo, and not because she\'s a cute girl, but because he genuinely doesn\'t want  her to get hurt. He tries to help her whenever he can. And for some reason it\'s just nice to see that side to him. Not to mention his mom is watching him like a hawk so he doesn\'t go off and kidnap some girls; literally. I love his mom haha.Rurumo is a witch in training and has to stay with Shibaki until all the tickets are gone. She\'s a very lovable character and she\'s pretty clueless as well, but even more so. But she is a witch living in a human world so her perception on them is kind of weak. But with that said, you see her struggle to distance herself from the human world and from Shibaki. It\'s apparent in episode 4 she\'s trying to stay focused on her duty, instead of being carefree in the world she\'s in. But it\'s also apparent that it\'s getting harder to do soAnd all the supporting characters are both annoying & entertaining. But overall I find them all enjoyable haha.Enjoyment: 7/10- With everything that I\'ve said, you\'re probably wondering why it\'s getting just a ""good"" score. And it\'s simple, this story lacks in producing a define plot. But it does gradually increase in entertainment, but there really is no main objective.Overall: 7/10- If you wanna good laugh, than watch this series!

Cuz at the end of the day, this show is really enjoyable!', 'You know what? Why not. I\'ll spend some time to write up my opinion on this show. And since there isn\'t much to it, it\'s going to be short.Majimoji Rurumo is... nice. That\'s it. It\'s a nice, relaxing series with an overall... soft tone to it. There is some fanservice but really, it\'s nothing too severe compared to other J.C. Staff anime such as To aru Majutsu no Index or Hentai Prince.I\'ve literally given everything about this show a rating of 7/10. That seems like the perfect number for this series. I don\'t mean that in a bad way.It\'s hard to badmouth...this series if you understand what it\'s aiming for.Rurumo is a light-hearted series about a boy who meets a witch. It\'s really just an episodic series based on their daily life together. That\'s it. And actually, it\'s pretty calming. It\'s one of those... feel-good series. It\'s not too be taken too seriously and yet, at times, it still manages to be fairly touching. It has its moments.I do really like one thing, though, and that was Kouta\'s attitude towards Rurumo. He\'s a perverted kid throughout most of the day but, whenever he\'s with Rurumo he seems to lighten up and treat her sincerely. And it\'s a good feeling to see that change within him. It feels like he genuinely wants to see her become happy while living in his world.Despite all the fluffy feelings I hold for this, there is ONE slight issue I had, and really it was only present in the beginning.At first, I don\'t know if it\'s just me but, it felt as though... Rurumo and Kouta barely spent any time together. Like, there\'s barely any scenes involving both of them in the same area and interacting with each other and when there was, it was short and trivial. So... it felt kind of empty whenever Kouta said something meaningful to her.Later on in the show this is fixed when Kouta starts to spend more on-screen time with her and, there are small dilemmas (As in, nothing drastic or life-threatening) that bring the two closer. The climax of those episodes tend to be heart warming and put a smile on my face, or had me saying ""D\'awwww...""The sound creates a sort of atmosphere to the show that I haven\'t really felt in a cutesy series before. I\'m talking about the music, which mainly consists of a guitar playing a... I hate to use this word again but, relaxing tune. Acchi Kocchi was similar with the music though that seemed to consist of more effort in the music than in Rurumo. At least, in my opinion.The art was average. Animated by J.C. Staff, it was expected by me to have nicer looking animation but, it didn\'t. I don\'t have a problem with this, seeing as the level of animation fit the show nicely.Overall Majimoji Rurumo is a feel-good show. It\'s not to be taken TOO seriously in terms of plot and, really, I see it as something to help you relax or put a smile on your face from time to time. Something to watch nonchalantly, I suppose you could say. A solid 7 out of 10. this series if you understand what it\'s aiming for.Rurumo is a light-hearted series about a boy who meets a witch.

So... it felt kind of empty whenever Kouta said something meaningful to her.Later on in the show this is fixed when Kouta starts to spend more on-screen time with her and, there are small dilemmas (As in, nothing drastic or life-threatening) that bring the two closer. The climax of those episodes tend to be heart warming and put a smile on my face, or had me saying ""D\'awwww...""The sound creates a sort of atmosphere to the show that I haven\'t really felt in a cutesy series before. I\'m talking about the music, which mainly consists of a guitar playing a... I hate to use this word again but, relaxing tune. Acchi Kocchi was similar with the music though that seemed to consist of more effort in the music than in Rurumo. At least, in my opinion.The art was average. Animated by J.C. Staff, it was expected by me to have nicer looking animation but, it didn\'t. I don\'t have a problem with this, seeing as the level of animation fit the show nicely.Overall Majimoji Rurumo is a feel-good show. It\'s not to be taken TOO seriously in terms of plot and, really, I see it as something to help you relax or put a smile on your face from time to time. Something to watch nonchalantly, I suppose you could say. A solid 7 out of 10.', ""First of all, let me start by saying this is quite an underrated anime.Yes, this anime is actually quite slow-paced, and has quite some cliched episodes and moments that you would find in a slice-of-life and romance series, but what really caught on to me, especially in the later episodes, is how compatible the op and ed are with the scenarios in the episodes. It is actually quite interesting to see the many sides of the main 2 characters and see how their relationship progressed.Story- wise, it's not amazing, and quite cliched at times, but the presentation was well-delivered.Art-wise, normal.Sound-wise, I really love and op...and ed, and some osts.Character-wise, it's great to see the main characters get developed, with bits and pieces of some characters' pasts and what each character's personalities are like. Characters' personalities are mostly quite consistent, especially Rurumo's,even through all the character developments they do not seem out of place.Enjoyment-wise, I would give it a 10 out of 10. It definitely has enough for me to keep watching to the finish, since I do not really like cliched settings. However, it is quite surprising cos at times I cannot even predict what will happen next. It's quite hard to find an anime that's cliched yet not predictable nowadays.Overall:9/10If you like slow-paced, touching, romantic with some slapstick humour, you should try this anime. and ed, and some osts.Character-wise, it's great to see the main characters get developed, with bits and pieces of some characters' pasts and what each character's personalities are like.

Premise is Kouta summons the witch Rurumo and accidentally strikes a bargain where in he is given a pair of girls pants in exchange for his immortal soul.After warming up to him a bit Rurumo refuses to take his soul and is punished by being forced to grant any wish Kouta desires.Now I wouldn't blame you if you thought this sounded...like the build up to a really perverted anime but it's really tame with a focus on the characters and not on fanservice, it's on AT-X but it's totally PG-13.Rurumo and her familiar Chiro are the best part of the show. I love Rurumo's totally deadpan persona and Chiro is a great comic relief side character. A few of the episodes fall flat but the character interactions are good enough to carry the show.If they make more I will watch it but I'm not exactly waiting with baited breath. like the build up to a really perverted anime but it's really tame with a focus on the characters and not on fanservice, it's on AT-X but it's totally PG-13.Rurumo and her familiar Chiro are the best part of the show.

So, like I\'ve said it was another one of those anime that involves magical girls, in this case it involves witches, whose typical concepts were modified to fit the Japanese fanbase, basically it is like ""Witch Craft Works"" except that there isn\'t that action genre present in it, though it doesn\'t have the same romance genre it, but I ain\'t gonna push through co\'z this isn\'t the part for it.For the story, I give a fair score since one...would be annoyed with the plot where a naive witch meets lusty boy kind of thing where witch was suppose to make lusty boy make a wish and take his life (of not without the ticket that the guy has) instead it turns out to be a witch entering into boy\'s life and the usual thing where boy\'s life turns upside down, however it was the romance between the two and the comedy puts a balance on the anime\'s poor plot.About it\'s art....well, I just don\'t like the way them character\'s were illustrated co\'z it kinda look like it was done by some mangaka wanna be who is trying hard but cannot , the panty shots were fine in a certain angle but upfront it kinda looks like your typical granny panty.About the sound, it was the opening theme, Rurumo\'s VA and Masako\'s VA that I find cute, however the let down was with Shibaki\'s VA where it would have been better if Sempai\'s VA did Shibaki\'s voice also Sumiko Inoue VA\'s sounded like a grown up than a teen girl and it would have been much better if the VA who did  Harulily\'s voice would have done it.Now about the cast, we all know that this anime revolves around Shibaki and Rurumo, well it good that is was all about them since Shibaki sort of act like Rurumo\'s guardian than anything else, their romance side was more of a true love where it is unconditional and that is where the enjoyment was more profound aside from the comedy aspect , so overall, this anime isn\'t bad at all, so here are my ratings for this anime:Story: Fair 6.The plot maybe be stupid but the comedy and romance were the one that balance it out.Art: Poor 3.Did I mention something about that the art of this anime was somehow done by a mangaka wannabe but cannot?Sound: Fair 6.Well, even though Shibaki and Inoue\'s voice were bad, It was the voices of Rurumo and Masako\' s that placed a certain balance over my opinion as to how I gave this part its score.Enjoyment: Good 7.The score is for the anime\'s comedy aspect.Overall:L Good 7.It wasn\'t bad especially with the romance between Shibaki and Rurumo. would be annoyed with the plot where a naive witch meets lusty boy kind of thing where witch was suppose to make lusty boy make a wish and take his life (of not without the ticket that the guy has) instead it turns out to be a witch entering into boy\'s life and the usual thing where boy\'s life turns upside down, however it was the romance between the two and the comedy puts a balance on the anime\'s poor plot.About it\'s art....well, I just don\'t like the way them character\'s were illustrated co\'z it kinda look like it was done by some mangaka wanna be who is trying hard but cannot , the panty shots were fine in a certain angle but upfront it kinda looks like your typical granny panty.About the sound, it was the opening theme, Rurumo\'s VA and Masako\'s VA that I find cute, however the let down was with Shibaki\'s VA where it would have been better if Sempai\'s VA did Shibaki\'s voice also Sumiko Inoue VA\'s sounded like a grown up than a teen girl and it would have been much better if the VA who did  Harulily\'s voice would have done it.Now about the cast, we all know that this anime revolves around Shibaki and Rurumo, well it good that is was all about them since Shibaki sort of act like Rurumo\'s guardian than anything else, their romance side was more of a true love where it is unconditional and that is where the enjoyment was more profound aside from the comedy aspect , so overall, this anime isn\'t bad at all, so here are my ratings for this anime:Story: Fair 6.The plot maybe be stupid but the comedy and romance were the one that balance it out.Art: Poor 3.Did I mention something about that the art of this anime was somehow done by a mangaka wannabe but cannot?Sound: Fair 6.Well, even though Shibaki and Inoue\'s voice were bad, It was the voices of Rurumo and Masako\' s that placed a certain balance over my opinion as to how I gave this part its score.Enjoyment: Good 7.The score is for the anime\'s comedy aspect.Overall:L Good 7.It wasn\'t bad especially with the romance between Shibaki and Rurumo.', 'Majimoji Rurumo is a very lopsided piece of work. It would be a terrible show if not for the presence of Rurumo herself.Majimoji Rurumo is a very corny show.  They way each episode is laid out is painfully predictable and trite, always ending with Rurumo showing emotions at the end and learning what it is like to enjoy herself. These scenes have very little emotional impact since you saw them from a mile away, and the slow and emotional music only makes you want to look away from how cheesy everything is.All the characters in the show are bland and 2-dimensional. The main character...is the typical ""nice"" pervert, his friends (who could all be lumped into one character) are also perverts, there is a boob girl, another boob girl, a tsundere, and so on. Because the show is centered just on growing Rurumo as a character, the growth of everyone else is pretty much ignored, and they stay the same throughout the entire series. As a result, the characters act the same every time, always leading Rurumo to the same predictable end.The humor is almost not worth mentioning, it\'s just standard jokes based on boobs and Rurumo being a klutz. I don\'t remember any moments in which it\'s made me laugh at all.Despite all this, Rurumo herself somehow single-highhandedly carries this show out of the trash into the range of mediocrity. Rurumo herself is not special character by any means- she has difficulty expressing herself, but is nice inside. All of Rurumo\'s scenes portray her as cute and klutzy. She says herself, ""I\'m a bit slow, so I have to try hard."" It seems like she\'s just as artificially engineered to draw out emotion like the rest of the show, but the difference with her is that it works- she ends up being very endearing.I cannot recommend Majimoji Rurumo as a good show to anyone. I watched it only for Rurumo, and every scene without her felt like a struggle to get through. However, when she got screen time, the show was largely enjoyable. Overall, I had a fair enjoyment of this show.

Sure I have a certain preferrence to lolis but that\'s all. And yet I\'m certain that if I were to pretend I was a pervert I would give a performance 10 times more convincing than this crap!Shibaki is a high-school student, supposedly well-known for being interested in the ecchi part of life. He meets a magical girl, Rurumo (aka a cute emotionless loli) and her familiar (the -nyan character) and receives from them magical tickets that may fullfill his every wish, on the premise that if all tickets run out, he dies (the loli doesn\'t know that). The...protagonist ends up using them on every episode to avoid disasters in his school life and to protect Rurumo herself (for example allowing her to stay at his house) who he grows attached to.Only the performance comes out as downright corny. It\'s like watching Miley Cyrus twerk, she just doesn\'t have it in her (or on her, specifically on her behinds... anyway she can\'t do it). The protagonist acts way too saint-like for the character he\'s supposed to be. In way too many cases where he could get some he starts going all moral and just on us, whereas in other cases where nothing is happening he\'s putting an over-the-top performance to show that he has only girls in mind that just doesn\'t come out as natural.The episodes are waaaaaayyyyyyy too cliche, most centering about Rurumo showing more human emotions through the various classicals (going-to-the-beach episode, animal-caring episode, mysterious-girl-joining-club episode...). The show is so cliche that you can practically imagine the plot of the entire episode from the introduction prior to opening credits (aka from the first minute). One thing I am glad for is that the wannabe pervert (how can they make this seem like a bad thing...?) sees Rurumo more as the immouto character than the maiden-in-distress, but again for 2 people living in the same house and ""bound by fate"" they somehow don\'t have nearly as many interractions as you would expect, making it feel incredibly lacking. In fact in many cases you will feel that pointless scenes get all the screen-time that could have been used for precious character developement.

In fact, I found it quite enjoyable. However, it is not a balanced anime, and it ignores its strengths in exchange for staying within the safety net of the same old tropes. Both times I have watched this series, I have had to strain my senses so as to not lose the golden thread that runs through the mud. That golden thread is all that can be seen of what could have been a great romance story about love across boundaries between...two characters who are both awkward for different reasons.The serious interactions between Rurumo and Kouta are few and far between, and they are the only moments that really made me feel like the story was progressing. In between these moments (or sometimes obscuring them) are a plethora of overused perverted, comedic devices. Occasionally, there is some genuinely good comedy, but regardless of the comedy\'s quality, the story is rarely progressing. But how could it? After all, the story premise itself is based on the relationship between Rurumo and Kouta. And yet, that relationship takes a backseat to the comedy. On top of that, filler episode format is used - swimsuit episodes, lingerie episodes, etc. There is little to no sense of progression in the episodes because the production team tunneled too heavily on creating funny perverted scenarios, even though a gem of a relationship premise was staring them in the face. In the final episode, we finally get a truly serious emotional episode plot, and yet it falls flat because there has been so little development beforehand. Perhaps the gentlest way of viewing the production\'s failure is to say that they tried to create a sense of the ""fun"" that Rurumo and Kouta were having together as a means to show the relationship\'s progression and empower the final episode. With that optimistic view, the show appears slightly more endearing, but ultimately it still suffers the same problems.As for the individual aspect grading...The story, for the aforementioned reasons, gets a 3.

Majimoji Rurumo is a fun anime that is undoubtedly average when it comes to its story, art, sound, and character development. Despite that, it all comes together into a fun romantic-comedy that I would easily recommend for fans of this genre. (7.5/10)Unlike the reviews that I have done before this one and Witch Craft Works are going to be the very categorized fashion that focuses on each category (story, art, sound, and characters) in a dissociated fashion. I will only be talking about overlaps when I think it is necessary. The reason for this departure from...my long form reviews (that you probably could use in an anime review itself with a bit of sprucing up to entertain viewers) is because I find both Rurumo and Witch Craft Works to be guilty pleasures. I am not saying guilty pleasures are persay not worth the effort of a long-form review, but there is not much to talk about (both positively and negatively) when it comes to either anime.Story: 6Majimoji Rurumo is a very simple anime that comes within a unique twist on the romantic-comedy genre that puts together a fairly clutzy, ditzy witch by the name of Rurumo and a perverted highschool boy named Kouta. This formation was caused by circumstances that had Rurumo spare the life of Kouta when he granted a ""very special wish"". After the anime establishes this pairing both (Kouta and Rurumo) have funny side adventures to learn what it means to be a witch, live, and possibly question whether or not, if giving up your life is worth someone\'s happiness. As amazing as that premise sounds, the plot goes really nowhere within this 12 episode cour. It mainly relies on a lot of episode cliches within slice of life anime (beach, unknowning love, etc.) This does allow for a very steady foundation to build the rest of the anime\'s characters, but it does create for a pretty bland series when its characters pan out. Luckily, most of the time they do.Characters: 7Rurumo and Kouta are the main protagonists of this series, and work well as a duo. Rurumo\'s innocent, immature nature really meshes well with Kouta\'s over-the-top personality. This formula isn\'t unique to anime (Gekkan Shoujo, Gintama, Gochuumon, Kiniro Mosaic all have this formula to some degree). Nevertheless, it still works to great effect. I found myself laughing a lot at the antics that were happening within anime when those two were on screen. It probably stems that I can relate closely to both characters, but I enjoy both of them a lot. The rest of the supporting cast are somewhat forgettable. The only characters outside of Rurumo and Kouta are Chiro and Tanako. Chiro has her own arc, and often leads to mischief on screen that screws with Kouta that I found fun. Tanako is fun in the same degree that her antics really just add for the rest of the series. The characters of this series are not original, but they\'re fun.Art and Sound:The art in Majimoji Rurumo is extremely quiet despite it being a romantic-comedy. When I go into watching a romantic-comedy, I assume that the color scheme is going to be outrageous or extremely colorful to match what is happening on screen. However, Rurumo never took those gambles or went a super high art quality. Everything was a simple pastel that is used in a lot of anime within this genre. This is not to say that the art scheme is bad, but it\'s generic for this type of show. However, Rurumo\'s smile in the opening of this anime is the brightest, warmest smile in all of anime. It screams pure happiness. And, is the best thing in this anime for me.As for sound, Majimoji Rurumo\'s sounds are nothing to write home about. A lot of the inserts are primarily forgettable. They fit the scenes well enough to have ambience that flags for the viewer that something funny is supposed to happen, or serious is about to occur. I guess that\'s fine for what it\'s worth, but I would have liked the music director to take a chance and make something really heartfelt piano sonatas or loud jazz exerpts, for example, for various scenes. Much like the art, the sound is not bad, but its not good either.Enjoyment: 9Overall: 7Majimoji Rurumo was a blast for me to watch. I enjoyed every minute that Kouta and Rurumo were on the screen. Their antics reminded me of some of the stupid things that my friends and I would do in high school (just without magical powers). I would never say this is a unique anime compared to other anime like it, but it had this aspect that made me happy to watch each episode. Rurumo may not be the perfect anime, but it exudes adolescence and innocence in love, melancholy, time, and friendship. A solid romantic-comedy that I think a lot of people will have fun with.Majimoji Rurumo: (7.5/10) my long form reviews (that you probably could use in an anime review itself with a bit of sprucing up to entertain viewers) is because I find both Rurumo and Witch Craft Works to be guilty pleasures. I am not saying guilty pleasures are persay not worth the effort of a long-form review, but there is not much to talk about (both positively and negatively) when it comes to either anime.Story: 6Majimoji Rurumo is a very simple anime that comes within a unique twist on the romantic-comedy genre that puts together a fairly clutzy, ditzy witch by the name of Rurumo and a perverted highschool boy named Kouta. This formation was caused by circumstances that had Rurumo spare the life of Kouta when he granted a ""very special wish"". After the anime establishes this pairing both (Kouta and Rurumo) have funny side adventures to learn what it means to be a witch, live, and possibly question whether or not, if giving up your life is worth someone\'s happiness. As amazing as that premise sounds, the plot goes really nowhere within this 12 episode cour. It mainly relies on a lot of episode cliches within slice of life anime (beach, unknowning love, etc.) This does allow for a very steady foundation to build the rest of the anime\'s characters, but it does create for a pretty bland series when its characters pan out. Luckily, most of the time they do.Characters: 7Rurumo and Kouta are the main protagonists of this series, and work well as a duo. Rurumo\'s innocent, immature nature really meshes well with Kouta\'s over-the-top personality. This formula isn\'t unique to anime (Gekkan Shoujo, Gintama, Gochuumon, Kiniro Mosaic all have this formula to some degree). Nevertheless, it still works to great effect. I found myself laughing a lot at the antics that were happening within anime when those two were on screen. It probably stems that I can relate closely to both characters, but I enjoy both of them a lot. The rest of the supporting cast are somewhat forgettable. The only characters outside of Rurumo and Kouta are Chiro and Tanako. Chiro has her own arc, and often leads to mischief on screen that screws with Kouta that I found fun. Tanako is fun in the same degree that her antics really just add for the rest of the series. The characters of this series are not original, but they\'re fun.Art and Sound:The art in Majimoji Rurumo is extremely quiet despite it being a romantic-comedy. When I go into watching a romantic-comedy, I assume that the color scheme is going to be outrageous or extremely colorful to match what is happening on screen. However, Rurumo never took those gambles or went a super high art quality. Everything was a simple pastel that is used in a lot of anime within this genre.

Mato Seihei no Slave,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50392/Mato_Seihei_no_Slave,"[""This show includes slavery, sexism, attempted rape, sexual assault, physical abuse, and blackmail; all in just the first 3 episodes. The protagonist is degraded and assaulted (verbally, physically, and sexually) regularly. One side character creates fake blackmail to force the protagonist to do the photo taker's bidding over fear of death if the photos were revealed to protagonist's master. The protagonist's master also threatens to mutilate their genitalia if they step out of line. There is sooooo much wrong with this show. Also, there is full frontal nudity, so it's basically a hentai pretending to be an ecchi anime.Aside from the obviously horrible adult content,...the characters are flat. The art is somewhat well done. The premise seemed interesting, a chained soldier, like maybe when changed they have to be carefully controlled or become a danger or something. But nope, the entire series is basically a giant kink fantast of abuse and slavery. the characters are flat. The art is somewhat well done.

Takahiro is the author of several manga and short stories, including popular works such as Akame ga Kill! or Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero. However, bloody fantasy and maho-shojo is not the only...thing that this brilliant man can produce, because Takahiro knows all the delights that can appeal to readers, mostly Japanese. In 2007, for example, he co-wrote with Makoto Kanata the visual novel Kimiaru, a work where the story centers on a brother and sister who become the servants of three girls and, yes, yes, it\'s harem and ecchi, just the way we like it. Then, a year later, Takahiro took part in writing the script for the anime adaptation of the same Kimiaru from A.C.G.T Studios. And so, starting in 2019, Takahiro began releasing his ecchi shounen manga ""Chained Soldier"" in collaboration with artist Youhei Takemura, and then the announcement of an anime adaptation from Seven Arcs came out, with Junji Nishimura stepping in as director, taking a vacant slot between the two seasons of The Fire Hunter. And AT-X TV rewarded viewers with an uncensored screening of the show.Yuki Wakura, the protagonist, has the unheard-of luck to find himself in another dimension filled with monsters ready to crawl out through the opening gates to the real world. In order to keep the real world safe from the threat, the dimension has created squads of female warriors who fight the monsters with their abilities, while living in the same world in their spare time as if nothing had happened. Wakura was in the middle of a gate and almost got killed, but Kyouka Uzen, the leader of the seventh monster-fighting squad, came to his rescue. She rescued him and made him a slave, recognizing his potential. After becoming a slave, the boy acquired the ability to turn into a large demon, supporting in such a state warrior girls as a reward for...erotic desires. Thus began the story of the slave Wakura, burning desire to fight monsters and the desire to become a hero with a lot of rewards in the form of sexy girls.Chained Soldier is notable for the fact that it combines a lot of erotic moments, clearly dividing the line between an interesting plot and the whole vulgar part of the show. The picture is full of battles between the characters and their relationship with each other, and the fanservice desired by many remains as a cherry on this sweet cake. And the fanservice is really not based on the level of casual poses or showing underwear, but on various fetishes, I\'m sorry, but I won\'t list them, you have to see it for yourself. The show also has a large number of female protagonists, among whom the brightest stands out a person with the name Tenka Izumo - a short-haired captain of the sixth squad, which, by the way, according to the results of the vote among readers took the leading place among the most popular characters of the manga. She is a cunning and charming girl who at first treated Wakura as a pet, not just a slave. And there are tons of such lovely characters in the show, as it\'s also a harem.Seven Arcs and the animators are to be thanked for the spectacular and special effects, but still it was not enough for such work, especially the CGI graphics of the monsters in the second half of the anime, which apparently wanted to save the budget, but it turned out a bit crooked. Erotic scenes, in turn, shown in the adaptation are depicted worse than in the manga, although they appear in color with a couple of new angles.Takahiro\'s manga can definitely be called ecchi with a good plot, while the adaptation by Seven Arcs can be understood as a good advertisement of the source material, which I, again, highly recommend to read.

Animators not going full Degenerate level like other Ecchi shows do, and hence the overall experience is bad. Not recommended.Okay, so I am a Manga reader, and I am reading this piece of art when there were only 15 chapters out, so yea, I am one of the OGs when it comes to the story and I know everything about the characters and what the story is about, so the whole anime is a huge L for me.I was really thinking that this will be...the next HS DxD or at least a tough contender, but it lost to a Magical Girl Parody and A basic Harem Isekai featuring Rings in Ecchi aspects.Unnecessary censoring, no ""Physics"" like DxD/HS of the Dead and lewd scenes are glossed over. Pacing is also slow, when taking in the fact that S1 only has 12 episodes, aka 1 cour. We are already at episode 6 and we still don\'t have our top Girls of the story in with the MC, and I don\'t think my 2nd personal favourite (the Commander in Chief) will be in the Harem by the end of the season...Well whatever, I had way, way more expectation, and it is sad that it was not met, Animation and Art is great, but just something is missing which DxD, To Love Ru and MahoAko has, I can\'t exactly pin point what... Maybe it\'s not degenerate enough, though Manga is recommended. the next HS DxD or at least a tough contender, but it lost to a Magical Girl Parody and A basic Harem Isekai featuring Rings in Ecchi aspects.Unnecessary censoring, no ""Physics"" like DxD/HS of the Dead and lewd scenes are glossed over.

Maybe it\'s not degenerate enough, though Manga is recommended.', ""Over the past 12 weeks, I have spent a combined 4 hours of my fleeting time on this planet watching Chained Soldier, and through 12 episodes, all I can say is that my experience was only slightly better than taking the SAT, getting a colonoscopy, or having a physical done by an old man. This series just feels forgettable; in the depressing way where it isn’t laughably bad enough to be remembered, but it’s nowhere near good enough to be remembered either. This series is just another redundant entry into the bloated ecchi ___ genre, that blank being an amalgamation of different story beats that...try to add more substance to the main plot of watching the main character be lusted after by beautiful women.Kill la Kill is an ecchi anime that does this well; Its overall story is equal parts gripping and ridiculous enough to keep the audience engaged. Unfortunately for Chained Soldier, its story beats aren't strong enough to accomplish this. Chained Soldier goes for this weird Solo Leveling rip-off angle by establishing Mato: this mysterious shadow realm-esque location linked to Japan somehow.  Unfortunately, Mato is hilariously underdeveloped as a setting.As viewers, we only really know 3 things about Mato: one, that people can just wind up there somehow through a “Mato Mishap”, two, that there are peaches that grow down there that give superpowers, and three, the place is packed with monsters that the “Anti-Demon Corp” fights. This is absolutely everything that the plot operates on, so whenever Mato is treated as a “desolate wasteland” that impacts our characters or drives the plot, said character development or story beat usually is underwhelming, due to the sheer shallowness of the Mato. In addition, there is non-Mato-based character development, but it’s so bog standard that it isn’t even worth mentioning.Mushoku Tensei is an ecchi anime that has very strong characters; Eris, Roxy, Cliff, and Sylphie, among others, are developed enough so that if the author decided to make a story featuring any of them as the protagonist, it would still have the impact of the main quest. Chained Soldier doesn’t even get close to doing that, as the characters are some of the most generic, trope-built characters anime has to offer.For example, Yuuki is a black-haired self-insert mc whose key character traits are that he gets nervous around women and he has a generic “good boy” sense of duty. Kyouka is a generic tough leader who spends 90% of her dialogue saying leader shit, and 10% of her dialogue questioning Yuuki’s kinks. Shushu is a “teasing girl” who is really horny. Himari is a tsundere that initially doesn’t like men, but is now horny for our main character for…reasons. Nei is actually the only character that I have somewhat positive feelings for, only because she is a sweet distraction from the rest of the character cast. (Also I’m really happy she is not lewded in the story, as I really didn’t feel like making 20% of this review an explanation on why that isn’t ok.)Keep in mind, those characters who might seem shallow are the “MAIN” characters of this story. The side characters are even more shallow; Tenka is just horny, albeit forcefully, and Azuma’s only memorable character trait is that strikes a Jojo pose to freeze time. I shouldn’t have to tell you that a character roster this bland and generic isn’t a recipe for success in any anime.“So what if the characters and story are generic and non-compelling, at least we have the animation and fan service!” You might say that, however, unlike something like High School DXD, which looks good enough to be compelling as an action or fan service anime, Chained Soldier accomplishes neither. In fact, it looks like shit. Mato is this wasteland with a charcoal-esque ground and a reddish-purple sky. If that doesn’t sound visually appealing to you, too damn bad, it's the backdrop of every single fight that this show has to offer. Speaking of the fights, they aren’t animated well at all. Character movements often look chunky and cumbersome, like they deserve more frames to be fluid. Of course, that’s when the characters actually are in motion; this series uses a lot of animation tricks to avoid doing that as much as possible, i.e, sword slashes coming out of a charging character instead of animating them actually swinging their sword, and panning the camera instead of moving the character on a jump slash or something.The art style of this show is just visually unappealing at times. Honestly, High School DXD, which was released 12 years ago, looks better in every capacity. The lighting is often strange whenever we are outside of the reddish-purple skies of Mato. Impactful moments are often defined with a chain flying across the screen, but these chains are so far outside of the show’s art style that they are jarring whenever they appear. And then the CGI, oh god the CGI. You see, all of the Shuuki, those monsters I mentioned earlier, are made through horrid CGI. Whenever they move, it is incredibly jarring, and it honestly fucks with any non-CGI aspect of the scene. This is even more disappointing for the more impactful Shuuki, who are imbued with special powers, thus having a different appearance, yet they have the exact same CGI movement patterns. Finally, the Shuuki don’t look good either; the basic ones look like Temple Run gorillas and the more advanced ones just look bad.So… Chained Soldier is an ecchi “action” anime that fails to establish any sort of compelling story or characters. The show doesn’t look good either: the animation of the fights is bad, and due to the shitty art style, the ecchi fanservice isn’t fulfilling, and even if it was, it isn’t appealing enough to save the rest of the story. So, what does Chained Soldier do well? Well, other than not lewding Nei, not much. The biggest praise I can give this series is that it isn’t offensively bad in any department. Everything is mid to bad, but nothing is appealing, terrible, or anger-inducing. The only problem with this is that in the long run, Chained Soldier will just be forgettable. Hell, I’ve already started. I needed the MAL page for this series to criticize its characters, before referencing it, I only knew the names of two characters out of the entire story. I doubt I’ll be able to name a character in 2 months; in 11, I’ll completely forget that this series exists. And that right there, is a damn shame, because, on paper, this was something that could’ve been at least memorable.Thank you for reading. try to add more substance to the main plot of watching the main character be lusted after by beautiful women.Kill la Kill is an ecchi anime that does this well; Its overall story is equal parts gripping and ridiculous enough to keep the audience engaged.

Can we watch it?  Yes you can if you don\'t hate harem genre especially mixed in with the spice of ecchi tag.2. Is it worth the watch?  Well if you judge a book by it\'s cover, you will miss the contents of it whether it is good or bad and regret will occur when some other person tells you that you missed something you shouldn\'t have.3. ""It is for those people who have weird fetishes and for men who like to...stepped upon and dominated"" - some brainless randome user.  HELL NO BRUH. You see, the title and the plot is based on the power of a girl Kyoka who can make any monster her slave in exchange for a reward of deepest desire and when she tries it on human(our MC), he changes into more powerful hero type monster but the condition is that his deepest desire for being a human teenage male is obvious (🌚) so the story revolves around that. I will not spoil the anime but as the story progress the rewards which seems(currently) to be for certain people, are slowly changed into something every human male desires.

You see, the title and the plot is based on the power of a girl Kyoka who can make any monster her slave in exchange for a reward of deepest desire and when she tries it on human(our MC), he changes into more powerful hero type monster but the condition is that his deepest desire for being a human teenage male is obvious (🌚) so the story revolves around that. I will not spoil the anime but as the story progress the rewards which seems(currently) to be for certain people, are slowly changed into something every human male desires.

I'm actually surprised.When you first hear of Chained Soldier at first, you may be thinking of what an interesting concept, but as you dig deeper, you learn how things work, and it really makes you question what in the hell you signed yourself up for. Not to paint it in a negative light, as that wasn't the intention. But you throw in an interesting story base, interesting line of colourful cast of characters. Then you throw the most anime like thing into the mix, in terms of it's system of power. As if like the Powerpuff girls, you've got the perfect ingredients, then...you add something extra by mistake. Which doesn't harm the show, far from it, more that this show will get odd looks at first, but then you actually watch it, and then you'll see that......It's not that bad.Story and characters: 7As stated in my opening, that I do feel where the show will shine most, is through it's colourful cast of characters. Each with their own fitting personality. Sure, it can seem as if each one just follows a common trope, which isn't surprising at all, but the contrast of meshing well together with each other, does wonders for the overall entertainment value. While I will admit, it is very weird. Very, very weird. But it can be a nice looking action filled anime, that'll give you enjoyment in this Winter season.What will really take the kicker, is the story of Chained Soldier,and depending how the show goes, will be the make or break of this anime. At the start, I said I was surprised. Because you can read thoughts, or listen to opinions of what this product is about, but then you'll be pleasantly surprised that it's more tame than expected. Sure, it still fills that theme, and very much so. But if you may be expecting something over the top with it, it's not the case, which may make it more fine to experience, for those who aren't a fan of the genre even.As for more inner details of the story. While it can be weird, but there are some daft moments in there,along with some interesting moments that'll more likely carry it to a solid success. While it won't be anime of the season. But is it a good story? I'd say so.Art and sound: 8I feel like this is also where it shines best. The colours really do suit the anime so well. Certain areas and themes will look smashing, where it be in a much more lighter context, or times where it needs a much more dark touch. The quality in this department clearly shows, and it shows good. Follow that up with a good quality of sounds, and you've got a show, that's good looking, and easy on the ears to boot. The sort of quality you want your decent seeming anime to be like.Chained Soldier will be a hit for sure, not a massive one, but it'll make it's mark, and be one of the more better animes of the season, even if it's middle of the range. It's not massively impressive by any stretch, but it's a decent anime, that deserves a try. you add something extra by mistake.

This ruined the series from the beginning when the director made this decision. By any means, the art style is not bad, but you could say it tried to mimic that of a 2000s style, but in my opinion, does not go well with this series.The ecchi scenes are way more ""mwehehe"" in the manga...than in the anime; this also goes for the characters and coloring.If you want to invest your time in this anime, go ahead, BUT I recommend reading the manga as it is more enjoyable and ""mwehehe."" than in the anime; this also goes for the characters and coloring.If you want to invest your time in this anime, go ahead, BUT I recommend reading the manga as it is more enjoyable and ""mwehehe.""', ""Ah, Mato Seihei no Slave, a tale where ecchi shenanigans meet the world-saving prowess of anime waifus—truly, a harmonious symphony for the discerning viewer. Now, allow me to paint you a vivid picture of my impressions:In the grand tapestry of anime, there exists a realm where shallow ecchi plots frolic alongside almost-decent fights, akin to a whimsical ballet of predictable narratives. Enter Mato Seihei no Slave, where the world's defense hinges not on valiant warriors, but on anime waifus showcasing their formidable combat prowess. Our protagonist, a man in a sea of celestial femininity, is sadly devoid of battle acumen but excels as the ultimate...househusband, mastering the culinary arts and domestic chores with unparalleled finesse.In a peculiar twist of fate, our hapless hero finds himself enslaved by a sultry anime waifu. However, fear not, dear reader, for this is not a descent into the realms of hentai; it is a journey into the lewd, a tantalizing dance along the precipice of decency.As our protagonist toils away, cleaning the waifus' base with unbridled dedication, a contractual clause demands a certain... amorous compensation for his efforts. A plot element that dances on the fringes of suggestive, inviting you to explore a world where lewdness meets power dynamics.Now, should this concoction of ecchi escapades, battle sequences of questionable decency, and hints at a deeper plot tickle your fancy, then rejoice, for Mato Seihei no Slave might be your cup of tea. Yet, for a discerning viewer seeking substance beyond the surface, a lingering suspicion emerges—that beneath the veil of suggestive intrigue, the promise of a profound narrative may be but a fleeting illusion.In the vast landscape of anime offerings, this one, my dear reader, is a niche that beckons to those who revel in the art of waifus, lewd contracts, and the curious interplay of ecchi and pseudo-deep plotlines. A realm where domestic prowess and sensual rewards converge in a dance of... well, perhaps not cosmic significance, but certainly of peculiar entertainment value. househusband, mastering the culinary arts and domestic chores with unparalleled finesse.In a peculiar twist of fate, our hapless hero finds himself enslaved by a sultry anime waifu.

Anyone who\'ve seen this show will tell you that it\'s one of the most popular shows of that time period, when anime was just about slowly going into the mainstream. And based off on one of the most prominent characters of that series, another work is created, and...has undoubtedly become the author\'s next hit, which would become Mato Seihei no Slave a.k.a Chained Soldier (honestly, what a stupid localized name). And since this Winter season is where the cultured degeneracy amps a notch thanks to this and Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete a.k.a Gushing Over Magical Girls, as a manga reader, I was expecting at least a somewhat decent adaptation to translate the well-regarded source material into anime. Sadly, that is where all my excitement is ripped to shreds.The world of Mato Seihei is actually quite interesting, taking a fair few cues from and sticking true to the action-dark fantasy genre duo which Takahiro has become famous for since Akame ga Kill!. The dark-fantasy vibes, ranging from a dystopian Japan where gates to another dimension known as Mato began popping up out of nowhere, sprouts monsters known as Shuuki wrecking the inhabitants of Earth. To combat this, the resources called ""Peaches"", when consumed by only women, grant them supernatural powers to keep the Shuuki out of bay within reach from the portals. And it\'s where in one of these portals that the main MC Yuuki Wakura finds himself entangled into a Mato Mishap, only to find himself facing not just the Shuuki, but also Kyouka Uzen, the 7th Squad Commander of the Demon Defense Force. Fearing for the safety of his life, he consents to Kyouka\'s enslaving him to rid of the Shuuki, turning him into not just a capable chained soldier, but also a slave of which his power help aid her in revealing into her untapped potential. Of course, what\'s a slave without his reward, and that\'s where Mato Seihei ups the ante on the sexual innuendos, making it a defining trait of the entire source material. As Yuuki retains his standing in the Mato world as a caretaker of the 7th Squad to help Kyouka ascend in rank into becoming the Supreme Commander of the Demon Defense Force, he will find mysteries within the Mato world that connect dearly to him.If you haven\'t noticed well enough, doesn\'t Kyouka Uzen resemble one of the characters in Akame ga Kill!? The eagle-eyed among you will realize that she is the embodient of Esdeath, and almost every inch of her character traits come straight from her, albeit a less tamed version when it becomes to the extreme. Together with Yuuki and the other girls of the 7th Squad: Himari Azuma, Shushu Suruga and Nei Okawamura, they\'re only a handful of what makes up the Demon Defense Force, all responsible for distinct areas where potential Shuuki may reside and appear from. As for Yuuki himself, he isn\'t a bad character, but he\'s kinda of bland, and by the appearance from the girls, a genuine caretaker to a literate power-up tool that like Kyouka, is able to take the girls\' distinct powers to new heights, which at least makes him a valuable slave.As for the girls of Mato Seihei, there have always been the competition for Best Girl of the series, and at least for the anime, we\'re blessed with a few standouts. Of course, Kyouka herself would be one, with the affinity of a clear level-headed leader, with Shushu being the clear next with her big assets, and both Himari and Kei looking up to Yuuki as just a companion within the small squad. Turn your head, and you have the 6th Squad members of leader Tenka Izumo, Himari\'s estranged sister of Yachiho and Shushu\'s match of Sahara Wakasa. Manga readers will already know that between the squad commanders, no girl has displayed as much rizz as Tenka, whom even in the face of trouble, still manages to assert her dominance, both to Yuuki and her enemies with her overwhelming Ame-no-Mitori space-time power, with an intellgent and exquisite mind-over-matter function. Anime onlies, now you know.Sadly, the production of the anime has been the biggest Elephant in the Room, with Seven Arcs at the helm. I mean, I don\'t expect the studio to have good animation, but in my very humble opinion, the studio does not have the capability to handle action all that well. It\'s very foretelling that as the anime progresses, the reliance on CGI (especially for Yuuki\'s slave transformation and the Shuuki) becomes a necessity to combat the shortcomings from such an action-packed series like Mato Seihei. Sure, Seven Arcs may have done both the Trinity Seven and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha series, but both of those series are from the pre-2020s, at a time where animation wasn\'t the priority, but looking distinctive to stand out from the pack. Nowadays with so much sakuga going around, Mato Seihei just looks like a low-effort ball from people who don\'t understand how to make decent adaptations, and it all stems from one person: Junji Nishimura, whom in my opinion, is not the director that you want to lead a high-profile show like this. Even with the show being led by a new debut episode director of Gorou Kuji, there\'s just no saving the anime in this disappointing state that instead of being pumped for more action-intense fights, these battles just become boring as time passes.The music is at least decent, though the OST is nothing memorable. At first, I wanted to like Akari Kitou\'s OP song, but it just felt so dragged out that the song becomes just as uninteresting as the visuals themselves. At the very least, Maaya Uchida\'s ED is somewhat in the realm of creativeness, expressing the 6 main and supporting girls, especially Tenka (since you already know the reason why she\'s featured quite a lot). The song, like the OP, is just borderline mediocre to fine.As an AniManga fan, you know when your favourite source materials have anime adaptations that don\'t live up to the expectations, you\'re bound for a bad time, and that\'s my sole expression when it comes to Mato Seihei no Slave.

But, after a few episodes, i do not see much progress in the plot and is more focused on the MC interactions with the other female characters. The antagonists just get squashed like bugs. Gets quite repetitive and is a waste of 8 episodes so far.However, lets be honest here, this anime is marketed towards a male audience...and to sell those uncensored dvds. Anyone who was not put off by the NFSW slave + master premise knows what they are getting into.Heck, id rather watch Highschool DxD again! It is much better in terms of SIZE, story and animation. and to sell those uncensored dvds.

It is much better in terms of SIZE, story and animation.', 'Chained Soldier was one of the best series I\'ve seen in awhile. It doesn\'t do anything better than any other series in particular, however the combination of elements really come together for an enthralling watch. First and foremost, this is an ecchi show and it doesn\'t pretend to be anything but that. With that said, it has a surprising amount of depth to it, whether it be in terms of relationship building, story progression, character development, or world building. I was honestly surprised how well the events of the story were conveyed.For a brief synopsis, our main character is Yuuki Wakura, a listless man...searching for an occupation. The world he lives is not too dissimilar to our own, except females have obtained magical abilities. The abilities are a side effect of an existing alternate dimension, the Mato dimension, from which monsters will periodically cross over to attack the human realm or bring humans back into. Since women are the only ones able to wield magic, the defense of the human dimension falls on them, making the Anti-Demon Corps.In the first episode, we\'re shown that Yuuki\'s sister Aoba has disappeared prior to the events of the series, but we don’t know what happened exactly. This prompts Yuuki to want to become hero, so others don\'t suffer his sister\'s fate. This is somewhat of a weak motivation for his proclaimed desire to become a hero in my opinion, but it\'s not so incredibly far fetched either. Regardless it’s this reasoning he chooses to become a ""slave"" to the commander Kyouka of the Anti-Demon Corps, when he’s unexpectedly transported through a gate to the Mato dimension. It\'s his agreeance to becoming Kyouka\'s slave that he is able to acquire power from her ability of the same name and escape the ambush of monsters he was transported into. I don’t want to go into a full synopsis, but characters, setting, and story all crank into high gear for the rest of the series.To start, Yuuki is just great. He\'s not so much of a bada$$ that it feels unrealistic or unachievable, but also not so much of a wimp you lose all respect (looking at you Takemichi - Tokyo Revengers). He has a story I can generally vibe with and had no problems following him for the story. I also appreciate his actions and motivations, and seeing how he grows throughout the series. His character is just done incredibly well in my opinion. They fleshed it out to a significant degree from the start, but also left room for him to grow.This leads me to the women of division 6 and 7. The show definitely provides an impression that men are not taken too seriously because of their lack of powers. This is conveyed incredibly well though, because of the obvious lunacy of this worlds setting. The girls all respond to Yuuki’s presence in a variety of ways, whether it be through indifference, concern, friendship, teasing, or attempted bonding. Each interaction had its own unique feel to it as well. Kyouka clearly does not warm up to Yuuki immediately, but slowly starts to depend on him as the show progresses and even starts to get jealous at points. I loved seeing her subtle vulnerabilities being shown sporadically throughout the series, especially given her tough facade. Similar to Kyouka, Himari is cold to Yuuki from the get go…I’m not sure her reasoning aside from maybe seeing him as a distraction from her goal to become stronger. Regardless, when she is given the opportunity to duel her sister, she is somewhat forced to interact/train with him. These episodes with Himari are perfection imo. Not only are we treated to both lewd and hilarious occurrences, but we see growth from an initially unlikeable character and a bond between these two that I considered incredibly heartwarming. Shushu’s character was surprisingly quaint as well, which becomes a theme. She starts off quirky, aloof, and somewhat perplexing, but as she gets to understand Yuuki she realizes the importance of love and just men in general. She’s no longer careless and misdirected by the end of the series. To me, Shushu showed the largest amount of growth of all the characters. Each interaction Yuuki has with his fellow female “military” members is so quaint and bring an unexpectedly welcome amount of both comedy and ecchi.Speaking of comedy and ecchi, I loved how they were incorporated into the series. To me, as an ecchi fan, I was happy to see the amount of degeneracy shown, and it’s done in an interesting way with levity. It also enables a lot of the comedy to occur, which was effective here. The fact it was fully uncensored gives it major bonus points as well. As degenerate as it was though, it still left room for a great story and set of characters. To be honest, I wouldn\'t consider myself one to like the idea of becoming subservient to anyone, however, Chained Soldier really makes it seem more appealing XD. It\'s not one sided either, everything seems to have a fair trade off. For example, Yuuki receives rewards for being a \'slave"" to Kyouka, in which she has no control over his subconscious desires (but agrees to for the overwhelming power he provides).The abilities shown are all unique and intriguing. I consistently looked forward to seeing the next revealed abilities of any new character. The cg animation definitely left a lot to be desired but were done well for the most part, it\'s not particularly jarring. What really resonated with me was the relationships built. The dynamic of characters toward the end of the series was really great to watch and I personally couldn\'t wait for more.In reference to Yuuki’s sister Aoba, it’s, in my opinion, here where the story gains depth. Up to her introduction at the start, this series is just a well directed ecchi in a complicated setting. The revelation about her disappearance adds a complex dilemma I personally would’ve had trouble resolving. Seeing Yuuki and her life together before her disappearance was great and made the situation Yuuki is in, in episode 1, bittersweet.To end, when you watch Chained Soldier, you know what you\'re getting into within a few minutes. In my opinion, this is not a series looking for deep introspection or philosophical discussions. Its only intent is to entertain (whether it be via comedy, ecchi, romance, or action). I\'ve read through several reviews for Chained Soldier. Some of the negative ones have comments saying this series has things like slavery, sexism, attempted grape, SA, physical abuse, blackmail…and more buzz words to try and indicate how vile this series is. Over sensitive individuals like this are why we can\'t have nice things in the west, and why I rely on Japan so heavily now. Most of the events in the series are literally there for ecchi and/or comedic purposes. I’ll admit,this is definitely not a show for everyone. There is wonky cg animation at times, characters could stand to have more individuality, there could be a stronger plot, more drama/depth, and a variety of other small gripes. If you start watching it while comprehending the intent, however, it’s a very enjoyable experience for its short 12 episodes…so much so that I binged it in one evening. Chained Soldier is obviously no icon of modern anime, but it does its job better than most others in the same genre. I highly recommend Chained Soldier and hope to see more series like this in the future, along with a season 2. searching for an occupation.

Nothing groundbreaking, sure, but interesting enough to make me pay attention to more than just the lewd scenes.Honestly, if this anime doesn't get a second season, I'm considering going to the manga. "", ""The ecchi that had the most potential but they decided to be afraid of success.This work is well known for its ecchi more than anything else. Those of us who made the decision to watch it knew that its strongest appeal would be the fights and fanservice. The bad thing is that the worst of the work is just what we expected the most, the fights and the fanservice. I would like to take the story into account so I can give it some extra points, but they don't even take it seriously. The only thing the anime seeks is to try to provide the...best settings for the reward scenes.The fanservice isn't even good enough to make it worth watching 12 episodes.

I had read the manga a long time ago, before the anime adaptation began airing. I thought it would be interesting to revisit the story through the anime. However, after watching the entire season, I must admit I\'m disappointed.When I started reading the manga, around a year ago, I had hopes for a compelling storyline. However, after delving into it, I found myself encountering repetitive content in each chapter. There seemed to be a lack of character development, which made it hard for me to get invested in the story. While I understand that sometimes it takes time...for a plot to unfold, after 25 chapters, I expected more progress.As for the anime adaptation, it fell short of my expectations. The pacing felt rushed, with numerous scenes cut short, ultimately damaging any chance for proper character development. Additionally, the animation quality was lackluster, failing to captivate me visually. The ecchi scenes, which could have added some excitement, were heavily censored, diminishing my enjoyment even further.Comparing the two mediums, I would say the manga is the better option. Despite its flaws, the artwork remains commendable, providing some redeeming qualities. However, I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend either to someone unless they have ample free time and a strong interest in the genre.Given my disappointment with the first season, I have little hope for a second season. It\'s unfortunate, but I doubt the series will improve significantly without addressing these issues. for a plot to unfold, after 25 chapters, I expected more progress.As for the anime adaptation, it fell short of my expectations.

Indeed, for the first and second episodes I was quite no understand about this anime, especially in the story and background of the incident location, slowly but surely I started to understand that they were in a different world and were tasked with protecting there.For Harem or Echi here it is still in a safe condition, not excessive, let alone making the audience horny, this is just my opinion, whether anyone else's.This is different from...the Ecchi anime that I often see, most of which show too much lewdness compared to the progress of the story, and this actually makes me disgusted to see it.Indeed, this anime tells about slavery, but only that, there is no such thing as Lucky Sukebe, or a little bit of perverted things for no reason.The MC himself is also not stupid, he is strong and has his own convictions, not easily tempted by perverted things.In my opinion, the character design is quite good, perfect, not made randomly.When fighting is also quite good, not stiff and not too much drama with unclear nonsense.I also think comedy is funny, it even makes me laugh at some comedies, and this doesn't make me bored watching it.The point is, don't judge something you don't know and don't immediately judge something as bad before you see everything.I quite like this anime because:The fighting action is good.The characters are beautiful.The MC is not bad.Echi is not excessive.This anime focuses more on story progress rather than perverted things.In addition, there is a little romance too. the Ecchi anime that I often see, most of which show too much lewdness compared to the progress of the story, and this actually makes me disgusted to see it.Indeed, this anime tells about slavery, but only that, there is no such thing as Lucky Sukebe, or a little bit of perverted things for no reason.The MC himself is also not stupid, he is strong and has his own convictions, not easily tempted by perverted things.In my opinion, the character design is quite good, perfect, not made randomly.When fighting is also quite good, not stiff and not too much drama with unclear nonsense.I also think comedy is funny, it even makes me laugh at some comedies, and this doesn't make me bored watching it.The point is, don't judge something you don't know and don't immediately judge something as bad before you see everything.I quite like this anime because:The fighting action is good.The characters are beautiful.The MC is not bad.Echi is not excessive.This anime focuses more on story progress rather than perverted things.In addition, there is a little romance too."", ""The only thing stopped me from dropping this anime is only one character!!!!!...Tenka!!!!!!That's it.. this anime without Tenka doesn't worth watching at all.. this is peak feminism and if u are a submissive boy this anime suits u very well otherwise it's just cringe!!!

I will explain.The anime does have a few good ideas on paper, but it\'s like the skin of the body, but nothing on the inside. There isn\'t any bones, no muscles, and no organs. The show doesn\'t really dedicate itself in digging deep into any aspect. The characters are barely serviceable and what you know about these people from their introduction is largely the same by episode 12.Yuuki, the main character, lives in a world where women have power by eating ""peaches"" from another realm, but...men can\'t access this power. The reason why men also can\'t be empowered is never explained.Yuuki really does make Deku from Boko no Hero seem like deep character. Yuuki likes cleaning and wants to be a hero....and that\'s the ""be all and end all"" sum of his character. He eventually gets transported to Mato and is rescued from monsters by the female MC, Kyouka. They find themselves in a bad pinch and she tells him that the only way that they can be saved is if he becomes her slave(relating to her power). Somehow and without an explanation, Yuuki understands that to accept this offer he has to lick her finger.No, you did not mis-read that. He licks her finger.When the contract is complete, he becomes a huge white monster. It is never explained why he changes form. It also never explains why other creatures that are slaves of Kyouka don\'t change into another form.Yuuki is later introduced to Kyouka\'s military division members. These are girls who barely have any background info and the show doesn\'t really explore these characters. So, we have a male with a complete surrounding cast of females......can you guess what happens? If you guessed that there is a harem trope then you would be correct. What makes it bad though is that the girls in this show want Yuuki for little to no reason. What a cliche.Now, all of this is bad and I can mention other bad things about the show, but I will skip to the end and just tell you how this anime insults your intelligence and disdains you, the viewer. Whenever, Yuuki transforms to a creature by Kyouka\'s power he eventually has to be ""rewarded"". This is the requirement for Kyouka to use her power. It is never explained why she\'s the sole person that has such a stipulation to use her power. In any event, Yuuki\'s ""reward"" is always something perverted....and it feels like the show is trying to cover up it\'s shortcomings and laziness by adding these perverted things.Of course there are perverted anime out there, but this show tries to represent itself as something serious.....but will try to distract you by such an easy way ""out"" to avoid from taking time to think about it\'s faults.

This show is probably not for you if you're looking for a deeper plot, but it's clear that it's not attempting to be one. It's a lighthearted show with occasional ecchi content that's quite watchable.The plot isn't too crazy: parallel worlds, bad guys that enter the human realm and have the potential to kill or kidnap people, and a defense force that is made up exclusively of women because they are the only ones with abilities in this universe...to oppose the bad guys. But, surprise! Even though he is a man, the MC is involved in something :PI promise there aren't many fanservice scenes in this show; either I'm dreaming or I remember the manga having a ton of them. Furthermore, because Kyouka has to give Yuuki something every time she uses her slave powers, this content isn't overly insistent for the sole purpose of fanservice or ecchi content. Rather, it serves a purpose in the plot.Although the animation studio is not among the most prominent, it was still done fairly well for modern anime, with some decent CGI used occasionally that didn't look out of place unlike some other shows.I only heard the opening and ending themes once, and consequently skipped them the first time I watched an episode, so I can't really comment on the soundtrack. to oppose the bad guys.

Unfortunately the story just couldn’t seem to get it up. Our titular character, and the majority of the cast were pretty dry in the end. The animation and the action were actually decent, and it was fun watching everyone get licked. There was one great moment of character driven story between two sisters, but the rest was hard to swallow, and otherwise the plot on the hole felt really forced.

It's not something I would usually watch, and watching it reminded me why (although there was another anime this season that countered that reasoning). This is what I would describe as mid ecchi. Yes, it has a decent plot for what it is, a solid cast of characters, and some okay ecchi scenes. So if that sounds like your cup of tea, then go for it. However, in the end, it just all ends up feeling cheap.The story is pretty simple and not...something I found myself caring for. Some of the characters have nice designs, and I like a couple of them, but overall, it's just something any other anime could pull off. The animation is pretty standard, but then it delves into the use of some pretty mid CGI for certain fight scenes, which just adds to the soulless feel of the anime as a whole.Then there's the ecchi part of it. Fan service itself is not something I'm against; it can and has been used to great extents and can improve anime if used correctly. But here, it just felt cheap and was kind of halfheartedly inserted with no feeling of real behind it. If these kinds of anime are what you like, I can't blame you.

You know the type of anime where some guy who is doing nothing wrong is just abused by a bunch of women.Synopsis: There exists another world filled with demons that are called Shuuki. In order to combat these demons an all female defense force was created. These women are granted special powers by these magical fruits that only grants powers to women (because reasons).The MC named Yuuki (a name that sounds very similar to Shuuki...) is attacked but saved by Kyouka a member of the defense force. Her ability is to enslave a living creature and unlock its...full power. She ends up having to use it on Yuuki which unlocks his full power. Now Yuuki can turn into a Shuuki.Yuuki's transformation is triggered in a very fetishy way. Either by licking Kyouka or one of her clothes item.Yuuki gets to join the defense force as a slave to Kyouka.His tasks are mainly to be a servant for Kyouka and her squad of annoying c*nts.One of the downsides to Kyouka's power of enslavement is that she has to reward the slave with their subconscious desire. The Shuuki she enslaved typically just require meat. But apparently Yuuki's subconscious desire is to be Kyouka's gimp ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯If another woman rides Yuuki they also have to give into his subconscious desires.The power makes no sense but its a good excuse for fanservice so i guess i shouldn't complain...There is not one well written character in this. The women are all awful. And the MC isnt that interesting either.All the girls want to f*ck Yuuki. Cant blame them since there are no dudes around...The anime is full of forced drama with characters being condescending for no real reason. You'd think having to fight monsters would be enough conflict but they had to throw in manufactured conflict and infighting.The conflict is so forced that they had to throw in the obligatory tournament where two different squads decide to have a contest of which is better.

These dimensions contain an entirely different world where monsters known as Shuuki brainlessly kill everything in sight.  They're actually quite aggressive.  Yuuki Wakura, an every day high school, gets warped to one of these and are saved by the 7th Division Anti-Demon Corps.  They are headed up by Kyouka Uzen, who has the power to enslave a Shuuki to do her bidding - which usually results in them fighting for her.  Out of desperation, she...uses it on Yuuki and it changes him into a Shuuki-like being, but he has full control over the immense strength that this newfound power gives him.  With dreams of becoming a hero, he decides to join the Anti-Demon Corps, which is where our story takes us.Yuuki isn't a great main character.  He's your typical harem main character who is pretty unremarkable on his own.  Unfortunately, it gets worse when we learn that Kyouka's ability to change Yuuki into a Shuuki has a fan-service related drawback, and it's about as silly as you can probably imagine.  Kyouka's an okay character - she has an ambition to run the entire Anti-Demon Corps. because of her past and trained immensely hard to become a master with her sword.  She doesn't develop all that much as the series goes on, though her interactions with Yuuki take some needed steps forward.  Himari, Shushu and Nei make up the rest of the 7th Divison, and have some better moments, though most of those are reserved for about halfway through when they introduce the 6th Division unit into the story.  Once we had that trio, the interactions are much better.  The comradery within the squads are very evident, and even past having the same goal, they work really well together once it's time to suit up.Shikoku is the big baddy here and we don't really learn much about her, outside of the fact that she's calling the shots.  Many of her underlings pale in comparison to her strength, but her important screen time likely comes after the conclusion of the current storyline.  Some of the other villains they use here have some pretty tragic backstories, which I appreciated.  You can tell there is at least some attempt to tell a decent story, even if there are parts that are rather silly.  The underlings directly under Shikoku are pretty mediocre though.  They're just stronger Shuuki with different powers.There are far too many points in this series that gets far too silly.  Yuuki is essentially recruited to be a cleaner to the house that the 7th Division lives in whenever they are not fighting Shuuki.  It's a weird way to keep hin within the Mato world.  What's less than ideal is that after the first episode or two, the story stays within that world for the rest of the series.  This leads to certain storylines starting to get dry, even if the specific storylines along the way are different.  Attempt to kill Shuuki, withdraw, relax, repeat.  It unfortunately gets rather old.The story ends on an okay note, but it's really hard to tell how much more story there is here.

(Story: 6/10, Characters: 7/10)Art: We have some words with regards to the animation.  First of all, be warned that the fan service in this series gets very heavy - there are multiple instances of full nudity on our female cast, many times of which are the result of Yuuki's apparently gross mind.  This level of fan service is never 'really' warranted in anime series, much less one about killing demons in another dimension.  Some of the other animation was decent otherwise.  Fighting scenes are packed pretty heavily with CG, but I strangely didn't completely hate it.  It works sometimes, others it doesn't.  It's most reserved for the Shuuki animations and it certainly made them pop out.  Whether that's a good thing or not may vary by audience.

(7/10)Overall: Chained Soldier is very okay all throughout, even with the over-the-top fan service.  The best character moments were on display when both units were working together, but there characters feel almost forgettable if you only get a few episodes in.

(7/10)"", 'Mato Seihei was one of the most hyped adaptations of the year and sadly failed to live up to expectations. It never managed to capture the magic of the manga and just felt like a flat, soulless seasonal.I’ve read the manga for the past year or so and was pretty excited when this was announced. I knew the battles could be tricky to animate, but I at least had hope the erotica content would be handled well. I mean, that is the main selling point to the story after all.. but my hopes and dreams were quickly dashed within a couple episodes of this....Scenes were changed or omitted from manga chapters and the ones we did get, were just mediocre. There’s a handful of decent scenes, but it’s just not enough considering that’s what made this series famous.The story has never been the strongest part of this series, but it is decent. Basically your usual bleach style set up of an MC unknowingly being recruited to join a secret evil fighting organisation. What carries the story is the characters and the character interactions. I do think the studio were able to nail the personalities of the girls and the seiyuus were excellent. You can really get a sense of the various quirks of each character. I just couldn’t help feeling that something felt “off” in this one. Whether it was the skipped chapters or cut scenes, I’m not sure, but it didn’t feel like the same story I anxiously waited to read chapters of and I think the current score differential underlines that being an issue for many fans.The other big thing we have to talk about is the CGI. It’s bad, like really bad. Because of the nature of the battles in this series, I understand CGI was probably a necessity, but there’s such a huge contrast with how it’s used here vs say a Synduality Noir(also from this season). It looks really out of place and jarring here. The 2D action scenes aren’t exactly anything to write home about either.Overall, to say I’m disappointed in this adaptation would be an understatement. While the manga isn’t the best thing in the world, it knows what it’s trying to be and succeeds in it. Great art, fights and characters. You’d think translating that to the anime medium wouldn’t be too difficult, but clearly it was an issue for this studio.Mato Seihei gets 6, out of 10.

In the meantime, watch highschool DxD for a similar premiseYou can simply expect what is going to happen every episode, the only thing I didn't expect is the fact that the mc and his sister didn't bang. The artstyle looks like ass, too much cg that sort of blends in assuming you are a blind man in his 60s which I am currently not. Even though I didn't enjoy the show, I watched it with my buddy on discord and he hated it too.

I genuinely can't think of a single factor that was handled even remotely well in this. Some of the worst CGI I've seen in an anime, muted dull color schemes, voice actors that do not fit their characters in the slightest (I like Maaya Uchida but Tenka should've been voiced by Maaya Sakamoto instead), extremely poor pacing that made watching this a total slog, and the fight choreography was painful to watch. The manga, by no means perfect and more of a guilty pleasure than anything, at least has a distinct style and personality,...and the anime fails to capture any of it.

I loved that the female heros take their ground and they aren't afraid of showing their feelings for the MC and expressing themselves to him. Tenka, of course, stole the show for herself. I really loved her.The design of the characters are really pretty, the female heros are really different from one to another, at first i thought that the animation wouldn't be as good as...an average show but i was wrong, the ecchi parts were well made.  I particularly liked their clothes a lot, the ARMY uniform is really beautiful.If you like ecchi, you will certainly like this show, even because the ecchi is pretty good fit in the story, it is not annoying, like fire force that, in my opinion, have some scenes that doesn't make any sense. an average show but i was wrong, the ecchi parts were well made.

The main appeal of Chained Soldier is fanservice. Specifically, what the internet likes to call “Dommy Mommy” fanservice. So does Chained Soldier deliver? Well, not really…Chained Soldier follows protagonist Yuuki as he falls into the mysterious realm called “Mato” where he is ambushed by monsters- only to be saved by Kyouka Uzen. He then discovers that he has the ability to enhance others powers. Yuuki then (voluntarily) becomes Kyouka’s servant, where he helps her and the rest of Kyouka’s squad fight the mysterious Shuuki. Essentially, Chained Soldier is a fairly typical “Boy gains...powers, fights monsters and gains a Harem of cute girls” show and Chained Soldier does little to change or elaborate upon this premise. The characters of the show are equally basic with, in most cases, little character development occurring. In essence, Chained Soldiers plot and characters are not bad but equally, not great. With nothing to distinguish or condemn it’s plot, Chained Soldier was always going to live or die by the quality of its fanservice. Unfortunately, Chained Soldiers fanservice feels distinctly “muted”. The intended appeal of Chained Soldier is obvious. Main girl Kyouka Uzen is a military officer with strong Dominatrix vibes In fact she comes off as looking like a teenage version of Akame Ga Kills Esdeath (in fact both works share the same author). Clearly, Chained Soldier is intended to appeal to fans of Dominant women. An unfortunately under-represented demographic. However, for me, one of the main appeals of such characters was the combination of agency and pro-activeness, both Romantically, Sexually and personally. In contrast to most typical anime girls, these women are more self-confident, less shy of their own affections and far more pro-active in a relationship. In essence, their whole appeal is based on confidence and agency. Emphasis on the Agency. So what does Chained Soldier do? Take away their agency. Most of the fanservice comes from Yuuki’s power, which, in exchange for enhancing powers, demands a reward from the person reviving the reward. Usually (but not exclusively), this reward comes in the form of Dominant female behaviour. This means that whilst the acts are dominant, the motivation is not. These characters are doing it because they are required to not because they want to. Mercifully, there is one exception, one of Kyouka’s rival squad captains, Tenka. In general however, this lack of agency on the part of the main female characters makes the fanservice come across as distinctly Anti-Climactic.Overall, for what it is, Chained Soldier has a unique premise and it must be said that the show does keep its underage characters far away from the fanservice. However the fanservice itself is too muted to appeal to the fanservice crowd but the plot too generic to satisfy anyone  else. The result is a show that promises much, but delivers little, and in so doing, satisfies no one. powers, fights monsters and gains a Harem of cute girls” show and Chained Soldier does little to change or elaborate upon this premise.

The story is entertaining, the characters are enjoyable, the fanservice is nice. I enjoyed watching it, and it also made me read the manga and I really recommend you read it too. The story keeps being good and it gets even better.The MC, Yukki, turns into a monster-like form and is basically used as a fighting “pet” as in some sort of an MMORPG, or whatever (I know, it’s not the best comparison, but cut me some slack). And that is where the ecchi comes in. After turning back to his human form, the girl who...was using him has to give him a reward in form of something naughty. Speaking of the reward, it’s a pretty interesting concept, because sometimes it seems like the reward fits Yuki’s desires, other times it seems like it’s something the girl wants – and I’d say those two things kind of blend together.Another nice fact is that monster form Yuki has different powers and shape depending on which girl is riding him.Aside from Yuki, the girls in this anime are amazing. Yuki’s master, Kyouka, is nice to begin with, but damn are the other girls great too. I’d write a thesis if I were to mention each of them in detail. I’ll just mention Tenka, who is really thirsty for our MC and gives him rewards even without riding him. I’ll also mention Yuki’s sister, who is also a really nice character. She is a real brocon, but a cute brocon. Mentioning his sister, the fact that she basically got turned into a humanoid Shuki, along with the other girls, also brings some nice depth into the story.Speaking of humanoid Shuki, the introduction of the Gods of Thunder is also interesting for the story.Overall, this was a really entertaining anime and I hope it gets a second season, because I think it deserves it. The story is good and it’s full of amazing girls, so that you can’t decide who the best girl is (well, at least I can’t).

One downside is the animation of Shuki and Yuki’s monster form, but I think it’s expected and it's not that bad.In the end, I think I can personally rate Mato Seihei no Slave a nice – 7.5/10."", 'This was by far my favorite anime this season. It made me hyped for every Thursday. There were definitely a lot of flaws with this adaptation. They left out some stuff, they censored some of it even in the uncensored broadcast, etc, but none of that was enough to ruin it for me. I really like the character designs in this show, and Tenka is one of my favorite anime characters period. The opening and ending are both great, and the chibi segments with Nei at the end were really cute. The voice acting was for the most part well cast as far as I...could tell. It made my day that we are getting a season two. If you do not like the anime, the manga is also really good (most would say better). could tell. It made my day that we are getting a season two. If you do not like the anime, the manga is also really good (most would say better).', ""Sad thing about this anime is that if it was not based on the manga it would probably be slightly more enjoyable. But seeing how majority of people who saw it were original manga fans I was expecting it to be roasted, and that roast was for good reason in the end.I will also judge it by manga seeing hown it is after all an adaptation, ans with that let us begin:Story: the premise is interesting to a degree, but nothing we have not seen so far. A dimensional gate opens in the Tokyo area and bunch od daemons starts invading. Entire hellish dimension (called...Mato in story) is only as big as Tokyo area for some reason,and it is an environment where humans can live with some difficulty. What makes this story unique are the powers which are only usable by women and one specific power tied to our MC. Other than that there is still secrets to be explored and conflits to resolve but they are only appearing later on in story and many of them are still not resolved. So this entire anime is basically introduction story and thus only interesting to a degree because of that. My grade: 5Sad thing is that the story in manga is much more interesting from the start as well as the world itself is more explored and some things were cut.Characters: not much to say here unfortunately. MC is as bland and ignorant as they go, all other major characters are females (of course) and they fall into typical stereotypes: serious kuudere commander with revenge plot, tsundere second in command who is hostile first and then sweet later on, charming but not very smart blonde girl who is all into fighting and a loli who by some miracle is not lewed even if this is ecchi. They are explored to a degree but none too deep, and all conflicts with MC are resolved in just one episode after they are introduced. Tenka is by far the best girl and she is not even in the main squad cast. Other characters are underrated (especially the bad guys, we barely know anything about them except they are bad and they hate humans for some reason) except the sister who is slightly more explored. My grade: 6.To be fair, by this point in manga we were still in the dark about many things but anime could at least give some hints.Animation and music: quite enjoyable. Animation was good overall, the battle scenes were great and I didn't notice downgrade anywhere while I was watching it. Music was nothing special but it did its part well enough. Kyouka and Tenka VA doing OP and ED with their characters appearing in them was nice touch. My grade: 7.Ecchi level: this needs its own cathegory because lets be real: most people were looking forward to this part of the anime. And boy, were they disappointed. Now, I didnt mention 'rewards' in story or animation segment as I was planning to speak separately about it. It is after all this franchise most unique thing, and it involves MC receiving a reward as compensation for using his powers and becoming slave in the first place. It first starts with Kyouka alone and later on others can also contribute (some even voluntary) and yes - even the loli character (but to be fair, they played it quite safe even in manga as the only thing she does is a kiss on the cheek).But for some reason, even if it had 18+ tag, the anime really went soft here. If I am to make comparison, if manga rewards were any XXX site than anime version would be girl on YouTube at the beach wearing nothing but her swimsuit. In some reward scenes they even covered breasts with their hands, despite being quite visible in manga. Now, I could understand playing it safe but this is ecchi anime and we also have Gushing over Magucal Girls this season which also had 18+ tag and who detroyed this anime in ecchiness. My grade: 6.Overall grade: 6. I personally gave it 8 as that was my enjoyment factor, but 6 or 7 is much more realistic grade.If they even make 2nd season it should preform much better as the story really picks up where they left it. That and please let them get more down with the ecchiness and season 2 could even score 8.

This show isn\'t interested in worryingly whitewashing some of the worst atrocities in human history for the sake of sad incels who wish they had subservient waifu, sex slaves. This is a battle-harem anime about a guy who can turn into a Kaiju monster under the chained leash of his smoking hot commander Waifu\'s ability. The price she pays for using him in battle is to reward him with whatever he subconsciously desires after he\'s turned back, which...in his case is to have his balls stepped on, his face buried betwixt her thighs as the main protagonist Yuuki takes off her tights or whatever kinky, surprisingly hot activities he subconsciously wants her to do to him. Degenerates assemble.In a world where only women get superpowers and portals leading to a place called Mato filled with monsters can open up can claim victims at random, aspiring hero Yuuki spends his time looking after the waifus (and his cute senpai) of the anti-Demon Corps 7th Corps as their housekeeper whilst he\'s not fighting monsters. It\'s a bit like Mother Of The Goddess Dormitory but with more action and without the paedophilia. Speaking of the action, it was shockingly good. Despite some ugly CGI, the animation is dynamic, fast-paced, and fun. What sets Chained Soldier apart from other action anime is its interesting set of powers wielded by the girls. Some are less interesting, like turning into a giant or turning arms into guns; however, some range from gaining super-strength whilst asleep to manipulating space and rewinding time by making Jojo poses. Even Commander Kyouka\'s enslaving ability is interesting in terms of how it can be implemented. She can even pass on the ability to other corp members, which empowers Yuuki in different ways.It also means they must reward Yuuki in different, increasingly lewd ways. Have you ever wondered what having a giant woman sit on you would be like? This show understands that if you\'re going to have ecchi scenes, you\'ve got to make them hot, and wow, did the animators at Seven Arcs understand the assignment given to them? The kinky slave stuff is also a genius way to expedition dump an entire military briefing or a world-building explanation to Yuuki without it becoming boring because you\'re too busy watching him having his lip bitten, panties flashed, titties rubbed against his back, or his balls stepped on.There are some problems. As I said earlier, the CGI can be a bit off-putting due to how ugly it can sometimes look. The first two episodes are also not very good because Yuuki comes across as a bit of a wimpy harem protagonist who constantly overreacts to seeing the slightest bit of skin. However, once you get past the first two episodes, it becomes easier to root for him, and the show becomes much more enjoyable to watch.Chain Solider is pretty good. It hits that sweet spot of not taking itself seriously enough to get away with all of its nonsense while telling an average action story. It won\'t be for everyone, but if you like good action and kinky Ecchi trash, then you\'ll get a kick out of this.7/10 Good. in his case is to have his balls stepped on, his face buried betwixt her thighs as the main protagonist Yuuki takes off her tights or whatever kinky, surprisingly hot activities he subconsciously wants her to do to him.

A mostly female cast is always cool and I really do think the characters were great, as far as harem protagonists go Yuuki was pretty solid and the girls were so much fun to watch. Their development was great and I think the power system was interesting too. And Tenka. Oh my god Tenka. I need you please hit me up. Anyways I really lived for the ""reward"" scenes if I\'m being honest they were kinda the highlight...for me like I looked forward to those more than most other things in this show but that\'s just a testament to how well they were executed. Whilst the action may have been lacking a little the fights were still fun and I wasn\'t really taken out of it by weaker CGI or anything like that.

It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. At least some ecchi anime at least have good animation and sexy scenes, while this is a trainwreck that uses 3D models for pretty much EVERYTHING that moves even slightly, perhaps some things that don’t move too. I am very surprised with just how low an anime can fall, the word ”pathetic” barely even begins to sum up how horrible it is.The manga had great art, fast pace, no unnecessary scenes or drama, lots of ecchi and it felt so lighthearted that even the abuse felt ok even though I’m more...of a sadist, because he didn’t feel as offensive as some doormat mcs, at least he’s got balls and gets stepped on because he likes it, not because he’s a wimp.Then enter the anime, some of the worst art I’ve ever seen in an anime with incredibly clear overuse of choppy and ugly 3D animated models (budget much?), messy and dragged out pace due to added drama and more ”political correctness”, hell, they changed a lot of parts completely and focused far too much on forced, artificial and horribly written drama, the writers for this are incredibly untalented. The ecchi is quite toned down and far worse due to bad art, it’s far from as lighthearted and fast paced, the mc feels more like a true abuse victim, ends up being written as a true wimp and doormat and the girls end up seeming far harsher due to the voice actors’ intonations and even newor changed dialogue lines.I detest the anime. It’s a train wreck, purely irredeemable gutter trash. It does everything wrong, not a single element is praiseworthy. Music, sfx, art, story, voice acting… It’s rare that everything ends up so wrong. It’s as if this is a joke to them. Clearly it’s just an attempt to grab some cash with zero love given to it. The manga is at least readable, although the story sucks there too, it’s made up for by the art, ecchi, cool scenes and pace that never stops for more than the bare minimum of drama and the characters are likable enough.Don’t waste your time, read the manga instead if the setting intrigues you. of a sadist, because he didn’t feel as offensive as some doormat mcs, at least he’s got balls and gets stepped on because he likes it, not because he’s a wimp.Then enter the anime, some of the worst art I’ve ever seen in an anime with incredibly clear overuse of choppy and ugly 3D animated models (budget much?), messy and dragged out pace due to added drama and more ”political correctness”, hell, they changed a lot of parts completely and focused far too much on forced, artificial and horribly written drama, the writers for this are incredibly untalented.

When the promos aired and the visuals started showing up on the Internet, many of us probably rolled our eyes as we see the amount of lascivious fan service. I confess to myself that as a manga reader, I came into the series for guilty pleasure rather than the story. While the premise doesn\'t seem entirely creatively bankrupt, it hardly sounds something that can be lucrative either. In our industry dominated by countless isekai, fantasy shows with cute girls, and fan service, Mato...Seihei No Slave didn\'t seem all that special at all.Takahiro\'s series isn\'t difficult to watch with a rather easy-to-follow plot. Right off the bat, we are given some background storytelling about the main protagonist Yuuki Wakura. Soon, we realize the Japan they are in has abnormal monsters known as \'Shuuki\'. Unfortunately for Yuuki, he comes across them and almost loses his life until being saved by the mysterious yet beautiful Kyouka Uzen. The catch though: he has to become her slave. That\'s right. The author wanted to pair up a normal young man with a female military soldier, or specifically the Chief of the Anti-Demon Corps 7th Unit. As naughty as it sounds, this show doesn\'t hide its intentions. We witness erotic kissing because as part of the show\'s plot, it\'s part of Yuuki\'s ""reward"". Wonder why this show has \'ecchi\' tagged under its genres? You don\'t need to look no further.I\'m not sure what the author is aiming for but the number of kisses Yuuki gets in this show far outclasses one of his well-known work, Akame ga Kill. Look, it\'s obvious the show adheres to fan service and glorifies its themes for those moments. Yuuki is essentially treated like a boy-toy who serve his master. Luckily for him, Kyouka is an honorable person and doesn\'t abuse Yuuki for her personal gains. However, she does become more possessive later on as she seems do develop geninue attachment to the boy. Nonetheless, Yuuki is the object of attention to a number of characters. With a domaint female roster, there\'s just no end to those rewards.However, I warn you that the show doesn\'t have exactly a stellar character cast when it comes to personalities or development. The majority of them are one dimensional and dead on arrival in terms of creativity. These include Himari, Shushu, Nei, Yachio, and even Tenka. Coming from different divisions, the female cast are poorly written with lack of character backgrounds. All of them are paired up with Yuuki for their own purposes, and mostly revolves around being a good-natured combat tool. Tenka is one character who seems to grow a deeper attachment towards him although this season only scratch the surface. Others such as Yachio seems to reluctantly accept Yuuki until they realize his importance in taking down the Shuuki.The plot kicks in from the start and throughout the show, we are given glimpses at Yuuki\'s past. There\'s not much depth outside what we know and the blame should be pointed to the pacing and length. This is a 12-cour show based off a manga that spans over 127 (at the time of this writing) chapters and counting. There\'s just no simple way to cram the material in and what we get is barely a tease. Nonetheless, you probably didn\'t stay here for the plot. It was obvious this show wanted to entertain for its fanservice and I suggest watching this in the uncensored version for justice.As it desires itself to be an action fantasy, I do question if the show wanted to maintain a mature way of storytelling. Sure, the animation quality is consistent and acceptable by adaptation standards. In fact, action scenes often strike as alluring and intense, with its crafted chereography. On the other hand, character reactions in this show can be questionable and ventures into meme-like territory. This mostly draws from Yuuki\'s cartoony reactions and perverted moments. The big wide eyes that seems to pop out easily makes him a punchable character. Even the female cast has their own goofy moments that drags down an attempt at more mature series. And of course, we can\'t talk about Mato Shihei no Slave without mentioning its fan service. It wanted to service the fans with ecchi through the usage of boobs, ass, and kisses. Some of these include french kissing all for the sake of entertainment so strap yourself in, this show really wants you to be serviced.Matoi Shihei no Slave is forgettable and a carbon copy of what modern shows of similar nature can accomplish. Only here, it added the idea of master-slave relationships. Romance really isn\'t a selling point, at least this season because those rewards are not based on love. Still, it\'s a 12-episode show and easily watchable with a bag of popcorn. Takahiro\'s body of work have been hits or misses throughout the years. This is one is a miss.

Now, I\'ve seen my fair share of ecchi genre animes that end up being one of the best things I\'ve ever seen, but this ain\'t it. Like the many people who have placed their reviews and based on my personal watch, this is a kink-filled fantasy with a dookie animation quality, dookie and boring personalities. With the literal 3rd episode, I already knew who the enemy was (spoiler it was the MC\'s sister). Ngl, the manga made it look interesting, I mean the idea of that hierarchy that women are higher...than men in this universe is quite eye-catching, but the way it was used was soooooo trash. The animation quality is so bad, the blending of the CGI with the background is definitely a no for me. And fr the MC is sooooo generic, like Deku even had more personality than this dude, and the other characters like Shushu ain\'t original. Nothing special about her or even the 2nd fem lead, Kyouka. Like her backstory is just meh, and I find it so ironic whenever they try to make the MC have those ""oh i\'m so weak, i gotta do smth"" and the next thing you know, he\'s licking Kyouka\'s boots and sniffing her sweaty-ahh shirt.To give you my pov, I personally love Kill la Kill\'s usage of ecchi, the characters end up semi-naked or full on naked or wear very revealing clothing because the clothes are beings and give the user its powers. But this freak show makes everything about sexual fantasies, girls harassing the main character, and AGHHH IM SO ANNOYED AHAHAHAHI wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone unless you want to feel ""not alone"" if you have these kinky fantasies that you can\'t commit to avoid allegations HAHAHAHAH than men in this universe is quite eye-catching, but the way it was used was soooooo trash.

If you're no fan of watching the anime having its self-insert like the author just shamelessly shows that he's a fan of this madness, you should probably stop what you're doing. This anime purely exhibits such dangerous energy that I am hindering myself from uttering those words. I don't think I need to elaborate further about the animation, it's nowhere near as bad as other CG animations go and you can see where MOST of the budget went into...this anime.What Chained Soldier does is purely fast-paced fanservice, like what you expect from pure action shows. Where, instead of 18 minutes of dedicated action sequences, you get 18 mins of dedicated fanservice. But there should be 21 minutes worth of content, right? Those extra 3 minutes are used, although haphazardly, to progress the story. The show knows you are only here for the insane amount of content and directly gives you what you came here for.The Chained Soldier's gourmet provides you with a plethora of different girls, you get a snobby girl who acts assertive, the very serious girl, and the called-best-girl of the anime like most anime with majority of female casts usually go. The only thing similar to them is their superiority to the MC, so prepare to watch MC get treated like an absolute slave. But it's okay since the MC is content with all this and thrives from a wicked sense of pervertedness from the girls' treatment of him. Being stared at with pure disgust, check. Getting blackmailed, check. Being called a pervert, check. But the girls still flock to him despite all of that? WIN WIN!So yeah, have fun watching this if your own projection of treatment is similar to this anime in any way. this anime.What Chained Soldier does is purely fast-paced fanservice, like what you expect from pure action shows.

Misaki no Mayoiga,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43755/Misaki_no_Mayoiga,"[""I am so happy I never saw the trailer and the MAL description for this movie before it was released was completely wrong  (it seems like it was based on the book which I haven't read yet and the movie changed things) because I got to go in blind. I was expecting a moving drama about 3 females of varying ages trying to find refuge from their traumatic backstories together that would make me cry. I got magical realism about a kind witch (not actually a witch but close enough) who adopts an orphan who lost her voice and a teenager who ran away...from her abusive father (rather than a woman running from her abusive husband as in the novel because married women are forbidden in anime I guess) and they live together in her magical, sentient house (Mayoiga) on a secluded peninsula along with youkai such as kappa, guardian dogs, and talking jizo statues. But in this world, not everything magical means humans good will...Again, they probably changed a lot from the original novel, but what we've ended up with is a tight, well-produced, immersive story with strong characters and well-proportioned whimsy and drama. No loose ends or sequel hooks, it tells the story it wanted to tell.So yeah, if you like found families and also magic and youkai, I recommend this movie. I already kind of watch it again. from her abusive father (rather than a woman running from her abusive husband as in the novel because married women are forbidden in anime I guess) and they live together in her magical, sentient house (Mayoiga) on a secluded peninsula along with youkai such as kappa, guardian dogs, and talking jizo statues.

I already kind of watch it again."", 'I vaguely remember hearing about this movie, Misaki no Mayoiga, on Anime News Network when it was first announced. Misaki no Mayoiga, with its English title being The House of the Lost on the Cape (Yeah, for the sake of brevity I\'m gonna keep using its Japanese title), is based on a 2015 novel by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and got adapted into the anime movie, which came out in 2021. The movie was mainly made as part of a project to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the terrible 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Fittingly enough, the anime seems to use said earthquake as a plot point....The promo art for the movie alone enticed me, and the premise seemed nice, so I decided to watch it once it came out. It\'s a good thing too, because as of this writing, Eleven Arts licensed it and is going to put it out on home video at the end of September. But I got to watch it online because I wanted to decide whether I liked it or not before buying or not buying it. Now that I\'ve seen it, I can wholeheartedly say...it\'s pretty cute. Nothing groundbreaking, but definitely not a bad movie by any means.The story focuses on two young girls, 17-year-old Yui and 8-year-old Hiyori. Yui ran away from home to escape an abusive family situation, and Hiyori lost her family in the earthquake, with the resulting trauma leaving her mute. The two of them become acquainted at a homeless shelter before getting picked up by a strange woman named Kiwa, who takes a liking to them to the point of pretending they\'re her grandchildren. She basically adopts them and takes them to her house in Kitsunezaki. Yui and Hiyori find out that the house is sentient, pretty much giving them whatever they need. With this, the three of them become a little family, and slowly but surely, Yui and Hiyori\'s damaged hearts begin to heal. But things start getting complicated when supernatural creatures such as kappa and komainu begin dropping in, and a malevolent force threatens the peace and safety Kiwa provided for Yui and Hiyori.Now, you\'re probably thinking to yourself ""Wait, a sentient house that gives its residents everything they need? Did this movie rip off Encanto?"" My answer to that is no, because while Encanto also uses the idea of a sentient house, it\'s not really based on any folklore. The word ""mayoiga"" translates to lavish or well-kept, and there\'s quite a bit of old Japanese folklore using that term to reference an abandoned but well-kept house found in remote parts of mountains or the general wilderness, so it\'s not like Misaki no Mayoiga just plagiarized that part of Encanto and dressed it up for its own use. It\'s like how Toei constantly reuses various concepts, cliches, and formulas for their magical girl anime, such as Sailor Moon and Pretty Cure. I know this is a weird thing to talk about, especially since other than the themes of family and the idea of a sentient house, the two movies are nothing alike, but I\'ve seen too many people be harassed and bullied over supposedly ""stealing"" ideas from other works that came long before it, even when said ideas are extremely vague, narrow, and arbitrary to the point where literally anyone can do their own take on them as long as it\'s not flat-out plagiarism. I mean, how many times has Mamoru Hosoda done movies involving virtual worlds in the internet?Alright, now onto the movie itself. The film is nicely and lavishly animated by David Production, who you\'ll know as the company that animated shows such as Cells At Work, Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, Fire Force, and the upcoming Undead Unluck anime. The backgrounds and set pieces are all nicely detailed without being overbearing, with bright colors that are easy on the eyes, the character designs are down-to-earth and a fairly nice mix of being both cartoony and realistic, and the actual animation is fairly smooth. Well, about as smooth as a mainly slice-of-life movie can afford to be. There are segments where Kiwa tells Yui and Hiyori various folk tales, and they\'re animated in an erratic, sketchy, brushwork art style akin to The Tale of Princess Kaguya, which works really wellI. f I had one complaint about the animation, it\'s that the scenes that take place during the night time are way too dark. They\'re so dark that you can barely make out who\'s there or what\'s going on. I don\'t have as much to say on the soundtrack, other than that it\'s pretty nice and does its job, and I didn\'t find the ending song to be very memorable.I\'m kind of mixed on the characters. On one hand, the stand outs are Yui and Hiyori, who get the most development throughout the movie and are the most three-dimensional. Yui is at first a guarded teenager who is wary of her new living arrangement and unable to accept kindness at face value after having dealt with an abusive father. Hiyori is a little kid who is trying to cope with the loss of her family, and the movie takes great care to have her personality come through via her facial expressions and body language without leaning into the exaggerated kind. They\'re fun to follow and are the best characters in the movie. On the other hand, Kiwa, the youkai, and the other townsfolk are kind of given the short end of the stick. The middle of the movie shows Yui and Hiyori interacting with the townsfolk, and they\'re a colorful bunch, but the movie doesn\'t really do anything with them, and their role in the final act of the film seems maudlin when the film doesn\'t try to flesh them out beyond their more positive traits. Plus, I felt like Kiwa leaned too much into the nice magical old lady stereotype, and we never do get to learn just what her deal is in terms of the final conflict.Personally, it felt to me like Misaki no Mayoiga was trying to be two different movies at once. The first half is mainly slice-of-life, and the second half introduces supernatural creatures and a pretty conventional final conflict which felt really out of place to me. I almost feel like the youkai were just shoved into the movie because the creators were afraid that a pure slice-of-life movie would bore their audience. Because of this, a lot of the ideas it presents in the last third don\'t get fleshed out as much as they need to, and as a result, Misaki no Mayoiga seems like it\'d be better suited as a TV series than a movie. But that\'s not to say the movie is bad in any way. Misaki no Mayoiga is a pleasant watch all around, even if it doesn\'t leave a strong impression, and I like it enough that I\'m absolutely going to buy it on home video when it comes out this month. This would probably be a cute movie to show to your kids if you want to get them into anime for the first time, beyond stuff like Pokemon and Ghibli. I have to admit though, it\'s really weird hearing Mana Ashida using a lower pitched voice, as I\'m so used to her usual cutesy kid voice, considering she started out as a child actress. But hey, I have no problem with it. It\'s great to see her expand her range both in terms of her voice and character types.So yeah, Misaki no Mayoiga isn\'t a movie that\'s going to bring the house down in any way. But it\'s a nice, wholesome, kick back and relax kind of movie that you can watch with your kids.

They live in the mountain but something strange is happening in that house. One moment, the young girl saw an old granny is talking to a Kappa. This is where the story becomes interesting when all of the myths are becoming alive! But sadly, I think the story is too short.Art (7)The art in this anime is good. I love the 3D Scene that they use for making the house and mountain. It looks...like a harvest moon game. But for 2D graphics, the quality is fine. I think they can improve their art in glow and shadow effects.Sound (8)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation.Character (6)The main character is not really memorable since they have fewer unique characters in my opinion. I think they should just put more personality in their character.Enjoyment (6)It's quite enjoyable to watch this anime.Overall (6)It's recommended to those who love slice-of-life, action, and myth anime! like a harvest moon game.

It provides some nice little humour and little snippets of the personalities of each character in the world of Nazarick. Nothing too special, but it\'s worth watching for the fun of it. I liked the concept of Ainz...Ooal Gown transporting to an alternate universe of Nazarick and stuff like that. Some scenes also parodise events of the first season, and a few from the recently finished second.Nothing else to say really, if you want some nice humour in your spare time, grab something to drink (maybe a snack or two), and watch.

Omamori Himari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6324/Omamori_Himari,"['A Nyan Koi rip-off? Not really. For those who have read the synopsis and went on that basis, let me stop you there. While the similarities of cat-allergies are familiar to each anime, that\'s pretty much it that each tale will share.After episode 1, I was actually surprised to want to watch the next episode due to how close the show stuck to the manga\'s storyline. With a long line of let-downs in the last year for adaptations, I had made sure not too have to much of an expectation for this show, and I\'m glad I did as its proven to be just above...what I had hoped for.Without going into detail, Omamori Himari is the story of Amakawa Yuuto, descendant to a long line of demon slayers, and his kick-ass sexy feline guardian Himari Noihara(demon neko-mimi or cute puss-in-boots for you westerners). Add in a \'tsundere\' childhood friend, a loli, a maid waitress, and an  \'ojou-sama\' like fiancee and you have the rest of Yuuto\'s ""cliched harem"" as they try to handle co-existence with youkai(demons) and humans alike due to Yuuto being casted as one of those  sensitive new age guy who doesn\'t like violence(the type of nose-bleeding harem male you love to hate)Now this show falls in the genres of Action, Comedy, Demons,  Romance, Harem, Supernatural....which sound like ingredients to a great plot and story, but coming from a creator who\'s previous works are hentai, what you will see is fan-service, cliches, fan-service, loli-action, fan-service and a lot of ecchi(as a male I have no problem with that....oh and did I mention fan-service?)...well I guess the benefits of a H-mangaka is that you can expect the artwork to be top-notch. From the 3 sizes(of each heroine) to Yuuto making out with a few of the leading ladies, they\'ve made sure to cover the right angle shots in detail(which some will find very ero-ero....if you can get past the censorship that is...hopefully there\'ll be none of that when DVD gets released).The OP and ED are ok but not something to start looking out for on your next karaoke session and the BGM can be classed as elevator music(well not as bad). As for the voice actors, you have a great line up of seiyuus(Tenma from School Rumble being Himari as an example, and the cute Kuro from Kodomo no Jikan as Shizuku for those loli-lovers ^nano). The only thing I wasn\'t pleased with is Yuuto\'s VA, which I feel they\'ve miscasted. Those who\'ve seen School Days should know what I mean. Everytime I hear Yuuto\'s voice whilst Himari\'s trying to flirt with him, I get that spine-cringing feeling that someones out of place. I do feel sorry for that seiyuu as its not his fault for being the VA to Makoto(probably the most hated male lead in all of harem time), but he just does not suit being a harem lead.All-in-all without discriminating the show from the seiyuu, Omamori Himari is a worthwhile anime to watch. From the producers ZEXCS(who gave us Regios, Rental Magica and *vomit* Da Capo), here\'s hoping they don\'t stuff this one and give us a bad ending, or in Makoto\'s term a ""nice boat""....If your looking for Nyan Koi replacement, I\'ll advice you now your not going to get it.

I don't suggest watching unless you expect nothing or get entertained very, very easily by boring stuff."", ""I suppose the easiest way to sum up what I've seen so far are these two words: Uninspired and dull.Everything you can see in this anime has been done multiple times before in so many better series, so if your after originality then you shouldn't bother watching this.The good thing about Omamori Himari is the fact that it will appeal to most fetishes out there: Lolicon, maids, cat-girls and what-not. Buts that probably the shows only redeaming feature, and even then its only good if your into that kind of thing.I'm quite glad theres only a week left of this as there really hasn't been...any building up to a finale, everything just feels like another episode rather than something meaningful.To sum this up; If you like having boobs and panty shots thrown at you then you'll probably like this, though if you want something with a bit of depth or action that is actually good then I'd advise to stay away from this. any building up to a finale, everything just feels like another episode rather than something meaningful.To sum this up; If you like having boobs and panty shots thrown at you then you'll probably like this, though if you want something with a bit of depth or action that is actually good then I'd advise to stay away from this."", 'This anime was my “gateway” in 2012, this year I discovered the “world of anime” and discovered what is “ecchi” and your pleasueres lmao...after watching this anime, i discover other animes animes ecchi, i understand that at the time what i was looking for was a ""hentai"" but i didn\'t know about that (at the time) start my journey in this world hoping to find an ecchi that would satisfy me. For ME ""Omamori Himari"" is my first anime with 12 Ep\'s I have good and bad memories with this anime, and in 2020 I got a tattoo representing my memories and my love for...this anime.Yeah, i have a tattoo of anime and the score overall is 7, yeah, is about that. this anime.Yeah, i have a tattoo of anime and the score overall is 7, yeah, is about that.', 'Ecchi and harem, they go hand in hand in the anime industry and are two of the most popular genres within the otaku culture, but this is widely known, so the question is: Does this anime have anything else to offer other than fan-service?It\'s answer is: No, while it does have a plot and has some action mixed into it, this kind of a story could be from a kid\'s dream for all I know.So after stating that this has no story where does this enjoyment come from, the fan-service obviously, while plot wise it is bad, the way it introduces characters and creates...for the situations it has, it does relatively good. The ""plot"" revolves around a guy named Amakawa Yuuto, who is your ordinary high school student, nothing more than that, he has his caretaker (a tsundere) wake him up and tend to him for most of the time. Until one day he wakes up with a cat in his face (a catgirl, childhood friend) and they start out their adventures from that point.But a story with only fan-service in it has no chance of getting an anime, so they added action/magic theme to it, which is fine in terms of content, we get to see a variety of magic they creator thought of when he added powers to his characters, the action itself is actually a bit good, they have some good fights which aren\'t only for the sake of fan-service.Lastly in the story, I would like to address the episodes and their content, while it has a bad plot and no real character background, it doesn\'t have the cliché episodes and has some episodes with original stuff happening in them.Art-wise it is good, like surprisingly good, the boob physics are used without holding back and the characters look colourful and vivid.Sound-wise, it is decent, nothing amazing or outstanding which piqued my interest, seiyuu wise, most of them you can probably recognise and if not, you will later as they play lots of roles in different anime.Now to add up on that tsundere and catgirl, childhood friend stereotype, we can add: a loli kuudere, clumsy maid and childhood friend 2. By summing all these up you can come to the conclusion that every cliché harem character is present, although I do say that, some of them have their own variations from their archetype, but honestly, most of them are textbook cliché characters.Overall I though Omamori Himari was quite a weak anime, but there is worse out there, a lot worse, it made up for its no-plot with decently good fights and the fan-service was not half bad.Strong points:- Fan service has some nice variety to it.- The episodes have some decent content in them.- The fights in the anime are good, cliché and overused, but entertaining.Weak points:- Textbook characters. Including the weak protagonist.- Weak plot, which doesn\'t get any expansion on in the anime.- Nothing special about its sound part.So if you are looking for a classic harem ecchi with some decent fights and episodes (in terms of content) and don\'t mind the weak characters, then Omamori Himari is the anime for you. for the situations it has, it does relatively good.

But instead of a good plot with fanservice, it\'s fanservice with little plot.I knew all hope was lost when the generic fanservice beach episode was the second one. Then episode 3 was written around fanservice. \'How can we make Himari\'s breasts/panties show this time?"". I wanted to give it a chance, it sounded interesting and for the most part ecchi doesn\'t bother me. I mean series like 11 eyes, for example, find ways to write fanservice into a scene, but in this...series, they try to write a scene around fanservice. It\'s pointless!

Where Himari really pulls ahead and shows that this is a very different anime is but the way all of the characters interact with not only the main male lead Yuuto, but with the other girls that have come to follow him.  In most of your harem anime the first girl that you meet is most of the time your air head who just likes to do a couple things. In this anime they do not introduce the air head until later...in the anime and not as a critical character. The first two girls that you meet are one of Yuuto's childhood friend, Rinko and the cat demon Himari. Right there you have the smart friend who wants to help Yuuto as much as she can and the other is the always loyal bodyguard.The story to Omamori Himari is not bad. The ending left it open for a second season, but they gave you enough to feel satisfied when it is over. Throughout the anime, the writer is always introducing new characters; some may play a bigger role and sometimes just the normal additions. They play a part that would be very different if they were not there. Between the voice and the characters, the producer of this anime did a good job. All of the voice actors fit the personality of the character that they were playing.Give this anime a chance I know that it will make you want to keep watching until there are none left and all you can is watch it over and over again. in the anime and not as a critical character.

This is what is wrong with pretty much every ecchi anime in existence, save for High School DxD, which in the novels states Issei is extremely strong. I would give this anime's character score a ZERO if it weren't for Himari and Kuesu.

I enjoyed every bit and the first signs that I would equally enjoy the anime appeared when I found myself smiling at the list of winter 2009 new releases.About just another high schooler living his life up until his demon repellent charm expires, making him vulnerable to demons, youkais, and monsters alike. Why are these demons after him? He\'s from a family of demon slayers and the rest goes along without much relevance to what\'s really important in the anime.We have the childhood friend, starting off at square one of this harem. Then a demon...cat guardian (Himari of course) appears to save him from his first demon attack. Shizuku gets dragged in after witnessing Yuuto\'s compassion for innocent demons. Lizlet sticks along after Yuuto ""saves her life"". And another childhood friend, apparently long lost, a demon slayer like Yuuto and my favorite of them all Kuesu Junguji.It\'s a harem anime, what\'s there to expect? Loads of boobage and underwear scenes of course. Being cat themed, we also get a bit of neko ears in the mix as well.The plot isn\'t that much important. I say the most interesting thing was Himari\'s quest to earn a mouth to mouth kiss with Yuuto with I enjoyed watching.Although I wish it would\'ve been longer and a bit more closer to the manga (for the benefit of the plot) I am very much satisfied with the 12 eps I received and hope with all my heart we get a little more content out of this.One thing that stuck out to me was the music. BEAM My BEAM (ED theme) was the best ending theme I\'ve heard in a long time. Possibly the best out of the winter 2009 - Spring 2010 anime EDs. Same for the OP as well. I loved all the songs.If I could wish for anything more of this anime. I would ask for Character albums with at least 2 songs for each character as well as a different version of the OP and ED themes.tl;dr: It\'s good, watch it before you start your next series in line. cat guardian (Himari of course) appears to save him from his first demon attack.

Well if you like your anime to consist of at least three pathetic main characters who do nothing but bitch about how weak they are then you\'ll be fine. Then about 1/2 of the time watching you will see nothing but tits, panties, and more tits. Which isn\'t that bad if your looking for just that. It also has a decent but half-assed story line for those of you who wish to seek a half-assed enjoyable tale.STORY: 6I\'ll be blunt. The story falls short of achieving...a memorable tale and exciting adventure. There wasn\'t so much a problem to where the story was going but to where it DIDN\'T GO.

Both have this issue of incompletion and both have their main protagonists seeking coexistence. However, I find that ""Omamori Himari"" did execute its story a lot better than its counterpart Tayutama. But it still failed to succeed where Tayutama also failed. And that was its useless characters and the unsatisfactory ending. Where it could have easily continued through a 2nd season and hopefully redeem itself through a well thought out conclusion. While there were many ecchi moments and romantic endeavors occurring everywhere in the story frequently, there was also a good portion of action involved which was very much welcomed. It could have been more gruesome and violent as it had a few scenes which seemed to beg for a violent outcome but this anime was aiming more for an ecchi/romance audience. Again, it could have done much worse than what other anime\'s who are KNOWN for gruesome scenes have done, *cough* Elfen Lied *cough* but the way it handled its plot it seemed to lean more towards Otaku\'s who love to see a Tig Ol\' Bittied heroine.ART: 8I very much enjoyed the art of Omamori Himari. Not because I had a hard on most of the time since it showed so much tit and ass but because...OK so the tits and ass were drawn very erotically and nicely. To the point where I didn\'t care about the story anymore. All I cared about was ""Are they...are they going to show me the nipples now or do I have to go watch a hentai?""SOUND: 9The music was OK and the sound of the characters fighting, arguing, etc is the same as any other anime and no different in anyway. TBH I don\'t even know why there is a sound section in reviews. Pretty much ALL anime\'s sound the same except for the voice actors, music, and special effects. And if the anime\'s do sound a bit off (or entirely) it probably is your speakers, download of the video, or streaming source.  They should just name this section ""Music"" or ""Actors"" IMO. Speaking of actors Bleach\'s Orihime is in here and so is the voice of Makoto (School Days) as the main protagonist. And if your familiar with the voice of Nymph from ""Heaven\'s Lost Property"" and Erio from ""Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko"" you\'ll probably :D. In addition to all of these underrated voice actresses/actors apparently Holo is our main heroine.CHARACTER: 6Hmm...don\'t know how to start this part out as the character list defines all of them almost perfectly. So I don\'t really see the point in addressing this part of the review. I guess I could only just review how they brought upon themselves the belief of them being an actual character that has worth in the show. You\'ve got:Himari: A VERY sexy feline Ayakashi who serves as the body guard of our main faggot obviously. She has real nice tits...and ass...and..FUCK! I\'ve paid too much attention to the fan-service that I practically forgot how she is. Let me see if I can remember...hmm....DAMN YOU FAN-SERVICE!Shizuku: Um...why does she remind me of Nozomu from Kanokon? (That anime was TERRIBLE by the way)Yuuto Amakawa: This guy is a FAGGOT and a PUSSY. (Not the feline kind) THAT IS ALL.Lizlet L ""Liz"" Chelsie: She basically is in the show purely for comedic relief and fan-service. Nothing about her is interesting...AT ALL...other than she\'s a fucking teacup lol.Kuesu Jinguuji: I didn\'t even give a shit about this bitch. OK MOVING ON!Rinko Kuzaki: This pathetic use of a script and character reminded me of Kazumi from Shakugan no Shana. (Who I deeply hate with a passion) You wanna know why? She\'s practically an EXACT REPLICA OF SAID BITCH. Almost everything about her (excluding her voice actress) is exactly like her! Especially her uselessness. I don\'t know why the developers even put her in the show. She just gets all pissed when Himari try\'s to get it on with the main faggot. (Just to let you know I shall refer to him as faggot as he is indeed a faggot) Everything else is just her trying to claim faggot as her own. And if you think I\'m wrong about her being a clone GTFO right now and watch SNS and then tell me she doesn\'t look and have the talent of being useless just like  Kazumi.ENJOYMENT: 6I did enjoy ""Omamori Himari"" I will not lie. It\'s got good ecchi moments if that\'s what your looking for but with a mix of some action and plot development as well. Although it wasted a lot of potential of being beyond a typical Action, Comedy, Demons, Ecchi, Romance, Harem, Supernatural anime it still manages to do just fine. Which suits its score perfectly. Its just a fine anime.OVERALL: 6If you like tits but no nipples, ass but not so much as the tits, and some plot and action development in between, then ""Omamori Himari"" just might be for you. Otherwise steer clear of this ecchi fest. And if your pissed that I wasted your time then blame yourself faggot. Your the one that decided to read a review than to go watch the damn anime in question. And this is just my personal opinion. That\'s what reviews are for! To let the ass who wastes their times writing these reviews express their ideas and feelings about the thing in question. Go ahead...click that ""Not Helpful Button"" I DARE YOU. a memorable tale and exciting adventure. There wasn\'t so much a problem to where the story was going but to where it DIDN\'T GO.

TBH I don\'t even know why there is a sound section in reviews. Pretty much ALL anime\'s sound the same except for the voice actors, music, and special effects. And if the anime\'s do sound a bit off (or entirely) it probably is your speakers, download of the video, or streaming source.  They should just name this section ""Music"" or ""Actors"" IMO. Speaking of actors Bleach\'s Orihime is in here and so is the voice of Makoto (School Days) as the main protagonist. And if your familiar with the voice of Nymph from ""Heaven\'s Lost Property"" and Erio from ""Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko"" you\'ll probably :D. In addition to all of these underrated voice actresses/actors apparently Holo is our main heroine.CHARACTER: 6Hmm...don\'t know how to start this part out as the character list defines all of them almost perfectly. So I don\'t really see the point in addressing this part of the review. I guess I could only just review how they brought upon themselves the belief of them being an actual character that has worth in the show. You\'ve got:Himari: A VERY sexy feline Ayakashi who serves as the body guard of our main faggot obviously. She has real nice tits...and ass...and..FUCK! I\'ve paid too much attention to the fan-service that I practically forgot how she is. Let me see if I can remember...hmm....DAMN YOU FAN-SERVICE!Shizuku: Um...why does she remind me of Nozomu from Kanokon? (That anime was TERRIBLE by the way)Yuuto Amakawa: This guy is a FAGGOT and a PUSSY. (Not the feline kind) THAT IS ALL.Lizlet L ""Liz"" Chelsie: She basically is in the show purely for comedic relief and fan-service. Nothing about her is interesting...AT ALL...other than she\'s a fucking teacup lol.Kuesu Jinguuji: I didn\'t even give a shit about this bitch. OK MOVING ON!Rinko Kuzaki: This pathetic use of a script and character reminded me of Kazumi from Shakugan no Shana. (Who I deeply hate with a passion) You wanna know why? She\'s practically an EXACT REPLICA OF SAID BITCH. Almost everything about her (excluding her voice actress) is exactly like her! Especially her uselessness. I don\'t know why the developers even put her in the show. She just gets all pissed when Himari try\'s to get it on with the main faggot. (Just to let you know I shall refer to him as faggot as he is indeed a faggot) Everything else is just her trying to claim faggot as her own. And if you think I\'m wrong about her being a clone GTFO right now and watch SNS and then tell me she doesn\'t look and have the talent of being useless just like  Kazumi.ENJOYMENT: 6I did enjoy ""Omamori Himari"" I will not lie. It\'s got good ecchi moments if that\'s what your looking for but with a mix of some action and plot development as well. Although it wasted a lot of potential of being beyond a typical Action, Comedy, Demons, Ecchi, Romance, Harem, Supernatural anime it still manages to do just fine. Which suits its score perfectly. Its just a fine anime.OVERALL: 6If you like tits but no nipples, ass but not so much as the tits, and some plot and action development in between, then ""Omamori Himari"" just might be for you. Otherwise steer clear of this ecchi fest. And if your pissed that I wasted your time then blame yourself faggot. Your the one that decided to read a review than to go watch the damn anime in question. And this is just my personal opinion. That\'s what reviews are for! To let the ass who wastes their times writing these reviews express their ideas and feelings about the thing in question. Go ahead...click that ""Not Helpful Button"" I DARE YOU.', ""Another RTLR coming right for your eyes! This time we're dealing with a show that just basically hits the checkboxes for the harem/echhi/supernatural lists, and skips away, happy in it's ability to be perfectly average. The short of it is there is some amusement to be had here, but it's very vanilla. Not a waste of time, but there are other series that do all those thing with much more vigor. Will the RTLR wall of allergies get modified? Or is Emma Frost's position still secure? Let's drop it like its hot!Story: 6As I said, this is very much your average harem show. The main...character (MC) possesses a very powerful technique that the demons fear and that the other slayer families wish to have. This power is not one he can use of free will, of course, and only activates in extremely dangerous situations. He is also a pacifist, believing demons and people can live together side by side, like some kind of hippie supernatural hangout. He only strikes enough to defend himself, and always keeps his harem on shorts leashes to make sure they don't kill either. We've seen this kind of character in tons of other shows, the happy go lucky guy that wants peace above all other things.As he and his initial cat demon girl and his human best friend encounter new foes and defeat them, they pretty much always end up becoming new members of the harem. They all give some variation on 'his soul is pure, I must study his ways' or something similar. As the flock grows, a few of the girls hit on the MC, but the primary romantic rivalry is between the cat girl and the human girl. This is where a lot of the ecchi moments come in, with cat girl doing everything in her power to breed with the MC, and the human friend determined not to lose her best friend to the strange cat girl demon. The other girls seem interested as well, but no one gets in to each of their ways until another girl comes along and claims to be the MC's betrothed.There's lots of moments where the cat demon shoves the MC's head between her enormous breasts, and he even up accidentally kissing the cat girl, blowing her mind and her lust sky high. The human friend sometimes attempts to keep up with the cat girl's outrageous behaviors. For example in one scene, the cat girl removes her top and exposes her breasts. The human girl freaks out, and then begins to remove her clothes as well. She's stopped before finishing the job, but the jealousy is readily apparent there. Oh, as a note, this is ecchi, but no nipples are ever shown onscreen that I can remember. It's all implied and innuendo and such. A lot of it revolves around jokes, where the MC and another person fall down and end up in an embarrassing position, with body parts in improper places and the light. It's not even as overblown as in, say, Highschool DxD where the characters put out their naughty bits intentionally and freak out the main character. This is more slapstick like, for the most part. Another old standby of the harem ecchi genre.Another slightly varied, but still cliche'd feature is that of a single character possessing a great deal of power, but being unable to fully use it for fear of losing control. DxD had it in the red dragon armor Issei had, and Sister New Devil had that white armor that made him risk becoming berserk. In Omamori, its the cat girl who is the one unable to completely unleash her powers because when she does, she attacks everyone she sees, driven by bloodlust, making it dangerous for any allies to be around her. So she often moves alone against the enemy, thinking she'll use her full power to win before the MC and the rest of the harem arrive. This is pretty much always met with disastrous results. Only by fighting at the MC's side does she learn to truly do the best she can in battle and not lose her mind. The whole 'don't go full powered or it'll consume you!' is yet another trope many of these kinds of anime pull.The ending doesn't give us anything new except a huge fight, and of course the MC gains the ability to use his superpower at will if only for a moment. The warriors for the hero find the true enemy had hasn't been engaging in the fighting, and finally slay him, freeing the 'face' of the true enemy (who is of course a female demon) the option to 'see the light' and join the harem if she pleases. Does she? I think we can all answer that question right now just off the info I've presented so far. And our ending has everything going right back to normal, only with the harem being even bigger now. The MC proves that demons and humans really can live together peacefully and all's well that ends well. Never seen that ending before, have you?Art: 8I thought the art looked pretty good. Of course they work hard for the ecchi elements, lots of bouncing tits and lots of panty shots, but they also work those into action shots and that to me makes the art and animation look a little smoother than some titles. Hard to slip in the panty shots over and over in the middle of fights if you're skimping on actual fight frames. No complaints from me, except that good art cannot save terribly average storytelling.Sound: 7The voices all sound fairly well. I didn't like the MC's voice much, though. The girls all sound fairly good, and have their own tweaks. The loli girl continually says 'nano' (you know I think is a rough translation) after damn near everything she says which can get a little old, but is used to humorous effects on occasion. The tea cup demon girl is a little high pitched at times, and nearly a little overdone. The other demon slayer sounds dead right in her arrogance, and the cat girl has a mature and sexy sound to her voice.The background music was acceptable, and a bit funny at times. They have that 'midway' point in the show, like where in broadcast they would have cut to commercial, the first 'side' of this shot shows a girl, or sometimes two, in an outfit. When the 'second' side appears, a sultry sax phrase is played, and much of the model's clothes are missing. Hearing that sexy sounding sax play was kind of funny, calling back to the days of old, cheesy pornos.The themes are fun, and while they may not always match some of the more intensive episodes, they still do their job well. They are both tunes I have playing in my general anime music folder, and they are fun and light-hearted. The ending theme, 'Beam my Beam' gets the lyrics shuffled around throughout the series, but is still 'bouncy' enough to fit the ecchi theme the show presents.Character: 5The characters catch knocks because they are so predictable and cliche to the point of being pieced together from better shows. Of course the cat girl, the demon trying hardest to win the MC's affection is sexy, and prone to initiating naught behavior such as flashing her breasts or pulling the MC into her chest and things like that. She's of course also very powerful and dresses in traditional garb while wielding a katana. She reminds me a lot of Erika from Campione. She's also at odds with every other girl in the harem, similar to the initial rivalry between Rias and Asia in DxD.The human friend also mirrors that same rivalry, being not a demon and not having any powers. Asia started out not a demon and her only power is basically defensive, so there's some comparison to be had I believe. I guess if you have a next door neighbor for several years, especially of the opposite sex, I think you're like legally required to marry them or something. Sorry guys, but the law of anime must be upheld!The loli isn't really into the guy all that much, beside her initial 'I must learn about love!' statement, which isn't that unusual. I am reminded of Yoshino from Date a Live here, in that she's around, she can help in a fight, but she's content to be close to the boy in question, and doesn't seem to lust after him the others do.The human supposed finace is of course very powerful, though she harbors a secret that causes her intense need to be with the MC. She's arrogant and believes that no one else could possibly compete with her for his affections, though she's secretly jealous inside over the cat girl. She's also by nature in diametric opposition to the harem's demon members, but to be close to the MC, she sets aside her duty to slay demons and stays with the group. This reminds me of the church exorcist Xenovia from DxD, or the 'hero village' girls from Sister New Devil. She's also bossy and opinionated, always arrogant about her powers. Tropes everywhere!Don't forget the MC, who, like most of these shows, has amnesia regarding his past, the ability to use a very strong superpower, but only when needed and never at will, and of course he's a total pacifist, thinking all creatures should be allowed to live and not be preyed upon. He's also clumsy around girls, doesn't have the confidence to move on any urges he might have sexually, and is not even bothered by the near sexual harassment piled on top of him by the harem members.All these characters are cookie cutters and seem to be lifted from better shows. None of them show anything that is really remarkable nor does anything not totally predictable based on their personalities. They play off here and there for a laugh, and can sometimes be funny, but for the most part, they kind of end up boring more than anything.Enjoyment: 6Yes, I did laugh a few times here and there, and a 6 is still better than bad, even though many people view a 6 like they do a 2. It's not a bad show, it's just formulaic, and doesn't have any real points in it that stick out above and beyond any other harem ecchi show out there. I actually had to watch the series twice, because I forgot so quickly about the series I couldn't even write on it without a second watch. It's forgettable, but not bad. There are much worse ways to pass the time, but there are many better ways to do so as well.Best Girl: Noihara Himari. The cat girl is cute, and is valiant enough in always trying to rush ahead and defeat the enemy before her master is ever in danger. At least she does't say 'nano' every 3 seconds.In closing, I would say that this isn't a bad show, 6 is above board, but barely. There's a lot of elements in this show we've seen before, and seen done better. If you don't mind the retreading of these tropes, then you'll likely have a good time here. If you want something more tangible with a unique hook or something you've not seen before, then pass for sure. I guess for me the question is, is totally forgettable worse than bad? I'm going to go with no, but I can see how some of you might say 'yes'. Just another ecchi harem in a genre pack solid with them. Emma is safe on the RTLR wall for now.

It wasn\'t a ""One of the Greatest Animes Ever"" anime, but it is worth watching if you\'re into the Echii/Harem stuff.Story wise... cat girl is sent to ""protect"" a childhood friend from demons that want to kill him. That\'s the main story right there. Along with some side stories added to it, it turned out pretty decent. For every couple episodes, new characters joined the show and the story got more interesting. Well done, although at points it seemed a little slow.Artwork, it\'s...your average anime made within a 3 year period. The art was clear and colorful, but it seemed fairly average for an anime, and it\'s not just the scenery, it goes for the characters too. I feel like I\'ve seen them before even watching the show, so they had common faces from other animes I\'ve watched. I\'m not complaining, the art went well with the show, but I would have liked to see a little more creativity.Sound was good, voice actors did their role well, and I\'m hoping that one day if this is dubbed the voice actors will do just as good. SFX were also well done, for the few battle sequences the show had, it was really impressive.Characters... like I said before, the artwork could have been a little more creative. And it\'s not just the artwork they could have added more creativity to, the character\'s personalities should have been more unique. Like ALL echii/harem animes I\'ve ever seen, there is always a silent character, a loli character, a strong/scary character, a character that is all lovey-dovey, etc. Even though these traits fit the characters, I would have liked to see something different for a change. I did like all the characters though, none of the characters turned out to be total jerks or annoying to me, which is interesting because there is almost ALWAYS at least one character in this kind of genre that gets on my nerves in every anime.I enjoyed the most of it, had some good comedy, good action scenes, interesting plot, and a whole lot of fanservice... but most of it ties in with the comedy part of the show.

It is one of the Ecchi and Harem anime that can't miss for the fans of Harem anime. (Truth:Is it my imagination or Yuuto is the only man that play the protagonist of the entire story?)Despite the differs between the plot between the manga and anime version, I could tell that the anime ending are even faster than the manga counter part  (Truth:Something that become the major questions of all times, could anime ending is the canon of the manga counterpart? If...so, when the ending of the manga version would appear and if not, is the ending is the only exclusive for anime only?)Character design is much little more advance than the manga version, that's all I can say...Artwork: 8/10 Level 4-Outstanding so, when the ending of the manga version would appear and if not, is the ending is the only exclusive for anime only?)Character design is much little more advance than the manga version, that's all I can say...Artwork: 8/10 Level 4-Outstanding"", 'Omamori himari is nothing groundbreaking, I gave it a 7 because I found it to be the most average you could get an anime and 7 is my idea of average. In engineering class we had to come up with a chart for a program that would design a movie based off of a few inputs from the viewer and this made me feel like the people who write anime nowadays have one. It seems like so many of the animes coming out today aim for average, as if there was some sort of algorithm out there where one could simply put in a few...ideas and a machine would spew out a script that used the same old concepts and ideas.Story: it\'s pretty simple, a boy named yuuto turns 16 and finds out he\'s from a family of demon hunters when he is attacked on the roof of the school only to be saved by his sexy cat bodyguard himari. He remembers nothing from his past because the charm that was protecting him for 16 years was so powerful. From then on it\'s your typical harem anime that has an ever-growing cast of female characters and 1 perverted friend. If you\'ve ever seen steel angel kurumi the plot is very similar to that. like I said the story for OH was far from original but I actually did enjoy the theme they used of yuuto and himari fighting ayakashi and feel that it actually had a good deal of potential. The problem was that like many animes this one could\'ve easily changed a few things around and been a lot better than it was but instead they stuck to the same boring pattern so many before it have fallen to, I will never understand the people that make these and why they can\'t see these obvious mistakes they\'re making. One thing I really get sick of seeing is the main character only surrounded by girls and the 1 guy friend only being a pervert. If you\'ve seen clannad you\'ll see Okazaki continuously runs off to hang out with sunohara, I loved seeing that because it was such a simple thing to do and its realistic but you never see it, as if the main character never has any friends and then once he does they\'re all girls.Art: while the art was standard the character designs were great. The only problem I had with it was the huge boobs were a little bit excessive, at some point it starts hurting the art not helping it. Still the harem of girls yuuto manages to collect does have it\'s gems, himari was hotter than your average harem girl and if you appreciate that kind of thing (who doesn\'t) and you don\'t really have plans to watch anything after what you\'re currently on you should check this out. Along with himari, Liz was another above average character and in my opinion that somewhat redeems this slightly, while I\'d much rather have originality over above average beauty I won\'t complain if they decide to throw in some great looking women (although I wish they\'d do both).Sound: I liked the sound in OH, the opening theme was very catchy and I enjoyed it more than many other openings I\'ve heard. The music during the anime got ""different"" at times but I liked it and felt it was a nice change from the average music You\'ll hear.Character: I hate to bash an anime but the characters were all typical harem characters. Yuuto was a spineless idiot who did nothing. Himari was his protective horny servant, Shizuku was another horny girl with a dark past, Liz was a horny girl who likes serving tea, Kuesu was a horny girl who is an enemy but hangs around with the rest of the bunch, and rinko was the tsundere best friend who loves yuuto. None of the characters grow throughout the anime at all, the only change we see is yuuto finally taking charge and deciding to fight which really wasn\'t all that big. The relationship between himari and yuuto suffered horribly, we didn\'t even get to see a real kiss between the two because it got interrupted by the rest of the cast, which was really annoying because I knew that\'s what would happen but was still hoping to see it.Overall I still think this series has potential but it will need more seasons to reach it. If we do see more series I\'d like to see more of 3 things, yuuto becoming stronger, fighting real enemies, and yuuto and himari\'s relationship grow. I hate how there aren\'t any animes out there were 2 people are in a relationship before the last episode, it can be done and we can enjoy watching the 2\'s relationship grow even beyond 2 that are just starting their relationship. I would like to see less of the harem constantly interrupting at every possible moment and attacking yuuto with lust or anger. There will have to be many changes if they wish to accomplish this seeing that the last episode of this 1st season got us nowhere, yuuto even said he didn\'t want himari around (I believe someone told him he must really want that cat around and he said no) which really kind of pissed me off since he does want himari around and now he\'s just contradicting himself. Either way I will watch a second season if they make one and I\'m still reading the manga which is different from the anime where the anime starts making changes when they go on the trip to paint, which I also think is a big mistake. ideas and a machine would spew out a script that used the same old concepts and ideas.Story: it\'s pretty simple, a boy named yuuto turns 16 and finds out he\'s from a family of demon hunters when he is attacked on the roof of the school only to be saved by his sexy cat bodyguard himari.

The cast of characters was interesting, and most of the main characters got solid character development, with the only real exception I feel being Rinko who feels somewhat out of place at times. The central theme of co-existence between humans and non human entities, in this case mostly Ayakashi, is something that's pretty overused, but it was still used effectively here, wherein it didn't spend as much time on discussing the theme itself, rather it stood as something that Yuuto simply believed in and the actual implementation of the theme was more so in regards to how...that effected his relationship with other characters. The plot started out somewhat slowly when it was simply introducing characters with a really light hearted tone, but by the time it reached its final arc the story has gotten a lot more intense and involved, which managed to benefit from the investment the viewers had gotten in the characters from the less involved portion. Though I should note that the light hearted moments don't go away and the comedy, which is solid, is a core part of the anime throughout. The action wasn't tremendously great, not really having much mechanical complexity at all, but there was a variety of powers and such in play that still made it interesting, and it was flashy so overall I would have to say that it was quite enjoyable. The finale was really good and ended the anime incredibly well, and though from what I understand they had to diverge from the manga in order to do so, I suppose that it was worth it as the ending was quite satisfying, though I felt the Public Affairs agent deserved worse than he got.The style and designs I thought were quite great, especially Himari's purple standard fighting outfit.

The story is decent for the genre, and the characters are fairly well developed. Only complaints are that the art seems kinda meh, the animation isn't super great like a lot of pre-2015 shows, and its hard to find online above 360p quality.

Right from the start I saw that the anime had great potential. Instead of the typical accept-my-duty-as-a-demon-slayer scenario, Yuuto(the main character) chooses to lead a normal life. But things are never that simple in the world of anime or else there would'nt be a story. However,after the...requisite introduction of Yuuto's harem and the perverted situations he gets into, the story basically felt as if it was rushed towards a very cliched and painful end. It could have been much much better and thus warrants only a 6 from me, it could have been a 9 or 10 with more work.Art:8The drawings was exquisite. Well drawn facial expressions too. Yet in 2010 I cannot really forgive that the action scenes feel as if they are from the 1990s; it takes 20 seconds to show a swing of the sword and everybody flying away. An action genre should show action not useless posturing. Nevertheless, tha art is still great.Sound:7The sound was good. The OP had a light-hearted feel to it that matched the mood of most of the episodes. But feel free to form your own opinion about the sound as I am not a good critic on the sound department.Characters:6Other than Himari's internal conflict between protecting Yuuto and staying by his side, the rest of the characters face little development. The other characters the story intoduced seem to turn into useless sidekick roles  almost overepisode(pun on overnight); they stand there saying the most useless things that don't really add to the conversation and take up air-time. this anime could use some serious work in character development.Enjoyment:7Being male, I obviously enjoy the large servings of fan-service that Ommamori Himari provide but my enjoyment was dampened by the fact this was a poor ending to what could have been a really great anime story-wise.Overall:7If you are willing to accept the faults of a rushed ending or a fan of the ecchi genre, then i would reccomend you to watch this. The anime leaves much to be desired but hopefully there will be a second season with an ending that is not as crappy as the first season. requisite introduction of Yuuto's harem and the perverted situations he gets into, the story basically felt as if it was rushed towards a very cliched and painful end.

I will try to leave spoilers out.Omamori Himari is your typical harem/ecchi anime, Amakawa Yuuto graces us with his MCness and has your typical background. Parents are dead, memories with a girl when he was younger and  living alone and having someone take care of him everyday. Honestly this whole anime screamed clicheness and boy did it not disappoint with the harem/ecchi tags. There are so many boobs and pantyshots, its beyond ridiculous.Story 7/10The story started off strong but for me kinda started dropping near the middle. This story revolves around Yuuto...but Himari is the one that takes center stage most of the time. Himari is an Ayakashi or a demon and she is bound by contract to protect Yuuto untill he becomes a demon slayer. When Yuuto turned 16, Himari appeared to abide by the contract. Then they begin their lives as a Master/Bodygaurd type relationship.Art 8/10The artsyle presented in this anime was pretty good, one of the main things that it falls flat on is that its animated the same way other ecchi/harem animes are so its lackluster in that department. The fight scenes were decent  but it didn't really amaze me. The main attraction that anime goes for is the plethora of boob and panty shots as per the ecchi type of anime but I still felt like it was a tad beyond neccesity.Sound 4/10Im not going to write too much into this category. The only thing I enjoyed was the OP, it was catchy and I found myself listening to it on youtube abit more than I care to admit. Other than that the sound was pretty nonexistant, they used the same bgm for almost all the fight scenes and much of the other bgm's didnt appeal to me.Character 7/10The characters both annoyed me and amused me, they are a colorful bunch with a variety of personalities and I enjoyed that but they are so oversexualized it killed it abit for me. I do not mind that they act perverted in front of the MC but I had to stop myself from screaming at my computer for them to stop so they could continue with the plot. The way they just strut around with panties everywhere and public nudity(yes, can't have an ecchi anime without public nudity) made me wish why isn't my life like this. My favorite character would have to be Kuesu, she is determined to make a name for herself and prove her family is strong and I admire that. She also uses a grimoire which is extra points for me. My least favorite character is Lizlet, she only has one grand scene which is her opening to the story then she falls flat afterwards. I question why she is even there sometimes, she does almost nothing to help the group and is gone half the time but she is a apart of the harem circle of heroines and it makes me wonder but you gotta have at least 5 heroines to make sure you fit in the harem crowd.Enjoyment 8/10Although I have bashed this anime, I did enjoy it to some extent. There was some good comedy and the side characters were amusing. Really this anime is pointed towards the group of guys who watch anime purely for the pantyshots and semi-nudity because thats what this mainly has. I found that this anime is either a hate it or you don't anime because I could not find an inbetween.Overall 6/10I have to give Omamori Himari a 6, it had its moments but it fell flat alot and figured it could get back up with oversexualized scenes and panties. This was one of those animes were I enjoyed the heroines more because Yuuto was one useless dude who did nothing but sit on his ass the whole damn show and I had to deduct points for that. Overall, this anime is good if you enjoy the harem/ecchi genre but if your looking for more then I suggest you look somewhere else because this show won't give you more than that. but Himari is the one that takes center stage most of the time.

I mean really? Not complaining just stating.Anyways, the plot is simple. Amakawa Yuuto is the heir to a demon slaying clan which broke the trend and decided to continue the tradition when his demon cat guard makes her random appearance. After that him and his guard Himari begin to amass a harem of demons (and one human girl who is totally out-shined) as Yuuto is nearly killed each time. After that it\'s pretty self-explanitory. Boy gains ridiculously large harem, discovers hidden secrets, epic battle, then lovey-dovey climax; but being that it\'s an harem I can\'t exactly guarantee...that.BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL REVIEW!? Well here it is: it\'s a harem/ecchi so that in itself is played out, but we still come to love it... for some reason. However, this series felt unusually fresh and didn\'t have a ""completely"" played out feel, despite the cliche plot concept.Point by Point:-Animation; Standard, not bad, but it felt like I was looking at a Manga.-Characters: Okay, it was pretty easy to understand Himari.-Plot: Yuck, but they made it work for them.-Music: Was there any?Overall 7/10. Not gold, but it was okay. Not a series for serious otakus. that.BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL REVIEW!?

However, this series felt unusually fresh and didn\'t have a ""completely"" played out feel, despite the cliche plot concept.Point by Point:-Animation; Standard, not bad, but it felt like I was looking at a Manga.-Characters: Okay, it was pretty easy to understand Himari.-Plot: Yuck, but they made it work for them.-Music: Was there any?Overall 7/10. Not gold, but it was okay. Not a series for serious otakus.', ""If you're looking to enjoy the story of this correctly, then just read the manga. But if you want to enjoy it visually in animation, and have a lot of the story drowned out with more unnecessary ecchiness and perversions; just watch this anime. Nuff said. "", 'More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet-----------------------------When I made my ""anime to review next"" list, I thought it\'d be fun to re-watch some anime I haven\'t seen in a long time, mixed in with the more recent stuff and shows I haven\'t seen yet.Enter Omamori Himari. A supernatural harem anime that I haven\'t seen in over a year. Unfortunately, I had an experience similar to Negima!?; I still enjoyed it, but not watching it in so long kinda dulled it a little...Story...Because I was new to anime when I watched Omamori Himari, I thought it was really good. Fast-forward about 16 months and it just seems meh at best. Sure, the existence of youkai allow some action to be injected into the show, but for the most part, it was about the main character collecting a harem, and switching from one to the other makes it feel out-of-place.AnimationThe animation in Omamori Himari has nothing really special about it. The characters look good, and the animation seems to flow smoothly, but the worst part about it is probably the fight scenes. It was all fine at the start, and looked good, but in several fights (ones involving Shizuku, especially) ended up using CG effects that looked REALLY out of place. At least, it did for me.SoundFor me, several of the BGM tracks in this anime stuck out, and generally fit the situation, but at times would feel very out of place. The OP is a cute and catchy song that will be stuck in your head for quite a while, and the ED (or EDs) were sung by the female cast, and I really like it when they do that.For the voice actors, there were several memorable names. The most obvious would be Ami Koshimizu voicing the titular Himari, and with pretty much every main character, I could hear someone from a different anime. This, however, is also a detriment due to the male lead\'s voice actor... Daisuke Hirakawa may very well turn people away because he pretty much sounds like a certain cheating asshole of a character.I was surprised, however, at how well the guy could sing in the final episode\'s ED.CharactersCharacters in anime are a bit of a hit-or-miss. Omamori Himari is disliked for having two characters who are more or less useless throughout most of the show (or, in Rinko\'s case, the show in its entirety).The better of the main characters (Himari, Shizuku, Kuesu) are generally more fun to watch, especially when any combination of the three battle. However, Kuesu\'s initial introduction may prove to be too strong for some viewers during the closing stages of the show.Final thoughtsOmamori Himari was a fun watch overall, but when it tried to get too serious near the end, it felt like it was trying a little too hard and the sudden change in tone may end up turning some watchers off.I\'d say to watch this if you are bored and have nothing else to do, at an overall pace of one episode a day. Trying to marathon this anime could quite possibly end up being too much.Story - 4.6Animation - 7.2Sound - 8.1Characters - 7.2Enjoyment - 7.0FINAL SCORE - 6.82/10 Because I was new to anime when I watched Omamori Himari, I thought it was really good.

The plot was okay for pokemon, just the average stuff. But my fave thing about this movie is the villians, Attila and Hun (with the help of Professor Sebastian). I like them the best because their personalities contrast yet they go so well together at the same time.

Senkou no Night Raid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6973/Senkou_no_Night_Raid,"['With the series ended (but ongoing in North America), it\'s seems that Senkou no Night Raid (or Night Raid 1931 in English) is not just about Japanese spies with superpowers (a la Darker than Black). It\'s more than that since it goes deeper into pre-WWII history which also touches sensitive content (e.g.: Mukden Incident). In contrast to what most people claimed that it whitewashes history, it\'s not.Story: 7The six episodes are just tasters on who are the characters and what direction will the story be, considering its episodic formula. The rest of episodes...well, let\'s just say that where the real story is as the episodic...formula is removed. The staff made a very good connection of the fictional side with historical facts, establishing a very balanced story which doesn\'t offend people from both sides. Though some still considered it that the staff is touching sensitive content which should be forgotten. Since I came from SE Asia country which was under the Japanese occupation during WWII, I didn\'t feel offended or sense any historical revisionism as what people had claimed. In fact, there\'s NO historical revisionism at all.Nonetheless, the staff did really research on the events and not including what historical revisionists had informed. So it\'s safe to say that this series has not (yet) drawn any angry outburst from China or Korea or any of Japan\'s neighbors for that matter.Considering some controversial stuff, at least, the staff are not taking any side. They did show the bad side of the Japanese. Of course, there\'s a disclaimer that the series\' story is fictional. By fiction, meaning that some events that occurred in the series are indeed fiction. It\'s common sense that people with superpowers do not exist in real-life history. From what I\'ve seen here, the superpowers did have an important role here.Since it\'s only 13 episodes, you might say there\'s still a lot of things which needs to be covered most especially on the characters. I wish that the series would be 25/26 episodes but due to budget cuts, well, they have no choiceArt: 7The character design is all right and balanced except that the animation is a bit wonky. But the background is neat and detailed, in fact, the staff did research on the design and layout of Shanghai (even though the series is set in 1931). OP animation also reminded me Casino Royale\'s opening credits.Sound: 8Taro Hakase! That\'s right, the violinist best known internationally for the violin version on Celine Dion\'s song ""To Love You More"", contributed the music here, most especially the violin music. (If you count Aoi\'s skill in playing the violin, you may guess that Hakase did that on purpose just to show that Aoi is lousy in playing the violin). The OP and ED are good but the latter is better since it\'s a ballad. Oh, and the OST itself asides from Hakase\'s music is great.The voice acting is all right but my problem is the Japanese voice actors speaking butchered Chinese, German, Russian and even English. The minor characters are native speakers which is something new. But it\'s very funny to hear the seiyuus to be speaking a language which is not native to them.For the English dub, you won\'t hear them speak other languages except English. Plus, the English voice actors managed to express the characters well. But Aoi\'s English voice actor irritates me.Character: 7At first, you may consider the characters plain and dull. But then, you get to realize that our four agents of Sakurai Kikan have personal motives. They are not really imperialists. They\'re individuals who have their own sets of problems and conflicted by their personal beliefs. In fact, it turns out that the Chinese and other nationalities shown in the series played a minor role here.But the staff really needs to develop more on the characters considering the limited time that the series have.Enjoyment: 8Well, honestly, there\'s a lot of dialogue here but the series did show some action here and there. If you\'re interested in Asian history or if you\'re well-equipped with Asian history, then you\'ll really know what\'s going on here. But if you\'re looking for James Bond action here, then you might be disappointed since the action is not James Bond action.You will realize that this series will remind you of the 2006 spy film, The Good Shepherd (directed by Robert De Niro and starring Matt Damon) except that Senkou no Night Raid has characters with superpowers. So, the spy action is still there but it\'s not the main focus.But those who aren\'t into Asian history or have no background of it will probably get bored with this. Here\'s a fair warning: do some research on pre-WWII events in Asia before you watch this show.Overall: 8For me, this series is underrated in the English-speaking fanbase. Well, I might say that the slow release of subs maybe at fault for this or that most viewers are not well acquainted with Asian history or that those who are saying that this is Japanese revisionist propaganda or that most viewers are more interested to the mainstream genres.But judging by the series, I\'m impressed that Anime no Chikara made such a risky move in making this. I\'m sure that they\'re pretty aware that they\'re touching sensitive issues here. At least, they\'re making something unique. It\'s not considered to be the best but it\'s considered to be very good. I would imagine this to be in a novel form or they should make this into a novel. That way, it will be just like reading some of the old spy novels.

My reason is because I love Asian history and know a lot about it especially the late 1800 to the early 1900 era. With this in mind, I had a pretty good idea of what was going on in the story. It sounds smug and biased, but this anime does require a bit of background knowledge to...fully appreciate it. Let\'s got down to the actual rating.(7)Art: I also liked the fact it was historical fiction, ACCURATE historical fiction in which the creators of the anime and story did their best to portray the setting and people during the turmoil of East Asia of the 1930\'s. The settings portrayed in the anime of China really reflect the changing times of the 1930\'s, a clash between traditional and Western can clearly be seen and the producers of the anime have done a very good job producing the backdrop and the ensemble.(9) Character: I really liked how the characters expressed the changing attitudes of the times in parallel to the setting in which their action takes place in. Kazura showing his conflicted between upholding his loyalty to Japan as an agent or taking a revolutionary stand in his romantic, utopian belief in ""Asia for Asians"" (which was a real philosophy back that Japan used to justify their colonization of East Asia), Aoi showing the new, relaxed European attitudes toward living in contrast to the traditional, rigid Asian customs that defined Asia at the time, and Natsume with his understanding and empathy towards the plight and exploitation of the peasant class during the rapid expansion of Imperial Japan (which was horrible: anyone poor or traditional was considered ""filthy"" in Japan and were expelled to countries, like Korea and China [who were considered even dirtier and did not deserve any human rights], to farm for Japan from land seized from the natives). Yukina is the only character, I believe, that sticks to the usual anime mold rather than the historical one set here, (which is a bit of a disappointment, but not a turnoff). Again I really liked the character representations, but they were indeed stiff and seemed a bit like robots at different times. Overall I give character good rating because of excessive symbolism that only a nerdy historian (me :P!) could really pick up on and enjoy.(8) Sound: I enjoyed the sound track, especially the emotional pieces on violin and piano. I\'m not an anime music aficionado (not yet at least), so I cannot give a critical review like I did with the other two sections, but I can say I did like it and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the series.(6) Story: The story itself was not very well constructed. I don\'t think there was necessarily a structured plot that drove the entire series, but rather the development of character and the stress on the changing attitudes of the new world. Again, knowing the history will allow you to enjoy this anime a lot more than if you were to watch it without prior knowledge.(9) Enjoyment: The Manchu Incident, the Chinese Civil War, the Opium Wars, all of these events during the 1930\'s era that were included in the anime really give it a realistic aspect that I can really sink my teeth into. It\'s obvious that the producers are skirting around the pond, they are avoiding heavy issues, such as the Nanking Massacre, that would spur on controversy and arguments between Japan and its neighbors and would have dirtied the name of this anime. I applaud the producers to take such daring steps (even if those steps are baby steps) to create anime that takes place in one of the most hotly debated eras in East Asia of all time. Using the ""fiction"" naming ploy, I believe the producers have cleverly avoided confrontation with political entities while at the same time, piquing viewers interest in Asian history.(7) Overall: Again, to fully appreciate this anime, you should know your history.

For those who're too busy watching Angel Beats and have no clue what this is, it's basically 1930's Chinese Ghost in the Shell.The story follows that squad of four spies, their wily leader and his lanky assistant. Aside from the old man leader, they all have superpowers. The hotblooded main guy has telekinesis which he revels in spamming, his associate is a cool-headed teleporter who dislikes his powers, their girlfriend is a scrying telepath and her bodyguard's got eagle...eyes. The aforementioned lanky, silent dude who's in the background of each episode can erase people's minds. Together they form an interesting team with some good dynamics, and so far their stories and outlooks seem pretty interesting. There's potential here.Episodes basically flow like this: Political babble -> Characters doing stuff -> Crazy Metal Gear spy action. It seems like each episode has a different themed language too, this is the only series I've seen off the top of my head where the characters go from speaking Chinese to Japanese to German to Russian on a whim. Overall the series' pacing is satisfying, but may be too slow for some. I think this is the sort of series that would work a lot better dubbed.The animation's good, and the backgrounds are gorgeous. I'm assuming they're accurate to the 1930's China setting. There's some use of CG all around, usually for the old-timey cars(btw there are car chases in these. and they are hilariously awesome). The OP animation is all cool and artsy. Not much else to say.What really sticks out at me though is the music, I'm loving this OST. The OP is catchy as hell and the violin work is amazing, especially the action theme.So yeah, what we got here is a fun and unique little spy romp with quite a bit of room to grow. If you like spy or historical stories, or are just looking for something non-moe, then this is a good deal. See also: RAINBOW.I'll make sure to update this if the series turns to trash, but I doubt it'll jump in quality that far judging by what we have now. eyes.

The chosen time period is somewhat rare for animes since Japan did a lot of questionable stuff during this time period and actually still try to hide it today. It's definitely nice to check out since it tries to depict what happened during the time in Manchuria after the Russo-Japanese War.Also adds a nice twist by adding ESPers to the time period, making them superpower spies. It's actually kind of vague as to what side they're on, but it gets a little clearer overtime. Adding psychic...powers to a spy setting just makes the tension go up. Although I think they could've done a bit more on it...The characters have a sort of cliche back story and personality, but I guess that's okay, right? I really wish the female lead stepped up her game (like in most other anime) and I also wished she had a better voice actor. I'm not one to criticize the voice acting, but it just kind of seemed like she was literally reading off the script rather than acting the part out. I don't know, it might just be my imagination, but the heroine has a lot of lines, so it might bother some people...Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable anime if you're into all the war tension, political issues stuff. There was one episode where none of the main characters appear and it's just plot development on the main conflict at hand that nearly lulled me to sleep, but the rest of the episodes are generally action packed with some humor in them. The opening is also not bad, but not superb. The anime is also aesthetically pleasing and really brings out the mood of the 1920s.I recommend it to history buffs. powers to a spy setting just makes the tension go up.

It respectfully portrays historical content, and does so in a fair manner, although the circumstances have been fictionalized. While character motivations from different characters range from downright imperialistic to idealistic, the series always maintains a realistic tone. There is love put in between specific character interactions, such as the bond between Natsume and Yukina and the brotherhood between Aoi and Kagura.However, the final few episodes felt lacking in budget and had a storyline, which was fine for the first half, then...unsatisfactory in the second. I felt like I was watching an entirely different series with unsatisfying payoffs at the end; additionally I feel that if more time was fleshed out for the ending, it would have been better. This could have been averted if there was not so much filler in the beginning, yet without the filler the character development would have suffered for the plot and the plot would not have suffered for the characters due to time constraints. For this reason, I am at a loss how to describe this anime. The first nine-or-so episodes has scenery that feels as though it was something out of Rao Pingru\'s ""Our Story: A Memoir of Love and Life in China"", anc character motivations that seemed logical and reasonable. The drama and suspense was reminiscent of the popular history novel ""Midnight in Peking"" throughout. But there are interactions in the final episodes that diminished the careful balance of idealism and realism that manifested itself prior.It may be a pipe dream, but I would like it if this anime was remade with a continuation of the original storylin, as this was still an incredibly well-done series. unsatisfactory in the second.

The opening and ending themes are also nice. The Indian caricature who had a white voice actor and the British dude who had an American voice actor was a nice meme. Although the guy who portrayed the Indian dude was far more skilled in expressing his emotions convincingly.Plot (3/10):It’s like Darker than Black. Except in China. In the 1930s. Look, it’s pretty interesting actually. But, some of the events do feel a bit wonky. You\'ll know what I mean when you...watch it. It\'s the kind of shit that makes you say to yourself ""I\'m fully aware I\'m watching a cartoon and it characters don\'t feel realistic (in terms of actions and responses)."" But it’s not that bad. Read the synopsis or something.-spoilers-The ending was shit. If you think otherwise, think about the character\'s actions and the time of those actions during the last episode. It\'s fucking retarded.-end spooilers-Setting (10/10):This anime takes place in the early 1930s – an interesting period in Japan’s history. During this time, Japan is already a world power, occupying Korea and “leasing” parts of Manchuria. However, we can witness the imperialistic mindset of the Japanese developing aggressively, leading to the autonomous Kwantung Army of Japan to stage the Mukden Incident and initiate the invasion of Manchuria. Also they add a bit of a supernatural twist in, which is kind of cool.I find Japan’s place in this time period to be one of the greatest yet saddest ironies I can think of. By defeating the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Japan was seen a shining beacon of freedom, a liberator so to speak, by many Asian nations at the time who were devastated by Western colonization. However, Japan didn’t share such a perspective. Japan sought to gain power by emulating the West, doing so by invading, colonizing, massacring, and raping the populaces of many other Asian nations in the years following. And it’s interesting to think that the Japanese encouraged modernization out of a fear of being dominated by Western powers, but by their own efforts, they became just like the colonizers they once feared. It’s kinda like the ending to Animal Farm.The anime doesn\'t go into all this detail, but you really should know this stuff before watching it.Characterization (6/10):A good amount of the characterization is done through flashbacks without much context, but it’s not too difficult to figure out what’s going on. It also feels a bit clumsy, as if the writers weren’t too sure of how to portray these scenes well. Also, that episode with the cat and the bag felt ridiculous and out-of-place compared to the rest of the episodes. But if you appreciate it as some form of comic relief, be my guest.I do enjoy the conflicting ideologies between Aoi and Kazura and also the conflict between Isao and Yukina as well. In the case of Aoi and Kazura, Aoi is quite critical of his country’s imperialistic attitude while Kazura responds defensively out of his sense of nationalism. This kind of conflict gives life to these characters, as it shows that they are clearly responding to their setting in a meaningful way. As for Yukina and Isao, Yukina is torn from having to fight against her brother, who is fighting for what he believes is right, even though he is radically misguided. Who is truly morally correct in this situation (in terms of ideology)? Also, sibling fighting is cute, isn’t it? ^^My verdict: meh watch it.

I've seen some pretty pretty shitty anime in my time, but this series takes the cake~!True, I tend to stay away from anime I think I won't like or have good reason to dislike (i.e. Naruto, One Piece, Girls Bravo, etc), but this anime lures you in with a good concept and short plot and fails to deliver!You expect some solid action, conspiracy, slices of the WWII time, but what you instead get is some micro-managed story that tries to get the audience to identify and emotionally-attach themselves to the characters. But it...needs time and sufficient reason, both of which we miss.I got as far as episode 7, true, so MAYBE MAYBE it gets better, but I have a strong feeling it will begin just as it ended.Anyway, good luck if you do decide to watch!

I was hooked from the beginning - a rarely explored historical setting, jaw-dropping fight choreography, high quality animation, serious plot but not overbearing - it was great.    We're so jaded as otaku into expecting the usual WWII whitewash from Japanese mass media - but it reads pretty true to events (aside from psychic powers and the narrative conceit of the Japanese mysteriously inventing a protypical A-Bomb).     Unfortunately, the crazy choreography...of the fights disappears quickly and true to most anime, the script loses its way and can't seal the deal in the end.

It first caught my eye on Netflix and I'm glad it did. Like the other reviews say, if you are interested in history, especially early 20th century history, this is the anime for you. However, my only major qualm with the show is that towards the end, the characters and the plot become a little shaky. Nevertheless, I would even just watch this anime for the animation and the soundtrack alone (goodness, the soundtrack is amazing, it's kind of a mix between Legend of Korra and jazz). And if you enjoy a...good hand to hand combat fight scene, this anime is chock full of them. It is certainly not an award winning anime, but I think it deserves more love than it is currently getting. good hand to hand combat fight scene, this anime is chock full of them.

This was quite a tumultuous time in history as some countries were undergoing massive changes, some were recovering from World War 1 while a select few were giving rise to what would spark World War 2.It was genuinely surprising and refreshing to see an anime actually be somewhat realistic portraying Japan back in those days, showing the dangers of their ideology and giving a fairly accurate depiction of the Manchurian...Incident, despite the fantastical elements added to spice up the story.The main characters are essentially spies with powerful abilities, Aoi has telekinesis, Yukina has telepathy, Natsume has x-ray vision and Kazura can teleport. The anime treats us with some enjoyable action scenes and plenty of intrigue in between them. Early on we see the team efficiently working together tackling the missions they’re given until they realize there’s more than meets the eye behind whatever their opponent is planning, as is often the case with these things.Moreover, each main character is well developed as we’re given a rough outline of their backstory and can infer their leanings and motivations from how they act throughout the show’s runtime which generally makes all their actions understandable. I’m glad it displays restraint and doesn’t tell everything there is to know about them, which leaves some comfortable room for us to read into things, this is especially poignant in the 5th episode, which is probably my favorite.For the most part, the show does quite well in its first 2/3rds, but it starts losing its thread a bit by the end as the main villain is fully revealed, his characterization and motivations are actually quite interesting, however his actions and the circumstances around them are less so. I don’t want to spoil anything, but suffice to say there’s a fifth ability beyond the four I described in the third paragraph, and it only serves to the show’s detriment more than anything else.By and large, Senkou no Night Raid is a good show, sure it stumbles a bit near the finish line, but everything else more than makes up for it, the setting right in the middle of the two world wars coupled with its subject matter are brimming with atmosphere, bringing you along for the ride back to those troubled days as you immerse yourself in it, all helped with a great soundtrack that fits very well with whatever tone it’s trying to convey, whether it’s a high energy action scene, a tense or mysterious sneaking scene or even a very emotional moment.I also recommend checking out the specials, Episode 7.5: ""Ahenkutsu no Akuma"" in particular was delightfully surreal.

Having watched this show again with a friend, I found my recommendation soured a bit by the inclusion of long pre-episode...history lessons over static images of maps. Certainly a fine addition if we were watching some kind of edutainment show, but had they all been cut, we likely could have gotten a whole other episode's worth of action and adventure from the saved footage and not lost anything in terms of context.One of my personal favorite aspects of the show centers around the abilities of the cast. Telekinesis, teleportation, clairvoyance... each member of the cast has their own unique power, and each power works within well-established, easy to process limitations. As the series progresses, those limitations become a compelling part of the action. Characters don't tap into heretofore undiscovered wells of power to contrive their way out of danger, instead having to use the tools that are available to them to solve problems. I'm personally quite a fan of static power levels; it's a fairly reliable way to establish stakes and avoids the arms race spectacle of late-stage shonen.That having been said, the plot does shift around between dry and awkward, at times. The low power level means that conflicts are smaller and more intimate in scale, but many of them wind up feeling like distractions. The final villain of the series sort of comes and goes with a minimum of fanfare, and while I can certainly remember facets of the show's ending, months after the fact, most of the series tends to occupy this valley of forgetfulness where things certainly happened, I just can't remember them.Overall, Senkou no Night Raid is a show that I, personally, enjoyed quite a bit.

I\'d rate it a 6 overall.The third special, episode 14, offers some nice closure to a couple of unresolved plot-points from the series and breezes by some rather disquieting social elements that are explored in more graphic detail in the second special, The Devil in the Opium Den.  I\'d rate the episode an 8.The second special, which falls somewhere prior to episode 12 of the series, was the one I watched last...and was, quite frankly, pretty shocking.  The familiar characters were passive observers to a kind of public-safety announcement on the evils of Opium Dens (and additional depravities).  No conclusion is reached and what passes for a plot made so brief an appearance as to be effectively non-existant.  Despite that, I have to rate this episode an 8 also for not candy-coating history.

Ryuuou no Oshigoto!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35905/Ryuuou_no_Oshigoto,"[""Yes, it's a good show despite being predictable. Despite not knowing a damn thing about Shogi I really enjoyed this show. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to enjoy it at all. The show provides the tools you need to follow along without being technical and boring. The story and premise is decent and it has a good cast and some funny dialogue. Despite being put in typical awkward situations with lolis the protagonist isn't some kind of pervert and only ever comments on the girls being cute. Watch it for the lolis and stay for the Shogi, it's a decent show. "", 'This anime. Or rather, this copy-paste formulaic anime adaptation of the light novel that apparently was voted #1 in the Japan’s Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! for 2017 made me wonder if the anime industry even tries anymore. It’s 2018 and here we are, an anime adaptation based on shogi with a cast filled with questionable characters and content. I was cautiously optimistic about this show at first but upon finishing this anime, I can say that without a shadow of a doubt, Ryuunou no Oshigoto left little more than desired.Sometimes, people say don’t judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately, that statement is hard...to apply for this series. Upon looking at the key visual, you’ll notice an average dull looking male protagonist surrounded by what seems to be a harem of girls. No, I’m not calling this anime a harem but it doesn’t help by the fact that some of them look about half his age. Still, there’s some hope because the show involves shogi, a strategic game of intelligence, right?Wrong.The story itself may be focused on shogi but the overall tone of the show will be far distracting than you’ll realize. The first few episodes can easily rub people in the wrong way with the way its characters are introduced. The main culprit is 9-year old Ai Hinatsuru who seems to have an attraction towards shogi master Yaichi. It leaves a controversial impression especially with how she reacts to him when other girls are involved in their lives. After being taken in as disciple, she seems to be even more attached to him to the point where you’ll see “yandere” moments. That’s just the tip of the iceberg though. We also meet Ginko Sora, a female prodigy who also happens to be Yaichi’s childhood friend. I think it’s easy to pinpoint her intentions after watching her reactions from just the first episode alone. Nonetheless, the initial beginning will test the audience on whether they should continue or not. For me, I decided to give this show a chance to see if it improves. Sadly, I’m mistaken.It seems almost every episode along the way wants to showcase shogi but also leaves the impression of underage girls doing what a grown up would do. Is that an overstatement? However, it’s undeniable that the show gives an uncomfortable feeling whenever characters such as Ai, Charlotte, or others tries to get Yaichi’s attention. Yaichi himself is hardly an interesting character either. The show saturates him with a generic personality and gets him often into compromising positions, either with his disciples or Ginko. It doesn’t help that he is dense as a black hole and the show never really develop him as a character. Speaking of development, the show is mostly void of that except on technical improvement of shogi skills. The only character that I respect in this anime would be Keika Kiyotaki. In perhaps one of the more realistic and heartwarming episodes, we see her determination and strive to improve. The storytelling of her past also make us understand Keika as a person and shogi player. Unfortunately, one episode can’t carry the show as altogether as the others are far less welcoming to watch.Now I’m not an expert on shogi but this anime seems to dedicate a lot of time in the matches themselves. One might think this is a positive but it’s hardly that. The mind games and psychology is hardly felt because of the way dialogue are delivered. It doesn’t help that the show often jumps around between opponents without giving the audience a memorable rivalry. Furthermore, the main cast is just incredibly one dimensional with personalities that are hardly interesting. If you want some actual shogi with integrity and promising story, check out 3-gatsu no Lion.Project No.9 is an oddball studio. My impression of their work in recent years has quite underwhelming and it seems that they didn’t manage to step up to the plate this time. On paper, the anime quality looks tolerable with the body movements, character designs, and facial expressions. However, there’s not much else that makes this anime’s visual quality stand out. Sure, there’s character reactions that can be comedic at times but it gets tedious fast. You can pretty much open up a light novel and see similarities in almost every series these days. It doesn’t help that the anime pulls out fan service moments that set off red flags. Oh and Yaichi, he has a very punchable face.On a more positive note, I suppose the anime’s soundtrack and voice mannerism managed to stay its welcome. Younger characters aren’t easy to portray but I got the impression that it was well delivered. Ginko’s voice is perhaps the most noticeable whenever she gets into a bad mood. On the other hand, I wish there was an auto-mute button whenever Yaichi talks in overly long dialogues. The theme songs of the show are rather catchy despite how generic it looks.If I said it once, I said it a hundred times. This show leaves little to be desired. You can watch this anime for the shogi but in the end, you’ll probably remember more than that. And I don’t mean that as a positive impression. One character I will actually remember for good measure though is Keika. I prayed the show would develop her more but it seems the anime decided to take steps back after that one memorable episode. For what’s worth, watch this anime with caution if you choose. It honestly became a show that gives shogi a bad name. to apply for this series.

Oh and Yaichi, he has a very punchable face.On a more positive note, I suppose the anime’s soundtrack and voice mannerism managed to stay its welcome. Younger characters aren’t easy to portray but I got the impression that it was well delivered. Ginko’s voice is perhaps the most noticeable whenever she gets into a bad mood. On the other hand, I wish there was an auto-mute button whenever Yaichi talks in overly long dialogues. The theme songs of the show are rather catchy despite how generic it looks.If I said it once, I said it a hundred times. This show leaves little to be desired. You can watch this anime for the shogi but in the end, you’ll probably remember more than that. And I don’t mean that as a positive impression. One character I will actually remember for good measure though is Keika. I prayed the show would develop her more but it seems the anime decided to take steps back after that one memorable episode. For what’s worth, watch this anime with caution if you choose. It honestly became a show that gives shogi a bad name.', ""Please note this review assumes that you have finished watching Ryuuou no Oshigoto and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.Learning to value the bonds that a master and disciple make while playing Shogi with Ai and friendsBased off a well-known light novel series of the same name Ryuuou no Oshigoto or its English title which is the Ryuo’s work is never done gives us the opportunity to look into the world of Shogi from not just a player’s perspective but also from a master’s perspective as they train...prospective students to enter the often-overlooked world of competitive shogi. It does this by introducing us to the Osaka Shogi scene and the many people that are connected to it which includes among their number powerful Shogi players as well as prospective shogi players who wish to enter the world of shogi for many varied reasons. The first episode of the series made a pretty impression on me largely due to the demonstration of the main heroine Ai Hinatsuru’s skill at shogi despite her young age. While wary of the many bad impressions that people had on the premise of the show I kept the show on my watch list and looking back at it I'm glad that I did as I really enjoyed this show.Taking place within the modern era within the city of Osaka and the surrounding areas Ryuuou no Oshigoto’s overall story follows the life of Yaichi Kuzuryuu a 16 year old teenager that despite his young age is already an accomplished shogi player who had just won the coveted shogi title of Ryuo and his encounter with Ai Hinatsuru a  9 year old elementary school girl a prodigy at shogi who had come seeking to become his disciple. As Yachi and Ai becomes master and apprentice and enter the Osaka shogi scene he soon begins to appreciate the unique skills that Ai has and how they can be used to both introduce new talent to the Osaka shogi scene while at the same time improve his own skills as they both confront the unique challenges that both title holders and beginners in the world of competitive shogi face. Along the way, Yachi and Ai would encounter many varied and interesting characters in their journey to improve their skills in Shogi. These include Ginko Sora Yaichi’s fellow apprentice who is as beautiful as she is skilled in Shogi, Ai Yashajin a rich and arrogant girl from Kobe that possesses skills equal to his disciple, Keika Yaichi’s fellow apprentice and his masters daughter who is determined to break into the league before time runs out and Ika a title holder that approaches Shogi with arrogance and seeks only to beat opponents relentlessly to satisfy her ego.YaichiYaichi Kuzuryuu voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuma Uchida of Classroom Crisis fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Despite his young age, Yaichi is already a veteran shogi player and a newly christened title holder having managed to secure the coveted title of Ryuo and becoming the youngest player to achieve that title in history. A 16-year-old teenager Yaichi is a kind, polite and considerate person that on first impression did not really fit the image of a pro shogi player and indeed more like a normal teenager. While kind and polite in the beginning Yaichi was also seen to be someone that was also understanding and patient and treated everyone with respect and dignity whether they are surprise gatecrashers or fellow shogi players. Having played shogi since childhood it can be seen that Yachi is someone that views the sport as something sacred and treats it with the utmost respect and as a result dislikes people that either dismiss it as a game or those players that treat their matches badly as he feels that they are not respecting the sport if they don’t play it seriously. While appearing indecisive in the beginning Yaichi was also someone that was noted to be intelligent and fast thinking and was the type of person that researched his opponents seriously to come up with countermeasures that show his determination to pay respect to both the game and to his opponents. While noted to have a great deal of pride at the beginning Yaichi true to his kind nature was also noted to be someone that was not just perceptive but also intelligent enough to realise the error of his ways and admit to the mistakes that he had made.As the series goes on and as events allow him to meet both Ai Hinatsuru as well as Ai Yashajin Yaichi’s personality gradually starts to change as the series progresses. At the beginning of the series as a result of his slump, Yaichi was noted to be someone that had low self-esteem that was only held back by his positive attitude and passion for the sport and worked only to secure a victory to silence his many detractors. This however changed after his encounter with Ai Hinatsuru. While initially sceptical of Ai given how she just suddenly appeared in front of him this opinion of her gradually changed after seeing the level of skill that she had skills that were every bit as equal to his own despite the lack of training and actual playing experience that she had. As a result of seeing the level of skill that she had as well as seeing her earnest desire to become his disciple Yaichi’s core focus soon changed to one that revolved around the training of Ai as his disciple and raise her as a pro shogi player that will be able to make full use of the talent that she had. While somewhat reluctant at the beginning due to the many opinions that people had about him and Ai as the series goes on this reluctance gradually disappears and is replaced by his desire to teach her carefully and calmly showing his determination to fulfil this promise. While somewhat reluctant and embarrassed to be associated with Ai at first this feeling gradually transforms to that of pride at having someone as skilled as her as his disciple and is something that Yaichi makes use of as his main source of motivation as the series goes on. While positive and calm on the surface Yaichi in the series also faced a number of problems that were unique to him. At the beginning of the series while Yachi had great skill he was also rather unimaginative with his tactics and as such was looked down by many people and his victory over the previous Ryuo was widely seen as a fluke. While dismissing them as harmless it can be seen that beneath the surface these sentiments affected him greatly. As the series progresses and Yaichi encounters first Ai Hinatsuru and later Ai Yashajin this feeling of inferiority starts to decrease as he upon seeing both their skills at shogi develops a motivation to improve his skills not just to improve his standing within the shogi world but also to be a good master to them. Yaichi’s most prominent trait is without a doubt his desire to not see Shogi as just another competitive sport but also a sport where his disciples can be good at and enjoy while respecting other players. This aspect of him I particularly liked as it showed how much he loved and respected the sport.Ai HinatsuruAi Hinatsuru voiced by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of SAO and Accel world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main heroine. A 9-year-old girl that’s still in elementary school Ai is on first appearance a quiet and nervous girl that nonetheless tries to project a cheerful attitude to mask it. After overcoming this it can be seen that Ai is also someone that is polite and well mannered and is also someone that is intelligent and fast thinking while also having a strong spirit that refuses to admit defeat. These three latter traits however can be said to be the ones that truly define her as they help form the foundation of Ai’s most prominent skill which is her skills as a shogi player. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that despite her young age Ai was noted to have an unusual amount of skill when it came to shogi and indeed can be seen to be a prodigy at that sport that is shown best in the first match that she had with Yaichi. In this, it can be seen that while only adept at the basic moves at first Ai’s real skill that continues to improve as the series goes on is her ability to enter into a focused state where she can focus her concentration on reading the shogi board and plan out her moves before they can be made. This type of ability while far from being non-existent is usually possessed by veteran players of the game who have had hundreds of matches under their belt and as a result, seeing a 9-year-old girl have this same ability is indeed something that can be said to be most unusual indeed. In line with this ability is another of Ai’s impressive traits which is her flawless memory which is her ability to remember every move and shogi problem that she had made or solved. When combined with her ability to enter into a focused state the level of ability that Ai has while certainly unrefined at first is nothing short of astounding and ensures that the title of shogi prodigy is an apt title for her.While Ai and Yaichi had the most unusual of first encounters as the series goes on it can be seen that Ai views her master with both admiration and respect and it can be seen that being his disciple is something that she had aspired to do since their first meeting. As a result of this level of admiration for her, master Ai is someone that is noted to have a great deal of pride on being recognised as his disciple and dislikes it when she has competition for this important role. True to this act Ai is shown to be very loyal to her master and will come to his defence at once if someone slanders him something that I felt was admirable of her. As the series goes on it can be seen that Ai’s feelings towards her master is something that easily exceeds that of a normal master-disciple relationship that can be seen in her attempts to please her master and her reactions when she see’s him with other girls. In this side of her, it can be seen that Ai is very conscious of her master’s actions and she can easily tell if he’s hiding something from her through her boosted perception skills something that I find quite hilarious as nothing beats seeing Yaichi being pinned to the wall by Ai’s glare. As the series goes on and as Ai and Yachi’s relationship improves it can be seen that Ai has begun to be more perceptive of the feelings and moods that Yachi projects as a result of the bond that they share and as a result she can feel both joy at seeing her master when he’s happy as well as feel disheartened when she see’s him in pain. This level of perception, however, is a doubled edged sword as while the former can make Ai’s determination to win and fight tenaciously to the end it can also have the opposite effort of affecting her morale and concentration when she senses the bond between her and her master weakening. The character of Ai Hinatsuru I felt was an interesting one as though she’s off a relatively young age the level of maturity that she has as well as the level of skill that she has in Shogi was very impressive. Despite the level of players that she has to face in her journey to become a pro player her determination to face them head on to both prove her skills and his masters trust in her was very admirable. I felt that her seiyuu Rina Hidaka really did a fantastic job at portraying the character of Ai Hinatsuru.GinkoGinko Sora voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gunslinger Strato’s fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Yaichi’s fellow shogi apprentice and fellow shogi title holder. A 14-year-old Junior high school student Ginko despite her young age is like Yaichi a fellow title holder in Shogi that also commands a lot of respect within the community due to her impressive win record against her fellow female pro shogi players. Unlike Yaichi no one denies the skills that Ginko has in Shogi and while she has many titles to her name it is the nickname that her fans gave her that truly make her stand out over her other titles this being the Snow White of Naniwa which is a somewhat ominous nickname.  A childhood friend and fellow shogi disciple of Yaichi Ginko has the unique position of being both a childhood friend and a senior disciple of Yaichi which also makes her somewhat of a mentor to Yaichi as well. As a result of this, it can be seen that Yaichi pays her a lot of respect in deference to this role. A quiet, blunt and confident young woman by nature Ginko is someone that’s shown to be a very determined and highly motivated person that has a strong will to succeed in everything that she does. While quiet by nature and indeed not one for small talk Ginko is shown to be someone that prefers a more direct approach to things seen both in her matches in shogi as well as in life. While conscious of the fame that she has managed to achieve within the shogi world Ginko is shown to be a modest person by nature and will respect those that have played the best they can against her whether she likes them or not.As the series goes on however Ginko’s personality starts to gradually change. At the beginning of the series, Ginko was noted to have a very icy personality especially when she deals with Yaichi and in which she’s noted to treat him rather harshly irrespective of the actions that he may or may not have done. This is especially true when she interrogates him for information when she determines that he’s hiding things from her. In this however we can see that the relationship between the two of is not as simple as it sounds as more than anything its obvious that Ginko sees Yaichi as more than a friend and fellow disciple and instead see’s him as something of a rival that can be relied upon to help each other when one needs help in shogi as well as let off steam by playing each other relentlessly. In this, despite the disparity between them in terms of titles, it can be seen that Ginko see’s Yaichi as a rival that’s superior to her in shogi and it is this desire to match Yaichi that truly acts as her core motivation to do well in Shogi. While Ginko, in the beginning, was quiet and somewhat blunt she was also shown to be rather assertive with her demands on Yachi but at the same time, she was also shown to have a rather mischievous side to her personality as well a contrast that I felt was interesting. While shown to be near expressionless in the beginning as the series goes on It can be seen that Ginko was someone that was also very loyal to her friends and was someone that easily got upset if their actions caused them distress a side of her personality that I particularly liked as it contrasted well with her Tsundere personality. This is best shown in her attempts to help Yaichi face his problems during his crisis during the Ryuo title match and her subsequent reaction when she was rebuffed by him. As the series goes on it can be seen that Ginko has a rather interesting complex in which she dislikes being seen and treated as a girl by others and can easily get embarrassed if she has to wear clothing that is typically associated with girls. This side of her personality was an interesting one as her behaviour when she’s in this mode is very much like a cute girl as she acts embarrassed and blushes openly rather than her usual icy Tsundere look. While harsh and violent towards Yaichi most of the time it’s interesting to note that even she has a softer side to her that she will show when she tries to help friends that are in a tight spot. The character of Ginko I felt was an interesting one as though she was Yaichi’s fellow disciple she was also his mentor and it can be seen that both rely on each other to improve their skills at shogi. The contrast between her personality with that of Ai and Yaichi I felt was interesting as it highlighted the fact that while they may have different personalities and approaches to shogi they are all united in their determination to play shogi and respect both the game and their opponents in doing so. I felt that her seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Ginko.Ai YashajinAi Yashajin voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura is one of the main characters of the series. A 9-year-old girl from a rich family that lives in Kobe Ai Yashajin on initial appearance is an arrogant and self-confident young girl that in the beginning tended to look down on others and was the complete opposite to Ai in terms of personality. While arrogant and possessing boundless confidence in herself Ai Yashajin was also noted to be a cynical person that had a lot of pride in her skills as a shogi player despite her lack of actual combat experience in the beginning and was also fiercely competitive regardless of who her opponent was. Despite that Ai Yashajin was also noted to have a teasing and malicious side to her that she makes use off when she feels the situation calls for it a side that I felt complemented her arrogant personality pretty well. Indeed, from the onset it can be seen that while Ai Hinatsuru has the image of a cute angel Ai Yashajin was the opposite and instead having the aura of a demon as in the beginning she got angry very easily and fought with great tenacity in her matches even when the tide has turned against her.As the series goes on however Ai Yashajin’s personality gradually changes as a result of not just meeting Yaichi but also seeing what the shogi world really was like. In the beginning of the series as a result of learning to play shogi through both self-taught materials as well as her parents records and notes Ai Yashajin while having the basics of shogi locked down was noted to have no actual combat experience in the real world and as a result of this often fell into traps when faced with opponents that make use of unconventional tactics. This shows that while she has the basics locked down she was lacking in the ability to read people’s moves and intentions which like in all board games is of great importance. As the series goes on this weakness of her’s gradually vanishes. While still tenacious and unwilling to give up Ai Yashajin gradually gets better at both reading the board and of people greatly improving her chances of victory. While Ai Yashajin as the series goes on generally retains her arrogant nature it can be seen that this attitude of her’s gradually softens as she learns to enjoy playing shogi with others and learn that shogi is not just about playing to win against her opponents but also to make connections with like-minded people while enjoying testing your strength against theirs. While Ai Yashajin and Yaichi did not have the best of first encounters and indeed she at first looked down on him at first this gradually changed as the series went as she was able to see the great effort and attentive care that Yaichi put in to help her understand the knowledge that she would need if she wanted to enter the shogi world and make a name for herself. As a result of this Ai Yashajin’s attitude towards Yaichi gradually changed and she soon learned to both respect his skills at shogi as well as the fact that he treated her like a normal person and did not let her status stop him from treating her bluntly if she did not get anything that was taught. The character of Ai Yashajin I felt was an interesting character as in addition to being polar opposites to Ai Hinatsuru in terms of shogi tactics Ai Yashajin was also every bit the opposite in terms of personality. The gradual thawing of Ai Yashajin’s personality from a withdrawn Tsundere that only played shogi to remember to one that had found that playing shogi in the real world while more punishing was actually more fun and challenging I felt was something that was well done and made great use of one of the series main themes which was that only by playing together would one be able to improve their skills while enjoying the game. I felt that her seiyuu Ayane Sakura really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ai Yashajin.KeikaKeika Kiyotaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of 3 Gatsu no lion and Anohana fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is both Yaichi’s fellow shogi disciple and the daughter of his master. A young woman in her mid-twenties Keika is a kind, caring and thoughtful person that’s also considerate and understanding of others. In this, it can be seen that Keika fits the very image of a big sister within the shogi family that Yaichi, Ai and Ginko belong too. Unlike Yaichi and Ginko Keika is not a title holder and indeed not a pro player as well and is instead she like Ai is a shogi trainee that hopes to be able to pass the training course and become a pro player.As the series goes on and as Keika’s personality is gradually revealed to us it can be seen that Keika has her fair share of problems that are worrying her that she tries to hide from her fellow shogi family members. While positive and relaxed on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Keika struggles greatly with the fact that despite the shogi skills that she had inherited from her father as well as through practice with Yachi and Ginko she hasn’t been able to make much headway with her dream of becoming a pro player while her fellow family members Yaichi and Ginko had gradually overtaken her and achieved fame within the world of shogi something that she punishes herself for. As a result of this, it can be seen that Keika is rather desperate to achieve her dream as unlike Yaichi and Ginko Keika also has to contend with the duo pressure of reaching the age limit and being dismissed from the training class due to defeats. As the series goes on Keika’s fortune and luck eventually changes and makes her realise that while having the pride of being from a famous shogi family was a good thing letting that constrain you and force you to punish yourself was not and that one should be able to walk the path that they want too without forgetting their roots. The character of Keika I felt was an interesting one as despite being happy and positive beneath the surface Keika is, in fact, someone that wrestles with a lot of struggles that are unique to her. This contrast in her outer and inner self I felt was especially well done as it allowed us to see the struggles that older shogi players may feel as they struggle to break into the pro players league while having to battle not just opponents that are not just younger than they are but also more skilled that they are.IkaIka Sainokami voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Tomatsu of Sword Art online and Asura crying fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow female pro shogi player to Ginko. A young teenage girl Ika is an arrogant, self-confident and menacing opponent that has the traits of a classic egotist. True to this personality type Ika is someone that cares little about either her opponent or manners and indeed seems to live only to crush her opponents relentlessly and use this to gain even more power and improve her skills. As a result of this, it can be seen that Ika is someone that hates weak opponents and would slander those that she considers weak as she see’s them as someone that’s not worth her time at all. As the series progresses it can be seen that Ika’s view of Yaichi is an unusual one in that she views him as more like an object than a person one that she only wants to herself and one whose only purpose was to play shogi with her to her heart's content. The character of Ika while introduced rather late in the series I felt was an interesting character as more than ever she represented a strong and fearsome opponent to both Ai and Yaichi in more ways than one that they had to overcome if they wanted to progress in their journey.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the series did a very job at showing the main setting of the series which was the city of Osaka and the various locales that the city had. The character designs for the series I felt were also well done and were faithful to their light novel counterparts to which I'm thankful. The animation for the moves that the characters make during the matches as well as the animation for the matches themselves was something that I felt was well done and it made it easier to see the significance of each move as well as how it impacted on the match as well.  In terms of voice acting overall, I felt that the main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Rina Hidaka, Ayane Sakura, and Hisako Kanemoto deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In terms of music, I thought that the series OST did a great job at conveying the various feelings and emotions that lay behind each scene and helped greatly in allowing us to see the types of feelings that the characters were going through at that time.Overall conclusionIn overall Ryuuou no Oshigoto was a really fun but also a really interesting anime that I really enjoyed watching this season and is arguably one of this season best anime’s. The series main strong points I thought were the interesting premise, story, characters, animation and strong voice acting and its strong emphasis on having fun while also learning how to play shogi with Ai and her friends. Unlike most countries, a lot of countries in Asia have the belief that if one wants to achieve mastery at something one must start training at an early age. As a result of this seeing, a 9-year-old decide to show up and petition a professional to train her as their disciple is by no means unusual. A lot of people seem to have the impression that this practice is shifty, but this is far from the truth as most martial arts and not to mention board games such as shogi really do start training them from an early age. In fact, as the members of the training class has proven the age of entry is actually between 7 and 9. One of the series main themes is learning to play shogi but as with all learning methods, the disciple would have to while learning how to play also encounter others that have the same goals as them. Humans by their very nature are social creatures and if we encounter people that share our interests its natural that we would want to bond with them. When trying to learn anything its always better if you learn it with friends. While learning shogi is the main theme part of that journey involves forging friendships with your fellow players and playing with them to not only improve your skills at it but also improve theirs as well as without playing with others you will not be able to learn what your flaws are and how you can rid yourself of them to improve yourself. While doing a good job at showing the teaching the basics to both Ai and to us viewers the series also did well to use this theme to teach us that winning in shogi is not everything and that defeat too can be a learning experience and one that can be used to figure out your flaws and correct them. Above all, it stresses that the most important thing is that you are having fun challenging others and learning from that experience and in turn helping both them and you.With Shogi as the main theme, it was important that the series not only featured interesting and entertaining matches but also genuine shogi moves that are used for real. In this I felt that the series did a great job at showing this as not only are each of the matches interesting and well designed but they also featured analysis’s of not just the players moves via simple and easily followed explanations but also looks at the players mental state and the feelings that they may be feeling as well. The look at the feelings that one may be feeling as well as at the issues that may affect a shogi player I felt was a good move as no matter how calm one is they cannot ignore every feeling that they may have and these can have adverse effects on a shogi match if you are unable to maintain your calmness. One other aspect that I thought the series did well in was its showing of the various ages of people that play in the shogi world. While largely unknown outside of Japan shogi is a world that can be said to attract people from all walks of life and the ages of people that enter its world can vary substantially which is best shown in the ages of the characters that are featured in the series from the 9-year-old Ai to the 14-year-old Ginko and the 16-year-old Yaichi. To them, shogi is the world that links all of them together. Apart from teaching us how to play shogi the other main theme that series makes use off that it makes use of as its main premise is the relationship between Yaichi and Ai in the form of the master and disciple relationship. Though increasingly rare such relationships do certainly exist, and they are of a more important nature than normal relationships. The relationship between a master and a disciple can be a complex one as the master is responsible for not just training their disciple but also learn to exist with them and learn how to tease out the skills that they may have while also working to motivate them and keep them focused. As a result of this, the degree of trust that can be formed between a master and disciple can be potent and deep one that can inspire a great sense of loyalty to the two that can be used to motivate them or break them out of a jam when needed. While Ai and Yaichi had the most random of first encounters as the series progresses it can be seen that a strong bond between the two gradually forms bonds that not only serve to motivate Ai so that she will do her best to not lose and let her master down but also serve to motivate Yachi to work hard for Ai by improving his own skills so that he can continue to teach her. This feeling of both master and disciple working together to both learn shogi and improve their skills by relying on and finding strength from each other as they overcome challenges together I thought was well done and illustrated just how strong such a bond can be if both master and disciple learn to rely on each other. Overall Ryuuou no Oshigoto was an anime that I really enjoyed as while being an effective anime in its own right its focus on teaching how to play shogi also did well to give it the additional role of an educational anime and had the effect of introducing the sport of shogi to a larger audience which I feel will make it more popular and hopefully give it some new blood. As a final score, I would give Ryuuou no Oshigoto a final score of 10/10 as while enjoying learning about Shogi I also really enjoyed seeing Yachi forge bonds with the many characters that he meets along the way while having fun playing shogi. Bonds that can be as powerful as any strategy that one can use to motivate oneself when caught in a pinch. prospective students to enter the often-overlooked world of competitive shogi. It does this by introducing us to the Osaka Shogi scene and the many people that are connected to it which includes among their number powerful Shogi players as well as prospective shogi players who wish to enter the world of shogi for many varied reasons. The first episode of the series made a pretty impression on me largely due to the demonstration of the main heroine Ai Hinatsuru’s skill at shogi despite her young age. While wary of the many bad impressions that people had on the premise of the show I kept the show on my watch list and looking back at it I'm glad that I did as I really enjoyed this show.Taking place within the modern era within the city of Osaka and the surrounding areas Ryuuou no Oshigoto’s overall story follows the life of Yaichi Kuzuryuu a 16 year old teenager that despite his young age is already an accomplished shogi player who had just won the coveted shogi title of Ryuo and his encounter with Ai Hinatsuru a  9 year old elementary school girl a prodigy at shogi who had come seeking to become his disciple. As Yachi and Ai becomes master and apprentice and enter the Osaka shogi scene he soon begins to appreciate the unique skills that Ai has and how they can be used to both introduce new talent to the Osaka shogi scene while at the same time improve his own skills as they both confront the unique challenges that both title holders and beginners in the world of competitive shogi face. Along the way, Yachi and Ai would encounter many varied and interesting characters in their journey to improve their skills in Shogi. These include Ginko Sora Yaichi’s fellow apprentice who is as beautiful as she is skilled in Shogi, Ai Yashajin a rich and arrogant girl from Kobe that possesses skills equal to his disciple, Keika Yaichi’s fellow apprentice and his masters daughter who is determined to break into the league before time runs out and Ika a title holder that approaches Shogi with arrogance and seeks only to beat opponents relentlessly to satisfy her ego.YaichiYaichi Kuzuryuu voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuma Uchida of Classroom Crisis fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Despite his young age, Yaichi is already a veteran shogi player and a newly christened title holder having managed to secure the coveted title of Ryuo and becoming the youngest player to achieve that title in history. A 16-year-old teenager Yaichi is a kind, polite and considerate person that on first impression did not really fit the image of a pro shogi player and indeed more like a normal teenager. While kind and polite in the beginning Yaichi was also seen to be someone that was also understanding and patient and treated everyone with respect and dignity whether they are surprise gatecrashers or fellow shogi players. Having played shogi since childhood it can be seen that Yachi is someone that views the sport as something sacred and treats it with the utmost respect and as a result dislikes people that either dismiss it as a game or those players that treat their matches badly as he feels that they are not respecting the sport if they don’t play it seriously. While appearing indecisive in the beginning Yaichi was also someone that was noted to be intelligent and fast thinking and was the type of person that researched his opponents seriously to come up with countermeasures that show his determination to pay respect to both the game and to his opponents. While noted to have a great deal of pride at the beginning Yaichi true to his kind nature was also noted to be someone that was not just perceptive but also intelligent enough to realise the error of his ways and admit to the mistakes that he had made.As the series goes on and as events allow him to meet both Ai Hinatsuru as well as Ai Yashajin Yaichi’s personality gradually starts to change as the series progresses. At the beginning of the series as a result of his slump, Yaichi was noted to be someone that had low self-esteem that was only held back by his positive attitude and passion for the sport and worked only to secure a victory to silence his many detractors. This however changed after his encounter with Ai Hinatsuru. While initially sceptical of Ai given how she just suddenly appeared in front of him this opinion of her gradually changed after seeing the level of skill that she had skills that were every bit as equal to his own despite the lack of training and actual playing experience that she had. As a result of seeing the level of skill that she had as well as seeing her earnest desire to become his disciple Yaichi’s core focus soon changed to one that revolved around the training of Ai as his disciple and raise her as a pro shogi player that will be able to make full use of the talent that she had. While somewhat reluctant at the beginning due to the many opinions that people had about him and Ai as the series goes on this reluctance gradually disappears and is replaced by his desire to teach her carefully and calmly showing his determination to fulfil this promise. While somewhat reluctant and embarrassed to be associated with Ai at first this feeling gradually transforms to that of pride at having someone as skilled as her as his disciple and is something that Yaichi makes use of as his main source of motivation as the series goes on. While positive and calm on the surface Yaichi in the series also faced a number of problems that were unique to him. At the beginning of the series while Yachi had great skill he was also rather unimaginative with his tactics and as such was looked down by many people and his victory over the previous Ryuo was widely seen as a fluke. While dismissing them as harmless it can be seen that beneath the surface these sentiments affected him greatly. As the series progresses and Yaichi encounters first Ai Hinatsuru and later Ai Yashajin this feeling of inferiority starts to decrease as he upon seeing both their skills at shogi develops a motivation to improve his skills not just to improve his standing within the shogi world but also to be a good master to them. Yaichi’s most prominent trait is without a doubt his desire to not see Shogi as just another competitive sport but also a sport where his disciples can be good at and enjoy while respecting other players. This aspect of him I particularly liked as it showed how much he loved and respected the sport.Ai HinatsuruAi Hinatsuru voiced by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of SAO and Accel world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main heroine. A 9-year-old girl that’s still in elementary school Ai is on first appearance a quiet and nervous girl that nonetheless tries to project a cheerful attitude to mask it. After overcoming this it can be seen that Ai is also someone that is polite and well mannered and is also someone that is intelligent and fast thinking while also having a strong spirit that refuses to admit defeat. These three latter traits however can be said to be the ones that truly define her as they help form the foundation of Ai’s most prominent skill which is her skills as a shogi player. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that despite her young age Ai was noted to have an unusual amount of skill when it came to shogi and indeed can be seen to be a prodigy at that sport that is shown best in the first match that she had with Yaichi. In this, it can be seen that while only adept at the basic moves at first Ai’s real skill that continues to improve as the series goes on is her ability to enter into a focused state where she can focus her concentration on reading the shogi board and plan out her moves before they can be made. This type of ability while far from being non-existent is usually possessed by veteran players of the game who have had hundreds of matches under their belt and as a result, seeing a 9-year-old girl have this same ability is indeed something that can be said to be most unusual indeed. In line with this ability is another of Ai’s impressive traits which is her flawless memory which is her ability to remember every move and shogi problem that she had made or solved. When combined with her ability to enter into a focused state the level of ability that Ai has while certainly unrefined at first is nothing short of astounding and ensures that the title of shogi prodigy is an apt title for her.While Ai and Yaichi had the most unusual of first encounters as the series goes on it can be seen that Ai views her master with both admiration and respect and it can be seen that being his disciple is something that she had aspired to do since their first meeting. As a result of this level of admiration for her, master Ai is someone that is noted to have a great deal of pride on being recognised as his disciple and dislikes it when she has competition for this important role. True to this act Ai is shown to be very loyal to her master and will come to his defence at once if someone slanders him something that I felt was admirable of her. As the series goes on it can be seen that Ai’s feelings towards her master is something that easily exceeds that of a normal master-disciple relationship that can be seen in her attempts to please her master and her reactions when she see’s him with other girls. In this side of her, it can be seen that Ai is very conscious of her master’s actions and she can easily tell if he’s hiding something from her through her boosted perception skills something that I find quite hilarious as nothing beats seeing Yaichi being pinned to the wall by Ai’s glare. As the series goes on and as Ai and Yachi’s relationship improves it can be seen that Ai has begun to be more perceptive of the feelings and moods that Yachi projects as a result of the bond that they share and as a result she can feel both joy at seeing her master when he’s happy as well as feel disheartened when she see’s him in pain. This level of perception, however, is a doubled edged sword as while the former can make Ai’s determination to win and fight tenaciously to the end it can also have the opposite effort of affecting her morale and concentration when she senses the bond between her and her master weakening. The character of Ai Hinatsuru I felt was an interesting one as though she’s off a relatively young age the level of maturity that she has as well as the level of skill that she has in Shogi was very impressive. Despite the level of players that she has to face in her journey to become a pro player her determination to face them head on to both prove her skills and his masters trust in her was very admirable. I felt that her seiyuu Rina Hidaka really did a fantastic job at portraying the character of Ai Hinatsuru.GinkoGinko Sora voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gunslinger Strato’s fame is one of the main characters of the series and is both Yaichi’s fellow shogi apprentice and fellow shogi title holder. A 14-year-old Junior high school student Ginko despite her young age is like Yaichi a fellow title holder in Shogi that also commands a lot of respect within the community due to her impressive win record against her fellow female pro shogi players. Unlike Yaichi no one denies the skills that Ginko has in Shogi and while she has many titles to her name it is the nickname that her fans gave her that truly make her stand out over her other titles this being the Snow White of Naniwa which is a somewhat ominous nickname.  A childhood friend and fellow shogi disciple of Yaichi Ginko has the unique position of being both a childhood friend and a senior disciple of Yaichi which also makes her somewhat of a mentor to Yaichi as well. As a result of this, it can be seen that Yaichi pays her a lot of respect in deference to this role. A quiet, blunt and confident young woman by nature Ginko is someone that’s shown to be a very determined and highly motivated person that has a strong will to succeed in everything that she does. While quiet by nature and indeed not one for small talk Ginko is shown to be someone that prefers a more direct approach to things seen both in her matches in shogi as well as in life. While conscious of the fame that she has managed to achieve within the shogi world Ginko is shown to be a modest person by nature and will respect those that have played the best they can against her whether she likes them or not.As the series goes on however Ginko’s personality starts to gradually change. At the beginning of the series, Ginko was noted to have a very icy personality especially when she deals with Yaichi and in which she’s noted to treat him rather harshly irrespective of the actions that he may or may not have done. This is especially true when she interrogates him for information when she determines that he’s hiding things from her. In this however we can see that the relationship between the two of is not as simple as it sounds as more than anything its obvious that Ginko sees Yaichi as more than a friend and fellow disciple and instead see’s him as something of a rival that can be relied upon to help each other when one needs help in shogi as well as let off steam by playing each other relentlessly. In this, despite the disparity between them in terms of titles, it can be seen that Ginko see’s Yaichi as a rival that’s superior to her in shogi and it is this desire to match Yaichi that truly acts as her core motivation to do well in Shogi. While Ginko, in the beginning, was quiet and somewhat blunt she was also shown to be rather assertive with her demands on Yachi but at the same time, she was also shown to have a rather mischievous side to her personality as well a contrast that I felt was interesting. While shown to be near expressionless in the beginning as the series goes on It can be seen that Ginko was someone that was also very loyal to her friends and was someone that easily got upset if their actions caused them distress a side of her personality that I particularly liked as it contrasted well with her Tsundere personality. This is best shown in her attempts to help Yaichi face his problems during his crisis during the Ryuo title match and her subsequent reaction when she was rebuffed by him. As the series goes on it can be seen that Ginko has a rather interesting complex in which she dislikes being seen and treated as a girl by others and can easily get embarrassed if she has to wear clothing that is typically associated with girls. This side of her personality was an interesting one as her behaviour when she’s in this mode is very much like a cute girl as she acts embarrassed and blushes openly rather than her usual icy Tsundere look. While harsh and violent towards Yaichi most of the time it’s interesting to note that even she has a softer side to her that she will show when she tries to help friends that are in a tight spot. The character of Ginko I felt was an interesting one as though she was Yaichi’s fellow disciple she was also his mentor and it can be seen that both rely on each other to improve their skills at shogi. The contrast between her personality with that of Ai and Yaichi I felt was interesting as it highlighted the fact that while they may have different personalities and approaches to shogi they are all united in their determination to play shogi and respect both the game and their opponents in doing so. I felt that her seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Ginko.Ai YashajinAi Yashajin voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura is one of the main characters of the series. A 9-year-old girl from a rich family that lives in Kobe Ai Yashajin on initial appearance is an arrogant and self-confident young girl that in the beginning tended to look down on others and was the complete opposite to Ai in terms of personality. While arrogant and possessing boundless confidence in herself Ai Yashajin was also noted to be a cynical person that had a lot of pride in her skills as a shogi player despite her lack of actual combat experience in the beginning and was also fiercely competitive regardless of who her opponent was. Despite that Ai Yashajin was also noted to have a teasing and malicious side to her that she makes use off when she feels the situation calls for it a side that I felt complemented her arrogant personality pretty well. Indeed, from the onset it can be seen that while Ai Hinatsuru has the image of a cute angel Ai Yashajin was the opposite and instead having the aura of a demon as in the beginning she got angry very easily and fought with great tenacity in her matches even when the tide has turned against her.As the series goes on however Ai Yashajin’s personality gradually changes as a result of not just meeting Yaichi but also seeing what the shogi world really was like. In the beginning of the series as a result of learning to play shogi through both self-taught materials as well as her parents records and notes Ai Yashajin while having the basics of shogi locked down was noted to have no actual combat experience in the real world and as a result of this often fell into traps when faced with opponents that make use of unconventional tactics. This shows that while she has the basics locked down she was lacking in the ability to read people’s moves and intentions which like in all board games is of great importance. As the series goes on this weakness of her’s gradually vanishes. While still tenacious and unwilling to give up Ai Yashajin gradually gets better at both reading the board and of people greatly improving her chances of victory. While Ai Yashajin as the series goes on generally retains her arrogant nature it can be seen that this attitude of her’s gradually softens as she learns to enjoy playing shogi with others and learn that shogi is not just about playing to win against her opponents but also to make connections with like-minded people while enjoying testing your strength against theirs. While Ai Yashajin and Yaichi did not have the best of first encounters and indeed she at first looked down on him at first this gradually changed as the series went as she was able to see the great effort and attentive care that Yaichi put in to help her understand the knowledge that she would need if she wanted to enter the shogi world and make a name for herself. As a result of this Ai Yashajin’s attitude towards Yaichi gradually changed and she soon learned to both respect his skills at shogi as well as the fact that he treated her like a normal person and did not let her status stop him from treating her bluntly if she did not get anything that was taught. The character of Ai Yashajin I felt was an interesting character as in addition to being polar opposites to Ai Hinatsuru in terms of shogi tactics Ai Yashajin was also every bit the opposite in terms of personality. The gradual thawing of Ai Yashajin’s personality from a withdrawn Tsundere that only played shogi to remember to one that had found that playing shogi in the real world while more punishing was actually more fun and challenging I felt was something that was well done and made great use of one of the series main themes which was that only by playing together would one be able to improve their skills while enjoying the game. I felt that her seiyuu Ayane Sakura really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ai Yashajin.KeikaKeika Kiyotaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of 3 Gatsu no lion and Anohana fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is both Yaichi’s fellow shogi disciple and the daughter of his master. A young woman in her mid-twenties Keika is a kind, caring and thoughtful person that’s also considerate and understanding of others. In this, it can be seen that Keika fits the very image of a big sister within the shogi family that Yaichi, Ai and Ginko belong too. Unlike Yaichi and Ginko Keika is not a title holder and indeed not a pro player as well and is instead she like Ai is a shogi trainee that hopes to be able to pass the training course and become a pro player.As the series goes on and as Keika’s personality is gradually revealed to us it can be seen that Keika has her fair share of problems that are worrying her that she tries to hide from her fellow shogi family members. While positive and relaxed on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Keika struggles greatly with the fact that despite the shogi skills that she had inherited from her father as well as through practice with Yachi and Ginko she hasn’t been able to make much headway with her dream of becoming a pro player while her fellow family members Yaichi and Ginko had gradually overtaken her and achieved fame within the world of shogi something that she punishes herself for. As a result of this, it can be seen that Keika is rather desperate to achieve her dream as unlike Yaichi and Ginko Keika also has to contend with the duo pressure of reaching the age limit and being dismissed from the training class due to defeats. As the series goes on Keika’s fortune and luck eventually changes and makes her realise that while having the pride of being from a famous shogi family was a good thing letting that constrain you and force you to punish yourself was not and that one should be able to walk the path that they want too without forgetting their roots. The character of Keika I felt was an interesting one as despite being happy and positive beneath the surface Keika is, in fact, someone that wrestles with a lot of struggles that are unique to her. This contrast in her outer and inner self I felt was especially well done as it allowed us to see the struggles that older shogi players may feel as they struggle to break into the pro players league while having to battle not just opponents that are not just younger than they are but also more skilled that they are.IkaIka Sainokami voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Tomatsu of Sword Art online and Asura crying fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow female pro shogi player to Ginko. A young teenage girl Ika is an arrogant, self-confident and menacing opponent that has the traits of a classic egotist. True to this personality type Ika is someone that cares little about either her opponent or manners and indeed seems to live only to crush her opponents relentlessly and use this to gain even more power and improve her skills. As a result of this, it can be seen that Ika is someone that hates weak opponents and would slander those that she considers weak as she see’s them as someone that’s not worth her time at all. As the series progresses it can be seen that Ika’s view of Yaichi is an unusual one in that she views him as more like an object than a person one that she only wants to herself and one whose only purpose was to play shogi with her to her heart's content. The character of Ika while introduced rather late in the series I felt was an interesting character as more than ever she represented a strong and fearsome opponent to both Ai and Yaichi in more ways than one that they had to overcome if they wanted to progress in their journey.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the series did a very job at showing the main setting of the series which was the city of Osaka and the various locales that the city had. The character designs for the series I felt were also well done and were faithful to their light novel counterparts to which I'm thankful. The animation for the moves that the characters make during the matches as well as the animation for the matches themselves was something that I felt was well done and it made it easier to see the significance of each move as well as how it impacted on the match as well.  In terms of voice acting overall, I felt that the main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I feel that Rina Hidaka, Ayane Sakura, and Hisako Kanemoto deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In terms of music, I thought that the series OST did a great job at conveying the various feelings and emotions that lay behind each scene and helped greatly in allowing us to see the types of feelings that the characters were going through at that time.Overall conclusionIn overall Ryuuou no Oshigoto was a really fun but also a really interesting anime that I really enjoyed watching this season and is arguably one of this season best anime’s. The series main strong points I thought were the interesting premise, story, characters, animation and strong voice acting and its strong emphasis on having fun while also learning how to play shogi with Ai and her friends. Unlike most countries, a lot of countries in Asia have the belief that if one wants to achieve mastery at something one must start training at an early age. As a result of this seeing, a 9-year-old decide to show up and petition a professional to train her as their disciple is by no means unusual. A lot of people seem to have the impression that this practice is shifty, but this is far from the truth as most martial arts and not to mention board games such as shogi really do start training them from an early age. In fact, as the members of the training class has proven the age of entry is actually between 7 and 9. One of the series main themes is learning to play shogi but as with all learning methods, the disciple would have to while learning how to play also encounter others that have the same goals as them. Humans by their very nature are social creatures and if we encounter people that share our interests its natural that we would want to bond with them. When trying to learn anything its always better if you learn it with friends. While learning shogi is the main theme part of that journey involves forging friendships with your fellow players and playing with them to not only improve your skills at it but also improve theirs as well as without playing with others you will not be able to learn what your flaws are and how you can rid yourself of them to improve yourself. While doing a good job at showing the teaching the basics to both Ai and to us viewers the series also did well to use this theme to teach us that winning in shogi is not everything and that defeat too can be a learning experience and one that can be used to figure out your flaws and correct them. Above all, it stresses that the most important thing is that you are having fun challenging others and learning from that experience and in turn helping both them and you.With Shogi as the main theme, it was important that the series not only featured interesting and entertaining matches but also genuine shogi moves that are used for real. In this I felt that the series did a great job at showing this as not only are each of the matches interesting and well designed but they also featured analysis’s of not just the players moves via simple and easily followed explanations but also looks at the players mental state and the feelings that they may be feeling as well. The look at the feelings that one may be feeling as well as at the issues that may affect a shogi player I felt was a good move as no matter how calm one is they cannot ignore every feeling that they may have and these can have adverse effects on a shogi match if you are unable to maintain your calmness. One other aspect that I thought the series did well in was its showing of the various ages of people that play in the shogi world. While largely unknown outside of Japan shogi is a world that can be said to attract people from all walks of life and the ages of people that enter its world can vary substantially which is best shown in the ages of the characters that are featured in the series from the 9-year-old Ai to the 14-year-old Ginko and the 16-year-old Yaichi. To them, shogi is the world that links all of them together. Apart from teaching us how to play shogi the other main theme that series makes use off that it makes use of as its main premise is the relationship between Yaichi and Ai in the form of the master and disciple relationship. Though increasingly rare such relationships do certainly exist, and they are of a more important nature than normal relationships. The relationship between a master and a disciple can be a complex one as the master is responsible for not just training their disciple but also learn to exist with them and learn how to tease out the skills that they may have while also working to motivate them and keep them focused. As a result of this, the degree of trust that can be formed between a master and disciple can be potent and deep one that can inspire a great sense of loyalty to the two that can be used to motivate them or break them out of a jam when needed. While Ai and Yaichi had the most random of first encounters as the series progresses it can be seen that a strong bond between the two gradually forms bonds that not only serve to motivate Ai so that she will do her best to not lose and let her master down but also serve to motivate Yachi to work hard for Ai by improving his own skills so that he can continue to teach her. This feeling of both master and disciple working together to both learn shogi and improve their skills by relying on and finding strength from each other as they overcome challenges together I thought was well done and illustrated just how strong such a bond can be if both master and disciple learn to rely on each other. Overall Ryuuou no Oshigoto was an anime that I really enjoyed as while being an effective anime in its own right its focus on teaching how to play shogi also did well to give it the additional role of an educational anime and had the effect of introducing the sport of shogi to a larger audience which I feel will make it more popular and hopefully give it some new blood. As a final score, I would give Ryuuou no Oshigoto a final score of 10/10 as while enjoying learning about Shogi I also really enjoyed seeing Yachi forge bonds with the many characters that he meets along the way while having fun playing shogi. Bonds that can be as powerful as any strategy that one can use to motivate oneself when caught in a pinch."", ""The Lolicon's Work is Never Done!A story about a Shogi master (Yaichi) who begins apprenticing a young girl(Ai-chan) who is a little too fond of him. Along the way we meet a few too many other little girl characters who all seem to have some weird magnetization towards our protagonist and a couple of actual high school/adult aged characters who you'd like to imagine will be actual love interests for Yaichi over the plethora of little girls he has to choose from.The show, at its core, is about Shogi... and lolis.

At the time, I found both Joey\'s views and the Author\'s expression of his story to be particularly fascinating, not to mention how high it made in the Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi contest a year or so ago.Bottom line, I heard a lot of things about it and I was excited, and even when the first two episodes aired, I was convinced that there had to be at least something that made it popular enough...for those high conjectures to be made.Alas, here I am at episode 4 and I am now thoroughly convinced that the author has no idea what he is doing.-Half-assing plot points-Reliance on misunderstandings and coincidences to drive forward its plot-Exposition that doesn\'t really add anything to the viewing experience (for anybody)-Lack of substance (Doesn\'t follow up on promises its set in any meaningful way)-Hasn\'t shown any attempt to take advantage of the premise it has set up for itself (i.e. shogi) nor has it used its premise in a way that makes it distinct in comparison to others of its ilk-Over-dependence on (loli) fanservice as a plot deviceI must admit however before bashing on it further that the production values, animation, and art are actually very good on their own. Along with the visual metaphors the anime sometimes employs, if anything, are enough to create intrigue in the viewer and keep them coming back each week. In fact, no matter how much I think this show needs to learn before being something truly notable, I am still intrigued as to where it goes next, so it is entirely possible I am making this review prematurely and the show gets really good by the end... I highly doubt it.First of all, where Ryuuou no Oshigoto goes wrong is in its over-reliance of misunderstandings, coincidences and other cliches that are typical for romantic comedies and harem anime-In other words, this show has a lot of light novel bullshit that we are all tired of, and the only way it differentiates itself from the others of its kind is by not dwelling on it for too long by heading directly to the shogi elements on the plot.In normal circumstances, this would be okay, after all, we all have a few of our favorite shows rely on cliches a little at the start before evolving into a fully fleshed out narrative with complicated themes.That said, the shows that are able to evolve complex and relatable narratives from seemingly cliche endeavors, are the ones that were using those standard archetypes as building blocks to form their own story, instead of falling back on them whenever it doesn\'t know what to do.One of my favorite examples of this is The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and anime that nearly everyone loves by the end, yet many will call the first few episodes (cliche) average or expected of romantic comedy anime. The difference is, when rewatching those first few episodes, you really start to notice that Sakurasou was never really cliche or typical in the way it was presented- it had consistent logic and from there, the series was free to grow into an anime that consistently inspired others to move forward in life and face its struggles.The problem with Ryou no Oshigoto in this aspect is that the anime doesn\'t have consistent logic, so it can\'t properly build off of it\'s preestablished premise without falling all over itself. In the future, if it wishes to inspire people, or give some sort of deep message, then it will have to make even larger leaps in logic than it has already done.Let\'s move onto the leaps of logic themselves- the first of which would be its overuse and general misplacement of loli fanservice.Fanservice in general is a pretty device topic, however, fanservice can be used in appropriate and meaningful ways, especially when two characters have a sexual attraction towards each other. We can see this pretty clearly in fanservice-heavy shows like Monogatari and Citrus and heck, even Karakai Juzo no Takagi-san does it better than Ryuuou no Oshigoto. The Main Character (The titular ""Ryou""), isn\'t sexually interested in children as far as we know, however, the show has a way of contriving to get Ai and Ryou together. First, it was Ai walking out of the shower while the Ryou\'s Best Friend/ Sister was coming in. Ryou freaked out and tried to shut out his sister without telling her what was going on, and Ai basically is giving him jealous death threats while naked and holding him.Actually, this scene isn\'t all that bad on its own, but the way that this type of forceful fanservice is used later in the episodes is what kind of irks me, however, I do give it credit for not doing a panty shot or something. Instead, the show goes out of its way to forcibly engage the two, while simultaneously going back on all of its promises it previously established.If Ai doesn\'t win against three professionals, her parents will decide to take her home. She doesn\'t win against all three. With the characterization of Ai\'s Mother, it was almost guaranteed that nothing would change her mind, but just because the Ryou bowed his head, and the Father was kind of wishy-washy, she decided to back down on a condition- if Ryou is unable to make her a female professional, he will have to MARRY AI AND WORK FOR HER FAMILY.I don\'t even understand the purpose of doing this in the first place, however, if you take a closer look at that scene it becomes more infuriating. Not only is this sensitive family matter taking place in public, with everybody staring at them instead of taking it to closed doors, and that it is taking place in front of Ai, but it\'s also everything else. The Mother did something out of character but is so deadpan that it doesn\'t even come off as character development, which makes it wholly contradictory. The Father was okay with marrying Ai off to a sixteen-year-old but (even if it would take place a few years in the future) this just isn\'t something parents should be considering at Ai\'s age (she\'s nine). The bigger problem with the Father here is that not only is he used for exposition dump (which technically makes him the surrogate audience character), but that he doesn\'t find this scenario wrong in any way, not even after all of the arguing, he did with the Mother up to this point. This is bad because having him be the surrogate audience character in the scenes leading up to the revelation, makes his stance all the more convincing from a structural standpoint- as I previously explained how this scene is already incompetent, it is a blatant attempt at getting us to agree with something we should have our own opinions on. It doesn\'t end there, however, because the crowd that forms there at the dojo also doesn\'t see anything wrong with it and is more or less cheerful the entire time.Also Ai\'s Mother asks him if he has siblings, and the Ryou answers ""yes"" to a younger sibling, which you would think would be used by the Mother in an attempt to marry Ai off to the alluded younger sibling, instead of the Main Character (Why else would she ask at that moment?), but it doesn\'t come up again and it remains insignificant I guess. If I had to predict why the author put in that question, it was to allude to the younger brother and I guess he\'ll come in and have feelings for Ai or something and stick around, but that\'s just speculation.Then we get to Episode 4, assumedly the first episode in the second light novel, and I see that this problem is actually getting worse. Episode 4 gives the Ryou another apprentice named Ai (we\'ll call her Ai Prime) and decides to make Ryou even more stupid. He proposes to another nine-year-old (and the author tries to pass it off as a joke by putting him making him say it in a seemingly contrived scenario, even though it was another case where even a nine-year-old would know the proper response), Ai gets jealous (why?), and he hides the fact he has another disciple from both Ai and Ai Prime for no discernable reason. Earlier in the episode, Ryou was thinking about giving Ai a proper rival, and you would think that he would immediately jump to the idea that the two would be great rivals, but instead he hides it from both of them, and Ai walks in on their study session (that took place in a completely random location) by the end of the episode, and it is treated like Ryou is cheating on her by doing that. Did I mention that Ai Prime is a tsundere? It was cute at first, but with considering how the show has already failed pretty badly at building off of archetypes to add depth to characters, I predict the next episode will have both Ais fighting each/ feeling betrayed and Ryou will finally get the idea of them being rivals!There\'s also the fact that he blatantly tells Ai Prime that she is better than Ai, but I won\'t go into detail on that.Ultimately, while the experience thus far was intriguing at a surface level, when you look deeper into the crevices of the story, you realize that this show is as hollow as a plastic shogi piece. It\'s a step above the average, but Ryuuou no Oshigoto itself is nothing special.It isn\'t unsalvagable, however, I see no indication that it would salvage itself later in the future, and even when the intensity gets cranked up in the later episodes, I still have a feeling that it will still be a hollow experience, with an ending that emphasizes how important friends are or how fun shogi is or something. But that\'s just speculation.It doesn\'t excel in any area, even with the ones its supposed to draw from (i.e. shogi/ sports). March comes in like a Lion is getting a lot of traction for how it emphasizes personal/emotional development using shogi as a thematic underpinning- I can\'t say that the show uses the rules of the game to create an engaging narrative, but the game itself makes a place for itself in the thematic undercurrent of the series, and if it weren\'t there it wouldn\'t be the same show- which I cannot say the same for shogi in Ryou no Oshigoto. It really doesn\'t have many legs to stand on at this point.Well, I suppose I\'m bashing this show enough. I will update my review after watching all 12 episodes, but I think this is enough of my conjecture for now.In the end, this show tries to be smart, and every time it does, it is shackled by some other dumb thing it decides to do. (It\'s basically only here for the lolicons, that said, it doesn\'t excel in that area either.)Welp. This was 3-gatsu no Loli. If you like it, whatever, just don\'t say it\'s smart or great because it really isn\'t. for those high conjectures to be made.Alas, here I am at episode 4 and I am now thoroughly convinced that the author has no idea what he is doing.-Half-assing plot points-Reliance on misunderstandings and coincidences to drive forward its plot-Exposition that doesn\'t really add anything to the viewing experience (for anybody)-Lack of substance (Doesn\'t follow up on promises its set in any meaningful way)-Hasn\'t shown any attempt to take advantage of the premise it has set up for itself (i.e. shogi) nor has it used its premise in a way that makes it distinct in comparison to others of its ilk-Over-dependence on (loli) fanservice as a plot deviceI must admit however before bashing on it further that the production values, animation, and art are actually very good on their own. Along with the visual metaphors the anime sometimes employs, if anything, are enough to create intrigue in the viewer and keep them coming back each week. In fact, no matter how much I think this show needs to learn before being something truly notable, I am still intrigued as to where it goes next, so it is entirely possible I am making this review prematurely and the show gets really good by the end... I highly doubt it.First of all, where Ryuuou no Oshigoto goes wrong is in its over-reliance of misunderstandings, coincidences and other cliches that are typical for romantic comedies and harem anime-In other words, this show has a lot of light novel bullshit that we are all tired of, and the only way it differentiates itself from the others of its kind is by not dwelling on it for too long by heading directly to the shogi elements on the plot.In normal circumstances, this would be okay, after all, we all have a few of our favorite shows rely on cliches a little at the start before evolving into a fully fleshed out narrative with complicated themes.That said, the shows that are able to evolve complex and relatable narratives from seemingly cliche endeavors, are the ones that were using those standard archetypes as building blocks to form their own story, instead of falling back on them whenever it doesn\'t know what to do.One of my favorite examples of this is The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and anime that nearly everyone loves by the end, yet many will call the first few episodes (cliche) average or expected of romantic comedy anime. The difference is, when rewatching those first few episodes, you really start to notice that Sakurasou was never really cliche or typical in the way it was presented- it had consistent logic and from there, the series was free to grow into an anime that consistently inspired others to move forward in life and face its struggles.The problem with Ryou no Oshigoto in this aspect is that the anime doesn\'t have consistent logic, so it can\'t properly build off of it\'s preestablished premise without falling all over itself. In the future, if it wishes to inspire people, or give some sort of deep message, then it will have to make even larger leaps in logic than it has already done.Let\'s move onto the leaps of logic themselves- the first of which would be its overuse and general misplacement of loli fanservice.Fanservice in general is a pretty device topic, however, fanservice can be used in appropriate and meaningful ways, especially when two characters have a sexual attraction towards each other. We can see this pretty clearly in fanservice-heavy shows like Monogatari and Citrus and heck, even Karakai Juzo no Takagi-san does it better than Ryuuou no Oshigoto. The Main Character (The titular ""Ryou""), isn\'t sexually interested in children as far as we know, however, the show has a way of contriving to get Ai and Ryou together. First, it was Ai walking out of the shower while the Ryou\'s Best Friend/ Sister was coming in. Ryou freaked out and tried to shut out his sister without telling her what was going on, and Ai basically is giving him jealous death threats while naked and holding him.Actually, this scene isn\'t all that bad on its own, but the way that this type of forceful fanservice is used later in the episodes is what kind of irks me, however, I do give it credit for not doing a panty shot or something. Instead, the show goes out of its way to forcibly engage the two, while simultaneously going back on all of its promises it previously established.If Ai doesn\'t win against three professionals, her parents will decide to take her home. She doesn\'t win against all three. With the characterization of Ai\'s Mother, it was almost guaranteed that nothing would change her mind, but just because the Ryou bowed his head, and the Father was kind of wishy-washy, she decided to back down on a condition- if Ryou is unable to make her a female professional, he will have to MARRY AI AND WORK FOR HER FAMILY.I don\'t even understand the purpose of doing this in the first place, however, if you take a closer look at that scene it becomes more infuriating. Not only is this sensitive family matter taking place in public, with everybody staring at them instead of taking it to closed doors, and that it is taking place in front of Ai, but it\'s also everything else. The Mother did something out of character but is so deadpan that it doesn\'t even come off as character development, which makes it wholly contradictory. The Father was okay with marrying Ai off to a sixteen-year-old but (even if it would take place a few years in the future) this just isn\'t something parents should be considering at Ai\'s age (she\'s nine). The bigger problem with the Father here is that not only is he used for exposition dump (which technically makes him the surrogate audience character), but that he doesn\'t find this scenario wrong in any way, not even after all of the arguing, he did with the Mother up to this point. This is bad because having him be the surrogate audience character in the scenes leading up to the revelation, makes his stance all the more convincing from a structural standpoint- as I previously explained how this scene is already incompetent, it is a blatant attempt at getting us to agree with something we should have our own opinions on. It doesn\'t end there, however, because the crowd that forms there at the dojo also doesn\'t see anything wrong with it and is more or less cheerful the entire time.Also Ai\'s Mother asks him if he has siblings, and the Ryou answers ""yes"" to a younger sibling, which you would think would be used by the Mother in an attempt to marry Ai off to the alluded younger sibling, instead of the Main Character (Why else would she ask at that moment?), but it doesn\'t come up again and it remains insignificant I guess. If I had to predict why the author put in that question, it was to allude to the younger brother and I guess he\'ll come in and have feelings for Ai or something and stick around, but that\'s just speculation.Then we get to Episode 4, assumedly the first episode in the second light novel, and I see that this problem is actually getting worse. Episode 4 gives the Ryou another apprentice named Ai (we\'ll call her Ai Prime) and decides to make Ryou even more stupid. He proposes to another nine-year-old (and the author tries to pass it off as a joke by putting him making him say it in a seemingly contrived scenario, even though it was another case where even a nine-year-old would know the proper response), Ai gets jealous (why?), and he hides the fact he has another disciple from both Ai and Ai Prime for no discernable reason.

Did I mention that Ai Prime is a tsundere? It was cute at first, but with considering how the show has already failed pretty badly at building off of archetypes to add depth to characters, I predict the next episode will have both Ais fighting each/ feeling betrayed and Ryou will finally get the idea of them being rivals!There\'s also the fact that he blatantly tells Ai Prime that she is better than Ai, but I won\'t go into detail on that.Ultimately, while the experience thus far was intriguing at a surface level, when you look deeper into the crevices of the story, you realize that this show is as hollow as a plastic shogi piece.

If you like it, whatever, just don\'t say it\'s smart or great because it really isn\'t.', 'Ryuuou no Oshigoto is a controversial anime. One one hand it can be accused of being a lolicon bait and a harem (not that I mind either of those). On the other, shogi games are well made and can get really exciting.First question that comes to mind: do you need to know shogi rules to enjoy it? Not really. I assume a person with deeper understanding of game could find something more in this anime, but as someone who barely knows basics of shogi, I didn\'t feel too limited by it. Show mentions many moves and strategies, but parts important to follow the story are...explained well enough.Ryuuou no Oshigoto\'s story is mostly focused on characters, their interactions and development. While shogi is used as a background and a driving force for them, I believe liking the characters is required to enjoy this anime. And this might be hard for some, considering how varied is cast - we have an abusive tsundere, a loli himedere with tsundere tendencies, a loli with yandere tendencies, onee-san character, full psycho yandere... aaand some more lolis.Oh, and most of them are interested in protagonist. Now, don\'t get me wrong. I\'m a fan of harems, and while Ryuuou no Oshigoto doesn\'t put too much focus on this aspect, I sure enjoyed it.Reading that you probably expect Yaichi to be typical harem MC. That\'s not the case. He sure is clueless, but other than that I\'d say his actions are reasonable and don\'t make you want to strangle him. He makes mistakes that are understandable and fitting from story perspective.Outside of nice Slice of Life atmosphere we also get shogi games. I have to admit, those are really well made. Thanks to good introductions, great music, effects and monologues, seemingly slow and ""boring"" games turn into something very exciting and emotional. Even though in most cases one can predict the outcome, they still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.While art in Ryuuou no Oshigoto isn\'t anything special in general, I have to mention characters design here. They are pretty. This anime doesn\'t really go into full fanservice mode - instead the service is done by more tame (in broad meaning...) interactions that shine thanks to characters designs being well used. Example of what I mean here would be Ginko\'s lips, stockings or occasional midriff. Good stuff.I\'m not sure if I managed to rely it properly in indirect way, so I\'ll write it directly as a summary: it\'s a light and enjoyable anime, don\'t take it too seriously and just enjoy it. I might forget it in few months or maybe even weeks, but I absolutely don\'t regret watching this series. I believe this title was meant to be a pleasant time killer and it fulfills this tole perfectly. explained well enough.Ryuuou no Oshigoto\'s story is mostly focused on characters, their interactions and development.

There comes a time in ones life where fast-paced activities and hobbies either aren\'t as viable or aren\'t as gratifying as ones that require thought and concentration. ""Ah, shogi!"" I thought after spotting Ryuuou no Oshigoto while scrolling through a list of currently-airing anime series. ""I\'ve always wanted to learn how to play! Maybe I should give this show a chance.""After a single episode, it became apparent that I had made a very, VERY grave mistake. This wasn\'t a shogi show at all... it was a loli show.My therapist had warned me...that a relapse into my loli addiction would be possible with even the slightest exposure to lolicon material.  And with that would come the guilt, the anger, the night terrors, the sleep-screaming... all of it would come rushing back to haunt me.And it did...I work in an office now, and I have a close relationship with my boss.

That is to me, how everything should be enjoyed.Thank you very much....Somehow MAL prevents me from posting short reviews? Why am I being taught on how to write reviews? This is my reviewing style.

Rushed adaptation...<LONG REVIEW>I heard about this series through it\'s winning in the Kono Light Novel Ga Sugoi Contest 2 years in a row, beating series like Snafu and Sword Art Online. It was shocking to see a light novel about shogi with lolis can beat series like SAO in a popularity contest, so I waited for the anime to see how this series handles its loli characters and also the Shogi element.After finishing the series, I have to say that it\'s quite disappointing, but I still had fun watching it. There are two things that this series fails at, it\'s adaptation and it\'s art. Now let me start with the adaptation part. I only gathered this information based on comments from fans of the LN. Apparently this is a failed attempt at adapting the LN, which I can agree. As an anime only, I can also see a lot of important events being rushed. A lot of the contest were quickly glanced through just to go to the final match. There is seriously a lack of explanation at scenes throughout the series especially near the end. Secondly, the art for Ryuuoh isn\'t that good. It isn\'t as bad as Marchen Madchen next door, but compared to a lot of series running this season, the only anime I can find on par with Ryuuoh in terms of art is Mitsuboshi Colors, which is also pretty weak at the art department. The only thing I like about Ryuuoh\'s art is how the characters\' eyes were drawn, especially when the characters are being serious while playing shogi, their eyes are beautifully drawn.  There are also so points within the series where the characters just look badly drawn. Well, coming from Project No 9, it isn\'t really surprising just by looking at their previous works.Now moving on to the good part. First its the characters. I like each character in this series. It really isn\'t because they are well fleshed out or anything, it\'s just I like how the characterization for this series is done. Among all the characters, my favorite one is definitely Yashajin Ai. I just love her design very much. Development wise, there are some minor development for each character but nothing grand, some examples being characters getting better at shogi, overcoming their fears, having confidence in themselves again etc.The details on Shogi is also very apparent in this series. If you know at least the basics of shogi, you can really learn from each of the contest in this series. They really did explain each step well. However, if you aren\'t familiar with Shogi, then you won\'t understand anything during the match. Personally I am in the latter part, but I still enjoy watching the matches, maybe because I also play chess and I know the feeling of not wanting to lose easily.So overall, I enjoyed watching Ryuuou no Oshigoto, but is it a must watch from this season? No. I will recommend you checking out the LN if you really like this series. I would only recommend the TV anime if you want your daily dose of loli cuteness. Otherwise, just skip this series or just go read the LN. <LONG REVIEW>I heard about this series through it\'s winning in the Kono Light Novel Ga Sugoi Contest 2 years in a row, beating series like Snafu and Sword Art Online.

Never before have I wanted an underage girl to win a chess game! Each character seemed to have drive and passion, with valid reasons for doing so. Sadly, I can\'t go more in depth but trust me when I say the characters are one of the best things about the anime!Secondly, the ""action"" in the show is surprising. The sheer tension I got when they were playing chess was left me perplexed to why this...anime made me feel more tension than the fights in Demon Slayer. The fact the writers and animators were able to do this, along with the voice actors, is a testament to the validity of this anime! anime made me feel more tension than the fights in Demon Slayer. The fact the writers and animators were able to do this, along with the voice actors, is a testament to the validity of this anime!', ""Ryuuou no Oshigoto! or also known as The Ryuuou's Work is Never Done! or even more commonly know as straight up loli shogi. If you check the studio's past works, you'll notice that they have done two other loli-based series, one that is pretty well known, Ro-Kyu-Bu! (Loli Basketball). This with how it sounds from a general description gives off the vibe off just being another loli-centric series with shogi as a tool to just further the loli-pandering. But boy was I wrong. This show does have a focus on lolis, but also on shogi and although they do not go in-depth and explain how...the game works, it can still be very exciting to watch. They showcase the many different matches of our characters, ranging from a JS all the way to our Christmas Cakes with each of them playing at a higher level than the average player as they're not only trying to compete to become a professional, but against other pros too.This show does take advantage of it's use of lolis to put in whatever quips it can to make our protagonist out to be a lolicon, but it does have other jokes available as well, so you won't be tired of seeing them outing him out as one. They have different jokes for the cast they have, with Ayumu, it would be chuuni stuff, with Ginko, it would be just her icy demeanor as she tries being a 'tsundere' and so on. You would see more different characters as you watch and most add something to it for their time there.Now back to it being exciting to watch. They put some superhuman like abilities into use for some of these, as well as having the intensity of the matches being able to keep you at the edge of your seats. They do add some visuals to add onto this which can make it look ridiculous as to what it is going on, although some may be overboard. Personally I found this to be more fun to watch. I had also decided to pick up on shogi and learn the rules a bit which makes the show even more enjoyable with the added knowledge of knowing what the characters were doing, although it is not necessary in my opinion as some of these matches can go by so quick that you wouldn't be given enough time to see it happen but just have the general idea.The music is pretty fun, I did like the oriental bits they played during the matches, but can't really say to much about it. And I would have to say the story is not it's strong suit as there is not much to tell other than they are learning shogi and trying to better themselves while facing their opponents. The appeal is from the characters and the matches which is to be expected with these kinds of shows.All in all, it is something that can be very fun to watch if you are looking for a sports/game show without being too familiar with it. It does tend to glaze over some matches, but definitely puts focus on the major ones which is what really makes them more appealing to watch. The fact that this show gave me the final push to go and start playing shogi because of how much fun I was having watching them play is the reason why I decided to give this at least a 9. the game works, it can still be very exciting to watch.

They put some superhuman like abilities into use for some of these, as well as having the intensity of the matches being able to keep you at the edge of your seats. They do add some visuals to add onto this which can make it look ridiculous as to what it is going on, although some may be overboard. Personally I found this to be more fun to watch. I had also decided to pick up on shogi and learn the rules a bit which makes the show even more enjoyable with the added knowledge of knowing what the characters were doing, although it is not necessary in my opinion as some of these matches can go by so quick that you wouldn't be given enough time to see it happen but just have the general idea.The music is pretty fun, I did like the oriental bits they played during the matches, but can't really say to much about it. And I would have to say the story is not it's strong suit as there is not much to tell other than they are learning shogi and trying to better themselves while facing their opponents. The appeal is from the characters and the matches which is to be expected with these kinds of shows.All in all, it is something that can be very fun to watch if you are looking for a sports/game show without being too familiar with it. It does tend to glaze over some matches, but definitely puts focus on the major ones which is what really makes them more appealing to watch. The fact that this show gave me the final push to go and start playing shogi because of how much fun I was having watching them play is the reason why I decided to give this at least a 9."", ""I feel like i shouldn't need to explain it but Shogi is not this intense or interesting !I've seen two old people playing Shogi before and it's one of the most boring things i'v ever scene. It's more boring then being in a Hospital room by yourself without anything to entertain yourself with while you wait for the Doctor. Hell, I've even played Shogi once and i was bored to tear.While i didn't really enjoy myself when they were actually playing Shogi ( That's a pretty big negative for a show based around it) I did find myself liking the world and the characters...involved with it.At first the characters aren't really that interesting. But then i found myself enjoying the characters like Sis and the Bodyguard chick.Honestly any and all of the Loli's in this are adorable.Ai and Char Char ( I think it's her name ) Are awesome and fun to have on screen.I do have some scenes where it's trying to make it seem like Ai's match is really important but it's really not. Especially when we have a second plot of one of the older girls trying to become a professional player that is much more interesting.The main Antagonist is also kind of nice but i feel they messed up his execution.For a Show about Shogi he's actually not bad. All throughout we hadn't heard him say a single word tell the episode and i'd say that was a mistake. I think it have been better if he never said a single word.Along with never showing his face. Normally we'd only see the back of his head or rarely just his mouth. I feel that if they kept him as a more mysterious Antagonist it would've been more enjoyable. Give him some secrecy and keep us more interested however much more.He's not the greatest Antagonist but he's actually pretty good for a show just about Shogi.I wish this show just had a girl Protagonist. Imagine how much more interesting this would be if the story was from Ai. A girl about the age of 10 or 11 going through a world completely unknown to her while also having to deal with people not taking her seriously and her having to prove herself by her own skill alone.Also i just don't like the MC that much and i like Yuri a shit ton more then this. But hey that's just me.The group of loli's in this i obviously like. But i honestly think i would've enjoyed the show a lot more if it was just about the girls. I like imaging the Loli's become friends and imaging the the two Ai's have a close relationship together as they go through High School. One being more rude while the other one being the nice and kind one. Hell, I honestly think they would be a good couple together ( When they're adults and not Loli's. I'm not weird) I would love for this to be a spin of series tbhFinally i just find something sad about these girls being obsessed with Shogi. Like the two Ai's alone have tremendous skill with one of the Ai's having a brain like a computer. But all that potential is gonna be used on a boring board game of Shogi.Overall i surprisingly enjoyed myself more then i thought i would with this being a show about something i don't really care for. involved with it.At first the characters aren't really that interesting.

Ok, so let\'s get back to business,...we have a guy who is a high ranking shogi player who all of the sudden finds himself having a padawan in a form of a little girl named Ai Hinatsuru, after making such promise from a game, where it doesn\'t seems to require a lotta effort to play and yet his overacting that he is in such exhaustion that he become this soooo stupidly desperate for water form a loli like Ai was just toooooooooo annoying.  Also him ( Yaichi Kuzuyuu) being this too obsess of losing from an old timer like  Meijin is something that I would like to see the who ever is this anime/novel/manga\'s creator Shiratori get beating up.

Also him having a loli romance with Ai Hinatsuru and having an affair with another Ai as in Ai Yashajin simply make him a womanizer of sort, that the creator himself was trying to make it look innocent as he jumble from his loli harem padawns to the two Milfs like Keiko and Tamayo , let\'s not forget his one time fling with Ika.Ai Hinatsuru- For me she is this brat who need some spanking, cu\'z how the hell can a 9 year old can have the thinking of an 18 year old, again she is another ill fitted part in a motor.Ginko Sora- She would have been fine to be Yaichi\'s girlfriend, but being this 14 year old and being another Jedi master of shogi in such young age and  being as aloof and frank as a 20 year old makes her a waste of opportunity for the guy Yaichi to be his wife. I really feel bad for her.Ai Yashajin- To me that girl can surly use some major attitude adjustment.Let\'s face them characters where just a bunch of ill fitted parts and that\'s that.Good 7, enjoyment:Nevertheless, this anime was still enjoyable to such extent, but the comedic aspect is lost in the last 2 episodes when the relationship between Ai and Yaichi becomes closer than just padawn and master, so..........Good 7, Overall:In the end this has more to do with the guy\'s relationship with a young girl and though it was good, the title and the genre weren\'t up to standards as to what the anime was suppose to be.... so, season 2?

Ahem, back to the review, contains minor spoilers.So the anime starts off with the Mc in a intense “Ryuo” match(this is basicully a tournament to earn the title of “Ryuo” which is a prestigous title in the shogi world) there he meets a yumm- I mean cute loli called “Hinatsuru, Ai”. Major spoiler he wins the “Ryuo” match, nah jk it is called “The Ryuo’s work is never done for a reason”. After winning and becomming the youngest Ryuo...ever at the age of 16. After a quick transition the Mc enters the his apartment and behold the loli is there asking to be his diciple. He accepts and finds out that she is a prodigy at shogi and then is it basicully a slice of life where they play intense matches of shogi which some are official matches. Then more lolis get introduced and the plot thickens(Insert lenny face) He also aquires the title of “Loli king” later on so expect some big things from him later on :)Lets discuss the important characthers: First is “Ai” his loli yandere diciple, she is a prodigy and Mc sees a lot of talent in her. Then is “Ginka” who he calls sis when they are not realated but because they trained under the same master. She is basicully the cold type of person and is in love with the Mc but is the type to abuse him, she is also quite good at shogi. She is also the one the bestowed the amazing title of “Loli king” onto the Mc. Next is the hot mature “Keika” she is 25 and she wants to become a female proffesional however she is not good enough as she keeps losing in the training group and her time is running out as once she is 27 she can’t goto the training group.Characters are pretty cute and I liked the art style and comedic at times, just an anime I say to pass the time, wouldn’t really call it a master piece of anything. Yes this anime is about shogi, most of the time I had no idea what was going on when they were playing shogi but still pretty enjoyable as they made the matches quite itense.Now onwards men!

""Truth be told Sangatsu is one of my favorite anime series I love the realistic drama, deep characters, interesting story progression I love everything about it. This anime didn\'t seem to have that kind of vibe so I really underestimated it. But here comes the weird part:IT DOES NOT HAVE THOSE THINGS BUT IT STILL MADE ME LOVE IT !I don\'t even know why !First episode was like ""Okay I got a good chuckle but whats with the huge...loli baits""Second episode was like ""Oh that was funny, I guess it\'s not bad after all""And before I knew it I was waiting for the next episode to come out with excitement.

Its a fucking mystery I tell you. I guess it\'s also about who is watching it.Great comedy (comedy is subjective so it might differ from the reader\'s tastes),light hearted episodes but also some real drama and real shogi battles going on, it\'s not totally a lolicon anime (... who am I kidding but atleast it\'s not creepy with it.. only sometimes), top quality waifus (Sora Ginko top waifu, I will yu-gi-oh battle anyone who claims otherwise.

Other than that it is just another slice of life. What helps to make it enjoyable is the cute character designs and interesting tidbits about the game. However, if you do not like ""certain characters"" their quirks while playing can get annoying over time.The art is nice and the music...is apt for some of its comical scenes, the characters are actually pretty interesting as there are no unlikeable characters maybe except for a few eccentric ones. However, some of the side characters are just absolutely lovable as they are the additional comic relief. The pacing for this anime is rather slow, as it should be, given its genre type and the angle of its narrative.Lastly, the depth of this anime is closely tied to the drama as they both starting picking up closer to the end. Throughout the anime it focuses on the theme \'shogi\' and as the title suggests it will mostly revolve around the MC and his title. Yet when the time finally comes where his skills are to be tested how will he fare? Put yourself into the shoes of a professional, you will most likely arrive with many takeaways. This is probably where the value of watching this series in particular lie.Overall, the anime is pretty good the comedic scenes are actually funny especially the ones with the recording staff. A good distraction if you\'re getting bored with the mainstream stuff. is apt for some of its comical scenes, the characters are actually pretty interesting as there are no unlikeable characters maybe except for a few eccentric ones.

A good distraction if you\'re getting bored with the mainstream stuff.', ""I would first like to state this review contains some spoilers as I needed to discuss the final arc and certain scenes with characters.Story: 5The story is certainly not the strong point of this series. It follows a young shogi prodigy and his daily antics of being a professional shogi player and a Loli harem king.While some arcs are seemingly pointless some are rather good. For example, Keika attempting to be a professional player after so many years of trying. And the final Ryuo match where Yaichi overcomes his slump after turning away his friends. Both were rather heartwarming but still had their respective faults.However,...as we neared the end of the story it felt fairly rushed. Firstly, cutting off a potential arc of Sora and Yaichi making up after their argument prior to the Ryuuou match. And even more so in summing up his final 3 matches in a single sentence and leaving it at that. Right after the excitement of his win, I felt it was a slap in the face to be told that he simply won all the rest of his matches in one sentence. It doesn't make any sense and is very anti-climacticAnimation: 7The animation is quite nice. Always smooth and pleasant to look at. This section was well done. There isn't too much else to be said.Sound: 7After about four episodes I had downloaded the OP to my phone. I think it's great and matches the upbeat opening very well. The ED was also quite enjoyable.Sound during the anime was good. No glaring issues but nothing special either.Characters: 4Other than a couple main characters and some sides I feel like many were introduced simply for fan service. However, as a comedy, some of their moments were fairly funny (for ex. the announcer girl) and enjoyable.The show had many of the classic character archetypes we have all seen before but they were still made enjoyable.No characters were really all that deep aside from Keika (who still wasn't all that deep) whom we learn of her past struggles. Of the others, we don't learn too much but the arc in which Ai gains family approval is quite nice too.As per usual in anime, MC's are either dense or beta. And Yaichi follows the trend with his attitude towards Sora. The scene on the beach and his later argument in which he was never shown apologizing for were not pleasant. Character fights that involve drama can create good tension in a show but in this show, I don't feel that sort of drama was needed. But if it was going to be there, as they did, please at the very least resolve the character drama and don't just forget about it. Sora was one of the stronger and more likable characters in the show imo. How can one be so dense? And how can one not apologize for what he did? I don't know. But if they grew up so close you would think he would not just ignore her right when he is thrown countless lolis. But oh well.Enjoyment: 7I largely enjoyed this show as it was colorful, eye-catching, and fun. Cute girls playing shogi? How could I not? Even with mediocre story arcs some prevailed and made us feel a bit for the characters. While other may have made us hate them a little too (Fking apologize to Sora).But overall lolis and shogi were never going to make a masterpiece of an animation. However, what it did make is an enjoyable comedy with some drama thrown in. Was the drama really needed? Probably not. But it wasn't bad, and the ending was fairly nice and lighthearted as well. as we neared the end of the story it felt fairly rushed.

Ryuuo still has its merit.As former fans of 3gatsu lion and 81diver, this is not my first shogi anime (or manga). Though this one is more lightweight than others, but don't let the loli-invasion or first impression deceiving you. Well I don't have any problem with harem or loli or cliche romance, as long as it's offer another aspects to enjoy. Though I understand some people might feel disgusted by that, maybe they're still too pure, lol.So what is this show offer besides cliche situations we could see in first few episodes? To my surprise, Ryuuo actually pretty serious...in terms of shogi as well as it's characters. Yes, the plot is not as intense as 81diver, and the romance or daily life is not as sweet as 3gatsu lion. But we still be able to enjoy shogi worlds and the heavy competitions around it (though I'm not sure if they represent RL shogi in Japan), also learn some knowledge and few tricks in playing shogi if that's your thing.And if we talk about characters here, you won't feel bored by those at all. Because the others beside the MC or it's apprentices are not just side kicks. They have proper introduction and back story also slight development. Of course, this anime is still airing and still halfway till the end, so we can't see much of them. We absolutely can't compare this to 3gatsu lion which have almost 50 episodes so far. But Ryuuo offer interesting characters, including MC who isn't just simple lolicon but actually someone who can be good master/teacher. The Ai-chan (both of them) also interesting in their own way (I mean their personality of course :3)So far, I have good time watching this. There are few things I can learn (which is weird, coming from comedy anime), there are even some emotional scenes, though not enough to put onions in front of my eyes but still done well. As for fan services, they're not going overboard with it and still bring me smile sometimes (no, don't get wrong idea here >.<). Hopefully, they keep this quality till the end, I think this anime deserve good points and definitely worth your time. in terms of shogi as well as it's characters.

But Ryuuo offer interesting characters, including MC who isn't just simple lolicon but actually someone who can be good master/teacher. The Ai-chan (both of them) also interesting in their own way (I mean their personality of course :3)So far, I have good time watching this. There are few things I can learn (which is weird, coming from comedy anime), there are even some emotional scenes, though not enough to put onions in front of my eyes but still done well. As for fan services, they're not going overboard with it and still bring me smile sometimes (no, don't get wrong idea here >.<). Hopefully, they keep this quality till the end, I think this anime deserve good points and definitely worth your time."", ""he show is funny, lolicon, if you have watched the following recent anime:- Tenshi no 3P!

I very much enjoyed this anime and its message and the charming characters that will make u gush.Story: The story pretty much focuses on our main man Yaichi who is considered the best at this game called Shogi.  He holds the title which supports this but yet he is kind of in a slump.  That is till one day he meets a grade school girl called Ai who wants him to train her which he does.  With her help and others he is eventually is able to get out of his slump.  It really...is a story that teaches that hard work pays off.Art: The art is decent! All the characters look good as do the places they go.Sound: Sound is good.  The opening and ending song sound nice as do the characters.Character:  I loved the characters. I didn't have a problem with anyone which is nice cause in an anime you will usually find one person u can't stand.Yaichi- He was the main and he was a good guy.  Smart, talented and relatable.Ai#1-   His first disciple.  She is very talented and sweet.  A cute girl, she loves her master Yaichi.Ai#2-   Yaichis second disciple.  She is very talented as well but is a tsundere.Ginko- She is one of the best female shogi players in the series.  She was taught Shogi withYaichi.  They are really close even calling each other brother and sister.  She has acrush on Yaichi.Enjoyment, Overall:  Overall I did enjoy this anime.  I definitely recommend to people who want an anime this is cute and funny that can be serious and has a good message. is a story that teaches that hard work pays off.Art: The art is decent!

So anyway here I go.Dear Author, you suck at adapting your story, please die, and beg for forgiveness!!!I wanted it to be rated by me to 8 or 9 but the story was ACHING fast paced and those background characters doesn't even have a single backstory line/scene in the series, then the most crucial of all is the love story or relationship between Ginko and Yaichi didn't bloom enough to the point that they should at least kiss, ACHE you author!!!And now the original plot for chess in japan called shogi, shogi is not...a popular game in the whole world so creating this plot is only good for those in-you-know. This could be a great anime if they made it up to 26 episodes. So many comedies within the series but its too short!!! The most touching scene of all is the ending, even if I was unsatisfied with the anime series, they tell the whole story in summarized ending. a popular game in the whole world so creating this plot is only good for those in-you-know.

I also give it points for novelty - if there\'s anything else like this out there, I haven\'t seen it. Not that I have looked all that hard.The story is a sort of a romantic comedy, with pandering to male fantasies, between an eager nine-year-old shogi prodigy and her 16yo shogi master.The premise is set up with a more gratuitous and racy tone than the rest of the show has. The setup has an obvious culmination, so the slight switch in tone shouldn\'t be confusing. Otherwise it stays...about what it was so blatantly set up to be about.The show manages to gesture at honestly sweet innocence, which I loved. Much happens to hint how true the romance could be. On the other hand, there is fanservice throughout, the male cast is bare-bones, and the plot likes to advance by introducing yet another woman. It\'s subdued and excused enough that the two themes don\'t clash much, and there are also long serious sequences, so it\'s not an ""at least thrice per episode"" scenario.Lightheartedness carries the bulk of the show. Most of it I enjoyed, but I couldn\'t say I was in tune with the sense of humor. The match with the young gay man made me just despair, so I should let you know it doesn\'t get anywhere near that bad again.After the setup, little is shown of the pair\'s private life. For further mystery, a small wedge of ambiguity is left in the boy\'s actions. It begs the viewer to infer things from everything else, elevating said everything. That might sound like a good concept, but unfortunately it\'s actually lazy and f*cking st*pid. It saps the drama and leads to issues with the girl\'s character. She ends up being forgettable and front-loaded, actually becoming shallower as the story progresses. It\'s not that she doesn\'t get screentime. In fact, she gets almost everything you can have when boxed in so hard. The ending does leave a mark on her, but that\'s so cheap and late I won\'t count it. Her character still sort of works, because not much is required of it, but it would have been such a boon if they\'d managed to make her at least a bit memorable.By contrast, the boy starts as a bit of a trope, and gets neatly grown without being totally subverted. Ginko and Keika also get developed.I was expecting the show to play coy, but I don\'t think it ever did. There was one hotel scene that would have been clever that way, while still achieving the same purpose and more, but they have the girl blush.There is also drama, as one should expect. Tragic notes are played, with bitter echoes. Fun, somber scenes of unjust, spiteful enjoyment. The climax made me feel things. It faltered far less than I expected.The shogi setting fits well. Essentially everyone is a professional player or aspiring to be one, and their primary motive is love of the game, rather than anything of the earth. Still, I would have liked if there was more of anything that doesn\'t come right back to shogi.The audio/visuals were good enough for me, for the most part, and there were also high points. At one point the girl ends up feverish in bed due to stress, and the thought crossed my mind that they didn\'t know how to make her look worn out and depressed.To end on a positive thought, I\'ll repeat that I really liked it :D about what it was so blatantly set up to be about.The show manages to gesture at honestly sweet innocence, which I loved.

I would say that it has its moments, and that I was interested in some of the characters but I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.

It's a loli harem anime that's just barely also about the game of shogi. That bit in the first episode where his shogi rival walks in to find him on the floor with a naked 9 year old under him is a real tone-setter for the kind of show you're going to be watching. It seems very self aware in it's use of situations like this as a comedic punchline, almost like it's trying to push the limits of what it can get away with while maintaining that it's...just a parody.The shogi in this show is, from what I understand, marginally realistic. When it does become the focus, the show acts like a typical sports anime, and the two girls named Ai are like shounen rivals. But when not playing shogi the show will not hesitate to just put the protagonist in increasingly compromising situations with a multitude of little girls. It does a pretty good job mixing those comedy elements while actually paying respect to the game of shogi and even if the depictions aren't the most realistic it does sell it pretty well. I won't give it too much praise but it was entertaining enough and certainly memorable. I give it an 8/10 just a parody.The shogi in this show is, from what I understand, marginally realistic.

I feel like there\'s a trend where a Teenage boy works along side a young female in anime these days. I mean more then Usual. With Ai and Yaichi it was just another Master/Student relationship. However when it came to the backstories of the Side and Minor characters, well that\'s a different story. I was more entertained by Yashajin, Keika, and Ginko. I felt like they made the anime more enjoyable thanks to their backstories more then Ai and Yaichi.The art and animation were top notch. When it...comes to animation I feel like Project No 9. brings it with every anime they\'ve produced.The sound and music was basically nothing to get excited about. The opening was fun, and the ending was soothing. The bgm really did not exist.The characters I feel like i summed up in my ""story"" section. Again though I liked the Minor and Side characters more then Ai and Yaichi. They were far more entertaining and enjoyable.My enjoyment of this anime was like a roller coaster. Some moments got me really excited to watch, while others had me saying ""What?"" in a confused matter. I just felt like the writing was all over at points and they eventually took the easy way out at the end of the show.Overall this anime is nothing special.

The score behind intense moments of watching the game, the sounds of shogi pieces hitting the board, the endearing character designs and beautiful animation makes for intense matches rivaling some of the best sports anime in the industry. You can tell the production team was not phoning this one in...like some other anime in the genre, the passion and intensity so central in professional sports anime bleeds through and generates so much hype for the matches.Honestly, the anime could stand on its sports design alone, however the anime also features a decent amount of loli-centric fan service and harem-esque relationships.

One of them is at my radar (March comes like a lion) and a couple others. The last one I watch and was comic as heck was Tonari no Sei-kun. There were so episodes that dealt with Shogi and the stories the other character made in her mind - one is a battle between chess pieces and shogi. Go watch it.Well but what\'s Ryuuou all about? Well the only thing I learn is that anime can make a boring Shogi game into a harem-comedy-exciting and FBI knock-on-your-door kind of sports. Why I say this? Well overall...the anime never tries to teach you about shogi in any way showing some supposedly impressing moves about a game you\'ve never played in your life. Maybe for japanese who play shogi that should be interesting.In terms of other stuff not Shogi well... it\'s sucks.We get to know some underage girls who play better than professional players - there isn\'t a distinction between them all. For those who love soccer - yeah everyone can play BUT you can see when it\'s a professional player or amateur. You know there are differences between Ronaldo or Messi and most other players in the world so that came out a bit bland. I mean, maybe it\'s because I don\'t understand Shogi BUT I don\'t think that\'s it...Overall characterization is nonexistent, with probably Keika a 25 year old shogi player who must evolve to a professional player or else she must quit (don\'t know if it\'s a rule or something like that). Btw, why Shogi has a female and male rank? It\'s a mental game not physic so can\'t understand that ""real life"" situation.Yaichi is boring bland character and both Ai (the 9/10 year old girls) really love him for some reason. There is also a Ginko who is a Tsundere.Every trope of a harem is there. There isn\'t much romance because Ai (one of them) is always blocking the stuff... There are some other more mature (if you can call it that) situations where both Ginko and Keika (probably not totally serious way) try to understand what Yaichi thinks of her. Bear in mind that one is 14 and the other is 25 while Yaichi is 16/17.The animation is quite alright I have no complains there.If you are watching with some other people around you beware because a couple of episodes (I think it was the first or second) there is a situation that almost puts Eromanga Sensei to shame...

No spoilers though.This anime is kind of bizarre. It's very heavily about shogi but its also not. By that I don't mean something like 3-gatsu no Lion, where it features shogi players but has a lot of story outside of that. Rather, this sticks to being focused on shogi the entire time, with all plot events and relationships being centered around shogi. I also think it...does a pretty good job of showing the world of shogi. However, the shogi is very rarely shogi like, and that itself is a source of amusement. That generally manifests in two ways. The first is that the various shogi relationships, such as master/disciple, are treated as other more intimate relationships. For example, there is an episode that revolves around Yaichi taking on a second disciple, but its basically written with dialogue out of a soap opera about a husband cheating on his wife. It's ridiculous, and hilarious. The other way that the shogi aspects don't feel very shogi like, is that they're way more intense. 3-gatsu no Lion had some matches where things got suspenseful, but there was always a certain calmness to it. Here players are throwing down pieces so strongly lightning shoots out and it often feels straight out of a sports mange with the way faces are framed and the occasional yelling. It's a very different experience and one that doesn't really allow for as much depth, but fits the much more lighthearted tone better. It's also one where the actual shogi being played really doesn't feel like it matters at all, and rather than strategy the things that get focused on are mind games and spirit and such. It's kind of messy though, in that ability levels are all over the place. The protagonist is supposedly amazing, but he loses quite often to people that on paper are supposed to be far weaker than him. Similarly, both Ai's are supposed to be amazing, but it isn't really clear how their abilities stack up against each other, and their matches against others of varying power levels are also pretty random. Obviously there's always a certain level of uncertainty when it comes to matches and fiction would need to exaggerate that, but here its so uncertain it feels kind of inconsistent.The plot overall is pretty happy and lighthearted. There are various conflicts and issues that the cast has to push through, but through the power of friendship and willpower they're able to make it through, growing their bonds along the way. It's certainly generic in one sense, but its written pretty well and seeing all this from the perspective of shogi makes it feel pretty novel. The cast is also really amusing, so that also helps. There's a good amount of cute girls doing cute things which is fun to watch. This also serves as a good source of humor, mainly in that it keeps resulting in situations where Yaichi gets accused of being a lolicon despite trying his best to but failing at trying to go out with a woman a decade older than him. The pacing to the story is kind of strange, in that its clear that they adapted more of the novels than would comfortably fit, but it feels like for the most part they didn't do this through rushing through content, but rather by cutting out content entirely. The end result is that it feels like the pacing is good, but there's this weird feeling that things are being left out, though the cuts were made well enough that it isn't entire clear where or how. Though there were areas where that wasn't possible entirely, mainly Keika's entire character arc throughout the series and most everything involved in the final arc of the series. Hence, the ending too was rushed, but it felt like a good place to end on and left me pretty satisfied with the series.The art, art style, and character designs, were pretty simple but worked well. The animation was solid. I would like to note that there was a lot of variety in shogi board piece styles which was interesting compared to 3-gatsu no Lion which only had one type. The OP and ED were both decent enough both in terms of visuals and audio. The soundtrack was solid enough and fit surprisingly well at times. I would also like to note that there were still frames and repeating frames at the beginning and end that were pretty amusing due to the music used.

So my opinion was like a 5 at the begining, but that 11 episode... it disappointed me, even when I shouldn´t be disappointed at anything, mainly because for what I said before.What happened? [SPOILERS]Well... the episode keeps creating a problem from the previous one with the mc, a sentimental problem, this time with Eul- I mean Ginko, but this time is way more deep....I don\'t care much about how Ginko has been treated by this series so far, I know for sure that the loli fanservice will win, and I really was planning to read the original source to see if there is a little hope for her to be noticed by this mc, because I liked a lot how he says so openly his feelings for Keika... but man...Ginko enters his room to cheer him up, but this mc doesn\'t see the intention and yells at her so roughly that he suddenly noticed he said something bad, making her, obviously, cry, and of course a punch in the face well deserved to him. I have no problem with that, in fact, I though it was the highest point in the whole series, but then... the script just falls so hard!... that is already unforgivable.The very next scene is in Keika\'s house and the way she tries to comfort Ginko is saying that it was Her Fault For Wanting To See Him At That Time... ... ... ... WHAT?! Like... WHAT THE F*** And then Keika wants her to cry more quietly....... WHATT!?! And Keika keeps talking and thinking positively about the mc. NO! there is no argument in the whole universe that can defend what mc said and did, not the shogi, not the age, not the pride, not the titles, Nothing!!!But ok ok... let\'s say that mc is in that part of adolescence where we all have been, ok... But Keika, my gosh!!! a 25 yo woman!!! AND that\'s not the worst part: later on the mc not only doesn\'t feel any regret or the need to apologise to Ginko, but he is way more deep into shogi and after hearing Keika\'s words he suddenly realizes something and go after... guess who... Ai.But that\'s not the worst part yet, I understand that he feels that need to apologise to Ai, then I thought ""the rest of the episode will be a proper apology to Ginko, no? it\'s going to be! It should!!""After mc hugs Ai, a train scene happens... everyone is going to Ai\'s city to... a wedding not wedding? I didn\'t understand. BUT... Ginko is there... WHY?!?! It\'s not just that everyone was happy but Ginko was like,.,. if that encounter was a little misunderstood, and the mc too!!The episode downplayed Ginko\'s scene, just... didn\'t care about her feelings.I didn\'t want to watch the 12, but I thought maybe...... just maybe there will be a decent scene for Ginko, but no.My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day was ruinedBasically, that way of treatment to a female character\'s feelings broke my heart, not only because I lived that kind of situation in my personal life, but because nobody have to be treated like that and then follow the culprit to hear an apology.That way to create drama in the story was cool, not the best, but it was decent, but the afterwards, the way the series want to resolve these problems were... despicable, disagreeable, sad, careless, unrealistic, negligible, unpleasant, cruel, dishonest, disrespectful, dry, rude, dangerous, negative, unfriendly, silly, contemptible, frivolous, etc.in other words painful. :\'cStory 2/10 bc nothing can forgive that 11th episodeArt    9/10 Beautiful Eula...

Ultimately, the reason I dropped it is that the side characters feel more like main characters than the actual main character and I was quite worried this anime was barreling towards a flat-ground hanger of an ending. In retrospect, this doesn\'t seem as likely as I once feared, but I don\'t have the mental fortitude to re-watch the...entire thing just to see how it concludes.Nothing here is bad by any stretch of imagination, but nothing is really exceptional, either.

Nothing in the animation stands out as to be unique or hard to pull off so they spared expenses there in more ways than one I would say.The story is ok, expected but ok. You dont watch this show for it, the characters act the way they were designed to act from the start. Its hard to invest in any 1 of the many 1 dimensional characters simply beyond just: ""ah its that character, glad she didnt lose like no one thought she would.""

No this isnt ""their culture"" if it were id dare you to say that with a straight face to a local teacher there that. You won\'t be surprised by their response. Now burst that bubble and go face reality please. Kids are just that, children, nothing less and definitely nothing more. They arent grade A idiots, but they are young. Ill just leave it at that.

This show was disgusting.', ""After watching this anime, I was left scratching my head and wondering what the hell I had just watched and why I had spent my time watching it. First off, the little girls were portrayed pretty sexually, and very much like love interests to the much older main protagonist. I'm really not against putting 'little girl' characters in an anime, I'm a huge fan of Amaama to Inazuma for example. But sexualizing them like they seem to do in this anime is just in bad taste.Anyway, back to the rest of the anime. Which isn't much to be honest. Even the Shogi aspect of Ryuuou...no Oshigoto is really uninteresting. I compare it to Saki as an example, which has a similar concept but has Mahjong as its center theme. It's not a perfect anime by any means, but that anime at least had me interested in the Mahjong aspect... And that's coming from someone who doesn't understand much of anything about Mahjong. Saki was just such silly fun, that it managed to keep my attention to the over-the-top animation, the silly banter and the (at least semi-)interesting characters. But here in Ryuuou no Oshigoto there's just nothing. It's  just two people sitting across from eachother, a few clicking sounds from the pawns hitting the board, and that's it. There's barely even any good banter or animation quality during the matches. The few scenes that did seem like there was some effort was put in, felt a little more cringy and weird than anything else to be honest. To me every Shogi match seemed like watching paint dry.To top it off, the characters were not exactly adding much of anything either. There were some who managed to be at least a little interesting, like Kiyotaki Keika as one example, but that's about it. The main protagonist in particular is just one of the most boring characters to watch, and the loli's surrounding him seem to serve no purpose other than love interests and 'oh look at me being a child prodigy'.In short, I can honestly say that the sheer mediocrity of Ryuuou no Oshigoto actually manages to be quite horrible. The characters, the animation quality, the storyline, the Shogi itself... It all feels like, well, stale bread or something. Yeah it's edible, but it's almost digustingly bland. no Oshigoto is really uninteresting. I compare it to Saki as an example, which has a similar concept but has Mahjong as its center theme.

Watching this makes me remember that this anime have little bit of similarity in drawing pattern like ""Blend S"" and ""Slow Start"" which is both have a different attack of art/drawing style but also have a bit of similarity too....So for the Art i\'d say that Project 9 did their best in this anime, it\'s quite nice for me but it\'s not the best in the market right now, because for me they always draw ""Lolicon"" theme anime which is i think they\'re expert on it but they had a few anime that strays away in that category and had a good art in those other anime\'s.Story line is a downright lousy, it comes to the point the plot is only focusing on this spoiled brat namely Hinatsuru Ai which is acting like a girlfriend to this very weak minded sensei of her namely Yaichi Kuzuryuu. Talking about the male protagonist, Yaichi is a very sharp and intelligent when it comes in Shogi but outside of it, he is a guy that scared of his own pupil, and those children around him have a extremely unusual behavior which is a 9year old don\'t possess in real life and even in other animes too they\'re normal type of a kid but in this show is like watching some grown woman in a body of a kid that always acting cute in front of her crush(which is Yaichi) LOL. This show is the very definition of ""LOLI STEREOTYPE"" that\'s why Yaichi a prodigy shogi player and a professional too is a generic type of a male protagonist without whatsoever improvement in his character throughout the story, only he cares is Ai and he is slave to it. Only Kiyotaki Keika is the one i\'ve seen that have character development, she\'s a very strong woman, she had those will of fire on her even tho there\'s a mountain of struggle that she will challenged on, I will remember her, other than generic annoying sexualized lolis plus generic male protagonist, and tsundere on their cast, Kiyotaka Keika is the only one i will remember on this show, she is admirable for those people that trying their very best in their lives. Also if you watch this show to find out what is ""SHOGI"" or you wanna know the very basic of shogi this anime won\'t teach you that, comparing this show in Haikyuu or EyeShield 21 this anime is lacking in tackling their sports content and won\'t explain the very basics of it to the viewers especially to those who don\'t know shogi.Enjoyment? i\'d say i enjoy a little part of it especially Kiyotaki Keika scenes other than that is kinda disturbing and annoying in the most part of it.My advice is watch this if you\'re a person that doesn\'t bother in inadequate details in SHOGI, a tsundere that always beat the crap out of the generic male protagonist, and bunch of Lolis especially the one who act like a wife and sometimes acting like a yandere which is the part annoyed me most because Ryuuou no Oshigoto don\'t have the genre of romance on it.Overall this is a trash garbage to me but i think it will be a gold to you ... maybe.

I knew it wasn't going to be great from previews, but not this bad.as l live in a non-shogi country, I had difficulty relating to the game, and how the character could say things like...you can be my bride to a girl who looks around 4 or 5.   It also tries to push comedy badly, and I struggled in general with it, more like going through the motions so just to have material for a review you can be my bride to a girl who looks around 4 or 5.

Juushin Enbu: Hero Tales,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2772/Juushin_Enbu__Hero_Tales,"[""I must say, the concept of an anime using a wuxia context really intrigued me. But in the end, it was yes and no everything that I could expect. The very bad news is, it&rsquo;s about 90% of your typical shounen anime. Such characterizations and development is present, but it&rsquo;s already stuff you&rsquo;ve seen before in typical shounen anime. The good news is, it&rsquo;s in a completely different context and it makes those qualities feel fresher. But what I personally was expecting was a balanced mixed of the qualities of anime and wuxia. Taitou is your typical big hearted and small-brained overly righteous teenage hero...with a big appetite, and his sister is your typical damsel in distress. And the rest of the characters have their purpose but felt they were created partially to be each other&rsquo;s foil. I mean, they have their own individuality, but I feel they were created more out of a reaction from one core character to the next.But some of the character&rsquo;s individuality such as Koyo&rsquo;s and Ryuuko&rsquo;s bring that balance to the atmosphere. Ryuuko is overly serious and has this kind of mentor role, but I like how his flaws are presented in the show and how he tries to confront them. Koyo may have a care free life, but he knows what&rsquo;s at stake and is serious about getting the job done. Housei is your typical friendly rival with Taitou, but in the end, they know they must unite. I felt Keirou was quite a unique and excellent villain in his own right. I would get into him, but to give my thoughts and reasons of why he was such a great villain would have to make me reveal spoilers.Anyway, if this anime has one huge flaw, it&rsquo;s the pacing. I felt the anime could have been shorter by five to eight episodes. There are episodes where the characters are in an emo-shell like Kenshin near the end of the manga of Rurouni Kenshin and felt in this anime, it could have been done much quicker. I felt there were times they could have taken advantage of the slower moments and also get into the other characters more deeply. Also, I felt it&rsquo;s pacing also rushed and forced too many things at the end. But I&rsquo;ll confess it was still a descent ending.But I say it&rsquo;s best trait is the unpredictability. The plot twists are kind of forced as well, but I say it does make those twists much more effective.In case some of you Full Metal Alchemist fans that are watching this, you&rsquo;ll be able to recognize that the way the eyes, shapes of faces, and angles are drawn, the characters are designed by Araka Hiromu, the artist of that respective anime. Granted they will be recognizable, but I have to say with the character design, I was personally not that impressed. I felt they were too one-dimensional (such as lack of distinction between Housei and Taitou and some other characters) and lacked detail (such as little use of shadowing, lighting, and cross hatching). But I guess what makes it for this flaw are the authentic but a little flashy costume designs, and I think the anime does a great job of capturing the setting of ancient China. I felt it was geographically and architecturally well represented.Unfortunately, the anime does not have much action presented, and it&rsquo;s not really action driven. But what I liked was that it did have martial arts action that wasn&rsquo;t over the top. None of your typical Matrix bullet time or wire fu crap. The hand to hand action at some capacity feels realistic. But I felt the action was very stiff in a Japanese Karate kind of way. I&rsquo;ll get more into my reasons when I get into the overall commentaryAnd last, despite my praises for the anime of being realistic, it also has action that has typical anime qualities such as using ki manipulation. But I like how the ki manipulation called Sekihou in the anime, has an interesting foundation and concept and only the seven stars can use them. So it brought an interesting twist to the action.The music and voice acting, is definitely one of this anime&rsquo;s greatest qualities. The opening theme Winterlong sung by the Beat Crusaders, is sung in English. Granted the English isn&rsquo;t perfect, but tolerable and actually makes sense. Granted the style is not culturally appropriate to the context, but I felt it&rsquo;s energy and lyrics brought an appropriate sense of feeling to the intense and light hearted atmosphere this anime has. And High and Mighty Color who sang songs for Gundam SEED Destiny are also present for future themes in the later half and bring the same qualities that Winterlong has. Despite the theme songs not being culturally appropriate as either Japanese or Chinese, the background music however is dead on. It&rsquo;s what you are to expect in a Wuxia film or when you enter an authentic Chinese buffet restaurant.  Nothing really much to complain with music.The voice acting is also superb. Suzumura Ken&rsquo;ichi, the voice of Shinn Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny plays our main lead, Taito. Pretty much take his portrayal of Shinn and put it into a typical shounen hero, and that&rsquo;s what you get and it works pretty well. The legendary Ginga Banjou, the voice of Giren from Gundam and Souther from Hokuto no Ken plays the main villain, General Keirou. He brings that intimidating charisma to his character. But the winner to me with the seiyuu cast is Koyama Rikiya, the voice of Takamura Mamoru from Hajime no Ippo as Koyo. He brought Takamura&rsquo;s badassness to Koyo and felt like I was getting prepared for season 2 of Hajime no Ippo. So the voice acting is great.Granted this anime has all kinds of flaws, but I think a lot of its good qualities make up for them at the right circumstances and brings a minimally decent balance. Even though some people may rightfully disagree with me, but I think the problem is that despite a Chinese setting, I found this anime to be way too Japanese with its action, story telling, and characterization and development. The disagreement of course will be, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s made by Japanese people&rdquo; which I do understand, but I have felt that there have been some animes that did not take place in Japan, and yet did not have to come across as typical Japanese or shounen. In the end, my impression was that it made the typical shounen story fresh with a different kind of context and twist. I think if this anime took some qualities from Hero, Once Upon a Time in China, Monkey King, and other iconic wuxia classics, I think it could have achieved something bigger. It&rsquo;s of course not the most perfect anime in the world, but interesting enough to say it's good and worth watching. with a big appetite, and his sister is your typical damsel in distress.

The disagreement of course will be, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s made by Japanese people&rdquo; which I do understand, but I have felt that there have been some animes that did not take place in Japan, and yet did not have to come across as typical Japanese or shounen. In the end, my impression was that it made the typical shounen story fresh with a different kind of context and twist. I think if this anime took some qualities from Hero, Once Upon a Time in China, Monkey King, and other iconic wuxia classics, I think it could have achieved something bigger. It&rsquo;s of course not the most perfect anime in the world, but interesting enough to say it's good and worth watching."", ""Best Rating: 4.5/10    Worst Rating: 3/10   Average Rating: 3.7/10*note: pardon me for my language, it's just the way I roll*don't agree with what I say about this anime? that's your problem....Review: Hero TalesCould have been good, but turned out bad.

Setting a story in medieval China (or a fantasy look-alike) is as common in East Asian media as setting a Western fantasy in medieval Europe. The basic plot isn\'t any more original, following seven warriors who are each the reincarnation of various warrior deities, with two (conveniently our protagonist and antagonist) being well-known as the...most powerful while the other five pick sides. Why are they fighting? THE KARMA OF THE STARS!!! Now, the concept of fate and free will has been with humans as long we\'ve told stories, but it can also be a crutch for the author who can use it as a cheap cop-out. In this case, \'Hero Tales\' uses fate and karma as an excuse to drive the plot in the absence of developed character motivations.The story itself actually isn\'t bad, but it plays so painfully and unimaginatively close to formula that there\'s nothing to make it good either. Anything you see here you\'ve seen better elsewhere.-Art-Hiromu Arakawa created one of the most famous manga series of all time with \'Fullmetal Alchemist\'. That fame creates a bit of a problem when she tries to reuse the character designs in other works- you\'ll be playing ""Spot the FMA character"" while watching this show (and judging by \'The Heroic Legend of Arslan\' this is a recurring mistake for her). The quality and aesthetic are nothing impressive either, having decent animation but a very generic and simple palette - lots of bright, flat colors. The series doesn\'t look bad, but it doesn\'t look good either (noticing a trend here?)-Sound-When not even J. Michael Tatum can\'t make his character sound very interesting, the show most likely has a writing deficiency. English dub voice actors do fine, but the sound is still pretty generic (nobody is given much that\'s memorable to say, so there\'s little opportunity to shine or suck). The soundtrack does nothing special either, the OP and ED are very basic.-Characters-The cast wouldn\'t be unique even if their designs weren\'t copy-pasted from a stupendously better series. Taitou is the untouched archetype of a Shonen protagonist: loud, violent, not terribly bright, and a big eater. The rest stick extremely close to archetype as well: the not-related-by-blood-so-it-technically-wouldn\'t-be-consanguinity sister, the goofball best friend, the pirate with a good heart, the bad girl with a good heart, the warlord who wants to take over for kicks and giggles- it\'s all been done before. The only interesting one is the assassin Shimei, who doesn\'t care who actually wins so long as he gets to watch a good show- however, he\'s a relatively minor character. The point where I stopped watching \'Hero Tales\' for the second time came when a certain character switched sides and joined the villain- because the villain said he was fighting for peace. No explanation of how his evil deeds would actually bring peace, his just stated that was his goal and this character (who knew his evil deeds full well) simply up and joined him with hardly a moment\'s hesitation. And that\'s when I left.-Enjoyment-It was good for a while as \'turn your brain off\' fun, but with the plot taking its sweet time to get anywhere and the cast not being interesting enough to make up for it, it dropped the show. Then a few months later I took a second stab at it, nothing got better, and when the dumb plot twist I just said \'forget it\' and haven\'t bothered with Hero Tales since. I rarely drop a series because I won\'t start one unless I think there\'s a good chance I\'ll like it. I took a gamble on this one and it failed.-Overall-\'Hero Tales\' doesn\'t actually stink, but for the same reason there\'s nothing good to note either: it\'s utterly generic. You can avoid catastrophic failure by sticking to the archetype, but you\'ll never be remembered for it one way or the other (people like to crap on ""School Days"", but they\'re still talking about it long after they\'ve forgotten other more generic romantic dramas).

No matter how hard a work tries to be different, it is constantly compared to its genre-kin. Such is the fate of any work. Jyuushin Enbu: Hero Tales (HT) is a series that plays it safe, yet somehow finds a way to stick with viewers even after the last somewhat cliche scenes.Story: 8HT is a story about a simple-minded young man named Taito who is just living his life with his family, minding his own business, when Keiro, a power-hungry warlord busts down his door and demands for...the sacred sword that will make him the emperor. Taito, barely surviving his confrontation with Keiro, soon learns that the two of them have their fates tied to two celestial deities and their destines are mapped out by the Karma of the Stars. Taito knows that he can\'t face Keiro alone so he, along with his sister Laila, embark on a quest to gather the five Celestial Guardians and take down the Dubhe warmonger, Keiro, before Empire collapses under the powers of fate itself.The plot is very by-the-books shonen: one guy needs to gather whole bunch of other guys to beat the final boss. Despite that, the anime deserves more credit for what it does right. It shows the development of character strength in a realistic fashion. It throws wrenches in the heroes\' road to Keiro and the good part about that is that the good guys don\'t always win. Characters that Taito and his friends love die before their eyes. The cast discovers themselves and while some may find closure, others only find more conflict. Soon, those trapped within fate\'s plans try to break free and make their own choices. This is a show that could not have been rushed, and it is clear that time was taken to make sure that the audience could develop a feeling for the characters. Sure, you might guess that they\'d probably win later down the line, but at what cost?Action is the obvious focus of the series and the action present is quite well done. Fighting isn\'t every episode, but its in the episodes that matter. The comedy in the series is decent, nothing ground breaking. However, there are a few scenes where despair is accurately portrayed. You\'ll feel the anguish, the exhaustion and the desperation of the characters, especially during the conclusion. Its a shame that the conclusion wasn\'t wholly original, but as I said earlier, this anime plays it safe genre-wise but that\'s not always a bad thing.Art: 8Anyone who has seen FMA can notice the striking similarity to the art in HT. Its an art style that will probably pique at least a ""oh, that looks like FMA."" It was the reason why I decided to give this series a chance.The animation is solid. Character designs are pretty down to earth, at least by anime standards. What really stands out is the choice to make a very Chinese-esque setting. While colors don\'t pop off the screen, the series at least makes an effort to look different than a lot of modern shounen.Sound: 7Each one of the openings is catchy in its own way, especially the first one. The first ending left a lot to be desired but the second ending was very good. It maintains the kind of the typical friendship theme but is still a very nice track, even though there is some sub-par engrish. That part is all to opinion, however. The rest of the BGM is composed of mostly Chinese-influenced tracks that don\'t help or hurt the series. The voice acting fits each character nicely.Characters: 7There seems to be an inherit problem with a lot of shounens: too many characters, not enough development for the vast majority. Taito doesn\'t change that much and neither does Keiro, but each fufills their role perfectly. Keiro is a brutal warmonger who uses anyone and anything to achieve his ends and isn\'t afraid to kill his own men to do so. Taito, on the other hand, is a knuckle head powered by friendship. While at times he can be a fool, he knows how to bring out the best in people. He\'s an all around good guy and proceeds to at least he fufill his role. Ryuko is the rival of Taito and the two of them eventually cross paths. Along the way to fight Keiro, Ryuko learns a lot about himself and he eventually needs to work out his priorities and loyalties in life. Hosei is the clown of the group, but he too begins to see that there are more important things than making fun of Taito\'s habit of repeating himself.Sadly, that\'s about as far as the character development goes. Laila does a decent job at standing out in the little sister crowd (she\'s not in love with Taito, by the way, which is a nice bonus) and she and Rinmei have a blast with the ""Men are useless"" club, but neither of them go farther than that. All of the others character don\'t go too far with their developments either. There are a few other side characters that make a splash, but their significance is better left to be experienced rather than just explained.Overall, HT doesn\'t go far with its characters, but the subtle details do matter and the party chemistry is still entertaining none the less.Enjoyment: 9So, what makes HT so enjoyable? Is it the actions scenes, the comedy, or the friendship? My answer: Why not all three? What really makes it stand apart is actually the very thing that makes it seem so unremarkable: Its absolutely shounen. It should be a must see for anyone just getting into anime, but wants an alternative to those big series. HT is all the shounen goodness anyone could possible ask for in just 26 episodes. It might not rock the boat, but it coasts relatively smoothly. Unlike a lot shounen that try to be more, HT is comfortable with what it is and the passion really shows.

Kawaisugi Crisis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53163/Kawaisugi_Crisis,"['Cute, is the name of the work. But is this show good as anyone thinks it is? The answer may surprise you.Pet-centric works are easy to find, let alone if there is one that\'s as good as it is. But this season, there is kind of a waste of an opportunity, and it lands on the laurels of the fairly unknown work of mangaka Mitsuru Kido\'s only full-fledged series: Kawaisugi Crisis a.k.a Too Cute Crisis.To be fair, there was a pet-centric show before, in the form of mangaka Tunami Minatuki\'s Doukyonin wa Hiza, Tokidoki, Atama no Ue. a.k.a My Roommate is a Cat, which has...an anime adaptation all the way back in Winter 2019. You\'d be forgiven if you forgot that show ever existed, because that same season had hitters like sequels of Kaguya-sama and Mob Psycho 100, not to mention one of the greatest, absolute trash to ever exist: Domestic na Kanojo a.k.a Domestic Girlfriend. But back to Doukyonin, I thought that there was a pretty compelling show back then, especially with the human-cat switcheroo of a POV that added allure to the series and made it stand out in the best of ways.Enter Kawaisugi Crisis, which involves a group of aliens trying to invade Earth, but the group wants to investigate the happenings on Earth before they make their decision. And the protagonist, Liza Luna, a member of the Azatoth Empire\'s Interstellar Survey team, was chosen for the mission to determine the functionality of Earth\'s destruction phase due to its low levels of civilization. Turns out, Earth is a rather compelling planet that\'s no short of surprises, and to Liza, it comes in the form of an animal café. Specifically, a cat café, where Liza is introduced to the world of cats. The feline creature that can be taken in as a pet, their levels of \'cuteness\' overload, sets Liza\'s alien circuits popping and thereby, sets a long investigation on Earth about them...to eventually own one herself in the form of the American Curl Yozora, and get tenuous amounts of enjoyment out of it, sharing that cats are superior when it comes to the ultimate pet.Through this stage, Liza can\'t really work alone, so she has the help of the cat café Nyanday\'s workers, waitress Kasumi Yanagi and clerk Seiji Mukai to better understand the feline creature\'s cuteness and attraction points. Even as more characters like Liza\'s fellow Survey Team researchers, Garmie Lou and Luster Cole come in to assist her, as well as other affiliated humans like the Azuma family\'s daughter Sasara and grandfather Mitsuhiko who owns pets but not the regular affair of cats and dogs, the one thing that the anime has going for it, is the cuteness portion. Essentially, this IS the tag for both the show and the original source material, but remove that, and it has nothing else in store to show. So, the decision is yours: Are you going to want to experience a show where simplicity is golden or a complex story where there is something that is bound to happen. To me, the jokes get repetitive quite fast, because the main character harps over the same qualities over and over again, but at the same time, she impresses me with her simpleton character to accept that all cute things on Earth are adored to the highest degree, even to the point of convincing her alien colleagues that being ""cutesy"" is a trait of the Earth when it comes to pets. And that\'s her conviction that she will never trade for when it comes to the deciding factor for Earth\'s demise, ensuring that the blue planet is a place where harm comes at a good price: relatable, cuteness overload, triggering the Crisis of being Too Cute.For such a low-key work like this, there is no need to do great animation; just present it in a way that doesn\'t feel subpar. And that\'s what studio SynergySP did with its in-house director, Jun Hatori, who did a decent job in the adaptation. The music is so-so as well, with Chogakusei\'s OP and DIALOGUE+\'s ED (which, for the girl group, to be frank, is just alright) which is just on the level of acceptability.This brings me back to the question that was raised in the review\'s opener: ""Cute, is the name of the work, but is this show as good as it can be?"" Honestly, it depends on the person\'s intention. If you like cute stuff with a simple story and plot to boot, then the anime is a no-brainer for you and is worth watching. Otherwise, try Doukyonin instead, that\'s an overall better human-pet story that delivers better than this show. an anime adaptation all the way back in Winter 2019. You\'d be forgiven if you forgot that show ever existed, because that same season had hitters like sequels of Kaguya-sama and Mob Psycho 100, not to mention one of the greatest, absolute trash to ever exist: Domestic na Kanojo a.k.a Domestic Girlfriend. But back to Doukyonin, I thought that there was a pretty compelling show back then, especially with the human-cat switcheroo of a POV that added allure to the series and made it stand out in the best of ways.Enter Kawaisugi Crisis, which involves a group of aliens trying to invade Earth, but the group wants to investigate the happenings on Earth before they make their decision. And the protagonist, Liza Luna, a member of the Azatoth Empire\'s Interstellar Survey team, was chosen for the mission to determine the functionality of Earth\'s destruction phase due to its low levels of civilization. Turns out, Earth is a rather compelling planet that\'s no short of surprises, and to Liza, it comes in the form of an animal café. Specifically, a cat café, where Liza is introduced to the world of cats. The feline creature that can be taken in as a pet, their levels of \'cuteness\' overload, sets Liza\'s alien circuits popping and thereby, sets a long investigation on Earth about them...to eventually own one herself in the form of the American Curl Yozora, and get tenuous amounts of enjoyment out of it, sharing that cats are superior when it comes to the ultimate pet.Through this stage, Liza can\'t really work alone, so she has the help of the cat café Nyanday\'s workers, waitress Kasumi Yanagi and clerk Seiji Mukai to better understand the feline creature\'s cuteness and attraction points. Even as more characters like Liza\'s fellow Survey Team researchers, Garmie Lou and Luster Cole come in to assist her, as well as other affiliated humans like the Azuma family\'s daughter Sasara and grandfather Mitsuhiko who owns pets but not the regular affair of cats and dogs, the one thing that the anime has going for it, is the cuteness portion. Essentially, this IS the tag for both the show and the original source material, but remove that, and it has nothing else in store to show. So, the decision is yours: Are you going to want to experience a show where simplicity is golden or a complex story where there is something that is bound to happen. To me, the jokes get repetitive quite fast, because the main character harps over the same qualities over and over again, but at the same time, she impresses me with her simpleton character to accept that all cute things on Earth are adored to the highest degree, even to the point of convincing her alien colleagues that being ""cutesy"" is a trait of the Earth when it comes to pets. And that\'s her conviction that she will never trade for when it comes to the deciding factor for Earth\'s demise, ensuring that the blue planet is a place where harm comes at a good price: relatable, cuteness overload, triggering the Crisis of being Too Cute.For such a low-key work like this, there is no need to do great animation; just present it in a way that doesn\'t feel subpar. And that\'s what studio SynergySP did with its in-house director, Jun Hatori, who did a decent job in the adaptation. The music is so-so as well, with Chogakusei\'s OP and DIALOGUE+\'s ED (which, for the girl group, to be frank, is just alright) which is just on the level of acceptability.This brings me back to the question that was raised in the review\'s opener: ""Cute, is the name of the work, but is this show as good as it can be?""

No. It\'s a simple show about aliens discovering earth\'s animals and how cute they are. It doesn\'t need to be anything fancy.Most of the show\'s aspects (animation, music, characters, etc) aren\'t anything special but when it comes to showcasing cute animals, the show shines magnificently. It knows how to pluck your heart strings and make you go ""aww"" along with the characters. Pet owners will enjoy it even more thanks to the relatable scenarios the characters get into.If you want a show with a complex story and complex characters...or just don\'t like animals, this show isn\'t for you.

It takes two side characters who had a vague but important role in the main story and develops those characters into two somewhat enjoyable characters to watch.It was worth the watch after watching the whole season of Kurokami just to see how they interacted but if there was more episodes like this one i dont think i would continue to watch.

Mugen no Juunin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4151/Mugen_no_Juunin,"[""I will start by saying that, having read the manga, I was very excited when I heard that there was going to be an anime adaptation, and I had high hopes/expectations for it.  It is possible that my review will be biased in that regard.  That being said, I'll begin my review.Art:  The art was, in my opinion, not bad.  The character designs were true to the manga, I didn't notice any particularly huge problems with inappropriate scenery or just general sloppiness.  However, this anime was based on a very violent, sword-fight laden manga, but there were few fights scenes...to get overly excited about.  The fight scenes that were shown were brief and unsatisfying.  For example, if Manji is fighting someone, the beginning of the fight will be shown, then they'll either switch to another character who is watching the battle or even to someone completed unrelated to the current battle.  Then suddenly, oh! there's the end of the battle.  It was completely unsatisfying.  The gore was toned down tenfold.Sound:  This was by far the worst part of the anime.  If you like the opening theme, you'll love the sound.  But whoever sings this song, her voice just grinds the gears in my head.  And you'll hear her pipe up at the most random and inappropriate times.  Sad?  You'll hear her.  Happy?  Sounds the same as sad.Character:  Overall character development, I'd say was average.  Despite reading the manga, I didn't leave this show feeling super connected to any of the characters.  There was room for improvement, but it really could have been worse too.  I noticed a couple moments that were glaringly out of character from the manga, but I tried to give some leeway.Enjoyment:  It was slow.  There were times when I could have easily fast-forwarded several parts and not have missed any plot.  One would think that by the twelfth episode, the penultimate episode, some sense of suspense would be building, or at least some problem that could feasibly end the series and/or set up a second season.  Nooooope.  Episode twelve left me with little desire to see the last episode.  The slowness combined with the hideously poor sound and mediocre characters left me with little satisfaction at the end of this series.Overall:  If you haven't read the manga, you may enjoy this series.  It is my opinion that if you were a fan of the manga, you should avoid this entirely.  Seriously, you won't laugh at how bad it is--it'll just make you sad.  It made me sad.  So very sad. to get overly excited about.  The fight scenes that were shown were brief and unsatisfying.

The manga surpasses it in every way, and watching Blade of the Immortal will do nothing but spoil the plot.It's evident that a lot of time and effort was put into doing the manga justice.  However, the nuances and subtleties which make Samura's work so great are simply not suited for anime.  The mangaka himself was originally against animating Blade of the Immortal.  I can't imagine why...he changed his mind; it was clearly a mistake.In many ways, this anime felt like a slideshow of the manga with music thrown in at the last minute.  As can be expected when over 20 volumes are compressed into 13 episodes, the plotline was rushed, and character development was mostly left out.  I'd write more about the high points of the anime (because there are plenty), but frankly, they can all be found in the original.Though a lot of long-time BotI fans are insulted by this adaptation, personally, I enjoy it.  I plan to watch it again before I get the next volume of the manga, as a quick recap of the story.  It's nice as a summary, but in no way can it take the place of the original. he changed his mind; it was clearly a mistake.In many ways, this anime felt like a slideshow of the manga with music thrown in at the last minute.

By first glance at the title, you'd think that the show would be pretty cool, but unfortunately after 1 episode you would be immensely disappointed.Blade of the Immortal follows the story of a guy named Manji. Manji is a samurai who is known to have killed over 100 men and lived to tell the tale. To put it simply, he's immortal. In the beginning, a girl named Rin hires Manji as her bodyguard as she travels to get revenge on the people who killed her family. The overall basis of the story isn't all that bad, but everything else makes it...worse.Animation - When trying to stay positive, the animation isn't all that bad. I've seen worse.

If the first episode can't hold you, than a series has problems, and this was the case.If you have read a certain amount of my other reviews by now, you will know that I am a huge BEE TRAIN fan, but I wasn't too excited over their acquiring of a new anime of this nature.  I was expecting already from the start a bloody mesh of pointless violence and...gore.  Well being the fan that I am, I decided to go ahead and give it a try, and it was a pretty big mistake.  I've never read BOTI so I have no idea what the story is really like but I can tell this was probably one of the worst adaptions I had ever seen.As always I being with the writing, Hiroyuki Kawasaki the writer of such shows as Sakura Wars, Tsubasa Chronicle, and Captain Tylor was the screenwriter and he sucked.  Big time.  The writing in the first episode alone was all over the place and sloppily thrown together it makes even his Tsubasa fillers look like Oscar worthy screenwriting.  I was lost 90% of the time, I had no idea who anyone was and ultimately why they existed.   The loony sister Machi  running around was a nice touch but in the context it made no sense.   I had to be told as to why she acted the way she did.  There was very little time spent on character development and absolutely no exposition given and no motive for any of the characters.Equally terrible was Koichi Mashimo's direction.   Mashimo who is the one to usually take his time went into high-speed on this.  As a result the episode suffered greatly.   I've always admired Koichi Mashimo for taking time and making all the elements come together, he is at his worst when he is in hyper-speed mode.   His visuals are delpalated and dreary and his execution of the music cues is equally bad.The visuals were very a-typical for this kind of show.  Overly dark overly shadowed and dyed in black ink.   It's a major departure for BEE TRAIN's usual colorful atmosphere and eye-catching style.   It's like watching Boogiepop where you want to scream, turn on the lights!  And of course the action was very typical with the usual blood flowing like a fountain routine.  Just once I would like to see an Anime character bleed normally.  The character designs are nice though, if that's any consolation.When it comes to music Ko Otani has in the past made some pretty amazing music scores.  Shadow of the Colossus being one of them, but in this case the music is terrible.   The score is mediocre and the opening themes are terrible.  The background and theme song vocalist sounds like a screeching cat it's like listening  to Ali Project only 10 times worse.From the first episode alone you can tell Blade of the Immortal is going to be a complete and absolute failure.   And from watching various clips of different episodes, it doesn't look to get any better.

Animation and sound are pretty standard with nothing particularly interesting to remember them for. This kills everything the manga was going for, meaning the rough pen artwork is gone and so is most of the gore. Turning that to a typical anime artstyle just kills the artistry. It’s like taking the Watchmen and changing them into Super Friends.Beyond that, this series is not even good as a standard action series. The main character is immortal and can never die no matter how many times he gets stabbed, clubbed or thrown into a huge blender. It doesn’t really matter...how strong his opponent is or what technique he is using. The protagonist just stands still and gets hit without caring and waits for the adversary to leave an opening so he can kill him. Basically, he can’t lose while they can, and that makes all the fights boring.The protagonist is not even cool like Alucard from Hellsing or Dark Shneider of Bastard!! He leaves you with no real impression. Neither do his random enemies and allies. The story is a generic revenge quest you have seen a billion times already, made up of stand alone missions. Plus, it ends without concluding anything.TL;DR: A passable and forgettable series. Not even the aesthetics of the manga managed to keep me interested for long.

Kantai Collection: KanColle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21511/Kantai_Collection__KanColle,"['Ever wondered why Touhou doesn\'t have an anime? This is why.There are two perspectives you can watch this show from: Either you played the game, or you haven\'t. This show is clearly designed to appeal to the former, and does a great job at failing in everything because of that. The thing about making an animated series of something like Kancolle is  that, aside from having the fans seeing their favorite characters being animated, it also gives a chance for them to see the characters develop beyond their limited personality trait in the game.What happens in this 12-episode odyssey is the complete opposite...of that idea.Before going any further into this series\' embarrassing writing that makes Boku no Pico Shakespearean in comparison, there are several other notable aspects of this show that warrant mentioning: Music, for the most part, is pretty decent. Apparently there seems to be an unspoken rule that terrible shows must have a decent/good soundtrack. Though, having claimed that, it\'s actually pretty difficult to hear most of the soundtrack because the battle scenes barely last more than a single minute. And yes, I\'m being pretty lenient with the term ""battle scenes"" because the visuals are legitimately worse than something from a Toei show. It\'s not even like YYY where 3DCG scenes were hardly noticeable- It\'s just literally everywhere in every battle scene in this show, and they\'re all so incredibly poorly choreographed that it makes you wonder whether a properly functioning human being was responsible for them.-Spoilers below-As mentioned previously, this show is something that tries too hard to appeal to the existing fanbase with the smallest effort possible that it fails at its job completely- First, the characters. There are way too fucking many. How did Diomedea manage to include all these 50+ characters in this 12-episode show? The answer is, they didn\'t. None of them end up being actual characters, and all they get for lines is repetition of the same throwaway line they babble in the game ad infinitum. See, this is the difference between a game and an animated series that tells a story- In games like Kancolle, it\'s pretty difficult to actually express characters\' personality aside from their throwaway lines, so to keep the game interesting, more characters are added to compensate for the lack of further development from the existing characters. But when you\'re trying to tell a story, that no longer applies- The more characters there are, the harder it is to focus on a certain character(s), and thus, it makes them as bland as they would be in the game when the point of telling a story is the complete opposite: Developing them beyond what would\'ve been feasible in a simple click-and-win game.These characters\' gimmicks are also influenced by the fanon- Such as Akagi being a big eater in the show due to her consuming lots of resources in-game. Completely necessary addition, I\'m sure. Fubuki, the MC, is incredibly boring and breaks personality several times in-series just to create unnecessary drama, which makes you wonder why the Admiral favors this particular character in the first place outside of her status as the main character. Everyone else can be summed up with a single sentence: Shimakaze likes going fast. Kongou likes speaking in broken English. Hibiki says one Russian word every chance she gets. Yuudaichi likes -poi more than -desu. Sendai really loves night battles. Naka won\'t shut the fuck up. Calling these protagonists cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard cutouts from Akame ga Kill, so I\'m not sure what to call them.What about the antagonists, though? If you expected anything other than ""incompetent mute cyborg zombies,"" then god damn is this show happy to disappoint. I\'m not sure what the trend is with all these silent villains that have no real motives, but I guess writing any form of conflict outside of badly animated/choreographed battle scenes was beyond Diomedea\'s capability. And if that wasn\'t enough, the Abyssals are pretty pathetic at their job and manage to be as threatening as moving dartboards. I guess they manage to finally sink a character who had a total screen time of less than a minute, who happens to be a friend of a boring friend of the boring MC with a last-second sneak attack. Oh, the horror. It\'s especially hilarious when the show cuts to Abyssals looking ominous and evil with spooky music playing in the background when they\'re a complete non-threat.And finally, the Admiral. It\'s pretty obvious that this Admiral character was designed to represent the viewer/player, which is why this character is never truly shown on the screen. Therefore, the character\'s motives/personality/appearance are all completely unknown because it\'s supposed to be “you.” I\'m not sure why this is even necessary considering this character plays a very little role, but apparently it was- Which is why Diomedea decides to fuck that up too by giving this character an identity. Apparently the reason why the Admiral favors Fubuki (the boring MC) so much is that he has a boner for this character. Well, that\'s great. Now everyone knows that the Admiral is this guy who has a boner for Fubuki, who is the most boring character in a show full of characters solely identified by throwaway lines. What happened to ambiguity, again? Honestly, Wo-class is a much better representation of the viewer- Looking bored and stoned as fuck throughout the entire fucking show pretty much sums up my experience.Aside from the poorly written characters with no effort put into them, there are two other things Diomedea decided to do to “appeal” to the existing fanbase of this series. One is tying in in-game mechanics like repair docks, buckets, upgrades, and etc. Not exactly necessary or hindering, but I\'d think that alone should have been enough for references from the game instead of making every character what they are in this show. The second thing is ""historical reenactment""- Since all the characters are based off of real life ships, the idea is that they would meet the same fate at the same time at the same place. This is sort of ""foreshadowed"" in the opening sequence where you can briefly see the real Akagi ship sinking and is a “major” plot point in the latter part of the series. I\'m not exactly sure how this is supposed to be an appeal, however. Knowing what\'s going to happen in the show based on real life events seems completely uninteresting especially considering the flat characters and setting, and if it was any more focused by the series, it would just be yet another cliche\'d ""fighting against fate"" plot line that\'s been done million times over, so I really don\'t get it. I guess it makes some people feel smug for knowing that this one character that may have been in the background in one episode will sink before other people do.So outside of Diomedea\'s blatantly embarrassing fanservice, what else is there? I guess there\'s supposed to be a plot somewhere, but the pacing is so horrendous that it\'s actually difficult to remember what actually happened in this show. That being said, this show does few things that could be considered two of the worst things one can do when writing a story. The first is lack of focus- Just like several other shows, this show cannot decide what kind of a show it wants to be. It could be either a fun show about wacky hijinx, or a serious show with drama that may or may not be forced. If it stuck with one, and did just that, then it would have been fine. Unfortunately, Kancolle attempts to do both, and fails at both- I\'m not sure why so many shows do this when both drama and comedy hinder each other most of the time, thus making their simultaaneous inclusion counter productive. I\'d assume it probably sounded good on that used toilet paper they used for the storyboard for this show. The amount of sudden mood shifts in this show is transcendent, and this is made even worse with piss-poor pacing. For example, there would be a forced drama scene with Fubuki and her friends. Then it would immediately cut to Ooi and Kitakami doing their usual comedy routine. Then immediately cut back to the drama scene. Flawless.The second problem ties into the first- Even the drama is completely forced. And even then, these supposedly sad scenes aren\'t even relevant or impactful. Because by the end of the episode, it turns out everything was fine all along, which makes the characters seem idiotic for worrying about it in the first place. This problem is especially notable with Fubuki breaking character and doing something reckless against the enemy because suddenly she decided that she wanted to feel important and have a personality. She obviously fails at everything noted above, but this scene itself has also failed at having any lasting impact. No one ends up getting hurt in the end, and everything was daijobu. Then she goes to train with moving targets, which really are as threatening as Abyssals considering how much damage Fubuki came out of it in the end. What a joke.But wait, there\'s more. In the last episode, where everything seems ""hopeless"" because that one mean Abyssal just won\'t die despite it being only able to shoot out nearly harmless white balls in the protagonists\' general direction as its masterful strategy, Nagato suddenly shows up to the rescue- It was all according to plan, apparently. Then when it doesn\'t work, a new shipgirl appears out of nowhere that got a brief ""foreshadowing"" (using this term extremely loosely) in the previous episode and comes to save the day- Then the Admiral literally uses repair buckets out of nowhere to get more shipgirls in the battle, and the show doesn\'t even try to hide its Deus ex Machina garbage writing at this point. Then Black Rock Shooter and Fubuki stare at each other before the former realizes this writing is fucking retarded and goes back down the ocean.Basically, every single episode in this show can be summed down to this: 20 minutes of filler that may or may not include poorly written drama that ends up resolving itself the same god damn episode, and 2 minutes of poorly choreographed battle scene where victory is solely decided by shooting at things a lot with no strategy involved.It\'s incredibly ironic that this show tried so hard to appeal to the existing fanbase that it only alienated them as a result, and ended up appealing to an entirely different group of people who watches shows based on anything but quality. Now, I think it\'s pretty notable to mention that some people seem to defend this show with claims like ""What did you expect?"" But that sort of claim would only be valid if someone criticized something like Hamtaro for its lack of drama. It\'s completely invalid here because it doesn\'t do either drama or comedy because it tries to do both and fails at both. Most criticisms for this show do not come from complaining about what this show doesn\'t have- It comes from what this show does have and that is fucking awful. Some might also claim ""It\'s a game advertisement show so it obviously wouldn\'t be good!"" What about Rage of Bahamut: Genesis? That was a show based on a Mobage, and it was one of the best shows of its season, so that excuse isn\'t valid either. Any show, no matter what it\'s based on or which studio\'s doing it, can have actual effort put into it, and that alone would make any show significantly better than this garbage. The fact is, this show is just a lazy, half-assed attempt to make money off a popular franchise while putting as little effort as possible. And just to emphasize on the point of ""striking while the iron is hot,"" a second season is immediately announced by the end of the last episode. Subtle.The best way to describe Kancolle would be that it\'s basically anti-Touhou. It\'s everything that Touhou isn\'t- Kadokawa also apparently decided that it didn\'t want to put any effort into their “game,” so they decided to forbid any Kancolle doujin game whatsoever because having to make anything that\'s more than a clicking simulator would be far beyond their talents. And then they get this show made just to make sure they can rake in as much money as possible before the popularity wears off. Considering how this show turned out, and how many of its existing fans reacted to it, I think it\'s pretty safe to say that ZUN made the proper decision. And I think it\'s pretty worrisome if all this makes a drunken man who can\'t even get human anatomy correct after nearly a decade seem like Albert fucking Einstein. of that idea.Before going any further into this series\' embarrassing writing that makes Boku no Pico Shakespearean in comparison, there are several other notable aspects of this show that warrant mentioning: Music, for the most part, is pretty decent.

See, this is the difference between a game and an animated series that tells a story- In games like Kancolle, it\'s pretty difficult to actually express characters\' personality aside from their throwaway lines, so to keep the game interesting, more characters are added to compensate for the lack of further development from the existing characters. But when you\'re trying to tell a story, that no longer applies- The more characters there are, the harder it is to focus on a certain character(s), and thus, it makes them as bland as they would be in the game when the point of telling a story is the complete opposite: Developing them beyond what would\'ve been feasible in a simple click-and-win game.These characters\' gimmicks are also influenced by the fanon- Such as Akagi being a big eater in the show due to her consuming lots of resources in-game. Completely necessary addition, I\'m sure. Fubuki, the MC, is incredibly boring and breaks personality several times in-series just to create unnecessary drama, which makes you wonder why the Admiral favors this particular character in the first place outside of her status as the main character. Everyone else can be summed up with a single sentence: Shimakaze likes going fast. Kongou likes speaking in broken English. Hibiki says one Russian word every chance she gets. Yuudaichi likes -poi more than -desu. Sendai really loves night battles. Naka won\'t shut the fuck up. Calling these protagonists cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard cutouts from Akame ga Kill, so I\'m not sure what to call them.What about the antagonists, though? If you expected anything other than ""incompetent mute cyborg zombies,"" then god damn is this show happy to disappoint. I\'m not sure what the trend is with all these silent villains that have no real motives, but I guess writing any form of conflict outside of badly animated/choreographed battle scenes was beyond Diomedea\'s capability. And if that wasn\'t enough, the Abyssals are pretty pathetic at their job and manage to be as threatening as moving dartboards. I guess they manage to finally sink a character who had a total screen time of less than a minute, who happens to be a friend of a boring friend of the boring MC with a last-second sneak attack. Oh, the horror. It\'s especially hilarious when the show cuts to Abyssals looking ominous and evil with spooky music playing in the background when they\'re a complete non-threat.And finally, the Admiral. It\'s pretty obvious that this Admiral character was designed to represent the viewer/player, which is why this character is never truly shown on the screen. Therefore, the character\'s motives/personality/appearance are all completely unknown because it\'s supposed to be “you.” I\'m not sure why this is even necessary considering this character plays a very little role, but apparently it was- Which is why Diomedea decides to fuck that up too by giving this character an identity. Apparently the reason why the Admiral favors Fubuki (the boring MC) so much is that he has a boner for this character. Well, that\'s great. Now everyone knows that the Admiral is this guy who has a boner for Fubuki, who is the most boring character in a show full of characters solely identified by throwaway lines. What happened to ambiguity, again? Honestly, Wo-class is a much better representation of the viewer- Looking bored and stoned as fuck throughout the entire fucking show pretty much sums up my experience.Aside from the poorly written characters with no effort put into them, there are two other things Diomedea decided to do to “appeal” to the existing fanbase of this series. One is tying in in-game mechanics like repair docks, buckets, upgrades, and etc. Not exactly necessary or hindering, but I\'d think that alone should have been enough for references from the game instead of making every character what they are in this show. The second thing is ""historical reenactment""- Since all the characters are based off of real life ships, the idea is that they would meet the same fate at the same time at the same place. This is sort of ""foreshadowed"" in the opening sequence where you can briefly see the real Akagi ship sinking and is a “major” plot point in the latter part of the series. I\'m not exactly sure how this is supposed to be an appeal, however. Knowing what\'s going to happen in the show based on real life events seems completely uninteresting especially considering the flat characters and setting, and if it was any more focused by the series, it would just be yet another cliche\'d ""fighting against fate"" plot line that\'s been done million times over, so I really don\'t get it. I guess it makes some people feel smug for knowing that this one character that may have been in the background in one episode will sink before other people do.So outside of Diomedea\'s blatantly embarrassing fanservice, what else is there? I guess there\'s supposed to be a plot somewhere, but the pacing is so horrendous that it\'s actually difficult to remember what actually happened in this show. That being said, this show does few things that could be considered two of the worst things one can do when writing a story. The first is lack of focus- Just like several other shows, this show cannot decide what kind of a show it wants to be. It could be either a fun show about wacky hijinx, or a serious show with drama that may or may not be forced. If it stuck with one, and did just that, then it would have been fine. Unfortunately, Kancolle attempts to do both, and fails at both- I\'m not sure why so many shows do this when both drama and comedy hinder each other most of the time, thus making their simultaaneous inclusion counter productive. I\'d assume it probably sounded good on that used toilet paper they used for the storyboard for this show. The amount of sudden mood shifts in this show is transcendent, and this is made even worse with piss-poor pacing. For example, there would be a forced drama scene with Fubuki and her friends. Then it would immediately cut to Ooi and Kitakami doing their usual comedy routine. Then immediately cut back to the drama scene. Flawless.The second problem ties into the first- Even the drama is completely forced. And even then, these supposedly sad scenes aren\'t even relevant or impactful. Because by the end of the episode, it turns out everything was fine all along, which makes the characters seem idiotic for worrying about it in the first place. This problem is especially notable with Fubuki breaking character and doing something reckless against the enemy because suddenly she decided that she wanted to feel important and have a personality. She obviously fails at everything noted above, but this scene itself has also failed at having any lasting impact. No one ends up getting hurt in the end, and everything was daijobu. Then she goes to train with moving targets, which really are as threatening as Abyssals considering how much damage Fubuki came out of it in the end. What a joke.But wait, there\'s more. In the last episode, where everything seems ""hopeless"" because that one mean Abyssal just won\'t die despite it being only able to shoot out nearly harmless white balls in the protagonists\' general direction as its masterful strategy, Nagato suddenly shows up to the rescue- It was all according to plan, apparently. Then when it doesn\'t work, a new shipgirl appears out of nowhere that got a brief ""foreshadowing"" (using this term extremely loosely) in the previous episode and comes to save the day- Then the Admiral literally uses repair buckets out of nowhere to get more shipgirls in the battle, and the show doesn\'t even try to hide its Deus ex Machina garbage writing at this point. Then Black Rock Shooter and Fubuki stare at each other before the former realizes this writing is fucking retarded and goes back down the ocean.Basically, every single episode in this show can be summed down to this: 20 minutes of filler that may or may not include poorly written drama that ends up resolving itself the same god damn episode, and 2 minutes of poorly choreographed battle scene where victory is solely decided by shooting at things a lot with no strategy involved.It\'s incredibly ironic that this show tried so hard to appeal to the existing fanbase that it only alienated them as a result, and ended up appealing to an entirely different group of people who watches shows based on anything but quality. Now, I think it\'s pretty notable to mention that some people seem to defend this show with claims like ""What did you expect?"" But that sort of claim would only be valid if someone criticized something like Hamtaro for its lack of drama. It\'s completely invalid here because it doesn\'t do either drama or comedy because it tries to do both and fails at both. Most criticisms for this show do not come from complaining about what this show doesn\'t have- It comes from what this show does have and that is fucking awful. Some might also claim ""It\'s a game advertisement show so it obviously wouldn\'t be good!"" What about Rage of Bahamut: Genesis? That was a show based on a Mobage, and it was one of the best shows of its season, so that excuse isn\'t valid either. Any show, no matter what it\'s based on or which studio\'s doing it, can have actual effort put into it, and that alone would make any show significantly better than this garbage. The fact is, this show is just a lazy, half-assed attempt to make money off a popular franchise while putting as little effort as possible. And just to emphasize on the point of ""striking while the iron is hot,"" a second season is immediately announced by the end of the last episode. Subtle.The best way to describe Kancolle would be that it\'s basically anti-Touhou. It\'s everything that Touhou isn\'t- Kadokawa also apparently decided that it didn\'t want to put any effort into their “game,” so they decided to forbid any Kancolle doujin game whatsoever because having to make anything that\'s more than a clicking simulator would be far beyond their talents. And then they get this show made just to make sure they can rake in as much money as possible before the popularity wears off. Considering how this show turned out, and how many of its existing fans reacted to it, I think it\'s pretty safe to say that ZUN made the proper decision. And I think it\'s pretty worrisome if all this makes a drunken man who can\'t even get human anatomy correct after nearly a decade seem like Albert fucking Einstein.', ""Kantai Collection: KanColle is an Action, Comedy, Slice of life, Military, Sci-fi anime based of the web browser game created by Kadokawa Games. The anime was created by Diomedéa Studio and was aired on January 8, 2015 to March 26, 2015 and lasting for 12 episodes.PlotThe plot follows Special Type Destroyer Fubuki, a young girl who is a Kanmusu, girls who possess a spirit of a naval vessel within themselves and use these spirits to fight the Abyssal fleet who are threatening humanity from the sea. These girls live at naval bases, where they are taught to fight the Abyssal. Fubuki is a new...recruit at one of these naval bases upon her arrival she joins the Third Torpedo Squadron and is sent into battle despite having very limited combat training. While in battle, she is saved by Akagi, An Aircraft Carrier, and afterwards Fubuki decides that she needs to become stronger so she can fight at Akagi’s side.The Show does a good job of explaining its story to the viewer by explaining the different kinds of Kanmusu and what the job in the fleet are. While the fighting is keep at a minimal, the focus of the show is based on Fubuki and her comrades while they train at the naval base which is interesting and funny at the same time. Now, because of the anime having so many character and character building, I going to only give the names of girls and what type of Kanmusu they are:Fubuki, Voiced by Sumire Uesaka – Special Type Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo SquadronMutsuki, Voiced by Rina Hidaka – Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo SquadronYūdachi, Voiced by Yumi Tanibe – Destroyer, a part of the Third Torpedo SquadronSendai, Jintsū and Naka, Voiced by Ayane Sakura – Light Cruisers, a part of the Third Torpedo Squadron with Jintsū as Flagship.Akagi, Voiced by Saki Fujita – Aircraft carrier, a part of the First Carrier DivisionKongō, Hiei, Haruna and Kirishima, Voiced by Nao Tōyama – Battleships, a part of the Second FleetNagato and Mutsu, Voiced by Ayane Sakura – Battleships, Secretaries of the fleet.Kitakami and Ōi, Voiced by Yuka Ōtsubo – Torpedo CruisersPresentationKanColle art style uses a bright blend of colors to breathe life into the show for the viewer. Each of the characters have been given a unique personality, making them stand out compared to one another and easily recognizable to the viewer. The show uses two different animation styles: one for the action scenes and the characters every day life. The use of a different style for the action scenes helps making them more beautiful and interesting to the viewer, thus making them some of the best parts of the show. The voice acting in this is very impressive because of some voice actresses doing multiple characters especially Ayane Sakura, as some of her characters have conversations with each other and the viewer is able to tell which character is talking by their voice.My OpinionKanColle is an anime where I did not know much about before watching, that has made me interested in the Kantai Collection game series. The story, while it not one of the best I've seen was still enjoyable. The characters have been designed with a lot of care in terms of looks and personality, and because of this care the art style over all was appealing to me. The message I got from KanColle is that as long you keep trying your hardest, you can achieve anything you put your mind and heart to. Finally, I love the character development of Fubuki over the course of the show as she always tries her best and doesn't give up.VerdictKanColle is one of the anime that while looking at each part separately, like basic story or characters, is nothing special; however, when combined together makes a very interesting show. Anyone, both fans of Kantai Collection or newcomers, can enjoy its characters, art style and story. While there is better stories out there, I still recommend people to give KanColle a go as it takes a common idea and makes it something unique and new to people watching. recruit at one of these naval bases upon her arrival she joins the Third Torpedo Squadron and is sent into battle despite having very limited combat training.

Cute girls. You know what's even better? Playing a game filled with them. Even better? The fact that they all have good artists and VAs. The best part? The diversity of girls makes it so anyone can find a favorite. You'd think it wouldn't be difficult to make a Kancolle anime considering there are anime with similar kinds of situations such as Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer, but instead of having a healthy balance of slice of life and battles, Kancolle just jumps around everywhere, making for a jarring experience.The story is heavily divided, with multiple parts with their own...plot. The parts are segmented into episodes 1-4, 5+7, 6 , 8-9, and 10-12. It winds up being all over the place, tending to be a repeating pattern of slice of life, preparations for sortie, sortie, miracle, and end sortie. Kancolle also tends to tunnel vision on whatever the current episode's plot is and forces the issue. The only overarching drive in Kancolle is Fubuki striving to become one of Akagi's escorts. Honestly, it's how the slice of life elements and combat elements are thrown into the pot together that really inhibit the anime as a whole.Fortunately, the lead designer is great. He really brings to life the ships of so many different artists in one cohesive style. The best part is that the faces are drawn similarly enough to where you can look at both the anime and game styles and see how they correlate. The music is also solid and features a wonderful op and ed. The battle music doesn't quite pack a punch, but still fits thematically.The biggest issue with the Kancolle anime is how the characters are handled. For some reason the writers decided that having all of the characters keep saying in game lines and slightly modified versions of in game lines was a good idea when it actually destroyed life from the characters. Look, I understand that the lines were probably put in because they wanted an easy way to convey the character's personalities, but it's possible to do it without resorting to such an uninspired method. I don't want to continually hear Hibiki's Russian one liners all the time. I want her to speak full sentences, and if Russian words want to be added in at that point, that's fine. Also, the fact that the admiral is never seen and never talks bothers me a lot. It just makes it feel like it's that way for self-inserting purposes, which just saps any joy from interactions with the admiral.Even with all of its problems, I did enjoy watching Kancolle; however, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It is definitely something that you have to enjoy from the start, otherwise you would just be bored. If anything, episode 6 was the most consistent episode thematically and consequently the most enjoyable.

You send the ships on sorties and expeditions in your campaign against the abyssals who has taken over Earth's ocean, all while praying to RNGesus that your construction or sortie reward yields the ship you want. Its a nice timesink and appeals a lot to its target audience, with a strong fanbase that rivals that of Touhou. With such a large and dedicated fanbase, its extremely tempting to create an...anime adaptation to not only provide fanservice, but to also make a quick buck on its popularity. So they yielded and produced this anime. And how does it fare?Condensed version:Why you may pick this up:-Plenty of fanservice (ero and non-ero) for those who have played the game-Poi-Kongou-Shimakaze-Nagamon-Ship waifus are now animated-OP and ED (though to be fair, if you only want the OP and ED you can just search on YT or hikari no  akari)Why you may skip this:-Anime does a poor job of introducing game to newcomers or to people who never played kancolle.-Newcomers and people who never played kancolle will not get the references and fanservice-Poor plot direction and pacing-Insufferable CGLong version:Story-5: This is the weakest part of the anime. The story is best described as going through an existential crisis; it does not know its purpose for existing. Does it want to tell a gripping tale about a young maiden's perilous journey through Earth's Ocean with her fellow shipgirls, or does it want to be a Madoka clone, or a SOL comedy, or to introduce newcomers to the game, or to provide fanservice for current players? It has the distinction of being all of the above, and yet somehow being none of the above at the same time. It constantly switches between those identities, like at one point the anime is trying to push the fact that a shipgirl has sunk, and at the next the Akatsuki sisters are entering a curry competition, as if that sinking never happened. It should pick an identity and stick to it. We would have been fine with the anime if all 12 episodes were just the shipgirls seating around the Teitoku's office drinking tea and eating cake, and maybe have cameos from the abyssals as well. They may as well call themselves Headquarters Tea-Time.  It’s simple, cheap, fun, provides fanservice for current players, while having many opportunities to introduce the game to newcomers.Art-7: The art is decent during the non-combat scenes. The managed to make most of the shipgirls look moe enough to keep you going. Artillery designs are all based on art from the game and WWII ships, while all the girls themselves look cute enough, unlike some of their in-game counterparts. The main problem is the CG used during the combat scenes, or when they are water skating. It is extremely jarring to watch. The framerate does not make the animation smooth, and this makes the combat scenes very hard to digest, which in turn, makes admiring the shipgirls difficult. The Character designs somehow gets downgraded as they move in a 3D plane, and ruins the entire experience. Fortunately, these scenes are not prolonged, and we quickly return to the moe 2D girls.Sound-8: One reason you may pick up this anime. Both OP and ED are enjoyable, and the ED is one of my personal favourite ED. The soundtrack used are enjoyable to hear when used during the scene is meant for, but are ultimately forgettable. Artillery firing packs a nice explosive punch to them, and all the VAs do their jobs well enough. The VAs in this anime deserve special mention, as they actually voiced multiple ship sisters, each with their own distinct pitch and tone you could’ve sworn were completely different voice actors. Honorable mention goes to Nao Touyama, who voiced the Kongou sisters, Atago and Takao. Her voices can be extremely different from each other, from Kongou’s  Engrish to Atago’s playfulness, and yet she manages to do make all 6 characters sound like they have 6 different VAs.Characters-8: Probably the main reason one might pick up this anime. Fans of the game should ALL have a ship they are extremely fond of, and Kadokawa has recognised this, even giving players the ability to marry the ships that they like. To see them animated, with their VAs saying new unique lines and interacting with other shipgirls, is like a wet dream come true to the player base. The story follows Fubuki, one of the special-class destroyers and a starter ship in the game, as she joins fellow destroyers Yuudachi (poi) and Mutsuki in taking the Ocean back for humanity, one abyssal at a time. The character development in this show suffers because of this, as these three are the only characters that receive any development, the rest being there to provide the viewers a chance to see their shipfus animated. While the other characters are lively and fun to watch on screen, they receive little to no character development. Backstories are left in history books since these shipgirls' history are based on their WWII counterparts, like Sendai's love for night battles since she fought most of her battles at night in WWII, or how Yamato's aversion to the word 'hotel' is based on her being used mostly as a hotel in WWII and barely used for combat. Enjoyable, but unless you have played the game, they are not memorable.Enjoyment-8: As a huge fan of the game, my enjoyment of this anime is, of course, biased, since I understand all the jokes, fanservice, and references made in this anime. To see the shipgirls that I often used in the game animated is glorious eye candy, but was shattered when they transitioned to the CG. I also found that I enjoyed the SoL moments more that the action ones. Just 2 episodes of them making curry and looking for Shimakaze are better than 10 episodes of them fighting the abyssals.Overall-7: If you are a fan of the game the anime is based on, feel free to watch this. While the CG is painful to watch, one can get over it through the love for their shipfus. For newcomers who wants to know more about the kancolle craze or wants to know more about the game, the English Kancolle wiki the kancolle forums, Himeuta, has FAQs and general information about the game. IF you are a newcomer, play the game and fall in love with the game or a shipfu first before watching, or else most of the jokes, references and cameos will lose its appeal. For people not interested in Kancolle but is a huge anime fan, do not bother with this. A poor story focus and lack of character development in a large cast of characters brings down the anime, with an ending not worth your time. If you want to investigate what the kancolle craze is about, himeuta or the kancolle wiki is more than enough. If not, you are better off spending your precious time watching other anime. anime adaptation to not only provide fanservice, but to also make a quick buck on its popularity.

Just 2 episodes of them making curry and looking for Shimakaze are better than 10 episodes of them fighting the abyssals.Overall-7: If you are a fan of the game the anime is based on, feel free to watch this. While the CG is painful to watch, one can get over it through the love for their shipfus. For newcomers who wants to know more about the kancolle craze or wants to know more about the game, the English Kancolle wiki the kancolle forums, Himeuta, has FAQs and general information about the game. IF you are a newcomer, play the game and fall in love with the game or a shipfu first before watching, or else most of the jokes, references and cameos will lose its appeal. For people not interested in Kancolle but is a huge anime fan, do not bother with this. A poor story focus and lack of character development in a large cast of characters brings down the anime, with an ending not worth your time. If you want to investigate what the kancolle craze is about, himeuta or the kancolle wiki is more than enough. If not, you are better off spending your precious time watching other anime."", 'I feel compelled to write a review about this show since it was one of those shows that was fairly hyped during this season and has a unusually high average score for a show this mediocre. As a fan of the game and the general media craze of Kancolle, this show as a whole falls short of being good from any perspective.Firstly, I\'d like to note that unlike a lot of people who like to rate similar to how IGN likes to rate things (i.e. anything below a 7-8 is ""meh""), and because of it, I generally dislike number ratings, especially ones as bloated as...a 1-10 scale, but I will follow the guidelines and base my ""average"" at a 5/10Spoilers ahead.Story: 3/10The premise of the show is the same as the game: some alien beings called Abyssal (a.k.a American forces) have invaded the waters near Japan and conventional weaponry does not work on them, so they do the next best thing: get adolescent girls to bond with the spirit of old Japanese warships, adopting their names in order to fight this new enemy. The fleet are stationed at a naval base where the admiral (who doesn\'t make an appearance, but is implied that you, the audience, is the admiral) helps shape them into the war machines they need to be. The premise is over the top and makes the show impossible to take seriously, which is the point. It\'s meant to tease the WW2 and moeblob demographics and provide a general 23~ minutes of pandering each week, which is fine, I enjoyed Strike Witches for doing practically the same thing.Where Kancolle differs, and suffers because of it, from Strike Witches, is that the show can\'t decide if it wants to go full-out fanservice mode and pander to the viewers or make a show with genuine hype and passable writing. A show can do both, but Kantai Collection is not one of those shows. The story starts off giving a really good showcase of the show, with nice action scenes, introductions to the popular ship girls of the game, with some delivering their one-liners and real-life-ship-mirroring personalities, but it never moves forward from that point. From one episode to the next, they keep introducing new ships, sometimes to introduce a new story arc, but most of the time it\'s just to have them there to cater to anyone who is a fan of that ship.There was a moment in one of the earlier episodes where they ""re-enact"" the Battle of Wake Island, which is the battle where the Kisaragi gets scuttled. The episodes ends rather dramatically, building up tension going into the next episode, maybe giving the show a sense of tension and direction, only to have the next episode be a showcase of Kongou and Shimakaze\'s shenanigans. It was incredibly jarring going from what could have been a moderately emotional story development to a 4-koma esque episode catering to fans of Kongou and Shimakaze, and then going back to conclude Mutsuki\'s and Kisaragi\'s arc at the end of that same episode. To put it simply, there were a lot of ideas thrown around in those 2 episodes, but no direction to coherently deliver it.After that point, the show switches into slice-of-life mode, where, you guessed it, they keep introducing more ship girls for one-off arcs that provides very little to any semblance of a story.The last third of the show goes back to being a bit more dramatic with the Battle of Midway, the famous battle in which Japan suffered a major loss in the Pacific theatre, and was the battle where one of show\'s more prominent characters, Akagi, gets sunken. I will say the sinking of Kisaragi did do a good job of baiting the audience into thinking they aren\'t afraid to stick to historical accuracy, and the episodes leading up to Operation MI did foreshadow Akagi\'s death, but in true anime fashion, the entire cast comes in to save the day. The final episode also had this theme of ""defying fate"" which basically translates into ""changing real-life history"", but the way it was delivered makes the writers of the show come off as being a little salty about WW2, with a little pinch of nationalism.TL;DR: Story is basically Strike Witches but on water instead of air, but with no actual direction and execution, and any sort of potential that the story did have was wasted to pander to fans of the game (which did not work).Art: 5/10The show started off strong. Like, really strong. In the first episode, when the girls deploy for the first time, we\'re treated to a rather eye-catching magical girl-esque transformation sequence as they equip their guns and armor. This is a good example of CGI being used moderately well. However, the art quality goes south rather quickly.The show mixes the use of 2D drawn and 3D CGI for normal, day to day scenes, and high-movement battle scenes, respectively. The problem comes in when there\'s any sort of dialogue during the latter scenes. The scenes like to cut from 2D to CGI and back for very little reason, even when there\'s no actual, high-budget action going on. It becomes even more jarring when there are visual inaccuracies swapping between the two types of animation within the same scene.By the end of the show, the budget was obviously running dry with shots like (https://38.media.tumblr.com/5d0dfa0739f4f665b7f76faf19446530/tumblr_nlt5vtpQg11r3fop8o1_500.gif) where assets pop in (and aren\'t composed properly, as you can tell from the gun barrels cutting off near the edge of the screen after popping in) or shots like this (http://i.4cdn.org/a/1427391382586.jpg) where apparently the girls have 6 fingers on each hand.There\'s also the point that many of the characters suffer from same-face syndrome, and as a result, look nothing like their game-art renditions.TL;DR - Art budget was used mostly in the opening episodes and the girls all look the same, unlike the source game.Sound: 7/10The opening and ending themes were rather enjoyable to listen to and the cast is the same as game, which is a really high point of praise considering the skill of some of the seiyuus. I think one seiyuu voiced 6-7 characters in this show, none of which sound the same, and a few of which interact with each other in the same scenes. It\'s also a nice touch that the characters have lines directly or draw from their lines in the game.Character: 3/10Speaking of characters drawing their lines from the game, that\'s pretty much 90% of the characters outside of the 3-4 main characters. One of the more popular ship girls, Kongou, pretty much serves as a mouthpiece for pandering. Her entire presence can be boiled down to ""Hey, look at me! Look at how historically accurate I am! Look at me deliver the same quotes as in the game every time I\'m on screen! Buurniing loooove~~~!!!"".As far as development goes, none of the characters actually grow, except for maybe Fubuki, the main character, and even then it takes a horrendously awkward development arc, and it never made care about her throughout the show (apparently, she was chosen to be a part of the admiral\'s fleet because he had a dream about her in a wedding dress? I get that marrying a ship girl is a part of the game, but did they really have to make a plot point?). And with the supporting cast being so bloated (with new ships being introduced as far as the second half of the last episode), there wouldn\'t be enough time to make the audience care about them even if the writers wanted to.Enjoyment: 4/10I was really hyped for this show when it first aired. The first few episodes were enjoyable, and I went in knowing this show is just pandering to fans of moe and Kancolle, the game. However, as the show went on, it kept getting more and more boring to sit through the 20 minutes of content, as the fanservice kept being recycled and the end of an episode didn\'t leave me feeling any better about the franchise than when I started.Overall 4/10The show would have received a much lower score for its shoddy production quality alone, but being a fan of the game and the general franchise, I\'ll give it a generous 4/10 as there is some slight enjoyment to be had from the show if you\'re a fan of the game or the media craze of kancolle. a 1-10 scale, but I will follow the guidelines and base my ""average"" at a 5/10Spoilers ahead.Story: 3/10The premise of the show is the same as the game: some alien beings called Abyssal (a.k.a American forces) have invaded the waters near Japan and conventional weaponry does not work on them, so they do the next best thing: get adolescent girls to bond with the spirit of old Japanese warships, adopting their names in order to fight this new enemy.

With that being said, the idea of turning naval combat ships into adorable fap-mater...I mean waifu-material...seemed like an idea that could not possible go wrong. And so one fateful day, Kadokawa Games created a free-to-play browser game featuring over 9000 (Give or take around 8900) different ship-girls that would go on to live in the dreams of otaku everywhere. Following this explosion of moeboats, Diomedea quickly grabbed the premise of Kantai Collection and set sail toward...creating an anime adaptation, knowing that the fans of the game would be immediately ""On board"" for seeing their favorites ships fully animated.Keizo Kusakawa (Dog Days/Asura Cryin\') came on to direct the series which would immediately receive an influx of mixed reviews. Some viewers hated the anime because it was nothing but cute girls doing cute things. But, on the other hand, that was the exact reason that so many other viewers were praising it. So now, critics are split down the middle in deciding whether or not KanColle is worth watching. And the answer to that really depends on what you are looking to get out of it. If you came for a story, go somewhere else -- this show is most definitely not for you. BUT, if you want to watch adorable boat girls just doing their thing, then get the hell on deck.The first episode of KanColle introduces you to Fubuki, a destroyer class ship-girl who will go on the be the main character of the series. Fubuki, unlike the other ships, is incredibly clumsy and has zero combat experience whatsoever. Tired of being the weakest of them all, Fubuki goes on to practice day and night in an attempt to not weigh down her fellow boats. After a solid mix of naval combat and fan-service scenarios, Fubuki gains many new friends who will go on to shape the experience of what Kantai Collection really is -- a fun show. But are fun and good interchangeable? That\'s something you must decide for yourself. But I\'m sure you\'ll get a grip of how I feel about it after I break it up over the next few paragraphs and weigh in on each aspect of the show.Music: 7/10The music of KanColle is actually pretty good. The soundtrack blends traditional Japanese styles with fast-paced and dramatic rock music riddled with miniature guitar solos. The music becomes essential for expanding the atmosphere of the fight-scenes (Which there are a handful of in the show). And the music in KanColle doesn\'t function the same way that a lot of soundtracks do, meaning it doesn\'t really blend in. You can always tell that it\'s there, the impact is not subtle at all. This is both good and bad, considering it can also work as a distraction. One other thing though, is that when the music ISN\'T playing, something seems amiss. Like the scenes are too bland without it. And unfortunately, this happens more often than you would think.Characters: 10/10The sheer amount of characters you come across in Kantai Collection is extravagant. But that is to be expected when the game has a total of 156 playable girls (That number is still rising, by the way). Obviously, not all 156 of the girls get screen-time in the anime. But even without that, it will still be easy to choose a favorite considering how different they all are from one another. However, if you don\'t choose Kongou as your favorite, you obviously don\'t know what you\'re doing. Character development really isn\'t a factor for anyone other than Fubuki. But the thing with Fubuki is that her development seems a little rushed. Her transition from ""Insanely weak and useless"" to ""Overpowered and unbalanced"" comes along rather quickly. And even though this is a problem, it does not overshadow how delightful and varied the boatgirls in KanColle are.Art: 8/10I think it\'s safe to say that Diomedea has outdone themselves with the artwork in Kantai Collection. Out of all of the series they\'ve done that I have had the chance to watch, this one is far superior. Character design is great and stays loyal to the source material. The enemies are dark and gloomy which contrast with the bright and vivid atmosphere of the rest of the show in a way that is basically impossible to ignore. Frankly, I was extremely impressed. When I got myself into this show I wasn\'t expecting anything phenomenal in the art department, but I quickly retracted those thoughts as the show progressed. HOWEVER, the one thing I really disliked as far as art went was when 3DCG was brought into the mixture. Adding dimension to the girls during floating (Or swimming? Sailing? I don\'t know what to call it) really took away the detail of their character just seconds prior. It created an inconsistent situation where I could love the image of a character in one scene and then go on to hate it in the next. In my opinion, the art should have just stayed 2D through the entire show.Story: 4/10I wouldn\'t go as far as saying there is no story in KanColle. I would, however, say that literally no one cares about it. Not even the writers. Everyone was just more concerned with watching all the moeboats interact with each other. And those scenes of interaction were great. But every once and a while, KanColle tried to slip some naval battle you didn\'t care about under the radar in an excuse to further develop Fubuki. I get what the writers were going for, but it really just didn\'t work. KanColle was unsuccessful in creating a story line that viewers cared about. When that happens, there really isn\'t much hope for its progression. The story starts to ""sink"" in a way. Ha. Ha ha. Anyway, like I said earlier on in the review -- if you came here for a story, you might as well go watch something else. But if you want to watch different groups of girls act all cute and funny, register for a Crunchyroll account and go check this out. You won\'t be let down.The one thing I wan\'t to add before I finish up this review is the amount of enjoyment I got out of this show. We can sit here all day and talk about ""What makes a show good"". But as far as I\'m concerned, enjoyment has a harder impact on that than anything else. KanColle looks great, sounds great, and a ton of laughs for anyone that is just looking to have a good time. I highly recommend it for anyone that has room left in their ""Favorite characters"" column on MyAnimeList. creating an anime adaptation, knowing that the fans of the game would be immediately ""On board"" for seeing their favorites ships fully animated.Keizo Kusakawa (Dog Days/Asura Cryin\') came on to direct the series which would immediately receive an influx of mixed reviews.

While most were happy and excited for the adaption of the most popular casual game in Japan, people who were already familiar with anime and the tropes associated with the media were worried. This was because the production company was a relatively unknown studio, the art was vastly different from the pixiv artists that make the original character pictures, the ever infamous CGI was going to be used, and with all things that attempt to cater to too many people,...artistic liberties were likely to be protracted for a generic anime. Unfortunately, generic is exactly what Kantai Collection is and even as an original fan of the game who went in with little expectations I felt disappointed.For those unfamiliar with the series, Kantai Collection (Or Kancolle short) is an online game about ship girls that take their designs based on World War 2 Japanese naval war vessels. Destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, you name it. Heavily reliant on moe and the popular concept of girls with war machines (Like Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer), it has become arguably the most popular game in Japan and even parts of Asia not only for otakus but for the casual people as well. The girls fight monstrous demons that rise from the ocean... And well, that's about it for the plot and setting. Not much information on the world is really given and the different sources like the manga and light novels are not official.This is perhaps the biggest problem with the Kancolle anime. Perhaps in order to stay faithful to the game, no real world exploration, setting, or story is set in place. It isn't exaggeration to say the plot of Kancolle is literally just naval fleet girls fighting against monsters with added slice of life in the mix. There is no explanation for how the girls “inherit” the souls of World War 2 ships, no exposition on the current state of the world, no details on what humanity is doing and why they have to rely on the girls, no details on how the Abyssals work. The show blatantly just puts out “it's just how it is” and ends the plotline there. And sadly all of this lacking information makes the Kancolle anime feel that it is devoid of substance and leaves many questions unanswered not only for the fans of the original game but for newcomers as well.This may have not been so bad if the presentation of the show was well done (As sometimes leaving the audience to their imaginations can be entertaining) but the show simply isn’t. It starts off with the inexperienced girl Fubuki who joins a naval base and slowly pushes herself to become better and be accepted as a regular fleet girl. She makes comrades, goes through training montages, and becomes one of the top fleet girls through hard work and determination. Sound familiar already? It should be as this type of story has been done an exuberant amount times before in anime (especially shounen) and any other type of media really. The plot and script follows a terribly formulaic procedure that is it almost insultingly lazy. And sadly as the episodes drag on they become more and more predictable for any anime veteran that has seen the tired recycled tropes that Kancolle constantly uses.With respect to spoilers, there is a particular early episode in the series that attempts a terrible gimmick to grab the interest of the audience (You will know when you see it). It is perhaps one of the worst written, predictable, and incredibly asinine things to have been done in anime and even the most hardcore fans are likely to be put off by it. Sadly, most of the episodes fail to improve where a chunk of the time is spent on low-tier generic dialogue, fan joke “inside” comedy memes, and then a few terrible build-up of melodrama that’s more cringey than B- movies.I do by no means hate slice of life, Kancolle just does a terrible job at it as it is filled with a main cast of girls who are uninteresting, boring, and unappealing, arguably even for the fans of the game, and the interactions they have with one another are incredibly bland. When the girls aren’t spouting lines from the online game, they are droning on endlessly about the food they just ate, how nice looking someone’s room is, or regurgitating repeatedly and unnecessarily about the mission they are undertaking. The writing feels as though the script maker and director wanted to waste time and fulfill their 20-minute-a-episode quota rather than try to make enjoyable interactions. The main cast is dull, the side characters are dull, the script is dull, and the anime constantly reuses the same jokes over and over again as cumbersome service to the game fans. The sad part is that the anime should be a platform to better develop the girls from the game and give a wider outlook to the depth of characters, but you would find more characterization and details in to personalities looking at a fleet girl’s Wikipedia page than the entirety of this anime.In regards to other production values, the battles are all done in CGI which for the most part look fairly fine and is actually done well, at least when you can ignore the awkward looking faces and the strangely placed transition between drawn scenes and CGI that happen from time to time. When the girls are fighting the CGI is acceptable, but tends to look horrible when the girls are talking and out of the battle transitions. Those who detest CGI in their anime best stay away. While the first few episodes are interesting to see exactly how the water-skating fleet girls fight, especially the first episode that shows a beautiful amount of details and work, the future battles are sadly not the same. Do not be misled by the first episode’s battle; past the opening episode the battles become mundane with generic looking enemies and lazily-made shooting sequences that fail to make full potential naval warfare can have.The art itself is mediocre at best and fans may notice a rather drop in quality of their favorite girls (Which may not be entirely blamed on the production company as the online game pictures use various different pixiv artists). There is a number of musical scores within the anime that are soundly produced and pleasing to the ears, and some of the pieces do well to convey the emotions of a scene where the bad script of Kancolle fail. There is a plethora of good voice actors like Nao Touyama and Yuka Iguchi as those who are familiar with the game may know. Unfortunately, the musical ensemble and voices are the best praise this show can receive.Overall, Kantai Collection is everything that is to be expected for good or bad. It's a below average generic show with mediocre writing mostly due to the fact that the producers and director of the show have to cater to an existing fanbas. It is a show that refuses, or is forced not to break out of the mold for any bit of artistic integrity and originality. There are a number of definite fanservice that only the game fans may appreciate; but they are so awkwardly placed within the frame of the anime they feel asinine rather than anything clever and certainly fail to aid new people to the franchise understand Kancolle. With gimmicky writing and no sound source to draw from besides the game which already lacks information on the setting, Kantai Collection simply cannot pass that line to be exceptional or anything ground breaking. It's not a show that I could recommend to someone who isn't a fan of the game or for those that have already watched a lot of anime and can easily predict how the show will proceed. For those who are fans I can only say keep your standards low and expect the expected. artistic liberties were likely to be protracted for a generic anime. Unfortunately, generic is exactly what Kantai Collection is and even as an original fan of the game who went in with little expectations I felt disappointed.For those unfamiliar with the series, Kantai Collection (Or Kancolle short) is an online game about ship girls that take their designs based on World War 2 Japanese naval war vessels. Destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, you name it. Heavily reliant on moe and the popular concept of girls with war machines (Like Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer), it has become arguably the most popular game in Japan and even parts of Asia not only for otakus but for the casual people as well. The girls fight monstrous demons that rise from the ocean... And well, that's about it for the plot and setting. Not much information on the world is really given and the different sources like the manga and light novels are not official.This is perhaps the biggest problem with the Kancolle anime. Perhaps in order to stay faithful to the game, no real world exploration, setting, or story is set in place. It isn't exaggeration to say the plot of Kancolle is literally just naval fleet girls fighting against monsters with added slice of life in the mix. There is no explanation for how the girls “inherit” the souls of World War 2 ships, no exposition on the current state of the world, no details on what humanity is doing and why they have to rely on the girls, no details on how the Abyssals work. The show blatantly just puts out “it's just how it is” and ends the plotline there. And sadly all of this lacking information makes the Kancolle anime feel that it is devoid of substance and leaves many questions unanswered not only for the fans of the original game but for newcomers as well.This may have not been so bad if the presentation of the show was well done (As sometimes leaving the audience to their imaginations can be entertaining) but the show simply isn’t. It starts off with the inexperienced girl Fubuki who joins a naval base and slowly pushes herself to become better and be accepted as a regular fleet girl. She makes comrades, goes through training montages, and becomes one of the top fleet girls through hard work and determination. Sound familiar already? It should be as this type of story has been done an exuberant amount times before in anime (especially shounen) and any other type of media really. The plot and script follows a terribly formulaic procedure that is it almost insultingly lazy. And sadly as the episodes drag on they become more and more predictable for any anime veteran that has seen the tired recycled tropes that Kancolle constantly uses.With respect to spoilers, there is a particular early episode in the series that attempts a terrible gimmick to grab the interest of the audience (You will know when you see it). It is perhaps one of the worst written, predictable, and incredibly asinine things to have been done in anime and even the most hardcore fans are likely to be put off by it. Sadly, most of the episodes fail to improve where a chunk of the time is spent on low-tier generic dialogue, fan joke “inside” comedy memes, and then a few terrible build-up of melodrama that’s more cringey than B- movies.I do by no means hate slice of life, Kancolle just does a terrible job at it as it is filled with a main cast of girls who are uninteresting, boring, and unappealing, arguably even for the fans of the game, and the interactions they have with one another are incredibly bland. When the girls aren’t spouting lines from the online game, they are droning on endlessly about the food they just ate, how nice looking someone’s room is, or regurgitating repeatedly and unnecessarily about the mission they are undertaking. The writing feels as though the script maker and director wanted to waste time and fulfill their 20-minute-a-episode quota rather than try to make enjoyable interactions. The main cast is dull, the side characters are dull, the script is dull, and the anime constantly reuses the same jokes over and over again as cumbersome service to the game fans. The sad part is that the anime should be a platform to better develop the girls from the game and give a wider outlook to the depth of characters, but you would find more characterization and details in to personalities looking at a fleet girl’s Wikipedia page than the entirety of this anime.In regards to other production values, the battles are all done in CGI which for the most part look fairly fine and is actually done well, at least when you can ignore the awkward looking faces and the strangely placed transition between drawn scenes and CGI that happen from time to time.

Oh yeah I have a review to do for Winter 2015.STORY (4):KanColle is based on a game adaptation by Kadokawa Games. KanColle is about a group of girls who have the spirit of battleships are on a mission to protect humanity form the abyssal fleet. I mean why can\'t you call it any other name rather than the generic abyssal fleet?In fact, just like Glasslip. I can understand why people didn\'t like the anime.The story has so many events going on that I barely keep track on anything. I know the concept about the WWII ships are interesting but...come on, please focus on one plot alone. The only later episodes then we see the climactic showdown between the abyssal fleet. The rest of the episodes are the girls do their own thing. Just like Glasslip where characters just do their own thing without any consequence. I thought that if there is conflict in this anime, I thought that could work.The concept is interesting however, they fail to expand that idea beyond. They just play the easy way out by throwing in random events like the curry contest. They never explore how curry contest is part of their training programme in order to defeat the abyssal fleet.ART (3):The animation is dull. I was like watching a nearly dim show.SOUND (5):The opening and ending are nothing special.CHARACTER (4):The characters suffer from ""Basic Economics"". When I say that, I mean there are too many characters. Although I did like their determination, this anime introduces too many characters that I lost track on what I saw. Nobody is special if too many people are special.In Economics, if there is more supply of something, the demand is less. Just like in KanColle, if there are too many characters, the value of the character development diminishes. Some anime suffered from the same problem as the characters from KanColle like for example Brothers Conflict, Kamigami no Asobi & Strike the Blood.Not to mention the characters design, they were barely discrete.I barely see the abyssal fleet. They only appear on the later episodes.CONCLUSION (4):As I have said, if the story and characters have better execution, I thought this anime would be entertaining. However, this anime throws in too many characters, that the enjoyment level decreases. You might say ""Oh! You don\'t like cute girls"". Not true, I like cute girls. However, if you throw in too many characters, the character value will diminish. I am serious when I say this.Diomedea took the script, shredded it up, put it in the shotgun, add a lot of characters inside it and shot it at the wall. Then we are asked to connect the dots.This anime has few good moments, however those good moments are weighed down by the problems of this show. So sadly I have to give this anime a 4 out of 10. If you want better experience, just play the games.Thank you, Winter 2015 for giving me another wonderful anime to review.

After reviewing this anime, I will be like ""What was that anime again?""', ""Hooray! Kantai is finally over, and damn it is getting a second season! So here is a bird to Diomedea and DMM, for continuing to cash cow this work. Anyway a review on the show, Kantai is a cashgrab, made by money hungry fags for its fan base. It is not a anime you would watch unless you are a fan (or a moe zombie, in which case a bird to you too).Flame bait aside, time to get serious. There are two results when one adapt a game into an anime, one is when you create a watchable show by actually adapting, the other is...when you create garbage by tossing in a bunch of references to the game. Here is the thing, most of the people who watch the show is not going to play the fricking game, when you make an anime you should be trying to appeal to the faction that isn't already in the fan-base. But who am I kidding, most anime writers are idiots anyway.story - 3Ship Waifu wacky hijink, some people say it is something about girls being reincarnation of ships and etc. But don't be fooled, it is ship Waifu wacky hijinks. I don't care how many references you make to WWII, or how accurate some of the details are, it is all dressing, if the meat of the show is wacky hijinks with ship waifu, then the details means nothing. It is all just fanservice for military otakus, and boring details for anyone who isn't a military otaku.The show try to have a couple serious moment, but let's be honest here, I'm not going to care that a cardboard cut out was sunk. You don't take the scenario serious from the start, neither will I, SHOCK FACTOR is a really cheap trick.Even the setting doesn't make much sense, but this was originally a browser game, so I'll let that pass. But I was still disappointed since I was expecting anthropomorphic ships, not girls with the souls of ships.Art - 8Jarring CG transitions during some of the combat scene, even though the cg isn't utter shit, it looks like f**king MMD so much that I question whether they really used MMD to make those scenes. Everything else was decent.Sound - 7Tracks okay, not much to say.character - 3POIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOIPOI, oh god I hate that sound. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and that is totally expected when you have so much character and so few episodes. A smart man would focus on a couple characters to flesh them out, but since Kantai exist only to rob the wallets of idiots who bought the BDs to see their ship Waifu, it shoves a bunch of them into the show. The result was that instead of characters, we have cardboard cutout with shiticks. And it gets insufferable, when you realize at the end of the day, you just want to see them all sunk, screw moe, I want a character not a bunch of cardboards.Overall - 4Some may ask, if you hate it why you watch it, the response would be, if you don't watch it you wouldn't know how to hate it and how it could have been better. Plus the major reason would be, to see how the current biggest doujin series turned out since it is a bit more popular than Touhou right now. Such a big doujin giant getting an official anime, I wanted to see how it would turn out, and god I am disappointed. When your anime is worse than your doujin manga, you know you f**ked up big time, in fact it made me doubt Kantai even deserve to have so many doujin artists, since a lot of Touhou artists jumped ship (pun intended) to try to flesh out Kantai. It is really disappointing to see that the actual people who made the thing cared so little about the show, turning it into a soulless cash-grab.We could have gotten a emotional story about anthropomorphic ships in a war, with losses and philosophy, showing the cruelty of war while referencing WWII. But instead we got, fricking cute girls doing cute things #ILostCount with ship references throw in. So once again, screw you Modern Anime, this is why we can't have good things. when you create garbage by tossing in a bunch of references to the game.

So once again, screw you Modern Anime, this is why we can't have good things."", ""TL;DR: At face value, it's a cute girls doing cute things show that combines Japanese otaku's two favourite fetishes: high school girls & military hardware. However, as the series progresses, it seems that Kancolle is not only meant as harmless fetish porn, but is in fact an attempt to deal with Japan's demons over their defeat in World War Two by having cute girls dress up as boats & literally blowing those demons up. For all its ham-fisted handling of the subject matter, it's good for a laugh, albeit in a “if you can't laugh, what can you do?” kind of way.Anyone who follows international...news may have seen Japan put its foot in it, so to speak, when it comes to its approach to remembering World War Two. Be it angering South Korea when government figures call for the retraction of Japan's recognition of “comfort women” as being sex slaves, or Prime Minister Abe angering everyone when he very publicly paid his respects at Yakasumi shrine, it seems that Japan, or at least a sizeable proportion of its population, continues to struggle with how to conceptualise & remember this period in history, or how the echoes of it continue to reverberate in South-East Asian & world politics today.This might seem an odd way to start a review of Kancolle (not to mention being simplistic to the point of offensive), an adaptation of a popular pay2win game where cute girls dress up as warships from the Imperial Japanese Navy to fight demons. Well, strictly speaking they posses the spirits of said warships, but it amounts to the same thing. Our protagonist, Fubuki, is the new girl at the all girls scho...navel base where they train to fight the mysterious demons from across the seas. As you'd expect, Fubuki is high on determination & resolve but low on talent or skill, the bulk of the series being about her gradual rise from being barely able to float to becoming the most important battle boat in the babefleet. In addition to her, we have a vast ensemble of other girls whose one dimensional character types loosely match with the ships they represent (the pirate lolis are destroyers, the elegant seniors are carriers etc etc). Much like Girlfriend BETA, the cast is so large that really you can't even try to remember who they all are, or why what they're doing is supposed to matter. (note that from this point things will be discussed that may be considered spoilers)A lot of Kancolle looks & feels cobbled together from other cute girls shows. There are girls who make animal noises because moe. There's a girl with random mascot creature companions because every show has to have mascots. The bigger ship girls love eating mountains of food because otaku love busty girls with big appetites. There's a random cooking episode in the middle of the series because why wouldn't there be (no points for guessing that they cook curry). There's yuri undertones all over the place & Fubuki has a serious “notice me, senpai” girl crush on fleet carrier Akagi because of course she does. Even the more serious sides to Kancolle feel like they're just going through the motions. A mentor character dies in episode three because a mentor character always dies/disappears to mark the end of Act 1, only in this case you'd only really know her to be that type of character if you know the history of the ship, since her on screen time is negligible. Even the ending, which is ultimately a we'll fight to change our fate showdown, feels like it could have been taken from almost any other action based anime out there.However, draped around all this generic storytelling & characters is something that becomes increasingly uncomfortable viewing as the show moves towards its climax. As already said, all the girls in the babefleet posses the spirit of an actual IJN warship from World War Two. Indeed, while the plot progresses in a pretty standard way, Kancolle does make an effort to ensure that when things happen to specific girls, it mirrors in some way the actual events their warship counterpart were involved in. Why is this problematic? Well once you see Kancolle as in effect a re-enactment of the Pacific War with cute girls, their demonic enemies can only been seen as the US navy (& possibly also the Royal navy, though less explicitly). Indeed, the final battle is an unapologetic re-imagining of the Battle of Midway, complete with a demon carrier that is easily interpreted as a stand in for the USS Yorktown, where the Japanese win. It's made even more questionable by the preceding event having been a surprise attack by the demons on their main navel base, as though it's not enough to imagine winning at Midway but they had to be the victims of Pearl Harbour too.If this had been a German movie re-imagining the Battle of Stalingrad as a glorious Nazi victory, or an American one re-imagining Gettysburg as a heroic victory for the Confederacy, one might imagine it would piss people off a bit. Yes, you can say it's only fiction, & Kancolle is certainly making sure to look as fantasy as possible. But the moment you combine fiction with real events you are in effect expressing a view on those events, & Kancolle's seems to be that its audience should not only be proud of their wartime military but in fact celebrate the military aggression it was involved in, presenting the whole thing as in fact a defensive war against a demonic foreign power that couldn't be reasoned or negotiated with.When looked at in it's current day context, Kancolle ties in with both pressure from the Japanese right on the government (including from some of its own members) to revise what they see as a defeatist & emasculating view of Japan's wartime past & the increasingly bellicose calls for re-militarisation of the Japanese armed forces, including the right to expand the Japanese navy, under the mantra of “collective self-defence.” Yes, you can say it's just a niche late night fanservice anime that hardly anyone watches & seeing it as anything more is just over thinking, but I disagree. For one, cultural products are not created in a vacuum, & at the very least Kancolle depicts the views the creators &, one assumes, their target audience hold. There are no neutral observers of history & Kancolle choosing to depict its version of history in the way that it does is no accident. It might hide its ideas behind more obvious fan service, but they're still there & they're clearly not meant to be ignored by the audience, even though you can always choose to do so.On the subject of fan service, Kancolle is, as you'd probably expect, riddled with it (I'm aware this is a rather awkward tonal shift, from discussing history to boob grabs, but bare with me). When I first heard of Kancolle, I thought it would be more like Girlz und Panzer, in that it would be about actual warships crewed by high school girls. The reality is something much more laughable, as the girls instead transform into weaponised versions of themselves Nobunagun style. I don't know why it was considered good character design, but what this amounts to is girls in high school uniforms, on jet skis, with scale model parts of their ship class stuck to their clothes. It does work to a degree with the carriers, which are depicted as archers whose arrows turn into aircraft upon firing, but for all the others it just looks stupid. Of course, it allows for the girls to strike lots of cliché & titillating body poses while firing, so I guess if your fetish is girls wearing bits of boat, it's got you covered.It's ultimate form of fan service, however, comes in the shape of the mysterious admiral. In case you were wondering if there are any male characters in Kancolle, there is one. You never see more than his shadow, but he is always there, always with the right plan for victory. All the girls worship him & Fubuki outright loves him, with one out of nowhere dream sequence involving her in a white dress, confessing while looking straight into the camera. Who is this mysterious, genius Lothario, you ask? Well that's simple: he's you*. You, the (presumed male) viewer &/or player who fantasise as is always assumed in cute girl shows that everything the cast do, they do for & because of you. You're awesome, guy watching a cartoon about 13-18 year old girls in revealing clothes, striking sexy poses while playing with phallic military hardware when they're not playing with each other. Shine on you crazy diamond. (at this point the reviewer caught his reflection in the monitor & cried)*One could also read the faceless admiral as Kancolle's way of getting around depicting Admiral Yamamoto, the actual mastermind behind the Battle of Midway & someone whose actual depiction in a otaku pandering show like Kancolle would have probably caused the producers far more of a headache than it would be worth.Kancolle, then, is a fairly standard action anime with cute girls that does manage to distinguish itself, but ultimately in all the wrong ways. Viewed purely as a TV show, stripped of all context or implication behind its subject, it's not bad but at the same time it makes it very obvious that it is doing everything it can to pander to it's intended audience to the point of obnoxiousness. In a broader context, it is an uncomfortable example of Japan's continued struggle to come to terms with it's role in World War Two or how that role continues to shape the opinions of Japan held by other countries. Hayao Miyazaki said of making “The Wind Rises” that he felt torn between viewing Japan's military aggression as having been foolish but taking pride in the Zero as a machine & the bravery of the pilots that flew it. Kancolle lacks such a conflicted view, & either by intention or an accidental by-product of poor writing presents a counter-factual version of history where Japan was both victim & victor. It'll take more than a wide eyed girl in a short skirt to make me agree with that. news may have seen Japan put its foot in it, so to speak, when it comes to its approach to remembering World War Two. Be it angering South Korea when government figures call for the retraction of Japan's recognition of “comfort women” as being sex slaves, or Prime Minister Abe angering everyone when he very publicly paid his respects at Yakasumi shrine, it seems that Japan, or at least a sizeable proportion of its population, continues to struggle with how to conceptualise & remember this period in history, or how the echoes of it continue to reverberate in South-East Asian & world politics today.This might seem an odd way to start a review of Kancolle (not to mention being simplistic to the point of offensive), an adaptation of a popular pay2win game where cute girls dress up as warships from the Imperial Japanese Navy to fight demons.

It's made even more questionable by the preceding event having been a surprise attack by the demons on their main navel base, as though it's not enough to imagine winning at Midway but they had to be the victims of Pearl Harbour too.If this had been a German movie re-imagining the Battle of Stalingrad as a glorious Nazi victory, or an American one re-imagining Gettysburg as a heroic victory for the Confederacy, one might imagine it would piss people off a bit. Yes, you can say it's only fiction, & Kancolle is certainly making sure to look as fantasy as possible. But the moment you combine fiction with real events you are in effect expressing a view on those events, & Kancolle's seems to be that its audience should not only be proud of their wartime military but in fact celebrate the military aggression it was involved in, presenting the whole thing as in fact a defensive war against a demonic foreign power that couldn't be reasoned or negotiated with.When looked at in it's current day context, Kancolle ties in with both pressure from the Japanese right on the government (including from some of its own members) to revise what they see as a defeatist & emasculating view of Japan's wartime past & the increasingly bellicose calls for re-militarisation of the Japanese armed forces, including the right to expand the Japanese navy, under the mantra of “collective self-defence.” Yes, you can say it's just a niche late night fanservice anime that hardly anyone watches & seeing it as anything more is just over thinking, but I disagree. For one, cultural products are not created in a vacuum, & at the very least Kancolle depicts the views the creators &, one assumes, their target audience hold. There are no neutral observers of history & Kancolle choosing to depict its version of history in the way that it does is no accident. It might hide its ideas behind more obvious fan service, but they're still there & they're clearly not meant to be ignored by the audience, even though you can always choose to do so.On the subject of fan service, Kancolle is, as you'd probably expect, riddled with it (I'm aware this is a rather awkward tonal shift, from discussing history to boob grabs, but bare with me). When I first heard of Kancolle, I thought it would be more like Girlz und Panzer, in that it would be about actual warships crewed by high school girls. The reality is something much more laughable, as the girls instead transform into weaponised versions of themselves Nobunagun style. I don't know why it was considered good character design, but what this amounts to is girls in high school uniforms, on jet skis, with scale model parts of their ship class stuck to their clothes. It does work to a degree with the carriers, which are depicted as archers whose arrows turn into aircraft upon firing, but for all the others it just looks stupid. Of course, it allows for the girls to strike lots of cliché & titillating body poses while firing, so I guess if your fetish is girls wearing bits of boat, it's got you covered.It's ultimate form of fan service, however, comes in the shape of the mysterious admiral. In case you were wondering if there are any male characters in Kancolle, there is one. You never see more than his shadow, but he is always there, always with the right plan for victory. All the girls worship him & Fubuki outright loves him, with one out of nowhere dream sequence involving her in a white dress, confessing while looking straight into the camera. Who is this mysterious, genius Lothario, you ask? Well that's simple: he's you*. You, the (presumed male) viewer &/or player who fantasise as is always assumed in cute girl shows that everything the cast do, they do for & because of you. You're awesome, guy watching a cartoon about 13-18 year old girls in revealing clothes, striking sexy poses while playing with phallic military hardware when they're not playing with each other. Shine on you crazy diamond. (at this point the reviewer caught his reflection in the monitor & cried)*One could also read the faceless admiral as Kancolle's way of getting around depicting Admiral Yamamoto, the actual mastermind behind the Battle of Midway & someone whose actual depiction in a otaku pandering show like Kancolle would have probably caused the producers far more of a headache than it would be worth.Kancolle, then, is a fairly standard action anime with cute girls that does manage to distinguish itself, but ultimately in all the wrong ways. Viewed purely as a TV show, stripped of all context or implication behind its subject, it's not bad but at the same time it makes it very obvious that it is doing everything it can to pander to it's intended audience to the point of obnoxiousness. In a broader context, it is an uncomfortable example of Japan's continued struggle to come to terms with it's role in World War Two or how that role continues to shape the opinions of Japan held by other countries. Hayao Miyazaki said of making “The Wind Rises” that he felt torn between viewing Japan's military aggression as having been foolish but taking pride in the Zero as a machine & the bravery of the pilots that flew it. Kancolle lacks such a conflicted view, & either by intention or an accidental by-product of poor writing presents a counter-factual version of history where Japan was both victim & victor. It'll take more than a wide eyed girl in a short skirt to make me agree with that."", 'Kantai Collection or KanColle is an anime adaptation of a hit web browser game. I haven\'t played the game or seen it. But what I did see before this anime came were pictures, lots and lots of pictures of girls with guns. Not just any guns, torpedoes, missiles, cannons and what not. And of course, I was intrigued as to whether this game would ever become an anime. When the anime was announced, I put it at the top of my list since I wanted to see what awesome action we would get.The series started off good, it didn\'t give as much action as I...thought but the animation and art was splendid except for the CGI part (no one likes CGI). But still, this anime was really good and as a slice of life, military, action style anime, it does a good job.Story 7/10:Low score because there isn\'t much of a story. It\'s just girls who are ships fighting abyssals or enemy ships/girls. The whole anime surrounds Fubuki, a Destroyer ship who joins the Naval District. She makes friends, trains to become stronger and has senpai\'s she looks up to. That\'s the slice of life part. For those who think this is gonna be a dark type war with blood, gore, deaths and some psychological stuff, don\'t be mistaken. The war barely puts a dent in the happy atmosphere that surrounds the series. Yeah, they do go fighting but that\'s all there is. The effects of the battle wear off as soon as they return and live like normal girls going to class etcetera etcetera.Though near the end of the series, stuff gets a bit serious and the war takes a higher importance than the slice of life.Art 8/10:Aside from the CGI, the artwork was pretty amazing. Each and every character is awesomely designed. I\'ve seen artworks all over the internet but I think this anime did a pretty good job in the art department. I couldn\'t find a single character that I can say has a bad design. As for the abyssals, only some have a humanish figure whereas the others are just fish type things with cannons.The backgrounds are also really pleasing. So don\'t worry about the animation in this anime. But you\'ll have to make it through the battles which mostly take place with CGI   which I do not understand why they did.Sound 10/10:The opening ""Miiro""  is epic. Loved this song. Good enough to download and listen to all the time.The ending ""Fubuki"" is also good. Rarely have I seen anime having great opening and endings. The sound gets a 10/10.Character 8/10:There are different types of ship in the navy. Each having it\'s own abilities, arsenal and tasks. The same is with KanColle. Each girl has a different ship to her. Some are Destroyers, carriers, battleships etc. But they are not alone. In the Naval District, there are tons of Destroyers, carriers and other ships. Each having her own duty. Some are teachers, some manage the district while others study, train and go into battle.Aside from their roles as ships, they are like any other character from an anime. Just think of the girls as from a school slice of life anime. Friends, rivals, senpais and teachers. That\'s how the characters are. And each has her own unique personality to contribute to the show.Our main lead, Fubuki is a hardworking girl who doesn\'t know much at first, but trains to become stronger. Alongside her, are her friends who also take part in training and who worry for her when she gets in trouble or gets injured. Fubuki and her friends are sort of like the first years of a school.Then come the seniors. Veterans in warfare and having amazing skills, they are the senpais everyone looks up to. Of course, rivalries exist and some grudges too but not so much to spoil the warm atmosphere the Naval District has.Enjoyment 9/10:I don\'t know how can one not enjoy this series (aside from the CGI parts). You\'ve got some fillers to lighten up the mood and your average slice of life just to give this military anime a warm feeling. When the battles start, stuff gets intense, with planes flying around, cannons firing, ships sinking. But like any other slice of life anime, KanColle tends not to kill off many girls even though it is a war.The mechanics of the anime are figured out as it progresses. As I didn\'t play the game, it took some time for me to know how these girls are ships and why the rest or eat as they do.It\'s a good anime. A really good anime for this season. If you\'ve seen pics of any KanColle characters on the net, I\'m sure you would want to see this anime too and go ahead, it\'s worth it. And the best thing is that it\'s getting a sequel.

So many new characters yet to see in action.', 'Don\'t take my score rating at face value. Kancolle (the anime) is a mesh of conflicts which makes it difficult to rate, also because of its target audience.The anime, before it aired, was announced to be crafted to exhibit a slice-of-life/battle ratio of 70%/30%, and that is where the problem lies. The anime basically hands you a platter of samples from the Kancolle universe but doesn\'t quite put in the effort to ensure that each sample is well crafted and fully developed.Let us start with the slice-of-life part first. Here\'s a warning to those who don\'t play the game: You won\'t get much of it...at all. Most of the slice-of-life humour and interesting points stem from puns (like the Curry Operation) from the game and real history, to the characters\' personalities which are well-exhibited in the game. Even for people who play the game, unless you know your waifus well (i.e. you understand the Japanese lines they say), you will also not be able to catch much. The scripts have the game\'s lines well weaved in in most parts, and almost every other line you hear will be either an exact or slightly modified line from the game. To fans, this is probably the most appealing part, because it brings out the personalities of each shipgirl and makes them come alive. Some people might dislike the overuse of in-game lines, but I\'d say it\'s most of the time done quite appropriately, and is likely the best way to show the character\'s personality that we\'re familiar with.Bonuses are included as well. ""Unexpected"" character behaviours like Nagato (aka Nagamon) and Zui-Kaga are included too, which are based off the fanfics. Good effort! Apart from that, the slice-of-life plot, is typical: entertaining, relaxing, and nothing much happens. Well done!The battle scenes are on the whole not too bad, apart from the awkward CGI here and there (and my friend spotted a single frame render error as well). Problem is, it\'s split as well. About half the battles, mostly at the beginning of the anime, are pretty exciting and nice to watch (they feature the fairies in the planes too!), but then after that it falls stale towards the later part of the anime. By the time you get to the end, it\'s really nothing new, apart from just more and more ships getting involved and starts to feel cheesy. The battle scenes are the part of the anime which doesn\'t really require you to know the game since the game battles are not very similar, but it doesn\'t impress both audiences, which is a shame.Drama in the show is also very awkward. There are some heartfelt scenes, and I must say I thought the anime (hint of a very slight spoiler here) was going to build up nicely from about ep 3 and ep 4, but it doesn\'t. The drama doesn\'t flow from one episode to another well, if any at all. While that\'s not a problem for slice-of-life, the writers decided to (try to) inject lots of seriousness in certain places, and because it just fizzles out by the next episode without a hint to its previous existence, the whole thing feels contrived.Character development is practically zilch, except for the main character, Fubuki, who gets a bit. But I can understand that because it wants to stay true to the game, the characters can\'t change much. Also, some personalities (like Kongou) are based off the history of the ship itself, and so can\'t be changed much. With such a wide cast of characters, you\'d be hard pressed to find enough time (for the slice-of-life segments) or impact (for battle and drama scenes) to develop any character in particular.So on the whole, the anime is just very awkward because all the elements cancel each other out. You get heavy scenes of drama and battles only to be totally forgotten by light-hearted ones later as though none of that happened. They are not particularly well executed either.OP and ED of the anime is great, and I think, if it was more focused on battles, these songs would fit it very well.To conclude, you\'d have to be in to this show for the characters to enjoy it, I\'d say, and thus, you\'d need to know the characters WELL either by seeing lots of fanfic or playing the game (or both!), otherwise the good parts will just fly past you leaving you with only the bad parts, which is likely why there\'s a whole lot of people bashing the show. Please be aware of that if you\'re taking up this series!PS: I gave it a 7/10 because the 70% slice-of-life part was basically done right. at all.

Paper-thin plot, cardboard cut-out characters, and dialogue that made me cringe with embarrassment at what I was listening to. The game at least has the possibility of death which brings a weird quasi-darkness to it considering your cute ""waifu"" can end up at the bottom of the sea. Besides 2 supporting girls sinking so far, we\'ve had nothing but predictable battles with hilariously bad CG effects, and SoL in-betweens with moe forced on...you so hard it kills the atmosphere and makes you wonder if there\'s actually a war going on. I know it\'s fucking moe yadda-yadda and is adapting the browser game to milk the fanbase even more with cuteness but sorry, knowing that DOES NOT excuse this show from being a bland and cliche\' as fuck mess. SW and GuP share some of the same problems, but they\'re a bit more subdued and certainly smarter in the way they are handled so I like them quite a bit. I probably wouldn\'t be as mad if I wasn\'t greeted every episode with OP and ED sequences that try so god damn hard to be Epic. They could really add some meaningful drama if the girls had to cope with the fact that they couldn\'t escape the fates of their past namesakes... but no, we all know Fubuki is going save the day with friendship, break all the laws with love, and change history with compassion... This show had promise in the beginning to not just be another cliche\' moe wank machine, but that is exactly what it turned into. It saddens me greatly to know that this kind of crap will almost certainly get a second season, wheras other more thought provoking shows, and even better moe shows, will fall to the wayside. I guess that\'s the anime world we live... it may be fruitless to try and fight it, but god dammit if I can save one other human soul from watching this junk then that\'s what I\'ll do. I won\'t be a mindless zombie attaching myself to this just because of the moe, hype, or bandwagon.

How does it feel to be sucked in a world with moe anthropomorphic boat characters doing boat stuff? Well, I hope you managed to enjoy yourself watching the anime. However, there have been mixed opinions about this anime throughout and after its airing. Although many, whether they played the game or not, have actually enjoyed the anime, others are disappointed over the story’s direction. Indeed, there are a number of flaws in the story which I feel that need to be addressed.Fubuki is the protagonist of the anime who...brought herself to the naval district. There was not any clear goal she had until she tried out her first battle with her fleet that she wanted to be stronger and be with Akagi’s fleet. Yes, this is all in the first episode of KanColle. From then on, we see not only the progress of Fubuki’s goal but as well as a ton of ships interacting one another and living their normal lives in the naval district. But danger looms in these girls’ eyes and they have to face their worst.Firstly, I feel that this anime is unfortunately not geared towards a group of audience who do not play the game. The anime contained humour mostly known for those who played game and knew more about the ships through many sources, whether official or not. To be honest, having watched the anime, I learnt a lot of such humour, and I was amazed by how the fans reacted to them through Twitter. I do not know if many who never played the game will understand the humour, but I think they will just pass it off. Speaking of humour, most of the time they are funny and cute. At least you are given some moe time in the anime.The major problem of the anime is the lack of setting details. I know that there are two sides fighting each other, the Kanmusu and the Abyssal, but what are they fighting for? Land? Resources? What are Abyssal? The story basically lacked about what the girls are fighting against. Also, the timeline can be confusing. I think that the timeline is based on a modern year, however the fighting between the two sides are loosely based on the sea battles during World War II, which the Imperial Japanese Navy fought against the United States Navy. I really hoped the writers can expand this whole event in detail so it can be a lot more understanding. The anime has a lot of potential throughout then which blew all away.Inconsistent pacing can be another problem in the story. Many complained for rushed scenes, especially towards the ending. Sometimes the battles felt rushed because something terrible happened, and things need to be taken cared of. Also, I do not really like how the composition plays within the story. At one moment, you see girls having a lot of fun, then later enemies fly past and a few them might have gotten themselves in trouble. The mood gets ruined and there is just too much emotions running at once.Many have tried predicting the story through major events in World War II, however the writers pretty much ‘baited’ a lot of people into seeing who dies in the anime. Many passed it off as a one-time thing, but another bunch think otherwise. Anyway, the whole World War II was just a loose adaptation. Strategic plans in the anime are okay, although the faults lie on the ships’ decision.Adaptation-wise, I would say it did not work out well. However because of the limitations the game has, it cannot be helped but to break them. It’s not really a big issue but it can certainly be frustrating for some people who watched the anime and tries the game afterwards only to know that they can’t do certain functions.You should know that Kantai Collection has a massive collection of ships that takes their names and abilities from past-time Japanese warships. Hence, the anime has a very huge cast of ships. Apart from Fubuki, there are focal characters as well from episode to episode. Of course, with a large cast, this means it is hard to know all the ships, especially for people who never played the game yet. I know most of them, which is a relief.Fubuki, being the protagonist of the story, has a nice steady character development that managed to get the goal she wanted. Throughout her stay in the naval district, she learns a lot from various ships who support her into becoming strong. Despite being moody at times, as well as saving whoever’s life on stake and getting herself in trouble instead, I think she is a nice character to watch. Indeed, she has grown stronger from start to end.Not much character development I see in all ships but Fubuki. Some of them drive Fubuki’s development, while the rest are just for the character interactions. I feel that some of the characters should have a more detailed background story which probably make the story more interesting. Also, there are a very few characters that just show up for something without any depth.I have to be honest here but I really do not like the admiral (many fans call him teitoku) in this anime. He does not get a physical appearance and also his actions are just merely bad or confusing. It is just bland.Being one of four Diomedea’s anime that aired this season, budget can be a main concern. But looking at this anime, I must say that I am impressed by how it looks as compared to its other anime. But this does not mean the animation is outstanding. As per normal, there are nice sceneries to look at. I like to see how the sceneries matches the mood of the scenes, for example during most of the battles, there is a stormy atmosphere on top. The character designs follow mostly as how it looked like in the game, since the game have different designers working on different cards, at least this anime is standard. It is cool how they don their own equipments, although one can complain these equipments are too heavy for a girl.The action scenes are awesome to look at. A lot of CGI is used in many action scenes and I think it is great since it gives the animations nice and smooth. However there are times when CGI should not be used, such as interactions of characters during battles. I like the visual effects that they made as well.I really love the opening and ending songs a lot and they are one of my favourite songs of this season. AKINO came back after AmaBuri’s Extra Magic Hour with Miiro, a very energetic song which is great to rock at. A newcomer, Nishizawa Shiena, performs Fubuki which I find it really emotional to hear. At first I was not fond by hearing it but after a while, it just clicks to me. I shall be expecting more of her voice in the future!The background music is okay, not too outstanding as well. I like some of the battle tracks that makes the battles more interesting to hear. Basically the background music has a wide variety of tracks from battle music, to slice of life music, to emotional music. Finally, I really want to give praise to all the voice actresses, especially Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao, for voicing a lot of roles in the anime. The voice actress roles in the anime are as identical as the game, so there should not be any worry.So, did Kantai Collection live up to my expectations? Not really, but I’m just disappointed with the story as I wish it can get better at some point. Meaningless to say, I also enjoyed most of the anime, mostly being comedy and cute ships doing cute things. I have also been shipping quite a number of ships lately, and I know Ooi and Kitakami is one of the best shippings ever.A sequel was announced after the final episode ended, and I’m not surprised to see that. It’s obvious that Diomedea and Kadokawa wants to milk more money from us viewers. I really hope the sequel gets better. And certainly, with this season, there can just be more KanColle players in the game, so I really hope they are enjoying themselves. brought herself to the naval district. There was not any clear goal she had until she tried out her first battle with her fleet that she wanted to be stronger and be with Akagi’s fleet. Yes, this is all in the first episode of KanColle.

But danger looms in these girls’ eyes and they have to face their worst.Firstly, I feel that this anime is unfortunately not geared towards a group of audience who do not play the game. The anime contained humour mostly known for those who played game and knew more about the ships through many sources, whether official or not. To be honest, having watched the anime, I learnt a lot of such humour, and I was amazed by how the fans reacted to them through Twitter. I do not know if many who never played the game will understand the humour, but I think they will just pass it off. Speaking of humour, most of the time they are funny and cute. At least you are given some moe time in the anime.The major problem of the anime is the lack of setting details. I know that there are two sides fighting each other, the Kanmusu and the Abyssal, but what are they fighting for? Land? Resources? What are Abyssal? The story basically lacked about what the girls are fighting against. Also, the timeline can be confusing. I think that the timeline is based on a modern year, however the fighting between the two sides are loosely based on the sea battles during World War II, which the Imperial Japanese Navy fought against the United States Navy. I really hoped the writers can expand this whole event in detail so it can be a lot more understanding. The anime has a lot of potential throughout then which blew all away.Inconsistent pacing can be another problem in the story. Many complained for rushed scenes, especially towards the ending. Sometimes the battles felt rushed because something terrible happened, and things need to be taken cared of. Also, I do not really like how the composition plays within the story. At one moment, you see girls having a lot of fun, then later enemies fly past and a few them might have gotten themselves in trouble. The mood gets ruined and there is just too much emotions running at once.Many have tried predicting the story through major events in World War II, however the writers pretty much ‘baited’ a lot of people into seeing who dies in the anime. Many passed it off as a one-time thing, but another bunch think otherwise. Anyway, the whole World War II was just a loose adaptation. Strategic plans in the anime are okay, although the faults lie on the ships’ decision.Adaptation-wise, I would say it did not work out well. However because of the limitations the game has, it cannot be helped but to break them. It’s not really a big issue but it can certainly be frustrating for some people who watched the anime and tries the game afterwards only to know that they can’t do certain functions.You should know that Kantai Collection has a massive collection of ships that takes their names and abilities from past-time Japanese warships. Hence, the anime has a very huge cast of ships. Apart from Fubuki, there are focal characters as well from episode to episode. Of course, with a large cast, this means it is hard to know all the ships, especially for people who never played the game yet. I know most of them, which is a relief.Fubuki, being the protagonist of the story, has a nice steady character development that managed to get the goal she wanted. Throughout her stay in the naval district, she learns a lot from various ships who support her into becoming strong. Despite being moody at times, as well as saving whoever’s life on stake and getting herself in trouble instead, I think she is a nice character to watch. Indeed, she has grown stronger from start to end.Not much character development I see in all ships but Fubuki. Some of them drive Fubuki’s development, while the rest are just for the character interactions. I feel that some of the characters should have a more detailed background story which probably make the story more interesting. Also, there are a very few characters that just show up for something without any depth.I have to be honest here but I really do not like the admiral (many fans call him teitoku) in this anime. He does not get a physical appearance and also his actions are just merely bad or confusing. It is just bland.Being one of four Diomedea’s anime that aired this season, budget can be a main concern. But looking at this anime, I must say that I am impressed by how it looks as compared to its other anime. But this does not mean the animation is outstanding. As per normal, there are nice sceneries to look at. I like to see how the sceneries matches the mood of the scenes, for example during most of the battles, there is a stormy atmosphere on top. The character designs follow mostly as how it looked like in the game, since the game have different designers working on different cards, at least this anime is standard. It is cool how they don their own equipments, although one can complain these equipments are too heavy for a girl.The action scenes are awesome to look at. A lot of CGI is used in many action scenes and I think it is great since it gives the animations nice and smooth. However there are times when CGI should not be used, such as interactions of characters during battles. I like the visual effects that they made as well.I really love the opening and ending songs a lot and they are one of my favourite songs of this season. AKINO came back after AmaBuri’s Extra Magic Hour with Miiro, a very energetic song which is great to rock at. A newcomer, Nishizawa Shiena, performs Fubuki which I find it really emotional to hear. At first I was not fond by hearing it but after a while, it just clicks to me. I shall be expecting more of her voice in the future!The background music is okay, not too outstanding as well. I like some of the battle tracks that makes the battles more interesting to hear. Basically the background music has a wide variety of tracks from battle music, to slice of life music, to emotional music. Finally, I really want to give praise to all the voice actresses, especially Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao, for voicing a lot of roles in the anime. The voice actress roles in the anime are as identical as the game, so there should not be any worry.So, did Kantai Collection live up to my expectations? Not really, but I’m just disappointed with the story as I wish it can get better at some point. Meaningless to say, I also enjoyed most of the anime, mostly being comedy and cute ships doing cute things. I have also been shipping quite a number of ships lately, and I know Ooi and Kitakami is one of the best shippings ever.A sequel was announced after the final episode ended, and I’m not surprised to see that. It’s obvious that Diomedea and Kadokawa wants to milk more money from us viewers. I really hope the sequel gets better. And certainly, with this season, there can just be more KanColle players in the game, so I really hope they are enjoying themselves.', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)In an anime like KanColle, with all of its ships, all of its ""moe,"" and all of its torpedoes, there actually exists something that the audience can relate to. And that is the idea of support. Everyone needs help, from the student looking to get tutored for the next exam to the adult wanting to learn how to use the computer. We almost can\'t get through our daily lives without someone, in some form, providing some kind of aid in our direction. And receiving such support can often times be both a rewarding and eye-opening experience.STORYKanColle...follows young Fubuki, an up-and-coming Destroyer Class ship looking to do what she can in a war that involves her, her friends, and her beloved Admiral.KanColle is a show that only anime could tackle; essentially, all of the girls from Kaga to Naka are anthropomorphized navy vessels, having turned from venerable war machines into really cute girls. While technically a ""Military"" genre anime, the show is mostly a slice-of-life offering, aiming to showcase the girls at various points in their training, lives, and careers as battle cruisers. And for the most part, the anime is able to pull this off. One tactic used to accomplish this goal is by divvying up the screen time for the majority of its cast. While Fubuki garners the most limelight, the show often times splits characters into respective groups, and even occasionally changing said groups up. In this way, the anime gives the audience the chance to watch their favorite ship do everyday things, from bathing, to eating, and even cooking. Another tactic is in the very nature of a militarized zone: each girl is relegated to specific tasks. While the majority of the girls are designed for battle -- Akagi, Kongou, and Yuudachi come to mind -- some are designed for other, more nuanced tasks. For example, Nagato is the overall leader, Yamato has her own ""hotel,"" and Hibiki is used for collection. By separating the ships into further, more specific roles, when the anime naturally transitions from one location to the next, so do the characters involved.The slice-of-life antics only make up about half of the anime; the other half moves into the aforementioned military facet. Here, the various girls actually start to be the very war vessels they actually are. It\'s at this point the show really begins to suffer. KanColle would like these battles to have any significant meaning attached to them, but sadly there isn\'t any to be had. While a wide range of girls receive attention, the amount isn\'t enough to constitute a connection deep enough to warrant their predicaments worthy of drama. Instead, it feels lacking, forced even, that the girls are placed within these situations. And such a feeling also comes from the purpose of the battles themselves; the victory never does anything. They may fight for an island or protect a strategic location, but the outcomes of the fights are always the same: win, go back to base, and wait for the next skirmish.Among the cuteness and firepower, KanColle does at least attempt to have some sort of thematic presence throughout its run. ""Attempt"" is the operative word, because the show somewhat fails at doing so. It sticks to the general and tired themes that most cute anime strive for: dealing with hardship, learning to accept others, and fighting against destiny. Nice little motifs, and certainly insights that one can take to heart, but none are looked at extremely seriously and only there for the structure of the anime. Think of the themes as a stack of paper; one piece is pulled from the stack and used to hold the show up. But since it\'s just one piece of paper, it breaks under the weight it is holding. Yet before it falls, it is held up by the next piece of paper -- the next theme -- only for the process to continue repeating indefinitely. It\'s not until the entire stack is placed underneath that the anime is prevented from falling. This interconnected support is literally just that: a theme of support. For while each individual, fun message is fine, what they all have in common is this idea of supporting one another, no matter the circumstance. And that\'s something that is not only consistent throughout the anime, but makes sense in context; whatever kind of military it is, supporting each other is the number one goal.ANIMATIONKanColle is a mixed bag when it comes to its art and its animation.The art for the show can actually be quite nice at times, but it largely depends on location. When the girls are at home base, the track field, mess hall, and dorms may not be detailed exquisitely but it still looks rather pretty. Yet, just like the move from slice-of-life to military, when the girls move onto the water, all of that art disappears. It\'s replaced with a lot of sky and ocean, with such a replacement losing any flair the show may have generated.The character designs for each of the ships are nicely done. The girls are given unique outfits depending on the character -- Yamato has her umbrella, Shimikaze has her bunny ears, and Atago has her blue pilot\'s outfit, to name a few. Furthermore, they each have their own, specialized weaponry to go along with their persons. Depending on the class and the size of the girl, their cannons match accordingly.When it comes to actual animation, it\'s a bit of a toss-up. When the girls are on their missions, the use of CG isn\'t too jarring, but the use of their weapons and the maneuvers they pull off aren\'t anything extraneous. It\'s usually them standing still, one arm out, and a bunch of smoke that covers the screen. When they\'re not out on the water, their casual conversations and simple motions are still of the same complexity; quite average.CHARACTERSKanColle contains quite the large cast. The majority of the characters don\'t see significant progress, but here it\'s prudent to take a look at three of the most important from the show: Fubuki, Yamato, and Mutsuki.Taking the lead, Fubuki is the average main character. She\'s kind and intelligent, but it\'s obvious that her skills are far lower than the others in the troupe. She struggles and fights to earn her place among their ranks, wanting to prove to herself and to everyone that she is capable of being the Destroyer that she is. This drive, this incessant need to be more than she is, is what the Admiral sees in her that the rest cannot. It\'s not so much that she has the largest guns, or can fire the biggest torpedoes, or has the greatest accuracy. What she provides is something intangible, something that not a lot of people immediately have. And that\'s courage. The courage to train from morning to night without rest. The courage to face your faults, to fix your mistakes. The courage to take a chance rather than holding back. And in this way, her fortitude gives her not only the ability to lead those around her but also support the very ships she calls friends. So while she may be the stereotypical hero, her exemplification of the underlying theme of the anime marks her as at least being slightly more than generic.In a stranger position is Yamato. Her enormous firepower makes her the fleet\'s secret weapon. But because of this, she\'s kept hidden away, unused in battle and forced to toil on an island that rarely gets visitors. She feels both lonely and worthless for these reasons, which, in a rather interesting way, makes her Fubuki\'s previous self. For Fubuki was in the exact same position; on the outside looking in and not being able to work with the girls she had come to respect. And so Yamato learns from Fubuki. She sees her determination, drive, and dedication at doing whatever it takes to fix the situation at hand. This instills in Yamato her own sense of purpose; that while she may be constrained to a more unique role, that doesn\'t mean she isn\'t valuable in some form. Thus Yamato gains her own kind of courage, showing up when the going got tough and proving to the girls and to the audience that everyone has a purpose.Perhaps the strangest of the ships, though, is Mutsuki. She\'s overtly sweet, always shouting niceties and aiding the friends around her. What\'s interesting is that she is rarely seen in battle; she makes a few appearances, but her prominence is her location outside of it. And that is usually in a flower field, near a shrine, or at the pier, where she is most often found believing in the aptitude of the ships at sea. She\'s not particularly noteworthy for her battle prowess, nor is she famous for being one of the cuter girls. In a way, she acts the most human, praying, wishing, and wanting the girls to perform to the best of their abilities, cheering from the sidelines rather than being the very vessel she is known to be. She experiences difficult times -- the loss of the girl she looks up to -- which tests her will, but, in true Fubuki fashion, Fubuki gives Mutsuki the courage necessary to continue believing in the ships around her. For nobody goes through life without problems, thus making how you deal with those issues to be the most important lesson.SOUNDThe OP contains quite the strong singer, whose vocal power carries the entire track from start to finish. The hard guitar and drum beat work nicely in unison, and help to support the vocalist throughout. The lyrics and tune can be catchy at certain points, though it is still an overall alright piece.Once again, the singer takes center stage in the ED. Although here, it features something weird: fast, catchy lyrics. The song is at first not that good of a listen, but after hearing it a few times, one gets used to the guitar, chimes, and quick singing, making the piece the stronger of the two.The soundtrack often fits the mood for the show, depending on whether it is partaking in the slice-of-life or military genres it falls under. The former usually uses piano and violins for those everyday sounds, and a single-drum for that training feel. The military aspects, in contrast, incorporate orchestral music for a more resounding vibe. Trumpets and violins work overtime during these scenarios, making the fights gain a heightened feeling of importance. Also of note are the cannon, gunfire, and ocean sound effects that give the battles further realism.As for voice acting, those involved give above-average performances. Special shout-outs are in order for Ayane Sakura for voicing what seems to be half of the cast and Yuni Tanibe for her signature ""Poi!""ENJOYMENTWhen it comes to anime, I\'m a fan of cuteness. And while not all of the girls were fun to watch on screen, some were quite entertaining to see. My favorites from the show were Yamato and Nagato for their attractiveness, while Oochi and Kitakami\'s relationship nearly always got me to laugh or smile. On the other hand, though, I despised Mutsuki. Just the combination of her voice and her extreme sweetness had me wanting her to leave the screen as quickly as she appeared.That\'s pretty much it in terms of enjoyment. The rest of the girls are alright, and there can be some cute moments here and there, but there is nothing entirely memorable. The actual battles, watching the girls at sea fighting against the enemy, were where the anime really began to lag. Instead of seeing the ""cute girls being cute,"" I was instead treated to warfare that wasn\'t all that impressive or fun to watch. A lot of screaming, a lot of explosions, but zero adorableness.As an anime, KanColle does what it set out to do. Its average story and characters are backed by a good amount of cuteness and some interesting sound work, making the whole package an alright experience. At the end of the day, though, there isn\'t much more to it than that.SUMMARYStory: Fine, interesting slice-of-life, meaningless battles, and individually weak yet collectively strong themesAnimation: Fine, mix of good and bad art, nice character designs, average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Fubuki is good, Yamato and Mutsuki are okay, with the rest not seeing significant progressSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice sound effects, above-average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, some of the girls are fun to watch, some are not, with the actual ship aspect being rather boringFinal Score: 5/10 follows young Fubuki, an up-and-coming Destroyer Class ship looking to do what she can in a war that involves her, her friends, and her beloved Admiral.KanColle is a show that only anime could tackle; essentially, all of the girls from Kaga to Naka are anthropomorphized navy vessels, having turned from venerable war machines into really cute girls.

A series based on a browser game with cute fleet girls doing badass things? Or perhaps a series about military warfare with a taste of delicious curry? Regardless of how Kantai Collection should be, the series should be viewed forefront about fleet girls. In essence, Kantai Collection crafts its premise based on a set of characters in a fictional world with historical references. But unfortunately, this show runs like an engine with crude oil and it’s not very impressive to say the least.It’s not always easy to adapt an anime based off a game. There are...certain set of principles to follow and not everyone will usually be satisfied to get what they want. Luckily, Kantai Collection is pretty straightforward with a rather non-linear storyline. That’s right. The series may seem complicated with all these characters but the story itself is fairly simple. We follow the footsteps of Fubuki as she enlists herself as a naval destroyer at a naval base. With limited combat experience, she is assigned to the Third Torpedo Squadron. We also quickly learn that the series details events related to warfare pitting the fleet girls against a mysterious enemy known as the “Abyss”. Taken for granted, the series should feel less refreshing but more so to adapt with what it has to offer. Any fan of military fiction may feel at home with this premise.But to start from the beginning, one should realize that the original source is a browser game made by developed by Kadokawa Games and hosted at DMM. With fairly simple gameplay mechanics and appeal, the series quickly gained popularity that now has over 2 million registered accounts in Japan. In fact, numerous adaptations of the game has been spawned that includes light novels, manga, and of course anime. So starting from here, one could say that taking on the footsteps of Fubuki is like becoming a new kid at school. The first day isn’t easy as we quickly find out that she lacks military experience. This is evidenced by her lack of ability to glide on water as a fleet girl. Fortunately enough, she receives plenty of support from her friends and in no time becomes accustomed to fighting. The first few episodes show the general premise and style of the show. We are introduced to prominent characters such as Fubuki’s friends – Mutsuki and Yudachi. Then, there are others from various squads including Kongou, Yayoi, Akatsuki with her Sixth Destroyer Division, Shimakaze, Akagi, Kaga, Nagato, among others. Then, there’s also the mysterious admiral who operates behind the scenes to direct these girls to fight in war. Director Keizo Kusakawa puts his skills at work and to say the least, his resume doesn’t look too impressive in terms of content. His most recent work includes directing another series from the Winter Season (Unlimited Fafnir) also with fictional war-like themes. The funny thing is that both of these shows are made of up a large female cast while his previous involvement follows a similar pattern.War itself can be a hard word to swallow. What that means is that pain and death is inevitable. Kantai Collection is no exception when it comes to fleet girls being destroyed. Earlier on in the show, one of them is lost against the Abyss that strikes a painful scar in Fubuki’s heart as she realizes the grim reality. And this shouldn’t be a surprise either given the historical content. Anyone who is knowledgeable about historical reference should already be familiar with the context of the show and the ships. After all, the fleet girls are based off of these ships such as destroyers, carriers, battleships, light and heavy cruisers. In retrospect, Kantai Collection crafts elements of surprises on occasions when we realize that not everyone will survive the war for newer fans.A show like this also has an over-sized cast. It’s noticeable that not everyone will get enough screen time. However, the show does present a lot of chemistry with the characters. The key word perhaps here is personality because every character in the show has one.  None of them behave like robots as part of some army. In fact, there are even feuds that builds up from little quirks with certain members of a squadron. On an individual basis though, each character portrays themselves on a unique scale. Take Fubuki for example. She comes off as a timid girl but builds confidence as the series progresses and fights alongside her friends. Kongou can be easily seen as the happy outgoing girl who has a heart of gold. Then, there’s Akagi who seems to play an older sister type of character and role model for the younger fleet girls. With a variety of these personalities, you can familiarize yourself to see how they work with the show. Take for granted, each character is assigned with a role as well but teamwork always play a key part to a mission’s success. While it is cleverly crafted, there are also some grim moments to heighten the awareness of the story. Unfortunately, the show also reassigns itself on many episodes with a slice of life tone. What weathers down the show is the balance of the pacing when we sometimes get episodes that just features ‘cute fleet girls doing cute things’. Part of that includes curry contests, beach episodes, and bath scenes. (which serves more purpose than just pure fan service) Combine that with some diehard comedy and you’ll Kantai Collection served with unconventional fun. In retrospect, it’ll take patience to adapt with shows like this and if the style isn’t your type of thing, then satisfaction will not likely be guaranteed for you.Animation can also be a mixed bag at first. The usage of CGI and modifications of the character designs serves as a pivotal factor to craft the basis of this series’ artwork. There’s a variety of characters so each of them must be well designed to fit with their personality. I can say with confidence that the character design did its job to portray the personalities and traits of each fleet girl. But the main course of the artwork comes with the action. The choreography has a charismatic thrill to it but only shines when you appreciate what it’s trying to do. In general, the battles has high caliber amount of action with a genuine attempt to adapt the reality of war. However, be aware that the action itself will feel repetitive as every battle has more or less of the amphibian nature of naval warfare. To cap it off, there’s also bits of fan service. What did you expect? The show is entirely made of female characters so a bit of skin here and there shouldn’t be a surprise; even with some subtle yuri-undertone on occasions. Yes, I’m looking at you Mochizuki.As for soundtrack, it’s mildly entertaining. The attractive OP and ED songs gives off a graceful feeling of energy. In particular, the ED theme song has tune that resembles a naval-like anthem for Fubuki and the others. But on a lesser appeal, the show’s OST is hardly noticeable. The only time they truly shine is perhaps during emotional scenes and the action sequences. Their purpose is to draw out the attention that get the audience to feel how it’s like being part of story. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always work and in most cases can be easily forgotten.  Another main noticeable part is the voice mannerism. Each one of them must fit well to bring the fleet girls to life. I do give credit to that being adapted with efficiency in regards to the majority of the cast. In particular, Kongou brings lots of energy into the show with her hyper activeness and broken English. Yudachi and her signature “Poi” can also be noticeable too. The long story short version is that every character has a matching voice to meet their needs.The roots of Kantai Collection may intimidating to realize but the show itself is actually more of mindless fun anime than anything else. Despite the amount of military context portrayed, there’s a balance of slice of life indulged with the comedy of each episode. The large cast of characters will be hard to get used to and honestly, it should be painfully obvious to accept that not all of them will get enough screen time. To accept this show though, I think that keeping a keen interest in what it has to offer may be the best way to go. A problem can develop when the show’s story squanders around and behaves wildly at times and then running like gentle air the next. Kantai Collection runs its engines to deliver fun entertainment so you’ll have to accept it or not. certain set of principles to follow and not everyone will usually be satisfied to get what they want. Luckily, Kantai Collection is pretty straightforward with a rather non-linear storyline. That’s right. The series may seem complicated with all these characters but the story itself is fairly simple. We follow the footsteps of Fubuki as she enlists herself as a naval destroyer at a naval base. With limited combat experience, she is assigned to the Third Torpedo Squadron. We also quickly learn that the series details events related to warfare pitting the fleet girls against a mysterious enemy known as the “Abyss”. Taken for granted, the series should feel less refreshing but more so to adapt with what it has to offer. Any fan of military fiction may feel at home with this premise.But to start from the beginning, one should realize that the original source is a browser game made by developed by Kadokawa Games and hosted at DMM. With fairly simple gameplay mechanics and appeal, the series quickly gained popularity that now has over 2 million registered accounts in Japan. In fact, numerous adaptations of the game has been spawned that includes light novels, manga, and of course anime. So starting from here, one could say that taking on the footsteps of Fubuki is like becoming a new kid at school. The first day isn’t easy as we quickly find out that she lacks military experience. This is evidenced by her lack of ability to glide on water as a fleet girl. Fortunately enough, she receives plenty of support from her friends and in no time becomes accustomed to fighting. The first few episodes show the general premise and style of the show. We are introduced to prominent characters such as Fubuki’s friends – Mutsuki and Yudachi. Then, there are others from various squads including Kongou, Yayoi, Akatsuki with her Sixth Destroyer Division, Shimakaze, Akagi, Kaga, Nagato, among others. Then, there’s also the mysterious admiral who operates behind the scenes to direct these girls to fight in war. Director Keizo Kusakawa puts his skills at work and to say the least, his resume doesn’t look too impressive in terms of content. His most recent work includes directing another series from the Winter Season (Unlimited Fafnir) also with fictional war-like themes. The funny thing is that both of these shows are made of up a large female cast while his previous involvement follows a similar pattern.War itself can be a hard word to swallow. What that means is that pain and death is inevitable. Kantai Collection is no exception when it comes to fleet girls being destroyed. Earlier on in the show, one of them is lost against the Abyss that strikes a painful scar in Fubuki’s heart as she realizes the grim reality. And this shouldn’t be a surprise either given the historical content. Anyone who is knowledgeable about historical reference should already be familiar with the context of the show and the ships. After all, the fleet girls are based off of these ships such as destroyers, carriers, battleships, light and heavy cruisers. In retrospect, Kantai Collection crafts elements of surprises on occasions when we realize that not everyone will survive the war for newer fans.A show like this also has an over-sized cast. It’s noticeable that not everyone will get enough screen time. However, the show does present a lot of chemistry with the characters. The key word perhaps here is personality because every character in the show has one.  None of them behave like robots as part of some army. In fact, there are even feuds that builds up from little quirks with certain members of a squadron. On an individual basis though, each character portrays themselves on a unique scale. Take Fubuki for example. She comes off as a timid girl but builds confidence as the series progresses and fights alongside her friends. Kongou can be easily seen as the happy outgoing girl who has a heart of gold. Then, there’s Akagi who seems to play an older sister type of character and role model for the younger fleet girls. With a variety of these personalities, you can familiarize yourself to see how they work with the show. Take for granted, each character is assigned with a role as well but teamwork always play a key part to a mission’s success. While it is cleverly crafted, there are also some grim moments to heighten the awareness of the story. Unfortunately, the show also reassigns itself on many episodes with a slice of life tone.

You then meet all the other girls ( they are all great but its hard to keep track of all their names). The show is really cute and falls under the genre ""cute girls doing cute things"". There is a lot of yuri subtext ( I was surprised, though its not unusual since all the characters are girls besides the admiral). The show is pretty enjoyable. ', 'The concept of using shipgirls equipped with weapons from the Second World War to combat sea monsters is a novel idea that I personally found interesting. The unique aspect of these shipgirls is that each of them represents a warship model from a different country, which is particularly fascinating to me as a fan of WWII warships, and more specifically, IJN warships. However, it is worth noting that the fate of each ship is not always a desirable one.The plot of the anime is also noteworthy. I recall an episode that highlights how the Akagi aircraft carrier required a significant amount of oil for fuel,...and in the anime, the girl who represents the Akagi aircraft carrier is portrayed as consuming large quantities of food. Although this portrayal is historically accurate, it is presented in a different manner. Additionally, I appreciated how the first episode introduced the oxygen-torpedo as their trump card, which is not visible on the surface and leaves no trace. This depiction is also accurate, albeit represented differently.The graphics of the anime are visually appealing, and the music is undoubtedly its best feature. The composition of the music for each episode and critical scenes is brilliant, and the tone fits the mood perfectly.However, I found myself disappointed with the direction the anime took after the third episode. The IJN ships were supposed to meet their historical fate of being drawn to the sea. Instead, the show deviated from historical accuracy and took a strange, alternative direction. I had hoped to see hard-fought battles in each episode, with one ship sinking per episode and the IJN fleet suffering losses and misfortune.Overall, the anime was entertaining; however, the divergence from historical accuracy was disconcerting. and in the anime, the girl who represents the Akagi aircraft carrier is portrayed as consuming large quantities of food.

Includes light spoilers, may or may not be properly done.Kantai Collection is obviously, about the game of ship girls or fleet girls, whatever. It's enjoyable.Aight, soooo let's start.========Story: 6/10The story here is pretty much similar to some anime series out there. Things happen where MC was weak and then they get experience from the things they do blablabla. There's also the 'sudden problems that appear' trope I just made up for this review. The anime also contains some cheesy dramatic stuff on some parts which made me, uh, cringe a little. I wonder how I got past...such cringey drama when I watched (now to bring an unrelated anime here) Love Live back then. Damn, that show was great but the drama on some parts were, ugh. There's also the 'sudden rescue' trope I also just made up, in this show.TL;DR: Story is the same shiet you can get from OK shows, drama is kek.Art: 10/10Here's where it gets real; The art is amazing, the water animation is so smooth, CG is great. I like the battle scenes in 3D. tbh the only show I've seen having CG shown for over 30 seconds is  Love Live. I like the art style here. The game art is, well, diverse (you may interpret this in a good or bad way, up to you :P).TL;DR: Nice art style, CG, bla.Sound: 9/10Ayy. Miiro is one of the best OPs I've heard this season. Along with Flyers from Death Parade. I like how they kept the VAs from the game. Also some sound effects. It's all good. I never wanted to listen to the ED though. topkek.TL;DR: Great sounds, voices, etc. yeah.Character: 7/10Those who don't play the game would probably hate this.Not much character development, understandable due to the large cast, and the time given for the show (1-cour). Hopefully S2 does better here.Anyhow, the personalities of the characters from the game are retained (yay) and how they say the same stuff from the game too >Atago, Tama, etc. etc.TL;DR: Not enough character dev. But it's all good.Enjoyment: 9/10I'd say I really liked this show despite some problems and how the system of the game is not similar. (I wish I could send multiple fleets to a mission at once :P). I believe the fanservice here is a-okay, could've been too much, but eh.  Plot is mediocre.TL;DR: It's good. LOL.Overall: 8/10Yes it's an average. Here's the TL;DR of the whole review, including the TL;DRs for each section:It's great, if you know the game. If you don't, it could be okay.It's enjoyable, to say the least.

Being the fan of Kancolle I am,I just cannot hate it completely, but this show was a disappointment.It is a huge potential wasted, thus a frustration to those familiar with he game and fandom.-What potential?Kancolle is a browser game that came out in 2013. It gained popularity far beyond the expected level, so much that the servers can\'t handle the demand and new players are allowed into the game via a lottery system, japanese and non-japanese alike.What made the game this popular, was the doujin market around it.The game had a vast amount of characters,interesting...character art, very good voice acting and music. The effort (and love) put into it was beyond the level of what one would expect from a free to play browser game. Thus, soon the fandom started expanding beyond the game.Characters were given unofficial traits based on their lines or behaviour in the game, -Akagi having a huge apetite due to consuming high amounts of resources in the game, Nagato being into cute things, Murakumo becoming the badass for no reason I know of- theories were built around the enemies -such as them being the malice of war,sunken vessels, zombie ships so to say- which gave birth to many comics that are unique in their own way, fun or serious, action-packed or laidback.The reason Kancolle keeps getting compared to Touhou isn\'t simply because its doujin market caught up to it in numbers, but because the way both their fanworks are: They hugely expand the concepts of the source they are feeding from.Kancolle as a game, does not have a story. It also does not need one.But when you\'re making a show, a scenario is needed. What the writers had to do was to do a throught research on the fanworks, and realize what Kancolle had been made into by the majority. But they failed this task.-Characters: 3/10Even this score may be biased because I simply cannot unlearn what I have from the fandom. But the anime does a terrible job on the characters. First of all, they tried toinclude too many charcters into a very short airing time. There is a ""let\'s show as many characters as we can so that we please every fan out there"" mentality going on. Yes, I said every ""fan"" out there. Because if you are not familiar with the character already, it\'s not possible to actually get attached to any of them. The reason for this is the ridiculously short screen time supporting everyone but Fubuki (MC) gets, and their dialouges mostly consisting of their lines from the game. So to anybody who is not already familiar with them, what the characters say, the way they think and react will make little to no sense. Even for those who know, portrayal of the characters are super weak.-Story: 3/10Ah, yes, the story. The first 3 episodes had one going, so I give one point for each. After that, it just becomes a mess of events. It feels like the studio gathered 12 people for each of the episodes, then they had a meeting on the basic storyline. ""Alright gentlemen, we are going to start from point A, then stop by B, and conclude with C.""Then, eveybody starts writing their own episode without knowing what the person before them wrote in their script. After the first 3 episodes we just have a major battle that keeps being postponed without seeing any real preperations for it, events that literally cancel each other out,(To keep it spoiler free,think of a character painting a wall blue for 3 episodes, thenpainting it red for next 2), things just coming out of the blue and even a filler that doesn\'t even manage to fill anything. And then a VERY anti-climatic ending. Yeah, even if you were to collect random doujin plots and brought them together, it would probably make this much sense, if not more.-Art: 7/10Despite the 3d CGI, the rest of the show was pretty good I think. And 3D CGI looking bad isn\'t a problem unique to this series, I\'ve yet to see 3D that doesn\'t stick out except Rebuild of Evangelion series. While the models look like slightly advanced MMD models, the animating of them were pretty good I think. The battle scenes were quite dynamic and in a series like this where combat is a major part, unfortunately this is inevitable. Other than the 3dCGI, everything was decent and enjoyable. We had very nice backgrounds, distinct changes in atmoshpere between different places of the Naval District. I enjoyed both the battlefield and recreation facilites. Character art was also pretty good, I think they handles Mutsuki\'s gradient hair pretty well.-Sound: 11/10Yes,if there\'s one part of the series that is perfect,it\'s the sound department. Both the voice actors and OST. Looking at the seiyuu list, you might think the developers were tight on budget, but this is a brilliant ""tech demo"" of the voice actors. Many charcaters are voiced by the same people, yet it\'s not noticable in the slightest. I watched a scene where 4 charcters talked to eachother, and was shocked to find out it was literally one person talking behind the scenes. My respects to each VA taking part in this show, that\'s incredible. I mean, being able to change their tone might be a crucial ability for the VAs, but it\'s impressive to be exposed to it in a single show and a single episode. The OST does a real good job too, was kinda disappointed that the show didn\'t have any OST from the game at first, but now I am glad it added to the already wonderful soundtrack of the franchise. Opening and ending are great as well.Might be a disappointment in terms of a show overall, but I nominate it for the best OST of the year already, as there aren\'t many anime that manage to stand out in this context.-Overall: 4-6/10-If you are a regular person simply looking for a new anime to watch, unfortunately I cannot recommend it. 4/10-If you are a person who wants to get into Kancolle, this is definately not the point to start. stayaway/10-If you are a fan of Kancolle, it\'s likely you will enjoy it more than regular peeps, but cringe at the potential it\'s wasting. 6/10-If you are a fan of military stuff, give it a try I say. You\'re here for torpedoes and planes anyway, and you will get it. 7/10 character art, very good voice acting and music.

I haven't played the game, and I probably won't and I haver really enjoyed Kantai Collection. In any case, as this anime is based on a game of WWII ships it won't make any harm knowing a bit of history and the kind of ships that were used. A bit of Wikipedia will help you understanding certain things and enjoying the anime.Story (4/10)This is one of the main weak points of the anime, the lack of story. I...wouldn't say that there is no plot, but is too ambiguous and bad connected. Most of the things are not explained at all, so you'll have to deal with it and imagine things on your own or checking them in Wiki's. I give it a 4 just because at least they didn't invented a complex story and if you take it as a some kind of slice of life it isn't so bad.Art (10/10)I can only thing of the art as superb. It's difficult to review it just because everything in this regard is just perfect. Character design, animation, light, color... all of them are of the highest level. This anime uses a lot of CG, even on the characters, but in a such a good way that enhances the animation without making the characters look bad. I specially liked how the planes were animated. I love WWII planes (more than ships, I'm sorry) and I want to marry the people that animated them for this anime.Sound (10/10)Same goes here. I don't usually like the opening and ending songs of animes. I know there are people that like them but I don't. But in this case the opening was, in my opinion, even good, which is a lot to say coming from me. Apart from that the voice acting is really impressive and the sound of the battles just amazing. I would recommend to see this anime with a nice sound system (or good headphones) so you can fully enjoy the battles.Characters (5/10)There are a lot of characters. Really, a lot. I find this both good and bad. On the one hand you won't get bored of the same characters all the time, mainly because they are to plain, but on the other hand is impossible, at least for me, to know all of them.There were times when they were talking about somebody and I didn't know who. In any case there is almost no development on the personalities, and I give them a 5 because most of them are funny and different.Enjoyment (9/10)I really enjoy seeing this anime. It is very funny with a lot of jokes, a lot of stupid characters... It made me laugh plenty of times. The battles are really well made and I also enjoyed them. There is even a bit (or more than a bit, but nothing hardcore) of yuri which is always well received in my case.SummaryMy overall mark is 8/10. The lack of plot and the simplicity of the characters contrast with the outstanding art and sound.

If you play(ed) the game or are just here for cute girls then it might be satisfactory but don\'t expect much more. You will not see naval combat that makes sense but instead see fleets of six ships shooting at planes with their main guns and ""instant repair buckets"" which are probably a mechanic from the game.The story itself is okayish. There is somewhat of a storyline but it is interrupted by random events. At some points the anime takes itself very seriously while at other points...it\'s just cute shipgirls do cute things. While the more serious parts are nice for character development, it does create a feeling of dissonance with the relaxed parts. The feeling of dissonance translates into the art style as well; most of the time everything is animated normally but very often during battles the anime switches a lot between cg and animation. It\'s not too bothersome but it would\'ve been nicer if they were more consistent.The sound was alright and the voice acting seems pretty good. It\'s also fun to hear the different voice quirks many of the characters have. The characters overall were pretty nice. All of them had clearly different personalities and there is more character development than you\'d expect from a 12 episode anime about shipgirls. Overall it\'s an okay anime to watch if you like the game or its characters but if you\'re not interested in either then this anime is not worth watching. it\'s just cute shipgirls do cute things.

In this crazy show, each character has the fire power of a battle ship, and they go to seas and battle enemy ships. Along with that it also has funny moments in between the battling. This show is based of of a video game, but even if you have never played the game the show can still be fun to watch. The show as designed to be silly and fun, and in no way supposed to be taken as a serious series. The beginning of the...show was just as silly as I'd hoped it to be, it made me laugh and enjoy the characters. As the show continues the jokes begin to be a tad bit more serious, making it so you can enjoy a character for what they are. The music and the sounds were outstanding, the music really brought out the naval combat, as well as the sounds bringing out the action. Lastly, the show was entertaining all throughout the twelve episodes, I was never bored at any moment of the show. In the end, I enjoyed every bit of the show for what it was. I would highly suggest going into the show with the mind set that this show should not be taken seriously. show was just as silly as I'd hoped it to be, it made me laugh and enjoy the characters.

It gave previews and used mechanics that originated from the game.  I honestly think that 12 episodes  were a bit too short due to the large amount of shipgirls that are in the game and the plot rushed a bit. It was great that they gave a spinoff on episode 6 to give a break on all the drama and action.

The level on which the show is most effective is fanservice, and I thought it did work rather well in that regard the world and characters were true to the game.  The question is whether it needs to function on any other level and if it matters that other aspects suffered for the sake of fanservice.  I don't think so.tl;dr: For Fans.So there is a story.  It's there, but it hardly matters.  I suppose there are nods to battles...in WW2, if that gets you going, but the characters tend to be more important than the overarching plot, and there are problems there, too, but I'll address that later.  I think the final resolution to the plot works, for the most part, but the worst moments in the show are probably attempts to advance the plot, create drama, or build stakes.  The show works best as a slice-of-life where sometimes the boats shoot somethings, and I think the episodes that worked best did not have a ton to do with the main plot.  The curry episode, or maybe even Kongou and Yamato's episodes are examples of this.tl;dr: barely mattersThe characters are probably one of the show's strongest aspects, but there isn't really anything done with them that we haven't seen before.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the character is that the show throws a lot of them at you, more than could possibly matter and more than the show could have time to really flesh out.  Even some of the characters that do matter, like Kongou and Shimakaze, don't receive much development.  If you're a fan of the game maybe that won't matter.  The portrayals of the characters are true to the game.  That said there are characters that do develop over the course of the series.  The pairs of carriers have a relationship that develops a bit over the course of the show.  Fubuki is all about that ganbaru thing that we're so used to seeing in anime.  Nagato and Mutsu's relationship is in the background, but I enjoy the way it develops, and the ultimate pay off was one of the most satisfying parts of the show.    On the other hand there are characters that just don't work.  Mostly Mutsuki.  Mutsuki was the worst.tl;dr: Mostly fine, but maybe only if you already know the girls.Some slightly awkward CG aside Art was good.  Some of the girls, like Fubuki, looked better in the anime art style.  I don't think I ever thought a girl just looked worst.Sound was fine.Overall, as a fan of the game, it was a fun show.  The characters and setting were right.  I got to see some of my favorite girls do things.  Mutsu did Mutsu things and it was great.  I think it succeeds where it matters most, and where it was intended to work, which is fanservice.  If you're looking for anything deeper you probably won't find it, but ultimately I don't think it needs to be anything more.  I'm satisfied with what it is and I'm looking forward to seeing more of my favorite girls, Jun'you, in the next season. in WW2, if that gets you going, but the characters tend to be more important than the overarching plot, and there are problems there, too, but I'll address that later.

The anime will be narrated by the point of view of Fubuki. The first episode is the typical episode that introduce you the anime.  The problem is the lack of development of Fubuki, she has development but it\'s null... I mean, we will know that in so moments she is a brilliant person who could know what it\'s going on only because a warning that the secretary ship gave to her.  But this fall it\'s forgotten because the anime doesn\'t care about her. The anime only care about HER GOALS. Or this is how I interpreted it.The characters... well in this anime we have a lot of cute shipgirls, like Akagi, Kaga, Kongou... they\'re very interesting characters, the relationships in this anime are so important, for example Kaga has a kind of senpai over the 5th Division of Aircraft, we\'re Shoukaku and Zuikaku, and it\'s based on historical references. The First Division have jokes over the Fifth Division. And Kaga always has some dialogues like ""I don\'t want to be near the fifth division"" but in the end it show that Kaga feel like the first division must have a senpai role over the Fifth. Other relationships are in more ""romance"" tone, probably because the historical counterpart fights along or because the historical counterpart was worried abount her in the last battle...  This ""romance"" are ok, because you can see that they\'re humans. There\'re a moment where the Secretary Ship, Nagato blushes because Mutsu (Her sister ship) says that NAGATO it\'s important to her.The sound well... I can only remember the Opening and the Ending... and a few parts of the OST...The Art it\'s... well there\'re part very well animated but others have a weird CGI that could make to close the episode, because in some points it\'s a very annoying CGI.But in the end this could be one of my top 10 favorites animes.

As if pantsless lolis with boot propellers wasn't stupid enough, here we have Fleet Girls™ which are basically qt 3.14s with assorted ship apparatuses that magically summon from the ethos (or variously must be equipped) and transform the grills into some vague reference to WW2 Japanese ships while they maintain their qt-ness.And yet it works. It works really well.Each ship (or grill) has a distinct personality. Some, like the Yamato, are hilariously tied to the IRL circumstances of their namesakes, but others are just...silly. We have lesbian ship sisters, the boisterous Kongo quartet, wizened fleet...carriers, and naturally there are loli torpedo boats with the gamut of anime tropes. Fubuki is the star of the series, a Fleet Grill™ who starts as a clumsy good-for-nothing but grows into a hero who saves everyone (not really a spoiler, since this is an anime and that happens in literally every single anime ever).All that's fine, but it's the details that made KanColle so good for me. The carriers use bows to fire arrows that poof into planes piloted by doll things (???), destroyers fire groups of torpedoes from their legs like some caricature of a boy doing the humping motion, and battleships make a grand gesture of giving the enemy a full salvo. The ship/grills heal from damage by soaking in a hot spring, when a ship is ready to be refitted they start glowing, the carriers and battleships eat about 400 tons of food per day. Even the seaplane tender girls have fantastic details with their setups. The best part is that it's presented with a nod for magic realism: nothing is explained, it just *is* and that's that. I know this is based on some vidya, and that's super obvious, but even though I haven't played said vidya I still appreciated the entire package.I know I'm a sucker for all things naval (except the soul-draining leech that is WoWS....ugh) and that definitely predisposed me to enjoy this, but I absolutely recommend KanColle for anyone searching out a great time. carriers, and naturally there are loli torpedo boats with the gamut of anime tropes.

The anime is based on a game of the same name which involves using battleships that are given the female gender targeting the ""moe"" aspect of anime in my opinion.  This review would be based solely on the anime experience without knowledge of the mechanics and the storyline of the game itself.Story - 6You could say that the story was less interesting compared to the art, animation, and sound of the anime.It follows the storyline of ""Main character meets senpai...whom she tries to catch up to, trains hard and suddenly gets noticed by senpai, joins senpai on a final mission, and they succeed.""  What\'s so different about the plot is that by the last few episodes of the anime, there was this forced idea injected into the characters that was nowhere to be seen during the first half.  Although it is implied that there are many mysterious things that are happening.  Overall, the story was average without real plot twists and a hell lot of Yuri moments.Looking at the flow of the episodes, one filler episode could be seen halfway that sorta shifted the momentum into a slower state but prepared the introduction of a thrilling arc.Art/Animation- 9Diomedea has been a studio that produced very fluid animation effects.  Now, given the complexity of the idea of the anime, I can say that they delivered pretty well.  There is no mistake that the characters are all beautifully drawn.  All of them have their own appeal and have typical aspects that a moe character should contain.  The involvement of planes, cannons, bullets, and torpedoes still continued my amazement with the anime\'s art.  I can say that KanColle has one of the most amazing art and animation for the Winter lineup.Sound- 9Opening and ending themes have always been an integral part of the anime.  And I can say that KanColle has an amazing soundtrack.  Bullet sounds and torpedo sounds are as close to the real deal as they can get and I have no complaints with the sound quality.   Given the nice art of the anime, the sound did not fail me as well.  One of the best opening and ending themes for the season.Character- 7The characters of course are a major part of the anime.  And this anime has given the characters specific attributes that make it hard to forget them.  I have never seen an anime that put together a lot of individually based speech disorders and mannerisms in different characters.  Well, they  really aren\'t speech disorders but I like to call it that.  There may be appeal in that but it sort of annoyed me halfway.  A few of those were Yuudachi who always ended with ""Poi"", Naka who is the self-proclaimed idol of the fleet, Akatsuki who is obsessed with becoming a lady, Kongou who gives the Japanese language slang due to her British vibe.  I swear, each of them has this unforgettable attribute that could either annoy you or make them cute in your positive.  Props to their voice actresses for their skill and talent to create personas that are hard to forget.Enjoyment- 8I can say that I enjoyed the anime despite it giving me a bad impression halfway due to the lack of its content.  But then again, this isn\'t one of those anime that you hope to have a very deep plot.  You can\'t deny the fact that the anime delivered well in terms of action, suspense, and a little bit of drama.  I\'m not a particular fan of historical and military themed anime but I have enjoyed this.  I am not aware whether the game has a similar plot or what, but this delivered a statement on how the game may be engaging as I suspect it to be.Overall- 8Personally,  I don\'t think that this would be an anime that you would really want to finish in an all-nighter due to the lack of a well-defined plot.  Given the fact that all the characters are very attractive girls, I guess it can capture the male audience easily. whom she tries to catch up to, trains hard and suddenly gets noticed by senpai, joins senpai on a final mission, and they succeed.""

I\'m not a particular fan of historical and military themed anime but I have enjoyed this.  I am not aware whether the game has a similar plot or what, but this delivered a statement on how the game may be engaging as I suspect it to be.Overall- 8Personally,  I don\'t think that this would be an anime that you would really want to finish in an all-nighter due to the lack of a well-defined plot.  Given the fact that all the characters are very attractive girls, I guess it can capture the male audience easily.', ""I came to know the existence of this anime for the famous ~poi ~poi craze going on. Of course I was also drawn to the girls fleet and was wondering what the hell is this KanColle all about.Well, to be honest, I did not have these pre-requisites:(1) knowledge on WW2 Japanese warships-hence, I don't understand most of the significance of the names of the battleships until later on. I thought I would be just fine not knowing them but I guess it kind of defeats the purpose for the writer to go ahead and name the girls based on the Japanese warships.(2) I don't play...the KanColle game-the KanColle game so far is only in Japanese. Otherwise, I would be interested to play it. Hence, it's hard to understand at first what's going on as you see people shooting arrows and shooting aeroplanes appear or even how the guns got attached to the girls, I mean I just don't get it.To be honest, I hate all the characters except for the poi girl(Yuudachi). As for Fubuki, I can't say I enjoyed her character development that much. I don't know why but she just doesn't click with me.Overall, if you are like me, feel free to skip this anime. It's a bother to actually want to know more about this anime if the publishers themselves make a lackluster effort in introducing this genre to new viewers like myself. However, if you have been following KanColle closely, I do believe you will enjoy this series. Otherwise, this anime is one to forget and ignore. only come and watch when you do have the time.PS: The art and sound(voice acting) was the only highlight of the series. There will be a sequel and I will be watching it only because I want to watch more of poi~ the KanColle game-the KanColle game so far is only in Japanese. Otherwise, I would be interested to play it.

The game lines reference is overused and everything seems to be so out of place and has no flow.They obviously set out to make this anime aimed at those who played the game which they just did that. So if you aren't a fan of kancolle this anime is not for you, simply because the anime is targeted at those who are interested/ playing the game and not for casual anime viewers.Now should you watch Kancolle? The answer is simple,if you are one of...the people who are playing the game, this might be for you. However If you are here looking for some good anime, with good plot, good character development and awesome story. Unfortunately, this is not for you. Simply because the story literally has no plot, just like in the game, where the girls keeps on going to do operations after one another and capture new islands.As the story goes on there will probably be alot of new ships being introduced to us, now if you haven't played the game at all you will probably have no clue who those Kanmusus are. there won't be any major character development since the game itself has over a hundred ships, with a variety of classes etc.This anime is based on real life WW2 ships, with some ships involved in warcrimes during WW2. This time Japan and Germany (Germany is in the game) are like the good guys who fight against the Aliens to protect humanity. Now where did the Americans go? Perhaps they all end up being the abyssal fleet since all the battle that took place especially events are based on IJN vs USN. Don't take it too offensive though.the anime could have been better unfortunately it did not meet many people's expectation therefore as a result is a failure in many people's eyes.Conclusion: I would not recommend this anime to those who have never played the game before/ have no interest the people who are playing the game, this might be for you.

Such is Kantai Collection.  It\'s premise may seem absurd but that hasn\'t stop millions of fans of playing its game. Due to this popularity, it was adapted into an anime a lot of hype was placed on it. Here I am to see if that hype was worth it.STORY:There\'s really nothing much to say about the story, since it\'s not meant to be taken seriously in the first place. Despite the theme surrounding the show being all war-like, the story usually leans to the slice-of-life genre and therefore, all the drama, all the friendship, all the fun...and enjoyment going on and not giving shit about the war that\'s plaguing their seas. Anyway, what I do like about the story is how the naval battle scenes are referenced to real-life events such as the Battle at Midway, if I recall correctly. Also, the story has some dark-theme to it and I was surprised to see one of the fleet girls actually die and how it affects the other characters.Anywho, if you are familiar with the game this show is based on, you probably already have the gist of what\'s to unfold here. If not, you\'ll probably get lost. The producers did throw in some originality of their own in regards to the storyline but they seem mostly to appeal to the moe-ness of the characters.CHARACTERSIf you can name any famous World War 2 IJN battleship, expect them to be present in the show, cutesy and battle-ready and all. By and large, KanColle has a huge roster of characters in the video game, but in a show consisting of only 12 episodes, only handful made the cut to be animated and given character.The main character is a destroyer named Fubuki. Despite the show trying to make her as interesting and lovable as possible, in the end I don\'t see Fubuki as an interesting main character. Her personality is generic and while there is a sense of character development, in the end it all falls flat. That said, the side-characters seem to have more personality than the MC. My personal favorite, and probably some as well, Kungou, a hyper-active, tea-loving, Engrish speaking battleship; her strong personality even matches her raw power as a war machine. There also exists Yuudachi, who always ends her sentences with a ""poi"", and that\'s it.Aside from all these, these characters were carefully made to match that of their real-life counterparts. For example: battleships and air-craft carriers are personified as more mature women, in contrast to the loli destroyers and dreadnoughts. To give them some variety, some characters have their own special personality while others just seem to fade in the background.Of course, it goes without saying that the clothing of most of the characters seemed skimpy and impractical for battle and even everyday interactions. This is mostly for the fan-servicing and while that surprised me, in my eyes it\'s not really a welcoming sight for the most part.AESTHETICS & AUDIOBefore it started airing, the visuals is where most of my worries lie for the show. Diomedia is in charge of the animation and by basing to their previous shows, I was rather skeptical about the resulting quality of KanColle. Fortunately, I was rather surprised and impressed of how the studio kept everything consistent for the most part. Overall the visuals were decent and the characters designs were faithful to their in-game counterparts. The fast-paced scenes were exchanged for CGI ones and while some scenes may make it look quite out of place and awkward, for the most part it did it job decently.The outlying soundtrack is also good, fairly complementing every scene. The opening and ending themes were good, despite sounding quite generic.FINAL VERDICTWhile KanColle\'s appeal mostly apply to that of those who have invested into the video game, I for one, think that KanColle is an interesting concept. One thing it has going for is its huge roster of colorful characters, if some of them are not as interesting as others. While presentation is quite mediocre and predictable, I can see some direction going for it. I also applaud it for having a second season in production already and I\'ll be glad too see how it presents itself once more. and enjoyment going on and not giving shit about the war that\'s plaguing their seas.

At first, making wonder about the existence of males.As the anime progresses, we come to find that these girls and women are based on ships. Although they look like ordinary human beings, these moe girls ultimately possess battleship properties such as resting, sinking & etc (to sink means death).The characters for the most part are one-dimensional besides...our main protagonist. They don't develop much even though it is fun to watch them interact with one another.Through interacting with different people, hints of development occur for main protagonist Fubuki. We get to watch this character through her experiences. The show attempts to show us her motivation to keep us interested in who she will become. The other characters.. although is a joy to watch, don't go through any development.Mutsuki, the girl with redish hair and squeeky voice, is one of the more important supporting characters whom has significant interactions with Fubuki. Sometimes Mutsuki feels lost when Fubuki is caught up in herself. But for Fubuki, it's as though she can't help it; she's weak and all she can do is to work hard, always thinking that she's not enough.I guess I could say that the story in KanColle is basically this sequence of events that has little strings attached. It doesn't have a main plot that is spread out throughout the entire show. Each episode seems to have its own plot. So what does that mean? It means that the anime is unpredicatable; which is a good thing in its part since its a Slice of Life. But what it also means is that there isn't a concrete goal in what the anime wants to achieve by the end of the series plot-wise. For example: I would have liked to see more into who the enemy are and what was the story behind why our characters are fighting their enemies. This is never touched upon.However, all in all, I realize that that was not the goal of the story. The drive of the plot is focused towards allowing viewers to see the world of KanColle from the eyes of our protagonist Fubuki. And I have to say, I quite enjoyed her journey much.The art is superb and very beautiful. I could just kiss it. Everything from the beaches that they're on to the ocean and the environment felt organized and understandable. Even the food looks delicious, poi.This part comes to preference: the animation switches to CGI/3D-ish when our girls are on water or have their gear on. I was a bit surprised at first since switching between the two on the go was new to me. After a while however, it felt like a nice little gimmick.Personally, this anime's art is so beautiful.. it could partly be the reason why I enjoyed this series so much. In other anime, concrete is so saturated. Here... you can just breathe with all the vivid colors and scenery. KanColle is a very colorful anime.The music can be pleasant. Often times, it attempts to fit the moods in the anime, and manages to do this well whether the tone in the episodes are meant to be sad, happy, or serious. I also liked how some OST's are oriental inspired. Sound in this anime is complimentary, but not memorable.Overall: The amazing art and sound knows how to tone in coordination with the scenes; you really get a nice feel of night and day or how Fubuki feels.The show is really good in what it does. It's very organized in its moments and it makes sure not to mix these moments. You can really relate with Fubuki. How she's new to the whole world is a nice introduction to anyone who wants to delve into the world of KanColle. Because seeing the world from her perspective is like seeing it from your own.Score Variations:4 and less (not recommended viewing) for those who are disinterested in the world of KanColle5 or 6 (possibly recommended viewing) for those who are interested in the world of KanColle our main protagonist.

First at all, if you like guns, military issues, comedy, action, and animes with just girls on it, this is for you! Isn't perfect but, is very well done, excellent drawing, nice characters, and is not pretending to be something else, simply is a good slice of life with adrenaline and shoujo ai, you're gonna enjoy with Akagi and Buki and all it takes be a little hero in the seas, battles between ships with...a brilliant variety, so much fire, good funny scenes and not lame at all. Is almost like a perfect balance between Strike Witches and Girls und  Panzer, is really worth to take a look. a brilliant variety, so much fire, good funny scenes and not lame at all.

This anime (for me) was made to entertain the Kancolle players and the Anime Enthusiasts. some people might think of this anime as a crap work, trash,etc. Because they have an overly high expectations or just demand that the anime is appealing to only them....But for me, this anime was made for everyone. and i will end this review with a cliffhanger....Btw, Yamato Kai, Poi Kai, Bismarck, Iowa, Eugen, Fubuki, Shigure Kai Nii, Gangut, Tenryuu, Kuma, Musashi Kai are my best shipfus :3 But for me, this anime was made for everyone. and i will end this review with a cliffhanger....Btw, Yamato Kai, Poi Kai, Bismarck, Iowa, Eugen, Fubuki, Shigure Kai Nii, Gangut, Tenryuu, Kuma, Musashi Kai are my best shipfus :3', ""Alright, this is gonna be a hell of a longgg ride. Beware for spoilers.Now, I have known KanColle for about a year now. I started when the Shimakaze hype is on its peak. I was just like, 'who the hell is this exhibitionist?' and got myself into KanColle.So if you're not familiar with the game, it's a card game made by DMM and Kadokawa Games. It has a record-breaking amount of players when it has just been released. I, unfortunately, only got the chance to play it late 2014. But I have quite the experience in the large and immersive fandom. It has a whole...LOAD of merchandise; from the Weiss Schwarz deck, to the figures, to the gachas and MILLIONS, wait no, BILLIONS of doujin merchandise.[Story - 5/10]As an avid fan myself, I was disappointed by the anime's story. It has a lot of fillers and it was just, I don't know? Inconsistent is the word I guess. I can't even begin to explain. It started well and action-packed. I was dazzled by episodes one until five, but that's where it went downhill. After the fifth episode, it's just inside jokes and stupid fillers and pure fanservice. The pace wasn't balanced, and I have to rewatch it about three times to get the whole thing. The eleventh episode was a letdown, since it feels like a rushed episode that didn't even make the climax more exciting. The 12th episode? Oh come on. That was the WORST. Starting from the nonsensical abyssal evolution to the really bad animation (exclude that Nagato fighting scene) it was the epitome of how badly made it was. Plus SPOILER ALERT! the story felt as if Kisaragi sunk for nothing.[Art - 6]The art wasn't really that enjoyable to me. The characters are fine and all but the 3D CG and the explosions really bug me.Seriously, that 3DCG sea was horrible. And don't even start with the 3D character animations. //shivers[Sound - 9]This is probably the most enjoyable part of the anime. From the adrenaline pumping opening theme Miiro to the exciting Fubuki, it can be easily said that the music was quite a masterpiece. The ending made us excited about the next episode, and the opening is just plain awesomeness. Don't get me started on the orchestral BGMs. The music is probably the only reason you would want to watch this show.[Character - 8]The characters were quite memorable. But, some were out of their original concepts. Like, Nagato, a caring girl in the game with passion for leading the  fleet, the perfect lady. In the anime, she is shown very strict. Way to go Diomedea, you just ruined my favorite girl. Other than that, Yuudachi and Kongou was just memorable! Ooi and Kitakami's lesbian scene were also something.[Enjoyment - 7]I can't say a lot about this topic. It was good and all, but it doesn't really etch into my memory like Death Parade or Binan Koukou Chikyuu Boeibu LOVE![Overall - 6]Bad story, inconsistent pace, lazy animation but godly music and memorable characters.

Other than that, has a little bit of everything: slice of life mixed with action and character development. It never gets samey.On somewhat negative note is perhaps choice of the main three characters. Fubuki is kind of nothing too special. Yuudachi only has Poi gimmick going for her and gets less likable after remodeling. I do not like Mitsuki at all. If not for that...I would have given it 8.Main trio is not that important overall though. Show gives plenty of development and screen time to other shipfus so you will likely find one or several ones to you liking.It has nice and kind Haruna, Haguro and Jintsu as well as sexy dressed Shimakaze.Destroyer group 6 are also nice and get 1 full episode dedicated to them among other things.Overall it is not perfect, but certainly decent and entertaining enough show, that I can recommend to anyone.

Do you like all girl casts? Do you like WHAP? Do you like shipping girls (pun not intended)? And do you like selecting waifus?If you answered yes to these questions, KanColle is the Anime for you. But let's go deeper.So Waifu Collection, I mean Kantai Collection, was based off a free to play brower game by the same name. The game followed the WW2 Japanese pacific naval campaign and the female analogues of the ships, with the player in charge of maintaining and managing the fleet. In the anime however, the pacific war against the...allied powers was dropped in favor of a war against unexplained Davy Jones abortions. In KanColle, there is an abundance of unexplained or questionable adaptiation choices of the source material. Another example is how in the game, the admiral is never shown for the purpose of having the player better picture themselves as the admiral. However, in the anime, the admiral is kept hidden even though there is no reason to project yourself as the admiral (unless Kongou is your waifu).For plot, I give it a 2/10. The best word I can use to describe the story is unfocused. This anime has so many different plots and themes, that the show has a hard time expressing any of them fully and ends up with a very forgettable storyline. In it's 12 episode series, it manages to include themes of death, survivor's guilt, maturing as a woman, determinism, and friendship, while managing to not go farther than introducing each concept. When watching this, I didnt know what to want or expect from this anime. Was is supposed to be just about Fubuki just becoming a better person? Is it about fitting in? Are the Abyssals going to be significant in any way? Is the Navy sexist for only enlisting girls? We don't know. Without a central plot, it lacks that feeling of satisfaction that the climax is supposed to give you. In most anime, when you see the protagonists finally reach their goal or complete their journey, the definite and conclusive ending is probably the most satisfying moment in the story, being able to either make or break a series. It felt like I was reading a book where I can't tell the difference between the protagonist and antagonist. I couldn't feel committed to any of the characters as the story was so unfocused. While there are shows that handle multiple plots fine, this anime fails as there is no central arc or theme that ties all the subplots together. Shows like Assassination Classroom is an example of how a story can follow the unique plots of multiple characters well by having them all work towards a common goal. Bakemonogatari is an example of how theme can tie plots together, where all the different arcs were unified by the common theme of trying to escape or fix events in your past. KanColle had no way of showing how each episode adds to each other, making the show easily forgettable.For Art, I give it a 8/10. If thought the 3D animated scenes were well blended into the regular art style of the anime and I liked the visual execution of the aircrafts.For Sound, I give it a 7/10. The music was pretty mediocre and didn't stand out as particularly poor or particularly good. Poi.For the Characters, I give it a 4/10. Like the story, it seems as if the anime is more interested in seeing how many characters it can introduce rather than how well they can develop them. Basically the Batman V Superman cameo feeling.So, should you watch KanColle?No. Honestly, High School Fleet does a way better job with executing the Naval fleet girl premise. allied powers was dropped in favor of a war against unexplained Davy Jones abortions. In KanColle, there is an abundance of unexplained or questionable adaptiation choices of the source material. Another example is how in the game, the admiral is never shown for the purpose of having the player better picture themselves as the admiral. However, in the anime, the admiral is kept hidden even though there is no reason to project yourself as the admiral (unless Kongou is your waifu).For plot, I give it a 2/10. The best word I can use to describe the story is unfocused. This anime has so many different plots and themes, that the show has a hard time expressing any of them fully and ends up with a very forgettable storyline. In it's 12 episode series, it manages to include themes of death, survivor's guilt, maturing as a woman, determinism, and friendship, while managing to not go farther than introducing each concept. When watching this, I didnt know what to want or expect from this anime. Was is supposed to be just about Fubuki just becoming a better person? Is it about fitting in? Are the Abyssals going to be significant in any way? Is the Navy sexist for only enlisting girls? We don't know. Without a central plot, it lacks that feeling of satisfaction that the climax is supposed to give you. In most anime, when you see the protagonists finally reach their goal or complete their journey, the definite and conclusive ending is probably the most satisfying moment in the story, being able to either make or break a series. It felt like I was reading a book where I can't tell the difference between the protagonist and antagonist. I couldn't feel committed to any of the characters as the story was so unfocused. While there are shows that handle multiple plots fine, this anime fails as there is no central arc or theme that ties all the subplots together. Shows like Assassination Classroom is an example of how a story can follow the unique plots of multiple characters well by having them all work towards a common goal. Bakemonogatari is an example of how theme can tie plots together, where all the different arcs were unified by the common theme of trying to escape or fix events in your past. KanColle had no way of showing how each episode adds to each other, making the show easily forgettable.For Art, I give it a 8/10. If thought the 3D animated scenes were well blended into the regular art style of the anime and I liked the visual execution of the aircrafts.For Sound, I give it a 7/10. The music was pretty mediocre and didn't stand out as particularly poor or particularly good. Poi.For the Characters, I give it a 4/10. Like the story, it seems as if the anime is more interested in seeing how many characters it can introduce rather than how well they can develop them. Basically the Batman V Superman cameo feeling.So, should you watch KanColle?No. Honestly, High School Fleet does a way better job with executing the Naval fleet girl premise."", 'Why am I writing another review for a series that already has like 30? This review will be different for 2 reasons: first, because of the direct contrast with the last anime I reviewed; and second, because I\'m going to be focusing on thematic elements a lot more than previous reviews do. I\'m not going to complain about the CGI (eh, it\'s better than Initial D) and I won\'t say anything more about the music after noting that the OP/ED are totally awesome. That said, there are going to be some SPOILERS in here, at least in a general sense, because I\'m going to be...talking about this show\'s thematic weight, and about how it works as rewritten history.First, the contrast. Superficially this show ought to share a lot with my last review, the miserable Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid. I mean, it\'s action girls up the wazoo, right? And fan-service? And pick-your-favorite-waifu as though it were a harem show? But if you look past those superficial similarities, this show really shines by comparison. First, while I\'m not going to deny the obvious shout-outs to people who\'ve played the games or are interested in the historical in-jokes, there\'s surprisingly little sexy-type fanservice. I recall maybe 2 panty shots, and they\'re really quick flashes during action sequences, plus some obligatory breast size jokes (but fairly limited ones).Even more importantly, this is a show that (despite its underlying concept being, well, kind of stupid) actually manages to earn the thematic weight of the occasional serious moments. There\'s an event maybe 1/3 of the way into the show that really comes out of nowhere--but is not glossed over like the uncounted attempted (not to mention the completed) rapes in Valkyrie. It\'s shocking in its tonal shift, but the show has the wisdom to stay with this event and devote serious screen time to showing the reactions of other characters over a fairly long course of time. Unlike Valkyrie, where this feels like a cheap, repulsive gimmick, here it adds a lot of weight to what the characters are dealing with. And it comes in a way that raises the stakes for the rest of the show. The show designers and writers had the guts to do this once: are we really going to be able to sit back and enjoy the Cutest Little Child Soldiers hanging around ganbatteing in class and eating ice cream afterward? Or are we going to think, wait, what\'ll happen in the next mission, is anybody really safe? Yeah, you\'re going to get a curry episode in the middle. You know what that\'s called? It\'s called tension relief. Even Evangelion had comic moments, you gotta spot the show an ep to let the audience relax before the next big arc.On that note--we actually get serious arcs, with missions that span several episodes, and are clearly building toward something. Missions with goals and stuff. We have both progress and setbacks. During the course of the anime, it is not at all clear what the ultimate outcome of the war will be. (I mean, there\'s sequels, so you can probably guess that Our Heroes don\'t outright lose. Yet. But who knows what S2 will bring? And if the season ends with them on the ropes, the story isn\'t *over*, it\'ll encourage everybody to go out and fight harder in the game, right?)Of course, the show does suffer from Cast of Thousands. I always take notes when I watch anime or read manga, because I want to remember everybody\'s names for later, and you usually don\'t have a lot to go on to tell them apart... well, these episodes took me over half an hour each because I was typing so much in my note file. I think I have a hundred lines of character summary and relationship mappings. Phew. Of course, that\'s because we\'re basically listing every freaking boat that ever showed up in the Japanese navy, which all have to be included so you can... buy the merch? Get more hype about the game? Spot your favorite shippuwaifu? Idk. But they\'re all in there, and if you aren\'t writing it down or already familiar, you\'re going to lose track.The second angle I want to cover is history. This is both the biggest fanservice element (imo), but also where it gets a little... awkward. Particularly for the American audience. The conceit of the show is that our Cutest Little Child Soldiers are somehow karmically linked to the souls of battleships... of the Japanese Navy. Of World War II. Now you might pause a minute, and scratch your head, and recall that exactly one Japanese capital ship actually *survived* the War... and think maybe that doesn\'t bode so well for Our Heroes. This feeling will get even stronger when you realize that the missions in the arcs of this anime actually map shockingly closely to historical engagements and events. The last third of the anime is a really amazingly close retelling of the Battle of Midway (go read the Wikipedia page and then watch episode 11 and just try to disagree). That\'s when it dawns on you that the Abyssals--they really are basically the American navy, fulfilling many of the same roles... we even have a creepy demonic USS Yorktown as an antagonist. So my grandmother was in this navy, and now I\'m emotionally invested in seeing their dark doppelgangers get whupped? Surreal.This is also where it should get weird or awkward for the Japanese audience. Because to tell this story, moreover to tell a victorious story, or most of all an *uncomplicated* story, with this history, you need to make some pretty radical changes. Here the USN analogue is actually just a mysterious force that arose from the depths and are clearly the aggressors. And to square that circle of ""IRL these girls all wound up dead lols"" we throw in a different element in the form of our main character, Fubuki, who is pretty much the poster girl for Yamato-damashii (see http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSpirit). She\'s gonna try super hard and believe super strong and motivate the whole fleet with the Power of Friendship, and by Nimitz that\'s actually going to change things! This is a *simplification* that actually *makes things complex*, because those are obviously very admirable qualities and make her, and all of them, likeable and relatable characters; but in the process they create a historical narrative in which just a little more Japanese Fighting Spirit (and a little more strategic flexibility and anti-aircraft gunnery) would\'ve saved the day. This winds up being uncomfortably nationalist: Japan the aggrieved victim; the eventual triumph of a particular Japanese national spirit and character; the sanitization and justification of Imperial Japan\'s role in the war--this is straight out of any Uyoku Dantai group. Decomplicating the original conflict complicates the work.Complicates because, the political implications aside, it\'s a formula that works. Everybody loves to cheer for the underdog; we like our heroes to be obviously heroic and lovable and not have to carry the weight of the atrocities that go with real war on any side; the best baddies are of course the arbitrarily hostile alien force that Shot First. And it\'s a kind of intriguing reworking of history, too, because with a little more strategic flexibility and anti-aircraft gunnery, things really could\'ve been quite different. At the end of the day, this show won me over, from the characters (even if I ran out of fingers and toes) to the historical what-ifs. It\'s just tough to keep an eye on the line between alternate history and emotional support for actual revisionism.In any event, if you watch the show (as you should!), you may find it quite interesting to read Wikipedia along with.

The art-style is really well done and I gotta say, the fight scenes with 3D animation are incredible, It's rare to see such a good CGI in an anime.

The music in it is priceless, from the epic opening to the background music during the fight scenes.

But that is being very very very biased, and my raw score on the actual quality of this anime is a teacher grade of 76/100 (US schools) taking out all my personal feelings about this anime and putting it raw, from a plot standpoint this was quite a average anime it feels for the most part like a Pokémon episodes-Story 5/10, or 50/100 (F)the story/plot revolves around well there is not much cute moe battleship girls and lets just throw in some abyssal demon girls as the antagonist and no such thing as backstory just here is why they are fighting because they are fighting something. Now the main idea or moral of the story is basically something out of Pokémon, something along the lines of a Pokémon wanting to evolve into a stronger form to be the very best, and not losing sight of your friends. Actual storyline is basically nonexistent however this was kinda meant to be a casual anime. But it still has quite the handful of feels.-art 8/10The artwork of kan coll appears to be heavily influenced by its roots to its internet game, because yes cute moe battleship girls that get stripped of clothing as they get damaged because JAPAN, anyways the artwork from it is decent nothing too amazing it doesn’t suck however the effects appear to be some crafty work along with all the turrets that the battleship girls have seem decent.-sound 8/10Im not really sure but it seemed alright, the battle girl ships use the same weapons over and over again so I guess having that as a constant is nice, voice acting was decent average all around.-Characters 6/10Well the characters get very well defined into their general character categories, from determined im gona do my best and never give up naurto attitudes, to territorial yuri girl, as well as the just there for someone to be sad (that one girl from DRRR that is in the hospital…) nothing real special going on here.-Enjoyment 8/10Sure this was a average anime that was on the borderline of being terrible, but deep down I wanted to watch this because of moe battleship girls, sure sometimes I was talking to the screen saying don’t do it why are you about to throw away your life for a stupid upgrade, and other times he JUST DO IT shia labeouf speech could be herd in the background of my mind as I criticized the anime but I did not waver from my task of seeing this to the end because I kinda wanted to know a little.-Overall 6/10 if you put it all together…The only thing holding you is the pre season hype about battleship girls, and personal intrest if you have no intrest in the thought of battleship impersonations as anime girls then there is almost nothing in this anime for you mosaic is there.

It was a more, cringe-y, excited feeling and I was more or less like \'WTF IS HAPPENING XD\'.I will be referring to the game a lot, since I am a player of KC. I am though, a bit passive on it tbh. Much like CoC players. (Waiting Simulator; 2015)Those who are like ""Eh, TL:DR"", please, ctrl+f the following for the TL:DR review:- TL:DR Story- TL:DR Art- TL:DR Sound- TL:DR Characters...Anyways, Kantai Collection. Those who know and play Kantai Collection (KC) should know what the characters are like in the game. Each \'ship\', so to say, have their own set of lines that they utter during for example, combat, or idling as your secretary. My problem is, how hard the animators tried to incorporate said lines from the game, into the anime. I love it when Kongo screams ""Burning Love!!"" when firing shells at enemies, IN THE GAME. In the anime however, it feels so horribly out of place. Not to mention how the Kongo class battleships were portrayed in the anime. Gehh.Jumping ahead, the story. It only really deserves a 6 in my opinion. They try really hard to make the anime as much like the animated game as possible. Those who again, play the game will also wonder how the admiral has certain ships that are a b**** to get in the game. Not to mention, the game once in a while, hosts events that are correlated to actual events that occurred during WW2. TL:DR Story - The anime pulled one of the bigger events from the actual game and animated it. How it looks and feels to those who don\'t play the game, I\'m not sure. But, those who play the game like I do, will probably make little sense of it.The art gets a nice 7 here. Again, referring back to the game, the characters that portray the different warships are often done by different artists. Even some characters that receive their Kai-ni (Upgrade), sometimes or rather, most of the time get their in-game art changed rather drastically. For example, Hibiki kai receiving her kai-ni to become Verniy. Her art changes. (Not an anime spoiler, chill). Back to the art, it\'s a refresher for me, to be honest. Coming back to the game to play day after day and seeing the small amount of progress and then comparing it to the mountain of exp you need to remodel them is a pain in the a** really. So getting to watch this anime and see what they did with the characters is a nice breather. TL:DR Art - It\'s a nice change of pace to players, and personally, I don\'t have much against it even if I weren\'t so used to the in-game art.The sound also gets a 7. The in-game sounds are so repetitive that I just mute it because f*** me if I\'m gonna sit through 3-2 grinding with it. Also, in-game music is the same. For the anime though, there are multitudes of different sounds and music that -kind of- bring the anime across to the audience. There are few, if no times where the anime wasn\'t moving forward. The music enriches and enhances the anime and really helps it move along. At the same time though, there are one or two times where the music didn\'t help create the atmosphere needed to for example, present a big, bad guy. A lot of cheery bits, really. A LOT, of cheery bits. TL:DR Sound - The anime\'s music and sounds are a massive change of pace for players of the game, at least that\'s what I think. If you don\'t play the game though, it\'s still really good. One thing I wish they\'d add though, the groaning of metal once in a while would be nice, for example, when they\'re evading, or getting hit.Characters in this anime, I have to give a 9. It\'s my biased point of view, and I refuse to change my scoring of it for any reason at all. My reason for giving this anime\'s characters a 9 is, simply, because I finally get to see the KC girls become animated. I was pretty hyped when they announced the anime was finally going into making. If I were unbiased, and watched this from a point-of-view of someone who hasn\'t played the game, there really is very little character development at all. The primary characters, sure, get a bit of development but it doesn\'t really go far at all. I get a sense that this anime was made to satisfy the hunger of KC players who wanted to see their premium ship waifus become animated. I am, sadly, a part of that group. TL:DR Characters - Fantastic to see them become animated, really. My only wish would have to be to give them each a better background and development. Really, some pretty important ships in the game become background characters in the anime. It sucks. (Here\'s to wishing your favourite waifu is animated.)I didn\'t enjoy the anime as much as I wish I could\'ve, so I give it a 7. I\'m not exactly saying that it was s*** either. It was fantastic fun to get to watch the girls become animated but at the same time, I was bummed that they didn\'t have their original art from the game. I understand that it\'d be pretty out-of-place if their art styles differed from each other, so I\'ll leave it at that. One final thing that really kind of gets me in the nerve. The planes that the carriers, aviation cruisers, etc, are piloted by \'fairies\'. Google \'Kantai Collection Fairies\' for a preview. Their little chibi characters with slits for eyes and are about only as tall as your hand. Back to the fairies. They are the ones that fly the aircraft presumably, because even the PV of the anime showed so. Right about now, you\'re probably thinking, \'Oh, what a cute little addition they added!\'. Then, you see the aerial combat of the anime and watch as the Zeroes and Torpedo Bombers get shot down by those alien things, THEN the realization hits you. I\'ll leave it to you to imagine what\'s happening inside those cockpits. TL:DR Enjoyment - Pretty fun, though the anime does sometimes slap you in the face with hidden brutalities the animators stealthily hid this \'cheerful\' game adaptation.Overall, 7. Really. I\'ve not much else to say about it. My point of view on this anime would really differ from those who didn\'t watch it but then again, there are people who play the game like I do and just give it a straight 10 because it\'s an adaptation of their \'assumable\', favourite game. Anyways, Kantai Collection. Those who know and play Kantai Collection (KC) should know what the characters are like in the game.

It\'s my biased point of view, and I refuse to change my scoring of it for any reason at all. My reason for giving this anime\'s characters a 9 is, simply, because I finally get to see the KC girls become animated. I was pretty hyped when they announced the anime was finally going into making. If I were unbiased, and watched this from a point-of-view of someone who hasn\'t played the game, there really is very little character development at all. The primary characters, sure, get a bit of development but it doesn\'t really go far at all. I get a sense that this anime was made to satisfy the hunger of KC players who wanted to see their premium ship waifus become animated. I am, sadly, a part of that group. TL:DR Characters - Fantastic to see them become animated, really. My only wish would have to be to give them each a better background and development. Really, some pretty important ships in the game become background characters in the anime. It sucks. (Here\'s to wishing your favourite waifu is animated.)I didn\'t enjoy the anime as much as I wish I could\'ve, so I give it a 7. I\'m not exactly saying that it was s*** either. It was fantastic fun to get to watch the girls become animated but at the same time, I was bummed that they didn\'t have their original art from the game. I understand that it\'d be pretty out-of-place if their art styles differed from each other, so I\'ll leave it at that. One final thing that really kind of gets me in the nerve. The planes that the carriers, aviation cruisers, etc, are piloted by \'fairies\'. Google \'Kantai Collection Fairies\' for a preview. Their little chibi characters with slits for eyes and are about only as tall as your hand. Back to the fairies. They are the ones that fly the aircraft presumably, because even the PV of the anime showed so. Right about now, you\'re probably thinking, \'Oh, what a cute little addition they added!\'. Then, you see the aerial combat of the anime and watch as the Zeroes and Torpedo Bombers get shot down by those alien things, THEN the realization hits you. I\'ll leave it to you to imagine what\'s happening inside those cockpits. TL:DR Enjoyment - Pretty fun, though the anime does sometimes slap you in the face with hidden brutalities the animators stealthily hid this \'cheerful\' game adaptation.Overall, 7. Really. I\'ve not much else to say about it. My point of view on this anime would really differ from those who didn\'t watch it but then again, there are people who play the game like I do and just give it a straight 10 because it\'s an adaptation of their \'assumable\', favourite game.', ""I shall preface this review by stating the fact that I have not played KanColle, and have extremely poor knowledge of World War II era planes, as well as events during the Pacific Theatre of that war, and this may have potentially detracted from my experience, but I digress.KanColle is a SoL about the browser game of the same name, involving a group of anthropomorphised Japanese WWII-era warships who must fight against some alien creatures. The story for the most part takes place from the perspective of Fubuki, who is not as skilled as her comrades, but is determined to improve herself, largely out of...admiration for Akagi. However, here lays one of KanColle's predominant shortcomings - there is a very large cast of characters and it is safe to assume a player of the game would like to see their favourite ship in action, but this is the problem. When you've got 12 episodes, and a very large cast of characters, the end result is a small amount of characters who retain a large amount of screentime, whereas the rest see next to none, and this is quite problematic due to the fact it often becomes a bit of a jumbled mess of characters, none of which the viewer comes to particularly care about. Additionally, the characters that are given significant screentime aren't the most in-depth either, with the show often relying on simple catchphrases and uninteresting formulaic quirks, rather than anything particularly substantial. I can't really think of anything major about any of the characters, beyond Kongou speaking in Engrish a lot and Yuudachi ending all her sentences with 'poi'.But this isn't all KanColle rests on, it's a story of two halves - the moe and character interactions, but also the action, so how does the action fare? All things considered, I'd say quite well. The show does make considerable usage of CGI (which I found less intrusive than I normally do, I theorise due to the fact all the fighting takes place in water, so it doesn't look as out of place). The action isn't anything to write home about, it's serviceable, but also a bit forgettable, and I'd say this could apply to the entirety of KanColle. It's not bad by any means, but it's just all too average to really keep you excited or emotionally invested or anything. Oddly enough, the finale, which should be expected to be the strongest episode, I'd wager to be the weakest. Climaxing with a recreation of the Battle of Midway, no doubt the most important battle for the IJN or Japan as a whole during the war, it was all a bit underwhelming. You really don't get a strong feel for the huge scale of the battle, and I'm not going to critique the lack of historical accuracy, as ultimately the only thing KanColle has in common with actual naval battles of WW2 are the names of the ships, but it just seemed an awfully poor missed opportunity. It's just so commonplace for any action series to have a huge battle at the end, wherein the main character(s) emerge victorious and celebrate, but it hardly felt any different to the minor skirmishes they'd engaged in beforehand.The film, titled KanColle: The Movie, is unfortunately more of the same. Perhaps a little more organised than the anime in terms of usage of characters (i.e. who gets placed in, and when) and more action-oriented than the original, but it too isn't anything special.All in all, KanColle's just average. I'd say that whatever it is you want to see, you've probably got a stronger alternative, but if it does look as though it appeals to you, then you'll most likely get what it is you expect, if you are who I presume the main target audience for this to be, and players of the game, and just want to see your favourite ship in animated form, then I think it's good enough, you'll get what you want. But for everyone else, it's not got much of a saving grace. admiration for Akagi.

But for everyone else, it's not got much of a saving grace."", 'My first ever review on MAL goes to my favorite fandom to be a part of. This is not just a review of the Kancolle anime, but Kantai Collection as a franchise, because in order to understand why the anime is good, you must understand Kancolle in its entirety. Don\'t worry- Ill be sure to explain everything and how it pertains to the anime. I hope to those who read this it will allow you to look over all the hate this anime receives and understand why it can be a good show.First, a preliminary. If you don\'t know, Kantai Collection (Kancolle) is based off...of a Japanese web browser game of the same name where anthropomorphic WWll era warship girls (called Kanmusu) are the main cast. The game was launched in 2013, and has had an extremely large following since then, growing to over 3 million players. The game is solely based on micromanagement of your fleet in attacking bots, PVP, and going on expeditions. The game has no strategic gameplay, and focuses heavily on RNG.The reason why this anime receives so much unwanted hate is simple: it is a show for the fans and playerbase of Kantai Collection.Kancolle is only available to play in Japan and it would make sense why almost no one in any other part of the world likes the anime. There are some like me who have done the necessary requirements to be able to play the game outside of Japan, and as an avid player and follower of the fanbase I realize this anime would look like something that was haphazardly thrown together. It is extremely surprising that they would actually do a dub for the show, as most of Kancolle\'s players are situated in Japan. To a dedicated Kantai Collection player however, this anime is a godsend to the fanbase in so many areas.Lets begin with the game, and why it makes the anime so good. As stated before, there is almost no gameplay in Kancolle. The majority of the fun comes from collecting the over 150 fleet girls.  As an admiral, the best part of the game is collecting my ship girls and getting to know each and every one of them. Yes- each ship girl has their own personality. Though some are generic anime stereotypes, it is still fun and exciting to meet the many girls and witness their characteristics and varying personalities. Every admiral grows attached to their shipgirls, and the game even allows marriage to them. When watching the anime, we are finally able to see our favorite shipgirls and theyre personalities in action, from Naka\'s mini concert to Kongou\'s burning love, and even to Sendai\'s spastic love for night battles. After interacting with the girls for so long on a computer screen, it would make sense that longtime fans would be in an uproar over seeing their favorite characters and how they act on TV.One of the best things I commend Kancolle for is the fact that they gave all the original shipgirls in the game a cameo in the anime. Whether it be as a main character, a character in a battle, or someone in the background, every original shipgirl was in the anime. It is very nice to see that Diomedea was able to give the luxury of seeing all the characters the players have grown attached to in the show.Next is the artstyle. Kancolle\'s artstyle varies heavily due to the many artists employed. Some of the characters who were released at the start of the game have VERY low quality artstyles compared to characters that come later on. Fubuki, Akagi, and Kaga are prime examples of this. They\'re artstyle is amazing in the anime compared to how they look in the game. Much more detailed hair, eyes and features are much more clearer than on the game, making the characters really appeal to those who care very much for their ship girls. Even characters whose artstyles aren\'t that bad look amazing in the anime, such as Nagato and Mutsu.The story of this anime can be seen to most people as quite lacking, though this is far from the case. The anime puts context to the game. When beginning the game, you are literally thrown in without having any context of what is happening AT ALL. I believe without a doubt almost all of the people who have scored low for this anime and given it bad reviews are regarding it solely as a military anime. This is not true. As Kancolle grew, it became widespread in many areas, including manga, light novels, and such. Though the game focuses solely on combat, most other media like the manga make the franchise out to look like a slice of life. This is the missing part that most people forget. Kancolle should be regarded as both a Military AND a Slice of Life. The manga and other media tell the tales of the girls at the naval base- doing their own things, interacting with each other and the admiral, playing, and having fun. Those who say that the anime ""doesn\'t have enough battle scenes"" don\'t recognize that Kancolle is not just a mecha musume anymore, but a slice of life about the naval base as well. For example, the Fubuki Ganbarimasu! manga tells of the training the new shipgirls undergo when they reach the naval base. This is the plot of the beginning of the story for her, a part that many find boring.Finally, the anime caters to the player fan base with many small nuances. Almost everything from the game is present in the anime, from one time use items, to character poses resembling their damage states, to the formations. Its the small things that the players notice that make the anime enjoyable.So in retrospect, this anime does not deserve the hate it has been receiving. If you get the chance, look at game play, read the manga, get invested into the Kantai Collection franchise for a couple of days before diving in, because instead of falling in love with the characters and such during the anime, being to like them beforehand, so you can really see how the game and manga influenced everything that happens in the anime.The biggest problem is that everyone is judging the show because they have no idea what is happening. of a Japanese web browser game of the same name where anthropomorphic WWll era warship girls (called Kanmusu) are the main cast.

I can count the ships that strike my heart(read: PP) with my hands. Best two words to describe the arts are ""Potato Farm"".2.

Character wise, similar to art, i can only sympathize or ""click"" with few, since they keep forcing the idea that they, the characters, met miserable ends innocently.

I JUST HAD TO WRITE BECAUSE WRITING IS ALL I DO AT COLLEGE AND NOT EXPRESSING MY OPINION DRIVES ME INSANE. ALSO I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME, SO DON’T HASSLE ABOUT THAT.)We all know that cute girls doing cute things has pretty much been consistently popular in anime since Kyoto Animation made it their selling point back in the mid 2000’s. Now I shall shamelessly admit that I love this genre as much as the next guy, but there has been a longstanding sentiment that people...are starting to get tired of it. So that’s why it seems like there has emerged a reactionary subgenre of cute girls doing decidedly uncute things. Whether it Gen Urobuchi mercilessly killing magical girls in Madoka magica or moeblobs in MUTHAFUCKIN TANKS in Girls und panzer, it seems the optimal way to refresh the formula was to take it to the EXTREME for all the jaded otaku tired of seeing girls drinking tea and/or crying with planet sized eyes.I imagine it is such a subgenre that led to the creation of today’s subject, Kantai Collection(or Kancolle). Adapted from a game that was apparently very popular and produced by an animation studio only really known for the highly controversial Kodomo no Jikan, Kancolle tells the story of cute girls…. who are also ancient Japanese warships! The show tells us that ‘Fleet girls’ are girls who have been born with the souls of ancient warships, and that they are needed to fight a mysterious race of sea demons called ‘Abyssals’. We follow Fubuki, a destroyer that has recently arrived at a naval base ready to fight.Yeah.. that is actually the premise. This may be where the first problem lies, a game doesn’t really need a believable or even consistent premise, but an anime series does a lot more. Then again, Kancolle, with its mixture of cool fights and comedy, perhaps doesn’t want you to take it that seriously, which is acceptable. The main plot is a mixture of naval action and slice of life elements. This is a combination that I personally adore in a show but I have to question whether it was pulled off effectively here.It moves slowly at first, letting us get to know the characters and mechanics, and following Fubuki as she learns more about her mission and attempts to grow stronger. However, just once it gets up to speed, the show throws filler episodes in the mix, which while entertaining, did not bode well for a 12 episode series. The mix of slice of life and action has to feel natural and not like the creators decided to suddenly switch gears because they thought you were getting bored. This harms the pacing and makes it harder to care about what it going on in the long run. Another thing is that in the show’s downtime, the comedy and character interaction isn’t all up to snuff, meaning you’ll often be wishing for something to happen.When the action scenes do kick into gear, they can be pretty tense, and the stakes are clearly shown, with little plot armor or deus ex machinas being used to cheat their way out of a fight. Despite the fact that we never really learn anything about the abyssals, they are pretty menacing and make for some good fights. When it comes to the drama, the show does make a good effort in attempting to get me to care, but these elements were too lightly spiced onto the mix to be effective. Things like Mutsuki’s arc from episodes 3 and 4 and Akagi’s arc near the end are able to shed some light on the characters and give us some reasons to care about how they fare in their fight against the abyssals, but not enough focus was given to this for it to be a prominent part of the show, as it was diluted by mediocre comedy and boring character interactions. Overall, this leads to a show which is entertaining, but lacks the tools to be truly engaging.The characters are many, and as such I forgot who many of them were. There is Fubuki’s squad, the other squads, the carriers, the higher ups and many more. I will give the show credit in managing to cram so many distinct characters into a measly 12 episodes, but they pay a heavy price for doing so. If you can keep track of these characters, you will pick up a surface level understanding of who they are, but that is exactly ALL you get, never does the show have time to dig any deeper into these ship girls. When the show uses its characters for some good drama(like in episodes 3+4 as I previously mentioned) it can be fairly competent but most of the time it doesn’t bother. This leads to many of the characters being pretty one note and bland. Fubuki is the spunky but shy protagonist who will keep training until senpai notices her, Mutsuki and Yuudachi are just ditzy best friends, Akagi is a wise mentor with a troubled past and Kongou is completely insane. If the show had more time or less characters, maybe this wouldn’t be a problem, but it is as it stands, and a fairly damning one too.The character designs and setting are mostly pretty dull, you can sometimes get confused which characters are which because of the multitude of them present, but the show at least tries to give unique designs to each girl. But hey it's what you expect, long flowing hair, school uniforms(for some reason?) and big moe eyes, but lacking in the originality or distinctness that make good moe designs. The animation is unsurprisingly kept to a minimum for the most part and movement is pretty limited(this is moe, who needs movement?). The exception to this is pretty obviously when the show wants to wow you with its gun porn.. I mean fight scenes. Here they pull out all the smooth water animations, gun animations, torpedo animations and EXTREME WIND BLOWY HAIR MOVEMENT. But this is to be expected from a show of this nature, and its not like it looks Ufotable or Madhouse levels of extreme sakuga usage.Music is pretty chill, but it doesn’t really have anything to compliment apart from the fight scenes. The music for most of the SOL aspects is just your usual light sounding tonky lounge music that usually is meant to compliment the comedy and light tone, which doesn’t work here on account of how boring these scenes are. The music in the fight scenes is of the “let's use an orchestra to be all dramatic” variety which is a shame because the game has face melting guitar as its battle theme from what I have heard, so why couldn’t we get some of that? The opening is also a fairly dull song, apart from the hilarious misheard lyric of “WANKERRRRRRRRRR” and I don’t even remember the ending so it can’t have been great.One thing I will say is that the voice acting is pretty impressive, mainly because many of the seiyus portray multiple characters, and manage to give them all distinct tones, which in moe is no easy task. They appear to be really TRYING to make the show more funny or dramatic, but sometimes it is the tools, not the workman at fault.In conclusion this show is either a heavily botched game adaptation or just a really boring moe show, it's dull and predictable but I honestly can’t say anything worse about it. You can tell it attempts to be something but ultimately cannot save itself from being nothing, the curse of bad moe shows if you will. Come to think of it, why did I even review this? they say mediocrities are the worst thing for a critic, then I guess that makes me some kind of intellectual masochist. are starting to get tired of it. So that’s why it seems like there has emerged a reactionary subgenre of cute girls doing decidedly uncute things. Whether it Gen Urobuchi mercilessly killing magical girls in Madoka magica or moeblobs in MUTHAFUCKIN TANKS in Girls und panzer, it seems the optimal way to refresh the formula was to take it to the EXTREME for all the jaded otaku tired of seeing girls drinking tea and/or crying with planet sized eyes.I imagine it is such a subgenre that led to the creation of today’s subject, Kantai Collection(or Kancolle). Adapted from a game that was apparently very popular and produced by an animation studio only really known for the highly controversial Kodomo no Jikan, Kancolle tells the story of cute girls…. who are also ancient Japanese warships! The show tells us that ‘Fleet girls’ are girls who have been born with the souls of ancient warships, and that they are needed to fight a mysterious race of sea demons called ‘Abyssals’. We follow Fubuki, a destroyer that has recently arrived at a naval base ready to fight.Yeah.. that is actually the premise. This may be where the first problem lies, a game doesn’t really need a believable or even consistent premise, but an anime series does a lot more. Then again, Kancolle, with its mixture of cool fights and comedy, perhaps doesn’t want you to take it that seriously, which is acceptable. The main plot is a mixture of naval action and slice of life elements. This is a combination that I personally adore in a show but I have to question whether it was pulled off effectively here.It moves slowly at first, letting us get to know the characters and mechanics, and following Fubuki as she learns more about her mission and attempts to grow stronger. However, just once it gets up to speed, the show throws filler episodes in the mix, which while entertaining, did not bode well for a 12 episode series. The mix of slice of life and action has to feel natural and not like the creators decided to suddenly switch gears because they thought you were getting bored. This harms the pacing and makes it harder to care about what it going on in the long run. Another thing is that in the show’s downtime, the comedy and character interaction isn’t all up to snuff, meaning you’ll often be wishing for something to happen.When the action scenes do kick into gear, they can be pretty tense, and the stakes are clearly shown, with little plot armor or deus ex machinas being used to cheat their way out of a fight. Despite the fact that we never really learn anything about the abyssals, they are pretty menacing and make for some good fights. When it comes to the drama, the show does make a good effort in attempting to get me to care, but these elements were too lightly spiced onto the mix to be effective. Things like Mutsuki’s arc from episodes 3 and 4 and Akagi’s arc near the end are able to shed some light on the characters and give us some reasons to care about how they fare in their fight against the abyssals, but not enough focus was given to this for it to be a prominent part of the show, as it was diluted by mediocre comedy and boring character interactions. Overall, this leads to a show which is entertaining, but lacks the tools to be truly engaging.The characters are many, and as such I forgot who many of them were. There is Fubuki’s squad, the other squads, the carriers, the higher ups and many more. I will give the show credit in managing to cram so many distinct characters into a measly 12 episodes, but they pay a heavy price for doing so. If you can keep track of these characters, you will pick up a surface level understanding of who they are, but that is exactly ALL you get, never does the show have time to dig any deeper into these ship girls. When the show uses its characters for some good drama(like in episodes 3+4 as I previously mentioned) it can be fairly competent but most of the time it doesn’t bother. This leads to many of the characters being pretty one note and bland. Fubuki is the spunky but shy protagonist who will keep training until senpai notices her, Mutsuki and Yuudachi are just ditzy best friends, Akagi is a wise mentor with a troubled past and Kongou is completely insane. If the show had more time or less characters, maybe this wouldn’t be a problem, but it is as it stands, and a fairly damning one too.The character designs and setting are mostly pretty dull, you can sometimes get confused which characters are which because of the multitude of them present, but the show at least tries to give unique designs to each girl. But hey it's what you expect, long flowing hair, school uniforms(for some reason?) and big moe eyes, but lacking in the originality or distinctness that make good moe designs. The animation is unsurprisingly kept to a minimum for the most part and movement is pretty limited(this is moe, who needs movement?). The exception to this is pretty obviously when the show wants to wow you with its gun porn.. I mean fight scenes. Here they pull out all the smooth water animations, gun animations, torpedo animations and EXTREME WIND BLOWY HAIR MOVEMENT. But this is to be expected from a show of this nature, and its not like it looks Ufotable or Madhouse levels of extreme sakuga usage.Music is pretty chill, but it doesn’t really have anything to compliment apart from the fight scenes.

The first season was a serious action typebar .  The opening song of this season was not good but the ending song was very beautiful.  And many of the scenes were so beautiful that they are unforgettable.  I am very surprised to see the bravery of all the girls here. I especially like the work of the rest of the team led by Fubuki San.  Not only that, the other two Yuudachi San & Mutsuki who were with Fubuki San also fought very bravely.  The BGMs used...in some episodes of this series were terrible.But the saddest thing to see is the drowning scene of Kisaragi San.  A bomb dropped on her head by an enemy plane hit her directly on the head and drowned her.  At first, when Kisaragi San was promising Mutsuki San that we would meet again, I thought something was going to happen. Later, Mutsuki San waited for his beloved Kisaragi San for approximately 3 days from morning to evening.  Later suddenly Fubuki San came and to tell the truth the two started crying very loudly.  At this moment I could not hold back my tears.  To be honest, if a good character dies tragically in an episode, it feels very bad to me. However, in the end, I don\'t want to minimize it by marking it on MAL.  It is a very nice series.I recommend to watch it.Now coming to the movie, it first shows that Kisaragi San is back. Then I  leave a little half. It was nice to see Mutsuki San\'s reaction after seeing her after a long time. But later when I found out that she is actually Abyssal (actually, I couldn\'t catch the correct word. If it\'s wrong, please comment). It means that she will not stay with that team. Then I felt a little different. In fact, I saw where a girl\'s voice was coming from,everyone went out to search for it. Finally, Fubuki San went to the main place where no one can go. All the enemies were finished in an instant with her skills.  This time I saw a tragic scene.  First I told about Kisaragi San, she also disappeared with them.  To be honest, watching the same scene twice in season one and this movie is too much painful.I was very patient.  Finally the ending song was very good.But at the very end of the movie, Kisaragi San\'s scene is shown again where she is unharmed. Here I have a question. Is Kisaragi San really came back?Is she alive?Or is it Mutsuki San\'s imagination?I was very interested to see what would happen next.  Accordingly, I started watching the second season. At first I was surprised to hear its opening song.  It seems that the singer has sung this song very sadly. My question is, why is the opening song so sad? Then the episode goes on.  But the surprising thing is that Shigure san is showing up here from the beginning.  Didn\'t show Fubuki San, didn\'t show Mutsuki San. Also Akagi,Kaga,Yuudachi,Nagato etc- didn\'t show in this season.  Is this season not related to the first season and the movie? Is Shigure San the main character in this season??  I really don\'t understand.  It would be nice if someone told me clearly.In conclusion, I like all the ""fighting scene with bravely"" in this whole series.  Loved the shooting of the planes.  The whole series were like a world war scene. in some episodes of this series were terrible.But the saddest thing to see is the drowning scene of Kisaragi San.

The whole series were like a world war scene.', ""I began to watch KanColle when it was airing, and then dropped it until it was fully released.  I decided to do a review of the anime as a stand-alone media type, or rather a perspective from a first time viewer with very little knowledge of the game.As a standalone anime it is fairly mediocre but still entertaining, like Strike Witches, Girls und Panzer, and Sky Girls, this anime attempts to mix moe girls with machines drawing fairly niche audiences and rampant skepticism from onlookers.It has several major downsides however, which makes this anime more niche than usual and directed...toward players of the game.Firstly the large cast of characters can be difficult to follow, especially since there is no singular naval uniform or main cast (aside from Fubuki and her roomies).   I feel the scenes with the main character interacting with most of the fleet were a little unnecessary, or at least should have had cute introductory captions for each character introduced to Fubuki (see the Negima anime by Shaft).  Over the show you come to grow attached to characters, so it doesn't feel lacking in main character development, but certain groups of ship girls are recurring on-screen without proper introduction or screen time (like the Heavy Cruisers, you know that one blonde one with enormous... guns..).The second major problem lies in the 3D graphics as well as the visual inconsistencies in the anime.  Let's be real here, the 3D looks atrocious next to the hand-drawn anime, and was much less noticeable in Girls und Panzer, and was completely accepted in Expelled from Paradise (which is all 3D so you just gotta suck it up) but in KanColle it's easily noticed and looks like it was made in MMD.  They could have easily come out with an OVA with amazing battle graphics, but instead went for the 12 episode with okay graphics.My final complaint is a nitpicky one about the anime continuity, which could probably be easily explained in the game, but again this review is from the viewpoint of the anime as standalone content.  This part contains --spoilers--The equipping of the ships is seen as purely mechanical, except for the few times when it's not?  Example, when Akagi equips and then her arrows magically appear in her quiver.  Or when Fubuki is trying to get Yamato in the water and all of a sudden she is wearing her  rigging.  Or, when Nagato joins the battle in her rigging only and suddenly she has her full guns?  Small things like these just don't make sense when they make a big point of the girls getting ready with the assistance of machines.  Strike Witches also had the magical and mechanical element, but it was very clear what both elements could do.  --end spoilers--On the whole, this is another mediocre anime that is still entertaining enough to watch the whole way through, but if they wanted to make it more open to non-game players they should have reduced the cast and clarified the world better.  If they only wanted it for the niche players, they really should have just gone all out and done the beach training episodes and justify to themselves moe ships. toward players of the game.Firstly the large cast of characters can be difficult to follow, especially since there is no singular naval uniform or main cast (aside from Fubuki and her roomies).

It\'s like the idiom, Jack of all trade but master of none. Kancolle tried to tackle multiple genre but succeeded in none.[[Note: Spoilers might be included]]Personal rant belowKantai Collection, or Kancolle for short, is an attempt by a company to create an anime out of a game just like Hollywood creating Dragonball Z out of Dragonball. An attempt to make something that is ""original"" yet ""fun"" but ended up failing at...both. The problem is that Kantai Collection tried too hard to do everything.I am speaking this from someone who plays the game, this anime is horrible if it is trying to teach a person about a game. This isn\'t like Pokemon, where the earlier episodes managed to tell you what the Pokemon is along with its mechanics.  If they are trying to explain about the game, they\'ll need to make the anime more ""militaristic"" as that\'s what Kancolle is: A spreadsheet simulation with naval battle theme. Or at least try and explain, even if it\'s crazy (e.g. Bucket bath), some mechanics in the game. Kancolle didn\'t do any.The story clearly shows that the directors don\'t know what path they want the anime to go with. It\'s like watching an indecisive kid.  It has a mix between slice-of-life and comedy with an underlying ""seriousness"" smashed into each episode somewhere near the end just to try and remind the viewers that the story is still serious.Now comes the part that is probably the reason why they continue watching Kancolle: CHARACTERS. Oh boy! Look at all these waifus you can get. But jokes aside, these characters and set-up are a mess. You have the main character that seems to always get the center-of-attention and get out of trouble (Fubuki), the comic relief (Yuudachi), and the try-to-be-serious-but-isn\'t (Mutsuk). Kitakami and Ooi are only there for daily lesbian service and all other characters are forgettable. How forgettable you might ask?

I wrote this review for those who basically not play the game and newcomer who want to know what moefication is.This anime performing ship girls (kanmusu) that fight against their enemy called Abbysal fleet. Ship girls are moefication character that adapted from World War II warships, especially form Imperial Japanese Navy. When first time I watched this anime, I didnt even understand what kind of anime is this. Some girls fight against monster on...the sea. But then I realize that this is a slice of life anime that focus on a new special type destroyer(moefication version of course) that join on a naval base, while she is never join a battle.The character development is some kind of point of interest here, where an unskilled ship girl what to become just like her friends. She kept training every day, hoping some day she can fight in the same fleet with her admired seniors. So you can enjoy a lot of motivative quotes from this anime, then change your view, maybe.One that I didnt understand when first time watched this anime is... WHO THE HELL WAS THE ADMIRAL?In this anime the admiral's face not shown and we wont know if the admiral is male or female. Then after I played the game, I know the admiral was WE. Yes, we whom organized the naval base in the game.This anime used 2 kind of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 3D animation used for the battle scenes, and the other just like anime in general.I belive many people love the opening song and so do I. MIIRO by Akino from bless4 was very macth the concept of this anime, the the ending song, Fubuki by Shiena Nishizawa, if you search for the lyrics you'll find that its contain the names of Fubuki-class destroyer.The story wasnt highlighted here.Overall maybe for those who have played the game before they would be upset. But for who not play the game yet, you will learn many kind of motive for your life that maybe good for you the sea.

So to somewhat be a contrarian for the sake of making myself seem more important, I\'ll state that I think there are more problems with the show than it just being a bad adaption of a browser game story or being too literal of an adaption of said story and thus displeasing ""mainstream"" anime audience goers in favor of diehard players of the game. I actually think the problems with this show runs much deeper than that. Well... As...deep as a show about animu girl warships can be, which is about the depth of a bowl of ramen, but still I think this is worth examining because I have literally nothing else to do with my time.For those who don\'t know Kantai Collection or Kancolle is a browser game that got adapted into an anime. The incredibly deep story of the show is that warships which are represented by human girls are fighting an unknown threat called ""Abyssals"" that come from somewhere deep at sea and start attacking coastal cities or something like that. The abyssals are also animu girl warships but they\'re made to look just evil enough to make your brain connect the association between evil and this ""character,"" but not enough that you would find them unattractive. I mean let\'s not get crazy here. The cliche nature of the story becomes apparent really quick, but even that isn\'t why this show ends up being bad either. Before I get into why I think it ends up being bad though I want you to imagine for a second what a show like this could do to milk content for it\'s story, and by that I mean a story aiming for mediocrity and not something even aiming for anything close to being good let alone greatness. The way I see it there are about four easy ways this show could have milked some easy content out of it\'s initial premise:1. It could focus on the relationships between the characters and/or their own internal(self) conflicts.2. It could focus it\'s content around the cuteness of the girl warships and layercake the fanservice.3. It could focus it\'s content on the strategy of the ship battles or more generically on the action therein.4. It could aim especially low and go for common tropes in similar anime shows and genres.Well to a certain extent you can say it attempts some of each of these easy ways to milk content, but what I think the true failure of this show is and what makes it bad regardless of it being a game adaption is it fails to really live up to any of these four easy ways of making a show like this work. So lets examine each one and see how it didn\'t quite live up to it\'s premise in these ways, I mean if you want to I guess.Take most basic writing courses any where and one of the first things you\'ll learn about writing a fictional story is that characterization is key and by that, if you want your story to feel real you have to have your character\'s doing believable and relatable things within the context of the story they\'re in and on top of that they have to have personality\'s with traits and quirks that also make sense within the context of a story. There are other aspects to writing a story sure, but generally the characters desires and their actions are what drive a story, so this is a pretty important thing to get right. If I had to say it tried to live up to any of the four things I listed above it would be this one and by that I mean they tried to make the shows main drive the characters and their conflicts between each other, rather than rely on most of the other aspects of this premise. The problem with the characters in this show though is that none of them act or behave the way they should given the situation that they\'re in but it\'s actually worse than just getting things wrong because I would say another major problem is that despite their clear leaning on character conflict to drive the story is the sheer amount of character and character buildup they omit and leave undeveloped.Let me give a minor spoiler as what I\'m about to say happens in the first episode, a character dies. As expected other characters respond to this characters death with sadness, but the sadness of her death doesn\'t really make sense in a lot of ways. The show like a lot of badly written anime has a tendency for being overly dramatic and it is never quite as well illustrated as it is with this early death. One of the characters is almost catatonically in denial about the other girls death for over three or four episodes. Now maybe the two characters are really close... But we\'re never shown that. This is another problem I have with this early death in this show and a trope I have noticed in a lot of eastern media I call ""Tragedy in an instant"" we\'re expected to feel the weight and emotional seriousness of a tragedy with people we have no real connection with yet and don\'t really know about the connections of to really feel anything about. Now it\'s possible I\'m just not empathic enough and everyone else on earth feels intense sadness over random instantaneous fictional deaths of characters, I\'m admitting there is some subjectivity here to say the least, but I think that even if you want an abrupt early death in a show there are ways of building up emotional weight and a feeling of loss for that character and I simply think this show failed to utilize any kind of emotional depth in trying to get us to care. I don\'t know why this character should matter to me other than in the most abstract ways possible. The bigger problem though is that it doesn\'t really make sense for the characters in universe to care as much as they do either. Now keep in mind my stating of the initial premise these girls are warships fighting a supposed large mysterious existential threat that might very well be the end of their civilization and yet they seem not to be familiar with death or it\'s consequences in this universe. The problem with this shows character\'s then is that it required more gritty and battle hardened people than it had, but it didn\'t want to go that route because grittiness and realism has a tendency to nerf the ""sexy"" cliches they\'re trying to paint by numbers into this plot like naive and happy go lucky girls. People that are constantly being attacked by a threat tend to not be very happy go lucky or naive, they tend to be filled with trauma, anxiety and are more settled into being ""prepared"" for a threat then they\'re trying to live a regular every day life. They also have a coldness towards the death of those around them, because they have seen it happen before, so they know to stay just caring and detached enough not to mourn everyone like it\'s the first time. Consider the denizens of other shows with a similar premise to this like Evangelion or Attack on Titan, in both shows a mysterious threat has started attacking people from some unknown point of origin and the attacks are constant and vicious and whatever else you or I might have to say about those shows in the positive and negative, the one thing I think they both did right was the characters personalities reflect the harsh circumstances they\'re in and by extension the whole of the shows societies and world seems geared towards surviving these threats. This is one of the major ways in which Kantai fails big time. There is an ""abyssal"" sized divide between their personalities of the characters and the way their society is structured and the seriousness of the threat they\'re supposed to be facing.A person defending this show might say ""Well of course it isn\'t like those shows, it\'s not trying to be that serious!"" I can agree to an extent that not every show with this type of premise has to be extremely serious or gritty and the scenario I outlined above is not the only one an anime or fiction in general has to take. In fact I can think of a lot of Anime shows that manage to balance a similarly serious premise with light hearted tones and comedy rather well. Hunter X Hunter, Gurren Lagann and Detective Conan come to mind for me and I can list a lot of others, the problem with Kantai isn\'t just that the serious moments aren\'t taken seriously enough. It\'s that there isn\'t enough (good) comedy and the light hearted moments are bland or nonsensical given the characters and the situations they\'re in. One of the only episodes that isn\'t just about the ships doing lame ship and game related things is about a curry contest... Now taken by itself it\'s not the worst premise for a random episode of a Nihon cartoon to have. The problem is this is about the only thing we ever see them do aside from swimming for no reason before a battle and swimming for no reason before a battle and feeling slightly sad, swimming for no reason before a battle and trying to get an unused powerful battleship to swim with you and then swimming for no reason before a battle and asking questions about the ""admiral."" I can imagine humanoid ship women doing a lot of things, I can even justify some of the overuse of swimming and ocean related scenes with no purpose given their ship nature, but the ""curry"" episode being the only only odd episode out where we see them doing anything else just illustrates the absurdity of the whole premise to an absolute boiling point. Either make it consistently about these ship women and their struggles in this ""war"" or use everyday tasks like a curry episode to illustrate differences between their personalities and push the war much further into the background. Make the show much more light hearted and less centered around the games threat and mechanics. If they wanted the show to be more about the girls personalities, more anime trope like episodes like a curry contest should have been employed here to illustrate these things. Instead what we get in lieu of that is pointless bickering, snobby and tsundere ship women denying the obvious usefulness of other girls in the fleet and not an interesting personality or arc of development among them. Instead of using the curry episode to develop the characters more it\'s yet another opportunity for this. In an even slightly better show an episode like that might show that one girl is a perfectionist in her cooking, maybe to an absurd point where she takes instruction so literally it still ends up tasting bad. Maybe by contrast another girl is a heavy improviser and the making her curry shows she\'s a heavy experimenter and less regimented in her ways. Maybe another girl is sloppy, maybe another girl is like me and she is just notoriously bad at cooking no matter what she tries. Maybe the food, spices and compositions of the curry can be reflective of the girls personalities.  What I\'m trying to get at here was even this stupid premise could be utilized to show some of the personalities of characters and move the plot forward here, the problem with this show as this episode especially illustrates, is that it likes to accomplish nothing at light speed. We learn nothing more about the characters that we didn\'t already know from this change of pace and setting that we didn\'t from all of the other more ship oriented task episodes.Every time I think I have hit upon what truly makes this show bad we reach another bedrock of a lack of quality here, but I think now we reached the final depths of the bad writing and that\'s that the characters aren\'t developed enough in general. You could ignore the rest of what I said in the paragraphs above if the characters on their own were well developed and interesting despite their lack of consistency with the setting, the lack of consistent tone and strong establishment of emotions, despite the poor utilization of the situations given etc. The problem is even if we put all that aside, the characters and their core motivations just aren\'t strong enough to carry a show. So we have a main character named Fubuki, a character who to the shows credit is new to this world and they try to make her a lens by which we come to understand the world of Kantai or at least this was what they could have done with this character and I think they were mildly attempting to do so. The problem is she just reacts so stupidly and haphazardly to everything around her that I can\'t really imagine this is what I would be like in this situation. So right off the bat we can\'t identify with the main character of a show... Her personality is also not markedly differently enough from the other girls to warrant her being a POV character for the audience. Most of the girls have the same\'ish bland slightly happy personality. We meet one or two tsunderes and even they aren\'t extreme enough to play off most of the shows poor characters. People complain that the show has too many characters and I think that could be the reason for some of the shows problems but the real problem is that we don\'t have a cohesive few characters we follow and see developing character arcs and traits develop for over the course of the show. There are other shows with a gigantic cast of characters that still make you care at least a little bit by showing how they relate to the main characters. All the characters in this show relate to Fubuki by virtue of the fact that they\'re another ship and their personalities aren\'t developed much or utilized to tell us anything about her or themselves in any way other than that. So the number of characters isn\'t the problem, it is the poor execution in using them that is.A lot of blood and ink is spilt around the idea of ""fanservice"" and whether it is moral or not and whether it is good content or not, regardless of it\'s moral character. Whatever you may personally think about that, in a browser game and in an anime show centered around girls like this the appeal of fanservice to a large part of the audience is undeniable. I mean let\'s get real here folks, You either really like warships to watch a show like this or because the majority of the audience is not military enthusiasts I\'m guessing you like women in skimpy outfits. I\'ll be flat out honest and say what drew me initially to this show was seeing pictures of the characters and I wasn\'t admiring their battleship parts, well maybe just a little, I mean those guns... That embarrassing bit of trivia aside, unless you happen to be a  dead serious military strategist who can somehow get over the fact that the ships are animu girls facing each other, the appeal of them being cute girls is going to have more to do with you wanting to watch this for most people, and I have to say on this front the show is a disappointment. I\'ve seen shows with much better stories, that don\'t need the filler content of women tripping over their own shoe so they can show a pantsu shot that still had more fanservice than this show. So in the most rudimentary way a show like this could give you even the most basest of pleasures and filler content it manages to not really do much. There are a few basic scenes of them in bathing suits, a bath area where they repair themselves and a few random excuses for extravagant outfits, but I think a person would reasonably expect a lot more than what you end up with concerning this if you have watched any similar anime and know absolutely anything about the culture of it. I\'ll have more to say about the lack of variety concerning this show and outfits and changes of setting later, but the main point you should note here is, is that even the most basic clichéd worthless and lazy slice of life/school club type of show does more with that than this show does.There is a somewhat bizarre scene where one of the ships is being tickled by some invisible hands that I\'m assuming is a thing that happens in the game, but the way it\'s shown it just ends up looking more weird and contextless than funny, sexy or whatever tone they were trying to convey with it. Which is another problem with this anime in general, the attempt to make the girls look sexy sometimes but they don\'t actually do anything that would constitute being ""sexy."" Now I guess there is a subjective threshold here and some things that might be intended to be a specific tone or way just might not resonate with me for whatever reason. For example I really like the show Cowboy Beebop and despite really liking the character and them doing rather obvious scenes with her that were intended to be fan servicey for their time I never really found Faye Valentine all that sexy or sexually appealing for some reason. I\'m not exactly sure why nor do I think going on this tangent would be very fruitful or important, but what I know about Beebop that I didn\'t necessarily get any vibes or intentional nods to from Kantai was whether they\'re even trying to entice people with their fanservice. At the very least with Faye her writing and characterization was clear enough that I could tell what they were intending to do that with her and not intending it with other characters even if their intentions didn\'t work with me in this particular way. As I said in the first section the characterization and the animation in Kantai don\'t really convey an intentional tone or idea of what we\'re supposed to think of these characters and the situations they\'re in most of the time and this broader problem is the best illustrated by their lack of an attempt to even appeal to us in the easiest way possible and when I think they were trying they still failed.While I\'m loosely talking about aesthetics, I\'ll say that the animation is pretty average, it doesn\'t do anything really bad and it\' doesn\'t do anything extremely good. I\'ll say in it\'s slight favor that unlike a lot of crap anime shows it never starts getting confusing with it\'s editing and it\'s action scenes. Conversely though nothing is very visually exciting and basically no risks are taken. I will say to the shows slight credit that the characters are represented well from what I know of their illustrated versions in game and there aren\'t any obvious messups like some animes do with weird disjointed spike hair, eyes too big or small for a face or tube leg/arm syndrome.I can also say that I honestly don\'t remember the music on this show at all, if it had a soundtrack it had no impact on me what so ever. A sure sign that anime show is bad is that when people go to praise the characters they instead start praising the voice actresses non-stop and forget about the characters themselves. Well fair enough to them ladies eastern and western they tried their best but this writing like a sinking ship was unsalvageable.Before we move on I\'ll just say you can condense and formulate my whole brilliant argument of this particular section and possibly my dislike of the whole anime down to one simple complaint, THEY DIDN\'T HAVE ANY HAMAKAZE, WTF? I MEAN WERE YOU EVEN TRYING? SHE IS A SILVER HAIRED ANGEL SENT DOWN BY THE WAIFU GODDESSES TO SINK MY DISGUSTING BATTLESHIP OF A LIFE. JUST ONE SCENE WITH HER WOULD HAVE SAVED THIS, I WATCHED THIS WHOLE DAMN SHOW AND SHE COULDN\'T EVEN SHOW UP ONCE? COME ON... Alright back to our regularly scheduled programming.Lets talk about the third way in which this show could have been good, which was focusing on the strategy aspects of the ships and or more generically the combat. You do see some combat in the show but as I already stated they aren\'t very visually interesting battles but that kind of underlies a broader point that the action in the show is just kind of bland and not very immersive. I think the blandness is easy enough to explain, there are many anime action shows and many with better drawn and more carefully orchestrated battle scenes than this show. The ships are just mostly depicted moving fast and every once in a while they scream things or an explosion occurs. A lot of battles end with crappy deus ex machina situations where a new squadron of ships or one previously unknown or unused powerful ship comes and saves the day relieving all tension the ""threat"" might have had otherwise. Repeat this ad infinitum and we have ourselves every action scene in the show. The lack of immersion comes into play because the threat never feels like a real threat and the battles never feel like a real battle because they lack real action and what they really lack in this department is strategy.There aren\'t scenes of the ships really strategizing or talking about naval strategies, it\'s easy to forget they\'re in a war in this show about ship girls being in a war. The best we get is a few ""practice"" scenes scattered throughout the episodes that don\'t really show them doing anything other than splashing around in water here and there. The ships sometimes talk about ""group composition"" and things like that but during a battle none of this is really utilized well or a elaborated on. I haven\'t played the game, but based off the show I\'m assuming it\'s either a really rudimentary strategy game or a ""card"" game that plays out like a strategy game anyway. So what this show needed was scenes where we see the ships doing serious formations and step by step attacks against the enemy. Like having the fast ships and submarines scouting in the front and long range but slow attackers in the back, carriers and midsized ships in the middle. Basic stuff like that to establish that are protagonists aren\'t complete morons and have some basic knowledge of their capabilities and an idea of what they need to do to ""win."" Girls und Panzer is a show very similar to this one structurally in a lot of ways and while I also didn\'t think that show was that good in strategy and action regard at the very least we see them talking about tank strategies, formations and the use of their specific tanks and abilities in battle. They understood how to utilize the absurd premise of their show at least a little bit better in this regard. We never really get that with Kantai most of the show is again about dumb luck or zerg rushing your opponent.Speaking of Girls und Panzer(GuP) another thing this show could have done that I would argue that GuP did was utilize the tropes in it\'s genre to help manufacture an obvious plot and trajectory for the shows story. GuP was about a school tanking club and by tanks I mean military tanks. ""School club"" is a well worn path in anime and GuP manages to use it to create a structure of competition and some of the obvious drama that can bring. Like sibling rivalry, the rivaling schools international compositions and personalities, the nature of things school clubs do for their school and their own sake ETC. Have an episode where they go on vacation for no reason and where they have to raise money to keep the school club in existence and congratulations you made yourself school club anime number 11473456 slated to release next fall. Kantai doesn\'t really have a similar obvious structure to appeal to, it\'s an action show but it\'s not really about action so it doesn\'t aim for those tropes much. It\'s about girls doing things, but they don\'t really do the typical things done in an anime like this, which might be good in a well written anime because that could mean it\'s bucking trends and stereotypes, the problem is it\'s not really replaced with anything here, it\'s just a lack of any kind of content at all. It doesn\'t really have a typical school or office setting you can milk material from either, the back drop is just kind of scant in general. I\'m not sure exactly what the world is like outside of these girl ships on an island. For all I know the rest of civilization is doing fine and the abyssals are only attacking this one crazy rich admirals island. Alternatively these ship women might be the only humans left, making this one of the bleakest dystopias ever penned to paper... The problem is we just don\'t really know what the hell is going on with this universes premise and doesn\'t even aim for lazy tropes and cliche elements as filler and structure, it\'s just a big pile of nothing folks and I\'m stepping in it.The animators of this show really seemed to want these girls to swim, so how about a few ""beach"" related episodes? They could play volleyball, they could have a swimming competition, they could have a swimsuit competition, they could go fishing, they could swim with cute sea creatures, they could have an episode where they find coconuts and two of the girls drink from them and talk about their lives and the nature of the universe. The point is even if we take the most obvious tacts and cues ever from just what\'s on this island we can imagine at least some rudimentary things for them to do other than the nothing that they end up doing. I think this is the single biggest factor in this shows failure, a lot of bad anime shows can still be liked by at least a few people by coasting on cliches alone, but truly bad anime like this don\'t even attempt that. This is a really special failure in that regard. I don\'t even like most of the school club/slice of life type anime I have seen but even most of those have better filler content than this. Or at least more effort was put into their lazy premises than this.The one cliche this show did rely on quite a bit was the ""love and team work conquer all"" nonsense. It just further illustrates the laziness of the show and how it failed especially hard for reasons 1, 3 and 4 on my list. It deflated the need for strategy, the girls having personalities or real relationships with one another and destroyed the need for us to care at all about the battles and the broader conflict the show was trying to convey. Guess what they win in the end, happily ever after, thank you and good night.The problem is, the problem is... ThE pRoBlEm Is. THE PROBLEM IS. I got as sick of writing this sentence as you probably did reading it. I mean I apologize with the repetitive nature of saying it so many times, but... The problem is so much just went so wrong with the show that I felt compelled to say it ad nausea. I thought it was starting to become a nervous tic and had to slap my hands and face a few times from pointing out even more problems.You want to know something I don\'t know a whole a lot about? Anime. I mean that in the sense that I probably know more about it than the vague idea of an average person in the west, but in the grand scheme of anime fans my knowledge is small pettanko\'s and I still have a lot to see and learn about. Two things I do know a lot about though or at the very least I have much more knowledge about in comparison to anime are video games and films. I have played an ungodly number of games and reviewed far more of them than I have shows here and I have watched almost 2400+ films according to a site where I track the obsessions that fuel my mental illnesses not unlike this very website we happen to be on. So in a Venn diagram between these two subjects we have film adaptions of video games and games based off films, in both cases we have a long history of tragedies and sadness. It isn\'t easy to adapt something from one media to the next, not every story is translatable. On the other hand I think people are too quick to assume the ""obvious truth"" that a book, comic or manga are superior to their ""dumber"" counterparts. There\'s a kind of elitism to media that something on the written page is more legitimate because it spells things out more and has more opportunities to expound upon things than the budgets of most shows, anime, movies and games do. There is a similar elitism about games being inferior to film and television. I don\'t always assume these things and I can think of specific examples where I definitely think an adaption improved upon it\'s original written source material. I\'m saying all this to reiterate what I said at the start of this review, that I don\'t think this being a ""game"" necessitated this anime being bad. Just because something often happens to be the case, doesn\'t mean it necessarily had to be true here. The Persona and DanganRonpa anime while not particularly shining examples of the broader media of animation were still pretty good adaptions of their respective games stories and in some ways made more sense and laid things out in a way that were more understandable than the games themselves. I can also imagine someone who has no familiarity with their games enjoying those shows. I at the very least after watching them didn\'t feel like they wasted my time. What Kantai should have ultimately done was establish the girl warships as real people in their setting and expound upon their personalities and their ship nature in the ocean battlefields and in a few typical anime situations. Aim for mediocre and that\'s what we could have had here. The problem is it couldn\'t even rise to that meager level of an adaption improving on the source material on a browser game. So the problem is... It\'s just not good. I still love Hami though. deep as a show about animu girl warships can be, which is about the depth of a bowl of ramen, but still I think this is worth examining because I have literally nothing else to do with my time.For those who don\'t know Kantai Collection or Kancolle is a browser game that got adapted into an anime. The incredibly deep story of the show is that warships which are represented by human girls are fighting an unknown threat called ""Abyssals"" that come from somewhere deep at sea and start attacking coastal cities or something like that. The abyssals are also animu girl warships but they\'re made to look just evil enough to make your brain connect the association between evil and this ""character,"" but not enough that you would find them unattractive. I mean let\'s not get crazy here. The cliche nature of the story becomes apparent really quick, but even that isn\'t why this show ends up being bad either. Before I get into why I think it ends up being bad though I want you to imagine for a second what a show like this could do to milk content for it\'s story, and by that I mean a story aiming for mediocrity and not something even aiming for anything close to being good let alone greatness. The way I see it there are about four easy ways this show could have milked some easy content out of it\'s initial premise:1. It could focus on the relationships between the characters and/or their own internal(self) conflicts.2. It could focus it\'s content around the cuteness of the girl warships and layercake the fanservice.3. It could focus it\'s content on the strategy of the ship battles or more generically on the action therein.4. It could aim especially low and go for common tropes in similar anime shows and genres.Well to a certain extent you can say it attempts some of each of these easy ways to milk content, but what I think the true failure of this show is and what makes it bad regardless of it being a game adaption is it fails to really live up to any of these four easy ways of making a show like this work. So lets examine each one and see how it didn\'t quite live up to it\'s premise in these ways, I mean if you want to I guess.Take most basic writing courses any where and one of the first things you\'ll learn about writing a fictional story is that characterization is key and by that, if you want your story to feel real you have to have your character\'s doing believable and relatable things within the context of the story they\'re in and on top of that they have to have personality\'s with traits and quirks that also make sense within the context of a story. There are other aspects to writing a story sure, but generally the characters desires and their actions are what drive a story, so this is a pretty important thing to get right. If I had to say it tried to live up to any of the four things I listed above it would be this one and by that I mean they tried to make the shows main drive the characters and their conflicts between each other, rather than rely on most of the other aspects of this premise. The problem with the characters in this show though is that none of them act or behave the way they should given the situation that they\'re in but it\'s actually worse than just getting things wrong because I would say another major problem is that despite their clear leaning on character conflict to drive the story is the sheer amount of character and character buildup they omit and leave undeveloped.Let me give a minor spoiler as what I\'m about to say happens in the first episode, a character dies. As expected other characters respond to this characters death with sadness, but the sadness of her death doesn\'t really make sense in a lot of ways. The show like a lot of badly written anime has a tendency for being overly dramatic and it is never quite as well illustrated as it is with this early death. One of the characters is almost catatonically in denial about the other girls death for over three or four episodes. Now maybe the two characters are really close... But we\'re never shown that. This is another problem I have with this early death in this show and a trope I have noticed in a lot of eastern media I call ""Tragedy in an instant"" we\'re expected to feel the weight and emotional seriousness of a tragedy with people we have no real connection with yet and don\'t really know about the connections of to really feel anything about. Now it\'s possible I\'m just not empathic enough and everyone else on earth feels intense sadness over random instantaneous fictional deaths of characters, I\'m admitting there is some subjectivity here to say the least, but I think that even if you want an abrupt early death in a show there are ways of building up emotional weight and a feeling of loss for that character and I simply think this show failed to utilize any kind of emotional depth in trying to get us to care. I don\'t know why this character should matter to me other than in the most abstract ways possible. The bigger problem though is that it doesn\'t really make sense for the characters in universe to care as much as they do either. Now keep in mind my stating of the initial premise these girls are warships fighting a supposed large mysterious existential threat that might very well be the end of their civilization and yet they seem not to be familiar with death or it\'s consequences in this universe. The problem with this shows character\'s then is that it required more gritty and battle hardened people than it had, but it didn\'t want to go that route because grittiness and realism has a tendency to nerf the ""sexy"" cliches they\'re trying to paint by numbers into this plot like naive and happy go lucky girls. People that are constantly being attacked by a threat tend to not be very happy go lucky or naive, they tend to be filled with trauma, anxiety and are more settled into being ""prepared"" for a threat then they\'re trying to live a regular every day life. They also have a coldness towards the death of those around them, because they have seen it happen before, so they know to stay just caring and detached enough not to mourn everyone like it\'s the first time. Consider the denizens of other shows with a similar premise to this like Evangelion or Attack on Titan, in both shows a mysterious threat has started attacking people from some unknown point of origin and the attacks are constant and vicious and whatever else you or I might have to say about those shows in the positive and negative, the one thing I think they both did right was the characters personalities reflect the harsh circumstances they\'re in and by extension the whole of the shows societies and world seems geared towards surviving these threats. This is one of the major ways in which Kantai fails big time. There is an ""abyssal"" sized divide between their personalities of the characters and the way their society is structured and the seriousness of the threat they\'re supposed to be facing.A person defending this show might say ""Well of course it isn\'t like those shows, it\'s not trying to be that serious!"" I can agree to an extent that not every show with this type of premise has to be extremely serious or gritty and the scenario I outlined above is not the only one an anime or fiction in general has to take. In fact I can think of a lot of Anime shows that manage to balance a similarly serious premise with light hearted tones and comedy rather well. Hunter X Hunter, Gurren Lagann and Detective Conan come to mind for me and I can list a lot of others, the problem with Kantai isn\'t just that the serious moments aren\'t taken seriously enough. It\'s that there isn\'t enough (good) comedy and the light hearted moments are bland or nonsensical given the characters and the situations they\'re in. One of the only episodes that isn\'t just about the ships doing lame ship and game related things is about a curry contest... Now taken by itself it\'s not the worst premise for a random episode of a Nihon cartoon to have. The problem is this is about the only thing we ever see them do aside from swimming for no reason before a battle and swimming for no reason before a battle and feeling slightly sad, swimming for no reason before a battle and trying to get an unused powerful battleship to swim with you and then swimming for no reason before a battle and asking questions about the ""admiral."" I can imagine humanoid ship women doing a lot of things, I can even justify some of the overuse of swimming and ocean related scenes with no purpose given their ship nature, but the ""curry"" episode being the only only odd episode out where we see them doing anything else just illustrates the absurdity of the whole premise to an absolute boiling point. Either make it consistently about these ship women and their struggles in this ""war"" or use everyday tasks like a curry episode to illustrate differences between their personalities and push the war much further into the background.

Maybe the food, spices and compositions of the curry can be reflective of the girls personalities.  What I\'m trying to get at here was even this stupid premise could be utilized to show some of the personalities of characters and move the plot forward here, the problem with this show as this episode especially illustrates, is that it likes to accomplish nothing at light speed.

So we have a main character named Fubuki, a character who to the shows credit is new to this world and they try to make her a lens by which we come to understand the world of Kantai or at least this was what they could have done with this character and I think they were mildly attempting to do so. The problem is she just reacts so stupidly and haphazardly to everything around her that I can\'t really imagine this is what I would be like in this situation.

Whatever you may personally think about that, in a browser game and in an anime show centered around girls like this the appeal of fanservice to a large part of the audience is undeniable. I mean let\'s get real here folks, You either really like warships to watch a show like this or because the majority of the audience is not military enthusiasts I\'m guessing you like women in skimpy outfits.

I\'m not exactly sure why nor do I think going on this tangent would be very fruitful or important, but what I know about Beebop that I didn\'t necessarily get any vibes or intentional nods to from Kantai was whether they\'re even trying to entice people with their fanservice. At the very least with Faye her writing and characterization was clear enough that I could tell what they were intending to do that with her and not intending it with other characters even if their intentions didn\'t work with me in this particular way. As I said in the first section the characterization and the animation in Kantai don\'t really convey an intentional tone or idea of what we\'re supposed to think of these characters and the situations they\'re in most of the time and this broader problem is the best illustrated by their lack of an attempt to even appeal to us in the easiest way possible and when I think they were trying they still failed.While I\'m loosely talking about aesthetics, I\'ll say that the animation is pretty average, it doesn\'t do anything really bad and it\' doesn\'t do anything extremely good. I\'ll say in it\'s slight favor that unlike a lot of crap anime shows it never starts getting confusing with it\'s editing and it\'s action scenes. Conversely though nothing is very visually exciting and basically no risks are taken. I will say to the shows slight credit that the characters are represented well from what I know of their illustrated versions in game and there aren\'t any obvious messups like some animes do with weird disjointed spike hair, eyes too big or small for a face or tube leg/arm syndrome.I can also say that I honestly don\'t remember the music on this show at all, if it had a soundtrack it had no impact on me what so ever. A sure sign that anime show is bad is that when people go to praise the characters they instead start praising the voice actresses non-stop and forget about the characters themselves. Well fair enough to them ladies eastern and western they tried their best but this writing like a sinking ship was unsalvageable.Before we move on I\'ll just say you can condense and formulate my whole brilliant argument of this particular section and possibly my dislike of the whole anime down to one simple complaint, THEY DIDN\'T HAVE ANY HAMAKAZE, WTF? I MEAN WERE YOU EVEN TRYING? SHE IS A SILVER HAIRED ANGEL SENT DOWN BY THE WAIFU GODDESSES TO SINK MY DISGUSTING BATTLESHIP OF A LIFE. JUST ONE SCENE WITH HER WOULD HAVE SAVED THIS, I WATCHED THIS WHOLE DAMN SHOW AND SHE COULDN\'T EVEN SHOW UP ONCE? COME ON... Alright back to our regularly scheduled programming.Lets talk about the third way in which this show could have been good, which was focusing on the strategy aspects of the ships and or more generically the combat. You do see some combat in the show but as I already stated they aren\'t very visually interesting battles but that kind of underlies a broader point that the action in the show is just kind of bland and not very immersive. I think the blandness is easy enough to explain, there are many anime action shows and many with better drawn and more carefully orchestrated battle scenes than this show. The ships are just mostly depicted moving fast and every once in a while they scream things or an explosion occurs. A lot of battles end with crappy deus ex machina situations where a new squadron of ships or one previously unknown or unused powerful ship comes and saves the day relieving all tension the ""threat"" might have had otherwise. Repeat this ad infinitum and we have ourselves every action scene in the show. The lack of immersion comes into play because the threat never feels like a real threat and the battles never feel like a real battle because they lack real action and what they really lack in this department is strategy.There aren\'t scenes of the ships really strategizing or talking about naval strategies, it\'s easy to forget they\'re in a war in this show about ship girls being in a war. The best we get is a few ""practice"" scenes scattered throughout the episodes that don\'t really show them doing anything other than splashing around in water here and there. The ships sometimes talk about ""group composition"" and things like that but during a battle none of this is really utilized well or a elaborated on. I haven\'t played the game, but based off the show I\'m assuming it\'s either a really rudimentary strategy game or a ""card"" game that plays out like a strategy game anyway. So what this show needed was scenes where we see the ships doing serious formations and step by step attacks against the enemy. Like having the fast ships and submarines scouting in the front and long range but slow attackers in the back, carriers and midsized ships in the middle. Basic stuff like that to establish that are protagonists aren\'t complete morons and have some basic knowledge of their capabilities and an idea of what they need to do to ""win."" Girls und Panzer is a show very similar to this one structurally in a lot of ways and while I also didn\'t think that show was that good in strategy and action regard at the very least we see them talking about tank strategies, formations and the use of their specific tanks and abilities in battle. They understood how to utilize the absurd premise of their show at least a little bit better in this regard. We never really get that with Kantai most of the show is again about dumb luck or zerg rushing your opponent.Speaking of Girls und Panzer(GuP) another thing this show could have done that I would argue that GuP did was utilize the tropes in it\'s genre to help manufacture an obvious plot and trajectory for the shows story. GuP was about a school tanking club and by tanks I mean military tanks. ""School club"" is a well worn path in anime and GuP manages to use it to create a structure of competition and some of the obvious drama that can bring. Like sibling rivalry, the rivaling schools international compositions and personalities, the nature of things school clubs do for their school and their own sake ETC. Have an episode where they go on vacation for no reason and where they have to raise money to keep the school club in existence and congratulations you made yourself school club anime number 11473456 slated to release next fall. Kantai doesn\'t really have a similar obvious structure to appeal to, it\'s an action show but it\'s not really about action so it doesn\'t aim for those tropes much. It\'s about girls doing things, but they don\'t really do the typical things done in an anime like this, which might be good in a well written anime because that could mean it\'s bucking trends and stereotypes, the problem is it\'s not really replaced with anything here, it\'s just a lack of any kind of content at all. It doesn\'t really have a typical school or office setting you can milk material from either, the back drop is just kind of scant in general. I\'m not sure exactly what the world is like outside of these girl ships on an island. For all I know the rest of civilization is doing fine and the abyssals are only attacking this one crazy rich admirals island. Alternatively these ship women might be the only humans left, making this one of the bleakest dystopias ever penned to paper... The problem is we just don\'t really know what the hell is going on with this universes premise and doesn\'t even aim for lazy tropes and cliche elements as filler and structure, it\'s just a big pile of nothing folks and I\'m stepping in it.The animators of this show really seemed to want these girls to swim, so how about a few ""beach"" related episodes? They could play volleyball, they could have a swimming competition, they could have a swimsuit competition, they could go fishing, they could swim with cute sea creatures, they could have an episode where they find coconuts and two of the girls drink from them and talk about their lives and the nature of the universe. The point is even if we take the most obvious tacts and cues ever from just what\'s on this island we can imagine at least some rudimentary things for them to do other than the nothing that they end up doing. I think this is the single biggest factor in this shows failure, a lot of bad anime shows can still be liked by at least a few people by coasting on cliches alone, but truly bad anime like this don\'t even attempt that. This is a really special failure in that regard. I don\'t even like most of the school club/slice of life type anime I have seen but even most of those have better filler content than this. Or at least more effort was put into their lazy premises than this.The one cliche this show did rely on quite a bit was the ""love and team work conquer all"" nonsense. It just further illustrates the laziness of the show and how it failed especially hard for reasons 1, 3 and 4 on my list. It deflated the need for strategy, the girls having personalities or real relationships with one another and destroyed the need for us to care at all about the battles and the broader conflict the show was trying to convey. Guess what they win in the end, happily ever after, thank you and good night.The problem is, the problem is... ThE pRoBlEm Is. THE PROBLEM IS. I got as sick of writing this sentence as you probably did reading it. I mean I apologize with the repetitive nature of saying it so many times, but... The problem is so much just went so wrong with the show that I felt compelled to say it ad nausea. I thought it was starting to become a nervous tic and had to slap my hands and face a few times from pointing out even more problems.You want to know something I don\'t know a whole a lot about? Anime. I mean that in the sense that I probably know more about it than the vague idea of an average person in the west, but in the grand scheme of anime fans my knowledge is small pettanko\'s and I still have a lot to see and learn about. Two things I do know a lot about though or at the very least I have much more knowledge about in comparison to anime are video games and films. I have played an ungodly number of games and reviewed far more of them than I have shows here and I have watched almost 2400+ films according to a site where I track the obsessions that fuel my mental illnesses not unlike this very website we happen to be on. So in a Venn diagram between these two subjects we have film adaptions of video games and games based off films, in both cases we have a long history of tragedies and sadness. It isn\'t easy to adapt something from one media to the next, not every story is translatable. On the other hand I think people are too quick to assume the ""obvious truth"" that a book, comic or manga are superior to their ""dumber"" counterparts. There\'s a kind of elitism to media that something on the written page is more legitimate because it spells things out more and has more opportunities to expound upon things than the budgets of most shows, anime, movies and games do. There is a similar elitism about games being inferior to film and television. I don\'t always assume these things and I can think of specific examples where I definitely think an adaption improved upon it\'s original written source material. I\'m saying all this to reiterate what I said at the start of this review, that I don\'t think this being a ""game"" necessitated this anime being bad. Just because something often happens to be the case, doesn\'t mean it necessarily had to be true here. The Persona and DanganRonpa anime while not particularly shining examples of the broader media of animation were still pretty good adaptions of their respective games stories and in some ways made more sense and laid things out in a way that were more understandable than the games themselves. I can also imagine someone who has no familiarity with their games enjoying those shows. I at the very least after watching them didn\'t feel like they wasted my time. What Kantai should have ultimately done was establish the girl warships as real people in their setting and expound upon their personalities and their ship nature in the ocean battlefields and in a few typical anime situations. Aim for mediocre and that\'s what we could have had here. The problem is it couldn\'t even rise to that meager level of an adaption improving on the source material on a browser game. So the problem is... It\'s just not good. I still love Hami though.', 'Story 7: Really not that much of a story.

So, was it any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryTo a certain extent, every anime is weird and you need a reasonable amount of suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy it and this anime was no exception. Kantai Collection tells the story of antropomorphic ships that take the form of teenage girls. How did that happen? Are the girls human with machine-like attributes or are they machines that just so happen to look human? Who knows? Who cares? The whole point is that they are...supposed to take down evil sea monsters and look cute while doing it.For the most part, the show maintains a reasonable balance between comedy and drama. The battles are intense but they never get dark or gritty, as expected of an anime starring cute girls. While I wish the show could have dedicated more time to its world-building aspect, I believe the story was enjoyable and solid in its own right. (6/10)CharactersKantai Collection follows the story of a young destroyer called Fubuki, who transfers to an academy of fleet girls and becomes acquainted to several characters throughout the show. Fubuki has no personality beyond being just the young cadet that wants to prove herself and it's the supporting cast what truly makes this show enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the antics of Kongou, Yamato, Akatsuki, Ikazuchi and so many others. (8/10)ArtAs expected from a show about cute girls, the titular fleet girls look absolutely gorgeous.

As a new fan of the game (and occasional Azur Lane player) I still find ""War stuff, but moe"" quite original (even if it\'s anything but). I\'ll make a quick summary of the anime, as I see it personally.Story: 5Not very good. Jumps around a lot, but kept me interested enough to hang around (though let\'s face it. The story isn\'t why we\'re here). The Abyssals are taking over the world (more specifically the oceans) and it\'s up to the shipgirls to stop them. There\'s a message about fighting fate in there,...but that\'s spoiler territory.Art: 7Very good blend of all the characters. They all have a cohesive style (unlike the game). CG is pretty jarring in combat, but not too bad (especially when you\'re used to it). Actual animation deserves an 8, really, but knocking off one for the mid-tier CG.Sound: 8Not a very memorable OST, but the OP and ED are some of my all-time favourites. The actual SFX are surprisingly good, and can keep you engaged in longer battles. The VAs did very good jobs - I was able to feel the emotion they tried to convey very well and apparently some of them voiced lots of characters. I never noticed, so kudos to those VAs especially!Character: 6Obviously not much time to make good on most of them, but the ones who do get development get enough to cause at least a bit of emotion (I found myself with a smile on my face for lots of the show, but that\'s more the SoL that does that). The cast is quite simple yet diverse, and I think it works well in this show. I\'d give it a 7, personally. I just really don\'t like how much of a self-insert the Admiral is (he never talks, nor appears on screen). He knocks one off, because of how damn unnatural it is.Enjoyment: 9If there\'s one good thing about Kancolle, it\'s that Cute Girls Doing Cute Things is always something I can get behind. The curry episode (total filler, don\'t worry) was a bit much for me with how jarring it was from the story, and the *goddamn admiral* exists, but besides that I really enjoyed the antics of the diverse cast.Overall: 8It\'s a good show. Not a masterpiece, but I\'d recommend it to someone fairly new to the medium (not so new as to find basic fanservice strange though. If I recall correctly this show has quite a bit, but not as much as other similar shows).Lots of the reviews on this anime are very critical, and while criticism is a good thing, I wanted to throw my own thoughts out there (because really, I think this anime should be rated like, 7.5. Even accounting for my own bias). I hope you take the time to give it a shot - it\'s not great but it\'s good enough to waste some time (and maybe find a favourite shipgirl. Who knows?) but that\'s spoiler territory.Art: 7Very good blend of all the characters. They all have a cohesive style (unlike the game).

Cliche at times, but you don't go into this anime looking for anything much more than a slice-of-life.See, that's where the problem lies. There's enough characters and enough interaction that it would have done well as a slice-of-life, or something with a less ambitious plot at the very least. I...would've watched a show of MC doing MC things slowly fitting into the community of the base.Instead, the story attempts to be much darker, dealing with a monstrous enemy with the threat of permadeath looming since episode three. And unfortunately, it comes up short. I won't go into the accuracy of the very clearly historically-based events, but I will mention that while ships sinking permanently is part of history and the game itself, there is not enough buildup to make it impactful the viewer, not enough threat to make action sequences truly suspenseful, and simply not enough plot to justify 12 episodes.In attempting an odd mix between slice-of-life and story-based anime, it excels at neither.

Kimi no Iru Machi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17741/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi,"[""Kimi no Iru Machi is an amazing series. Amazingly mediocre.The show is almost feels like swimming in an ocean of rage and frustration for many reasons. For a romance based series, Kimi no Iru Machi sure likes to play around with the idea but then twists it in all sorts of angles. These angles do not connect well in any way but instead ends up making a shape out of wrong proportions. As a follower of the original manga that began to ran years before the debut of this anime series, I am definitely not satisfied from what I see. It feels like I’m drowning...in a sea of despair.Kimi no Iru Machi (A Town Where You Live) is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Seo Kouji. The author is previously known for his other work, Suzuka that also received an anime adaptation based off of his manga. So now it’s his time to once again step it up and bring forth a romantic comedy for people to enjoy. Unfortunately, it seems like the series doesn’t step itself up but rather falls even further behind from the OVAs that debuted prior to this.The series follows main male protagonist Haruto Kirishima as a high school student living on the countryside. As a healthy boy of his age, he falls under the category of the typical high school student with thoughts running through his head. These thoughts includes schoolwork, his future, and the obvious: girls. This is because Haruto has a crush on another female student. Will have the courage to ask her out? What happens if he gets rejected? Will Haruto ever become a man? These might be a few questions for thought for potential anime only viewers at first glance. However, this isn't’ exactly what you might expect.For whatever reason, the anime decides to skip around and go straight into an arc that is covered later on from the manga. It’s disappointing given the fact that important factors and development in the beginning between Haruto and another main female protagonist are left mostly in unexplored territory. The series does pull out the old trick in the book as in the form of flashbacks. But honestly though, this doesn’t work well in terms of a romance developing series. For our main female protagonist, Eba Yuzuki, this is even more frustrating to watch because the lack character driven concept. It also doesn’t help by the fact that Haruto himself is not exactly one of those characters where we get to know from the beginning.As for Haruto, the boy clearly has eyes set on a particular someone but not exactly whom you might expect. As mentioned before, this series skips around and omits parts from the manga that clearly accelerates its plot. As for Haruto, the guy seems to lack a personality and often acts reserved around others. He is caring on the outside but often makes rash decisions while observing from the backgrounds. It is not until he sees truly sees reality that he decides to act. Often or not though, this is met with mixed results. However, Haruto does carry responsibilities and follows him through. He is hardworking and cares about the well-being of others so some respect can be handed out to him. Out of the girls that Haruto meets throughout the series, Eba is a magnet for responsibility to be delivered.The duo of Haruto and Eba is also awkward to watch as they don’t seem very compatible. Haruto seems to be a guy that often keeps thoughts to himself. On the other hand, Eba is a girl with a sociable personality that speaks out her mind and often not afraid to act on her actions. Again though, these lead to mixed results similar to Haruto’s case and leaves both happy and painful scars.Among other characters in the show includes Eba’s younger sister Rin that seemingly causes mischievous trouble for the duo. It’s also silly to note that she is almost nothing like her sister. At the same time, she seems to be a pivoting factor in order to get Haruto to open his eyes to the truth that lies in front of him. Then, there’s also Nanami Yuzuki, a girl that Haruto has his eyes set on from the beginning. She is depicted as a kind and forgiving girl. At many instances, she offers advise to others but is a bit insecure to herself at times. Other girls in the show also plays their minor roles but mostly stays in the background. For Haruto though, his eyes only focuses on what he thinks is in front of him. What reality show him though is much more painful but again, he keeps it to himself.One prominent feature of the story in the series also features a main supporting male character that plays a more of a tragic role. In fact, he is more of the influence factor to Eba’s decision as well as Haruto’s. The result of that influence though leads to sorrow but also some hope for Haruto; an unfortunate feeling for hope but nonetheless. But as far as that goes, the series decides to twist around with the aspect of romance again and presents it in way to almost beyond repair. Even if a series is labeled as romance with drama and comedy, it should at least follow a straight forward plot. No, instead it decides to jump all over the place and loses focus to the point where viewers might not be sure who Haruto wants to be with. Coupled with the lackluster of a sociable personality, Haruto is a man that is both hard to be empathetic with or take pity for; emphasis on either.On the more drama side, the series also tries to make viewers feel sorry for its characters. However, it gets hard to take pity on them because the decisions they make. Sure, decisions often can result in consequences but I find the choices the characters make in this series to be outright abrupt with nonsense. It doesn’t help by the fact that the series rushes its primary plot so there’s little focus on background or character development. Instead, it focuses on Haruto and his daily life with other girls. The guy is responsible but he sure doesn’t take some of his relationships as well as such. This is especially true later on with another girl that some can see as a golden egg. Unfortunately, it's a just another egg wasted by Haruto.The comedy factor of Kimi no Iru Machi is second rated. It often tries to mix in comedy with drama at the same time but this doesn’t work out. At other times, it tries the typical and cliched misunderstandings with factors of fan service. As a fan though, I don’t feel serviced or satisfied. The dialogues spoken by most of the characters also lacks flavor. Rin is perhaps one of the more curious girls that often treats Haruto’s life as a game so her dialogues tends to add a bit of interest. For the rest of the cast though, the words often a loop of dull expressions.For a more slice of life style series though, there are some hopes. The feeling of countryside brings forth a feeling of nostalgia through most of the flashbacks played throughout the series. It gives off a sense of feeling in terms of simplicity. After all, living on the countryside is simple rather than in a big crowded city. Furthermore, there is some sense of realism in terms of relationships. Examples of this includes the consequences of a long term relationship, dealing with tragedies, and getting yourself back up afterwards from it. It can be relatable too in a sort of way especially if viewers have been in a relationship in the past or is currently in one. I just hope that you won’t make some horrible decisions as some of the characters do in this series. That’s not a pretty sight to see honestly.In terms of artwork, Kimi no Iru Machi adapts a simple style with its characters looking natural but at the same time lacking any noticeable features. There’s noting particular standing out with any of the characters. Haruto looks normal and Eba is portrayed as the typical girl with a tip of naiveness. Given the fact that Seo Kouji is involved with the project, there’s also similarity in character designs between this series and his other work, Suzuka. The backgrounds does have a trace of naturalism to it though with the dancing leaves, souring winds, and seasonal weather.For its soundtrack, Kimi no Iru Machi is amazingly mediocre. There’s almost nothing to praise about any of the VA’s performances. The main male protagonist Haruto (Yoshimasa Hosoya) seems to have tone of a mature character but his actions contradicts this. Most of the girls’ voices are typical with possibly Eba being the most outstanding with her somewhat elegant tone of voice. Music wise, the show does show some melancholy especially in regards to its flashback scenes. The OP song, “Sentimental Love” is presented with a calm tone along with traces of fan service and somewhat of hope for its characters. Its two contrasting ED songs brings forth a feeling of homesickness that seems to also walk down the memory lane.Overall, Kimi no Iru Machi proves to be a lackluster romance anime that jumped way over itself. Its ineffective writing coupled by its lack of characterization makes its frustrating to watch. If that wasn’t enough, Haruto and Eba isn’t exactly what I would call the best of couple. The message that it tries to get across never seems to reach if there was one at all. Maybe it’s something on the line of ‘the truth hurts’, ‘face the reality’, or ‘love bites’. Whatever it is though doesn’t work out right. However, it does bring forth some sense of realism with relationships that takes on a path of drama. If you decide to choose the path to watch this anime though, just be aware of what’s ahead. in a sea of despair.Kimi no Iru Machi (A Town Where You Live) is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Seo Kouji. The author is previously known for his other work, Suzuka that also received an anime adaptation based off of his manga.

They have been childhood friends for a short period of time and they really bonded when Eba came back during the later years of her high school lift to attend school and various events befall them and get in the way of the love they have for each other, the most major being the distance between where the...two live. Eba initially travels out to the countryside where Haruto lives but then has to go back to Tokyo, and this anime takes over from the OVA series where Haruto travels out to Tokyo to chase after Eba.Story: 7I was really disappointed with how quickly they moved this anime along. They were constantly jumping around between past and present and never spent more than about 2 episodes on any particular event or moment. The rate at which the relationships moved along as well was frustrating as you never really got a great grasp of what was going on and how the characters really felt. What was good about it however was the ability for the viewer to be able to relate to the situation at hand. It was a fairly good setup, just rushed.Characters: 5The way they rushed through the anime was really bad, and consequently that's how the characters have turned out. I mostly disliked all of the characters, but the one bright spark was the fact that you could relate to them in a way, regardless of the decisions they made. Kirishima Haruto is your fairly common main character, not much personality and just can't seem to let go of the main female interest. Eba Yuzuki is your typical bright, clumsy damsel in distress who needs someone around to help her all the time and to support her. Although I believe she was supposed to be a likeable character, I did not like her. To me she was just to needy and just made me frustrated with her decisions and the way she conducted herself, but I digress. Eba also has a younger sister Rin who comes into the story about halfway through. She has quite the personality as she is constatly pushing Eba and Haruto together, but I won't spoil too much about her and what goes on.Art and Music: 7The music for the anime was quite well chosen I believe, although nothing outstanding that would make you want to keep listening to it outside of the anime itself. The artworks are fairly good as well, but would've benefited from a little more time to get that smoother texture and brighter colours in general.Overall Enjoyment: 7I did enjoy this anime even with all of its flaws. I do recommend giving it a watch, but at the same time be warned that it will feel really rushed and you will not have a lot of time to be able to appreciate the situations and get to know the characters really well.Recommendation:From what other people tell me, they say the Manga is a lot better and ads in elements of comedy, as well as goes more in depth and is a lot more enjoyable overall two live.

What this anime should be applauded for, is its look at how fragile our desires can  be, and the cruelty and selfishness that come as a result of it.  Of course, this also means that the characters are often unlikable and frustrating. This isn't an anime where you really like the characters, and if anything at all, it's more of a study on the ups and downs of relationships, and...the cruelty of love.This is to say, this isn't the kind of material that is particularly enjoyable. But that doesn't make it bad by default. Even stories that aren't enjoyable, have legitimate merit as art. Afterall, not all romance stories are happy, and often in life relationships have hurdles and don't always end with happiness. These stories certainly should be told. Where Kimi no Iru Machi fails is in the final act and the overall pacing of the story. Because the story moves too quickly, there isn't enough depth given to the the main character's choice at the end, and it leaves the audience feeling frustrated and angry with the main characters. This again, doesn't make it bad. But the Manga tackled this subject a lot more seriously, and showed the consequences for this decision, and the new hurdles that arise when choosing your desires over others happiness.Essentially, the story just leaves you feeling terrible for the person that gets hurt, and frustrated and angry with the two lead characters.  They chose their desires over everything else, despite the consequences of it effecting people beyond them. Which again is fine, but the anime doesn't really give us enough weight to the decisions being made. We don't even get to spend time with the characters after the fact to understand these consequences. And the final  blow is that they essentially sweep it all under the rug, and try to pass it off as happiness trumping over everything, despite the consequences. Which again, fine, but we needed to see those consequences to understand the impact our desires can have on others, as well as why these characters are willing to suffer these consequences to fulfill their desires.Instead of looking at the impact of the main characters actions, the character that is impacted by this the most says that her love is so strong, she'll wait for the main character if he ever breaks up with the girl that was chosen over her. This on some level, looks at the idea that we can't always choose or control our desires, even if they will never be fulfilled or reciprocated. It's the cruelty of love. But the rushed pacing makes it feel like a cheap ploy to release the main character from his actions and set up an ending that is more digestible. However, this has the opposite effect, as it makes it feel like the subject matter isn't being taken seriously enough.Overall this anime has an interesting subject matter, but it doesn't take the time needed to properly study it.  This ultimately leaves us with a bunch of a unlikable characters, and a story that isn't particularly enjoyable. However, the story is brave in its subject matter, I just wish it was more brave in going further with it (even if it makes for an uncomfortable experience), because these stories are worth telling. I would have preferred the Anime to have pushed the uncomfortable aspects of love, and left us with an ending that makes us question our own desires. Instead it comes off like a story between two people that make bad decisions, and ultimately burn everyone down around them for the sake of their love. the cruelty of love.This is to say, this isn't the kind of material that is particularly enjoyable.

If ‘no’ or if you’re unsure, then you can decide for yourself whether you want to watch this or not.“A Town Where You Live” is a romantic drama that differs from the norm when it comes to adapting manga into anime. Most anime start right from the beginning of the manga and proceed...from there. I have not read the manga so I don’t know exactly where it starts relative to the rest of the story, but this anime starts from a later arc and instead uses many flashbacks to fill in the important details that happened prior to present events. This makes for some confusing switches in time periods and also results in a lack of connection to characters, especially the ones that mostly only appear in flashbacks.The story of the anime begins with Kirishima Haruto, a country boy who is moving to Tokyo as he chases after the girl he loves, Eba Yuzuki. He leaves behind his friends and one of his other former crushes as he ventures alone into the big city to start his new life and his search for Eba. With him, he has brought a necklace which he hopes to give to her. Eba is a girl who is originally from Tokyo but due to family problems, bonded with Haruto on the few occasions she visited his hometown (one time was fairly short when they were young and another time she actually lived at his house for an extended period of time). Haruto starts living with his older sister, Aoi, and soon meets several other friends who go to his new high school, like his new female neighbor Mishima Asuka and the upbeat motorcycle-riding Kazama Kyousuke. Haruto begins his new everyday high school life while continuing to be an amazing cook and, most importantly, searching for Eba.Aside from the inconsistent rhythm of the plot due to the many flashbacks which sometimes encompass entire episodes, I felt the plot also suffered from the characters' personalities. Haruto (as I mentioned at the beginning) is your typical indecisive male protagonist. Because of his indecisiveness, he ends up hurting not only the girls he is involved with, but himself and a few other people connected to the girls. Eba isn’t much better. She is also very indecisive and constantly tries to push Haruto away despite it still being blatantly obvious that she still has at least some feelings. These problems accumulate throughout the course of the show and end (in my opinion) with a rather unsatisfying and unrealistic ending.As for the art, it’s unimpressive to say the least. The character designs are maybe the worst part of it as every single character’s face is just copied and pasted with a different hair style and color as well as different eye colors. Because all of their facial structures are exactly the same, every character has the same stupid looking smile (I think this is the first time I’ve genuinely disliked any anime characters’ smiles). As for the backgrounds, they are very colorful and add a lot of effect to the scenes which sometimes helps them but sometimes is overused and ends up making some scenes laughably overdramatic. By that I mean that there are only so many times when gusts of wind, lightning bugs, and sakura blossoms can show up at the perfect time before it seems to be more than a coincidence. The scenery around Tokyo and Haruto’s hometown however are much better and during the regular scenes, the scenery is much nicer and more realistic (as far as anime goes anyway).The soundtrack consists of mostly instrumental pieces that sound generic in a romantic drama. None of the tracks stand out and the OP and ED are just average as well. The voice acting is impressive though as there are several different accents which (I assume since I don’t understand Japanese) the voice actors do well. It’s definitely clear even to a westerner like me that these accents are about as different as American and British ones.Kimi no Iru Machi tries a little too hard to be a dramatic romance story. Whether it comes to the indecisive characters or the strange art style, the show just falls flat in almost every possible way and is nothing more than forgettable. I recommend skipping this or maybe trying the manga instead (I know I’m recommending something I have not read, but I would recommend starting at the beginning of the story instead of dealing with flashbacks as that seems to me like it would work a little better). Still as I said in the beginning, do not watch this if the thing you hate most in the world is indecisive characters in romance stories, because this will annoy you to no end if that is the case. from there.

The character designs are maybe the worst part of it as every single character’s face is just copied and pasted with a different hair style and color as well as different eye colors. Because all of their facial structures are exactly the same, every character has the same stupid looking smile (I think this is the first time I’ve genuinely disliked any anime characters’ smiles). As for the backgrounds, they are very colorful and add a lot of effect to the scenes which sometimes helps them but sometimes is overused and ends up making some scenes laughably overdramatic. By that I mean that there are only so many times when gusts of wind, lightning bugs, and sakura blossoms can show up at the perfect time before it seems to be more than a coincidence. The scenery around Tokyo and Haruto’s hometown however are much better and during the regular scenes, the scenery is much nicer and more realistic (as far as anime goes anyway).The soundtrack consists of mostly instrumental pieces that sound generic in a romantic drama. None of the tracks stand out and the OP and ED are just average as well. The voice acting is impressive though as there are several different accents which (I assume since I don’t understand Japanese) the voice actors do well. It’s definitely clear even to a westerner like me that these accents are about as different as American and British ones.Kimi no Iru Machi tries a little too hard to be a dramatic romance story. Whether it comes to the indecisive characters or the strange art style, the show just falls flat in almost every possible way and is nothing more than forgettable. I recommend skipping this or maybe trying the manga instead (I know I’m recommending something I have not read, but I would recommend starting at the beginning of the story instead of dealing with flashbacks as that seems to me like it would work a little better). Still as I said in the beginning, do not watch this if the thing you hate most in the world is indecisive characters in romance stories, because this will annoy you to no end if that is the case."", 'Has it ever happened to you? Sitting down to write something but you can\'t really seem to organize your thoughts? I have no clue whatsoever as to how to approach this one.. This anime to me is as strange as the vast universe we live in and i certainly don\'t mean that in a good way, as you may have gathered by my rating.At first i thought there was something wrong with my neuron system, maybe my brain\'s wiring wasn\'t allowing me to enjoy this piece of art in a way that would.....Touch my soul or me strings or some other slang romance enthusiasts like...to use every other sentence. So i went to the hospital and had a doctor check me...The results were terrifying...I was in the terminal stages of bullshit intolerance and i\'ve been told that this is an incurable disease but it won\'t affect my day to day interactions with people or animals for that matter.I left the hospital devastated, i had no fags, no money to buy some and i had parked my car 2 blocks away from the damn hospital. So as i was walking i tried to come in terms with this new disease of mine, tried to embrace it..So i thought to myself that all is not lost, i shall beat this fucker in the ass and be a normal kid again..I came back home, poured a drink and went to google, my old pal who knows everything about everyone, and suggested i should try a shock therapy..That sounded dangerous and to be honest i like a bit of danger. I\'m not what you\'d call and andrenaline junkie but i quite fancy the idea of chemicals causing my reptilian brain to go berserk.Of course this being a shock therapy wasn\'t a piece of cake..More like a piece of concrete falling from a 3 story building and hitting you on the head leaving you for absolutely dead.And this is where A Town Where You Live comes in...From the very first episode it attacks your senses like aids attacks your immune system and if you don\'t know what aids does to you, why don\'t ya ask Freddie Mercury how that went? Well you can\'t cause he\'s dead but anyway.And the first wave of attack comes in the form of animation..From the very first seconds the animation was like a night out at Vegas with a tablet full of acid. You are still able to see things but you see in waves of blurriness and with no sense of real focus...And of course hallucinations are a nice touch as well. What i want to say is that the animation is close to atrocious and weirdly colored and blurry and it gave me eyes herpes. The characters themselves are well drawn don\'t get me wrong but everything else is not good, at the very best it\'s basic. I\'m not sure if it was a copy issue or anything of that sort but it seemed wayward to me.The second wave comes in the form of the characters and the story hitting you in turns for maximum impact, maximum amounts of vomit and massive internal injuries. The story goes like this, once upon a time there was a boy named Haruto and lived with his parents in the countryside..One fateful day a girl named Yuzuki came to live with them..No it\'s not like that you idiots get your mind out of the gutter..She was the daughter of a friend of Haruto\'s father or something like that..Anyway Haruto is plain and simple an annoying twat. He treats her like crap and for no obvious reason other than him being an asshole. Sure one can make the case that Yuzu is a klutz and a helpless case who can\'t do anything on her own, from walking in a straight line to breathing without the help of a special committee. So Haru has to help her with everything..Keyword here being ""help""...Simply put he is one of those guys who go after broken people so he can fix them in the hopes of them not leaving him.....So one thing leads to another and they ended up together? I\'m still not sure on the details but that\'s what happens..She then leaves for Tokyo and after some time of long distance relationshiping she found someone else.Is anyone here surprised? Nope? Well hear this and be amazed at the idiocy that this anime has to offer...Haru being a creep and a stalker among other things decided to MOVE TO TOKYO to find her...Got that?From that point on some insanily stupid stuff happen and Haru jumps from girl to girl while always being in love with Yuzu and still being an obnoxious fuck with no moral restriction whatsoever.......Other characters you say? Well yeah silly there are other characters..His hot sister being one and Yuzu\'s redhead hot sister as well..Oh yeah there was another one who went by the name of Kazama and he, He was a damn likable character. He was an aquaintance of Haru\'s sister and they became friends..And guess what? They killed him off...But before they did that they had to make him the 3rd wheel and the one Yuzu dated while in Tokyo.So animation that can kill life organisms 2 galaxies away, a story made possible by an angry teenager on drugs and characters that are as believable and relatable as Spongebob..Music and VA was....There..Now i know this review wasn\'t as long or as full of details as you\'d expect but i simply cannot put every single thing that is wrong with this anime cause the servers of the internet would explode..Do you want that? But then again i\'ll give this anime the pro of being at least a bit realistic..I mean people are shit and they do shitty things and they use each other to get what they want and they fuck you in the proccess..That\'s an unwritten rule of human relations. On that front it did well, mind you that\'s not saying much since most times it ditches realism for downright idiocy but at least it tried and i\'m a nice guy!I can\'t and won\'t reccomend this to anyone, even to people that i hate with a burning passion. But then again there are people out there with little to no sense so don\'t blame me, blame the world we live in and the society like everyone seems to do these days. to use every other sentence.

It felt so rushed and half assed.. In one moment you have Haruto giving up and going home with his ass between his legs and then he has this sudden realization and starts running towards , guess who, EBA to spout...some random shit from her house door, only to see in the window a peeking Eba with a regretfull face.. This repeated imense times troughout the anime and the Manga too.But I guess its just Seo Kouji godly writing making the highlights again.. In case you dont know this men  was the one who created Suzuka wich guess what its like Kimi no iru Machi all over again, only the characters are slightly different.. Apparently Suzuka and KNIM are even from the same freaking story line.. Fucking amazing.. Its like Seo is making fun of its audience wiggling his troll dick around like a madmanBut in this case its not entirely Seo´s fault.. The studio who adapted KNIM was GONZO .. One of the worst studios out there right next to Deen and Pierrot (Imo) .. And has I said above the anime was very rushed and you want to know why!? Because shrinking a 270 chapter Manga into a 12 episode anime (NOTE: EACH EPISODE HAS HARDLY 18 MIN) is fucking stupid.. An anime that had the potential to have atleast 26 episodes and then they could release 2 OVA with the aftermath to close it in a soothing way, but its Gonzo so we shouldn´t expect much.Even so its not like the Source material was good.. The story of KNIM is very infamous for its twists and forced drama.. The characters arent necessary bland and motivationless, actually quite opposite however they are so hateable for their stupid ass decisions and ""the power of bad writting"" behind that you end up like Umm what the hell? .. Midway trough Haruto forms a rivalry with a guy in the verge of dying only to accomplish his goals leaving the viewers thinking .. WOW what an asshole..Like seriously the way that this anime takes itself is so laughable on the insight that anyone with a brain would bash it.. And despite all this I was definitely surprised that I managed to end the series, more so that I was actually entertained and fell in love with it in a weird way.. It was non-sensical and just teen drama at its best.. #BLAME SEO some random shit from her house door, only to see in the window a peeking Eba with a regretfull face..

Also please try to feel through the review rather than going by a word by word meaning because thats what this show is also about)FEEL. The best word to decribe this show. It makes you feel so many emotions  during its showtime and keeps you glued to watch the next scene. I am going to say this here and now,...you might or might not(probably the later) like this show, but it will definetily be a worthy watch, atleast it was for me.The characters aint perfect, they lie to both themselves and others, they cheat and they dont act as MC, Villain or SideKicks. The hearbreaks and rejection is raw, not all the time is remedy shown for the one who is suffering. Characters get hurt, just for falling in love. And you feels all those emotions with them. The story aint perfect, actually its neither good nor bad, its just there for you to watch it. But is it worth a watch? Definetily. Somehow this show feels so real that it might just take place in real life. The love depicted in the show just feels so true: slowly growing closer towards eachother, realising your true feelings but still being unable to show them, unable to move on after being rejected and re ignition of it after couple years when you go through a memorial incident that happened in the past. I might forget the character names, the place names, hell even the anime itself(tbh this is why wrote this review so i might rememeber to rewatch it later in life by finding this review in my mal history), but i m pretty sure i am going to remember this story in this way ""there was this guy , he met her, she loved him, then this happened and then that..."".I am going to say this again, you need to first watch it to grow to hate it and even then you wont regret watching it, its that kind of show. you might or might not(probably the later) like this show, but it will definetily be a worthy watch, atleast it was for me.The characters aint perfect, they lie to both themselves and others, they cheat and they dont act as MC, Villain or SideKicks.

Actually the beggining is making you to continue watching as long as you'll recognize every single character.Story.This anime has one of the most wonderful love stories ever. It shows how strong can be loving personality. And shows that love is stronger than any type of friendship. When friend challenges ill friend for his former girlfriend, that's really unbelievable. Actually if it was me, i would let him to die thinking that he...has won. The end of the storyline was wonderful, but i was hoping they would show Asuka in the end with someone handsome and made for her.Art.Can't say anything good or bad about art, i think it was ok.

Before that, 2 episodes called Tasogare Kousaten (Twilight Intersection) were released. Two OVA came after this in 2014. If you want to watch all of them, I suggest starting with Tasogare Kousaten, then this, then the 2 OVAs. Tasogare Kousanten comes a bit before this in the story, and the 2 OVAs adapt chapters that were released later on.Before I start, I would like to mention that this is another review of Kimi no Iru Machi from a manga reader. Actually, I wonder if anyone DIDN\'T read the manga...before the anime. It feels like a lot of people read the manga, heard about the anime and told their friends not to watch it afterwards.It is by far my lowest rated anime on MAL, and there is a reason for that. This anime feels lackluster. It fails in all categories to deliver a minimum of what is expected from an anime to make in enjoyable.Let\'s start with the story, for which I gave it a 5. The only redeeming thing about the story is that it stays the same as the source material. What is wrong about it? First, we skip all of Hiroshima to skip straight to Tokyo. You heard right, we skip a third of the manga and 90% of character development and go straight to the second part of the manga. Some of the chapters from Hiroshima were shown as flashback, but not nearly enough to understand why the events in this series are unfolding. There\'s also the fact that this anime wanted to cover the most chapters possible, so makes for a very rushed story with essential scenes left behind. The ending also felt incomplete, as there are a lot of things that are left unresolved in the manga at this point.The art is a 6. It was actually an 8 until Episode 12. The characters looks from the manga are well adapted, but the animation is weird. The opening is one of the parts where it looks the weirdest, and it\'s the only part you have to watch 12 times. The center part of the animation is usually nice, but anything that\'s a bit peripheral to it or in the background looks horribly rushed. The still frames are beautiful, and the ending does a nice job of blending in the author\'s drawings with some photography in the background. One of the finer points that bothered me were when the characters\' mouths stopped moving for some unexplained reason during random scenes, and black and white still frames that started showing up during the last few episodes, a lot of them in episode 12.The sound deserves a measly 3. The music felt really out of place in this. The OP and ED are terrible and fail to set the right mood, if any, for the anime. The voice acting for Haruto was nice, with a thick accent and an unpolished vocabulary, it gave a vibe similar to an ""redneck"" only a bit softer. The other VA had nothing special, and were lacking a lot of emotion during key scenes. It felt like watching two animated dolls talk to each other.As for the characters, I won\'t drag on it. It gets a 4 mostly because of the shortcomings of the story. The fact that they skip straight to Tokyo does not allow for any development that would have been necessary to understand the characters\' decision and motivations. Some of the characters, like Asukara, are briefly introduced then swept aside. Same goes for Akari and Kanzaki, that were more present during Hiroshima. Also, a certain key character that has a key role in the anime has not appeared, and it\'s a shame because it explains a lot of things between Haruto and Asuka. Introducing it would probably not have given it enough time to make it to a conclusion within 12 episodes, so I can understand its absence.The last criteria is enjoyment, which got a 3. I feel like this is really brought down by the fact that I expected an anime that would be as enjoyable as its source material, which it was not. It is not the first time that I watched an anime based on a manga I already read, but it\'s the first time I am so disappointed with it. I usually like romantic stuff, both comedy and drama, but what I got here was useless drama and akward scenes.Overall it deserves a 4. It is an anime adaptation, but it\'s most certainly not a good one. It does have some novelty elements but it is far outhweighed by the overall lack of quality. If you read the manga, you don\'t need to watch this, and you\'ll be happier if you don\'t. If you haven\'t but like seinen, romance and drama, pick up the manga instead. before the anime.

Lets go through it one by one, mybe some ppl out there like it...i don\'t.Story:The story is way to rushed. There are huge timeskips, with character-ralations changing quite drastically without any explanation, so that in and of itself is a huge minus in my book.A strange undying love is used to justify toxic relationships....big minusCharacter conflict isn\'t resolved, the opposing character either gets killed of, or just magically changes for the better (looking at you little sister)...THERE IS NO KATHARSIS.Like, that\'s not necesarily bad, but... with show\'s like this it\'s the only redeeming feature. Imagine school-days but the MC survives....f*ckin BS.Art:Good Lord...what happened in Episode 2 at the End? I have NEVER seen an anime with a voice-acting performance so out of sync with the animatin. NEVER. The rest is ok, but nothing spectacular.Sound:As we call it in german: Schnulzig. It\'s cheesy af. Opening and Ending are catchy af thou, so that is nice. Also it\'s a lovy-dovy series, so it does what it should. Props.Characters:Bland, no development, rushed.I like that they included (some) dialects, which was nice. Though that point could have been stressed a lot more.Apart from that nothing sticks out, except the toxicity of Eva and her little Sister. As well as the weird mix of decisiveness (moves to tokyo for his love) and indecisiveness (just gives up on her for half the show) of the MC.Enjoyment:I literally suffered through this. The story dragged on, the art wasn\'t good enough to be enjoyed...I was really bored.Overall:Don\'t watch it. Just watch school days, it\'s better.Or watch 5cm a second, if you want a ""realistic depiction of love"".This show is hot sh*t, fight me THERE IS NO KATHARSIS.Like, that\'s not necesarily bad, but... with show\'s like this it\'s the only redeeming feature.

As well as the weird mix of decisiveness (moves to tokyo for his love) and indecisiveness (just gives up on her for half the show) of the MC.Enjoyment:I literally suffered through this. The story dragged on, the art wasn\'t good enough to be enjoyed...I was really bored.Overall:Don\'t watch it. Just watch school days, it\'s better.Or watch 5cm a second, if you want a ""realistic depiction of love"".This show is hot sh*t, fight me', 'I know a lot of people say to read the manga because it\'s ""better"", but it\'s for good reason.People who haven\'t read the manga may see us as some original source elitists, but you will never be able to experience everything the mangaka had to offer and his style of writing drama, through an the anime that plows through entire arcs within episodes.The manga was like a roller coaster of feels that spanned through years of years of Haruto\'s life. However, the anime is just like a compiled highlight reel of all of that, and because of it, the effect is not as great.Kimi no...iru machi is a manga that a lot of other ""romance"" and ""harem series don\'t really like to go through. It goes through relationships and breakups until he finds the one who he really feels that completes his life. This is shown through spanning arcs in the manga and you can really feel the sense of living his life as he goes through highschool, moving, graduating, and then living on his own.Sadly, the anime only has 12 episodes and it becomes difficult to capture that sense of time passing by.Finally, I\'m not saying NOT to watch the anime, but it would be great if you all gave the manga a chance. I\'ve read the manga twice and it made go through a variety of emotions and sometimes making me flip tables literally xD. I feel like it would be fun to share that same experience, so that\'s why I took the time to write this up!Happy reading everyone!Thanks,-morekawaiipls iru machi is a manga that a lot of other ""romance"" and ""harem series don\'t really like to go through.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, lets begin the review.Reasons You Should Watch This Show: The realism of...the relationships and situations portrayed in this series consisting of only 12 episodes and 4 OVA\'s are relatable and thought provoking. If you\'re anything like me you try to find as much meaning in a story as possible, and in my opinion the best selling point of this anime is in the way the story is told, and the ability to sway your emotions throughout the anime, as well as make you question the actions taken by the characters and whether or not they are the wrong or right ones; the ones you would take had it been you in their situation.Story: The story isn\'t perfect, but it\'s far from bad. The story consists of the MC trying to figure out his heart and the lengths he\'s willing to go for the girl he loves. I really enjoyed the concept of the story and the amount of meaning that can be found within the plot. One issue some people had is that the story was a bit rushed compared to the manga, and to a certain extent I agree that at times it did feel rushed, but nothing too bad. 7/10Characters: One of the best parts of this show is the characters, as the story goes on all of the major characters are developed. As they get older they act different towards each other and show their feelings differently. Just like most anime\'s though, the MC makes a lot of stupid decisions that could have easily been avoided, and although the characters are great, due to the 12 episode run time you miss out on a lot of potential character development. Imo though, I think this anime did the best job it could do on developing characters within such a short period. In addition you have 4 OVA\'s focused on tying up loose ends and providing extra backstory. 9/10Sound/Music: The soundtrack written by Keiichi Oku fits the atmosphere nicely and there are plenty of great songs that stand out in their own right. The OP and ED are bomb as well. As far as voice acting goes, the Japanese actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. 8/10Visuals/Animation: The art is very unique and is very pretty at times, though I noticed that the animation can be lazy. For example, they won\'t animate the characters talking if it\'s at the end of a sentence and the camera pans back to them. If you are familiar with the Monogatari series, the animation is very similar but not as ""edgy"". 8/10Enjoyment: Overall I related a lot with the main character and the decisions he ended up making. I really enjoyed the way the story was told, it was predictable at times but it also had a lot of unpredictable moments that had me eager to watch the next episode to find out what would happen. If you\'re into romance and are looking for something to relate to, this anime is for you.Story: 7/10Characters: 9/10Sound/Music: 8/10Visuals/Animation: 8/10Enjoyment: 10/10Final Rating: 8/10 the relationships and situations portrayed in this series consisting of only 12 episodes and 4 OVA\'s are relatable and thought provoking.

The MAL information is missing two very important things the genre Ecchi and the theme Harem, so just to warn you it is full of that.There is only one thing that I personally, in a completely subjective way, is Asuka, She was cute and nothing else. Now talking about the dislikes there are in abundance starting with the plot. It was a pretty basic guy running after a girl that he loved in childhood, nothing new...there. The progression of the plot was slow and the characters were shallow. The story had many turns from a love story to a harem and then going ntr at some points not only that but it manages to add a time jump too. The things that I hated the most were unnecessary thigh and panty shots that pop up after each minute and made no contribution to the situation at all.The anime made the worst plot turn into a downright abomination by making it not only a very basic love triangle but also kept adding new girls as the story progressed. The whole writing that went into the anime was pretty cheap, like they didn't even try to make an average story but just wrote whatever popped up first in their mind. Character development was laughable and whatever little development they made was heavily dependent on them going out with a new character and coming back to the old memories and it repeated a lot.The guy is shown as a nice guy so he doesn't want to hurt any of the girls and starts his ntr harem that is the point where many of the watchers feel compelled to drop it. The story had no constant theme it fluctuated a lot from love story to love triangle then to a harem and lastly to ntr. The camera angles were absolutely unnecessary, showing panties while the characters are talking about a serious topic is not something that adds any value, and showing the thighs of each girl more than twenty times is also just to keep the audience only for ecchi and not for the plot of the anime.Also, the anime follows all the basic Romance arcs like boring fireworks just to make memories and repeatedly uses them for bad character development. The rain when there is a sad scene gives the audience a bad cinematic and finally the breakup and they made it even worse in this anime. I still am baffled why the anime is rated this high while being nothing but a mixture of the worst thing.This is the worst piece of art I have watched to date. It is an absolute abomination on planet Earth, I would never recommend such badly written and directed anime to anyone. there. The progression of the plot was slow and the characters were shallow.

I despise this anime. I only like two characters in it and one of them was supporting. The ending was beyond the realm of dreadful. They should just rename this to ""School Days 2."" Yes, the ending was that bad. The MC is about as interesting and as smart as the many craps I took while watching this. Oh, also, about 3 episodes are SOLELY flashbacks. I found myself skipping over them too, because they held no relevance to the plot. While they gave an idea as to the relationship between the...MC and his female dog of a crush, they also served no purpose and could easily have been cut out without confusing the watcher. It has good art, but that\'s all. It\'s a waste of time to even fully review this garbage. Save yourself a few hours and don\'t watch this wreck of an anime.(SPOILERS) [+Large Your Lie In April spoiler]Oh, by the way. Did I mention how the MC\'s new best friend stole the MC\'s girlfriend from him unknowingly, and that the MC challenged said best friend to get her back? Yeah, also, best friend is dying and has surgery so that they can try to have an ""even"" playing field, but guess what? They pull a your lie in April and the surgery fails. You know what they do after that? Timeskip. Oh, and he suddenly forgot his original crush and dates the MUCH more likeable character, only for original crush to come back and ruin everything. Long story short, he breaks up with the perfect girl he had for Ms. ""I broke up with you for a guy after hearing he was dying but now that he\'s dead i love you again""(END OF SPOILERS)Seriously.

Our main protagonist something year old Haruto Kirishima transfers to Tokyo in pursuit of childhood friend and girlfriend Eba Yuzuki. Eba unexpectedly leaves Haruto’s home town Hiroshima and after a short while broke up with Haruto for unknown reasons, Haruto eventually tracks down Eba and demands an explanation for breaking up.That’s about as much of the story I can give away without spoiling it. A Town Where You Live was released back in the summer of 2013 and was the last series of the...summer line up that I wanted to watch. I only read the story briefly and I just assumed it would be a complicated love triangle, turns out I was right. So let’s go in to some detail.When watching the first episode I was drawn in entirely by the character designs and animation, it was very shiny and a visual treat for the eyes. I thought that regardless of the story the visuals would make up for it. I was wrong. The story is clichéd and soap oriented which made it hard to watch at times. (A soap is a weekly television drama for those who don't know)Then comes the god-awful characters that mess up the show entirely for me (with the exception of a few) I will start off with the biggest and main problem of the series which is Eba Yuzuki, she is undoubtedly the worst female character I have ever had the displeasure of watching for over 4 hours. Not only is she the dullest, most mind numbingly boring females leads I have ever seen, she is also one of the biggest bitches in this show! (Granted it was only her and her step-sister)We also have our main protagonist Haruto, who needs a slap to help him get over his simplistic and shitty ex-girlfriend. Haruto has a common personality; he just seems like your common everyday nice guy, who is also lucky enough to get the attention of a few female characters in the show, but never acts on it. He has good cooking skills and his friends encourage him to become a chef, though he see’s cooking as more of a hobby. (Essentially, he's a boring twat)Other mentionable characters include Kyouske Kazama a very cheerful guy who dreams of becoming a motorbike racer. His dreams are unlikely to happen because of his illness. (Anaemia) Kazama became friends with Haruto after giving Haruto some words of inspiration and encouragement not to give up on the woman he loves. Haruto finds out later that Kazama is dating Eba and the two begin a rivalry to win over Eba, the two are still very good friends though.Finally we have Asuka Mishima who is Haruto’s neighbor when he moves to Tokyo to live with his sister. She and Haruto first met when a misunderstood Asuka thought he was a thief and attacked him with a baseball bat. The two eventually became friends and later began to date one another.I don’t know whether the creator does it intentionally to make the two main characters so unlike-able. The main character is incredibly plain and generic. The supporting cast does a much better job; they are much more easy to relate to and have at least some desirable character traits.Probably the greatest thing about this show was the animation. I mean Wow! When looking back at Gonzo’s previous work like Saikano or Full Metal Panic you can just see the drastic change in beauty. The one thing you cant fault about this series is the animation.The sound of this anime was good I was content with the plate of music put in front of me, the opening theme is very good and I didn’t feel compelled to skip it after so many episodes. The ending theme was also likeable but I skipped it every now and then.The reasons why I felt that this series was bad because of its mundane characters, overuse of a love-triangle storyline and the flawed execution. This series was not trying to attempt anything new, the pacing of the series was not to the right standard which can annoy the viewer and the only redeeming quality of this anime was the animation. This series was likeable at times with moments such as: the relationship between Haruto and Asuka plus the rivalry/friendship between Haruto and Kazama. Sadly those moments were insignificant on the train wreck that was ‘A Town Where You Live’.Overall I did not like this anime it has one redeemable feature (animation style) that is not worth watching for this shitty, overused and stereotypical love triangle/love dilemma that occurs within this show. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they are fans of drama/romance genres. This show deserves a score of 5/10.Thanks for reading guys summer line up that I wanted to watch.

The ending and decisions made throughout the show are so disappointing and inhuman to be honest. The story is poopoo, and the characters are all whiny babies.

First off I have to say, these last few months I have watched many many romance anime to fill the deep black void in my heart and let me tell you, this anime just straight up isn\'t good.Imagine, a man falls in love with a mysterious girl from Tokyo that stayed with him, then all of a sudden, after their love finally reached a peak and they shared their feelings for one another, she up and leaves. So, whats the reasonable thing to do? Follow her from hundreds of kilometres away obviously! Well guess what, that sucks,...she has another boyfriend that she cheated on him with, and hes your best friend! So he decides to challenge his dying friend for a fight to win over his girlfriend.He dies from a failed surgery and he stops talking to her for some reason. Last time they meet up before a 2 year hiatus was to give an ex boyfriend her boyfriends dying present to him. Next thing you know, he dates an extremely sweet, innocent, naive, adorable girl, just when he thinks he gets over the girl from Tokyo, she appears again. They go to a group date, they talk a lot and reminisce about old times, all the while his girlfriend has no idea that this is happening. So, a few months pass and his girlfriend wants to go on a trip, but oh no, her grandmas back is messed up so she has to go see her. While she does that, she decides that he should go back to his hometown, with said ex girlfriend, to check on his family.A bunch of shit happens, reminiscence of old times, hanging out with friends and having a chuckle. Your ex wants to go to the festival with you, little do you know, she has an ulterior motive. Youre watching fireworks while she confesses her love to you, you reciprocate that love and embrace. Now, you actively cheats on your own sweet, innocent girlfriend, who prior, confided in you about her best friends death and you were the only one who could offer it. She fell in love with, always trusted you with everything and wanted to give you the world. But instead, you opted for childish, unrequited, and wrong love, abandoning your girlfriend, mixed up in her own feelings depressed because she still loves you.This anime was mediocre, bordering on terrible, the story is very very mediocre and just down right sad. It\'s supposed to be a happy ending about ""oh, love will always win, no matter how far apart you are or what happens"" but no, a lot of people got hurt. The girlfriend never deserved anything that happened to her and just wanted to give him happiness, lowkey pissed me off because she was willing to give him the world. Anyway, thats the end of my rant, not very good, not awful but not good. she has another boyfriend that she cheated on him with, and hes your best friend!

Now, you actively cheats on your own sweet, innocent girlfriend, who prior, confided in you about her best friends death and you were the only one who could offer it. She fell in love with, always trusted you with everything and wanted to give you the world. But instead, you opted for childish, unrequited, and wrong love, abandoning your girlfriend, mixed up in her own feelings depressed because she still loves you.This anime was mediocre, bordering on terrible, the story is very very mediocre and just down right sad. It\'s supposed to be a happy ending about ""oh, love will always win, no matter how far apart you are or what happens"" but no, a lot of people got hurt. The girlfriend never deserved anything that happened to her and just wanted to give him happiness, lowkey pissed me off because she was willing to give him the world. Anyway, thats the end of my rant, not very good, not awful but not good.', ""Kimi no Iru Machi. Where to start with this one... Well, for one, I did NOT enjoy this anime. I'm usually quick to drop series that I'm not into that much, but I wanted to try giving it more time to interest me. So, did this series interest me? Yes, in a way, it did. I wanted to know if the story goes further downhill or if it gets any better along the way.For me personally it just got worse. I suppose that if I tried really hard, I could find some moments where the story had gotten little better for a moment here...and there or a character made a smart decision for once, but if you look at the bigger picture (like this anime overall), those little things are so insignificant, they‘re not even worth mentioning.This anime tries to take a more realistic approach to relationships and love, and while I think it’s worth praising for that, I just can’t help but feel that it fails miserably.To quickly go over the aspects of the anime:Story: It had some potential, the idea wasn’t bad, though I feel the approach and execution of it was.Art: Not the best I’ve seen, but not bad either. No complaints here.Sound: The soundtrack was probably my favorite part of the show. The OP song stood out the most to me.Character: Only 1 or 2 of the characters were at least ‘ok’ to me. Plus, the story didn’t favor them at all and they ended up… Well I can’t say, because I don’t want to spoil anything if you DO decide to watch this series.Enjoyment: Can’t say that I completely despised watching this anime (wouldn’t have managed to finish it if I did), but I definitely can’t say that I had a good time watching this either.Overall: Kimi no Iru Machi tried to do something different, but unfortunately, it failed. I would not recommend watching this anime. and there or a character made a smart decision for once, but if you look at the bigger picture (like this anime overall), those little things are so insignificant, they‘re not even worth mentioning.This anime tries to take a more realistic approach to relationships and love, and while I think it’s worth praising for that, I just can’t help but feel that it fails miserably.To quickly go over the aspects of the anime:Story: It had some potential, the idea wasn’t bad, though I feel the approach and execution of it was.Art: Not the best I’ve seen, but not bad either.

This is really just a rant so, sorry if it sucks igQuick Explanation of characters that I mention in case anyone cares:Haruto - Main character, used to date Yuzuki in middle school but then they broke up when she moved back to Tokyo. He then moves to Tokyo in high school to continue pursuing her.Yuzuki - Haruto\'s ex-girlfriend for most of the show (they get back together because of course they do)Asuka -...One of Haruto\'s friends that he makes at his new high school in Tokyo. They start dating once they enter college.Rin - Yuzuki\'s younger sister.Some of the decisions that Haruto makes are absolutely ridiculous and upsetting to watch. I mean, the first decision that he makes is moving all the way to Tokyo from Hiroshima in order to find out how the girl he USED TO date ""really feels"" about him. Very creepy behavior.Also, definitely don\'t watch this if you dislike it when ""lack of communication"" is used as a major plot point because it happens OFTEN, especially in the last half of the show. Look, I get that it can be used in an interesting way, but there are times when Haruto DOES NOT tell his new girlfriend things ON PURPOSE. And then he gets surprised when it blows up in his face!! Wow!!!!This could just be me but I think Rin was just the worst character. Her only purpose in the show was to stir up drama between Haruto, Asuka, and Yuzuki. And it was very irritating. Sometimes, shows can have purposefully antagonistic characters who do stir up drama or cause chaos in an entertaining or interesting way, but Rin just kind of sucked. It wasn\'t enjoyable to watch when she causes unnecessary drama that Haruto only makes worse by not telling Asuka the truth.The only thing I really liked was the opening. It was nice, but that might\'ve just been in comparison to the rest of the show not being very good. One of Haruto\'s friends that he makes at his new high school in Tokyo.

It hints an idea that the moral of the story is about maturing past poor decisions and making the right choice in life... only for the story to fall into contrivances just to keep the god-chosen girl as the winner no matter the circumstances.The manga is not just double as guilty of this as the anime, but it\'s 3-4 times as guilty. It\'s an absolute dumpster fire of plot...contrivances.You\'d think that this was based on a bad visual novel because of how bad the story is. But in fact there are objectively many ""bad"" visual novels with much better adaptions. I\'d go so far as to say there are bad visual novels better than the manga in general simply from their basic idea and the ability to enjoy how cheesy or bad they are.This series is just... a dumpster fire about the childish fantasy that ""Everything works out in the end"". Even ""Moe"" anime\'s can get the basic premise of how life works and people grow as individuals, but this anime refuses that concept and tries to give an instance where being a complete jackass works out through bad writing.Don\'t touch it. Just... don\'t. Not even the manga because it\'s much worse in every aspect except character development, which exponentially makes everything else worse as a result. contrivances.You\'d think that this was based on a bad visual novel because of how bad the story is.

The audience is strung along the main characters quest as he tries to reconnect with his long lost love, with many questions, secrets, trials and tribulations along the way. Romance stories, or at least good ones, are always roller coasters to say the least and usually are always told in the same way. However, Kimi Ni Machi Iru finds its way to reuse the old methodology and turn it into a new refreshing tale of love. Watching the main characters journey unfold is...definitely worth watching.Story: 8.3 -The story isn't innovative by any means, and it usually revolves around the same concept. A good way to compare Kimi Ni Machi Iru is like comparing it to a Korean Drama show. They always tell it the same way, but it is how they use it, is the key to success. Throughout the story, there are well placed literary devices (symbolism/foreshadowing/irony etc.) and without a keen eye, one could miss out on a completely well developed scene.Animation: 8.5 -The art direction definitely has a stylized theme to it, from hues or rather colors depicting the mood and setting of the situation or scene to, warm, calming and serene pastel like colors. Oftentimes, there is no attention to detail, which can be confusing and the question of why it couldn't have just been consistent arises, however overall, it does deserve an honorable mention.Characters: 8.3 -The characters are probably the hardest thing to rate in Kimi Ni Machi Iru, and it's definitely going to be opinionated. Each character in the story are very like-able and most likely the audience will end up choosing their favorites (Here comes the rage!). Get ready to see the males name x females name on youtube or comment posts, although the story is most likely predetermined. The characters display their emotions quite vividly, which is also complemented with the art &amp; animation, which can be truly taxing on the soul. These characters deliver a very realistic and very human emotions, that often the viewer can definitely relate to, even if sometimes we might not agree with from a story standpoint or perspective.Wow Factor: 8.5 -Kimi Ni Machi Iru does not disappoint and will keep the audience quite amused/engaged until the very end or perhaps just the opposite, to people who compare it to the manga. The story and its characters in it will take you for a heart felt, possibly tear jerking melodramatic journey that is absolutely worth a watch.Final Grade: 8.4 / 10 - &gt; 8 (Anime List)+ Good use of Literary Devices (Used in story telling, ex: Foreshadowing, Symbolism etc.)+ Good use of flash backs+ Opening Intro &amp; Song (MIMI MEME MIMI - Sentimental Love)- Sometimes too easy to read &amp; generic of whats to come- More consistency with the Art styleReview by: AzurexSky of AniRaters definitely worth watching.Story: 8.3 -The story isn't innovative by any means, and it usually revolves around the same concept.

It had many flaws but also many pros that made it an enjoyable one to watch.Story:The story of this anime was good, but in my opinion, it lacked clarity. Often throughout the anime, you find yourself confused or puzzled in regards to what is actually happening. Constantly, there are flashbacks that generally complicated the story and ultimately made it hard to follow. In my opinion, i did not hate the story. Instead, i quite enjoyed it despite the countless flaws that were present.Art:Many can criticize the animation by saying that the characters and setting...were poorly drawn. However, i could argue otherwise because i honestly believe that the animation in this anime was not bad. Although, there were many parts that were terribly done, i would still say that the art was not bad. If i were to give my honest opinion, i would say that the art was fair. There was nothing special as the anime contained simplistic animations and ordinary color use.Sound:This was probably the best thing the show had going for it. Oddly enough, i quite enjoyed the music and sounds used within this anime. I felt as though the producers used music/sounds effectively draw out a particular mood within the anime.Character:The characters were good, but was not excellent. At times, it is seen that the characters lacked substance. In other words, it can be seen that the producers rushed the development of the characters resulting in dull and vague personalities. Personally, i did not mind the characters, but i do feel as though they could have been developed more.Enjoyment:I could honestly say that i enjoyed this anime, despite all its flaws. There were easily more cons than pros in this anime, but even so, the anime was one that was quite amusing to watch.Overall:As a final statement, i can say that this was a good anime. To anyone who enjoys watching anime that involves romance then this is definitely one that is worth checking out. After watching this anime, i can honestly recommend it to everyone as it was one that was quite enjoyable. were poorly drawn.

Recommended for people that don\'t want a typical cliche humor romance, but something more realistic with a deeper meaning.This will be an analytical interpretation of the story and thoughts passing through each character. I suffered from a lot of trauma (PTSD) in my life and have a very deep psychological understanding of sorrow, hope, despair, grief, depression and various other complex emotions and most importantly: LOVE.SPOILERS INCLUDED.The most highlighted emotion in this anime is that of true love. I am not talking about a simple crush like you have on someone you find attractive. This...is the kind of love that you\'ll only experience once in your life if you are lucky enough (I for one was lucky enough). Your sense of logic and kindness gets overwritten by the deep desire to grasp that love that you lost, once more and this time hold on to it as tight as you can. It\'s the kind of love that will make you lose all reason. It\'s the kind of love that will fill your heart with pure bliss and turn your mind into a permanent happy drug. It\'s the kind of love that is impossible to understand unless you experienced it.I hope this explanation of what true love is, helps you understand my analysis better.Haruto is your run-off-the-mill typical high school student. Nothing special about him in the beginning, except that he has a crush on a high school girl. Then he stumbles upon his fateful encounter as a kid, but is unaware of what that means for his future life. He then meets his fated love in form of Yuzuki Eba during high school but forgot about her (pretty stupid plot flaw at this point as such an encounter is highly memorable, but let\'s give him the benifit of doubt).She (Yuzuki Eba) invades his fairly boring life with so much energy, that he has no choice but to fall head over heels in that loveable person. Why is she so energetic though? Such coincidence is miraculous on paper, but she herself already fell in love with him at young age and that memory stuck with her as one of her happiest (very important for the plot development).Sidestep into Yuzuki\'s life: Yuzuki returns to Tokyo after her childhood memory with Haruto. Get\'s mentally tormented by her younger sister. This kind of torment turns her entire psyche into a mess. At this point she is full of despair and pities herself, believing she is unwanted. The Kyousuke comes into the picture as the white knight that saves her from her misery. Slowly she accepts his kindness and sees him as a true friend that is too kind to be true (this is very real for someone that is suffering deeply, anyone that is remotely kind is idolized). He falls in love with her, she rejects him, but feels terrible for doing so.Back to main story: Yuzuki is a lot more cheerful after being saved from misery and back together with the person she truly loves, Haruto. He then also notices that he is deeply in love with her too, but then ugly destiny pitches into their beautiful love and makes their life an entire utter mess. Kyousuke is the most to blame for this mess, although he is a good guy at heart with no ill intentions.From the Anime itself it is unclear if Kyousuke indirectly blackmailed Yuzuki with his illness and abusing her weak and kind heart to give in to his desires. However, it is clear that Yuzuki feels terrible for the person that saved her from her weakest state and feels like she owes him all he desires, since his own life is about to run out.Here on out the misunderstandings of the viewers occurs: ""Yuzuki treating Haruto like trash and rejecting him"". This statement is as wrong as can be. What really happens is: Yuzuki rejects Haruto because she is extremely confused. Not only that, but she is too kind of a person to let her ""white knight"" (Kyousuke) suffer any more than he already does, so she gives in to giving him the mutual love he desires (but it\'s fake love). Yuzuki isn\'t at fault here, she has no ill intentions at all and hopes it\'s the correct choice.Kyousuke dies and now the REAL mess begins. Haruto lost a great friend, Yuzuki lost her saviour and good friend. Both of them are mentally broken at this point. Both of them drown in an ocean of despair and sorrow. The love they shared is lost in their extremely messy psyche.Both of them are highly vulnerable at this point. Any kind of affection will give them comfort. Yuzuki probably gets the affection of her younger sister, because her younger sister starts to feel bad for her (this isn\'t clear in the anime but the best interpretation I have).And Asuke who always had a crush on Haruto, finally makes a move on him in his most vulnerable state. He takes it as a substitute love, but it\'s truly just a substitute to his true love. Asuka may be genuine about the love, she is fairly simple and probably also seeks comfort after the loss of her seemingly best friend Kyousuke. And so Haruto and Asuka intertwine in a mostly onesided and fake relationship. While on surface the relationship they have looks like they make a cute couple, Haruto still suffers deeply from losing so many things along the line.Haruto got driven into so many corners, that he can\'t act like a nice person anymore and stops caring about trying to make everyone happy. So instead he pursues his own dream of reclaiming his one and only true love.Yuzuki finally having dealt with all her past issues, can now let her heart roam freely and thus inevitably floating back to the only person she ever truly loved, her fated encounter: Haruto. Initially she just acts like she just wants a friendship with him (trust me, I am in a similar boat right now), but in reality she just wants to not lose Haruto anymore and get closer to him once more with the last grain of hope she has for fulfilling her love wish.Haruto becomes a scumbag towards Asuka, because loves rules over reason. If you think Haruto is just a simple asshole, you never suffered enough in your life to understand the pain he is actually going through (or okay, yes it is an anime and fictional character, so just imagine a real person like me).What do both characters suffer from? Let\'s name the issues and constant stress they deal with:-> Heartbroken (mostly depression)-> Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (leads to depression and various other terrible things)-> Hopelessness (caused by the constant obstacles their relationship gets plagued with)-> Distance-> a few additonal minor issues that add up to the count but not worth mentioning to keep the list focused on the main issuesI suffer from more than that, but less is enough to drive them insane in their rational mindset. So ofcourse Haruto can\'t play Mr. Niceguy towards Asuka anymore and the pre-doomed fake relationship they had together comes to an obvious end. Asuka doesn\'t deserve to be treated like that, but there is no helping his attitude. Many viewers are probably aggrevated for Haruto\'s behaviour towards Asuka, especially when he lies all the time. Rather than hating him tho, pity him instead. He is suffering so much, that he feels like he needs to lie to one of his most precious people in life.Then after their breakup, Haruto feels terrible about himself and Yuzuki notices that Haruto is severely hurt and highly vulnerable once again from having to break the heart of Asuka. The pain he suffers at that point is immeasurable and extremely hard to put into words, just imagine staring into eternal emptiness.After coming clean with Asuka, he can finally pursue his dream of fulfilling his deepest desire once again: Come together with Yuzuki one final time and enjoy their long awaited mutual and beautiful true love.The ending and how it\'s displayed in a tone of despair with a dark rainy mood setting at the end really shows that true love comes with a price when so much shit got between you and your true love.People that understand this kind of psychological aspect of the characters, can really respect the author for trying his best at displaying such realistic and beautiful love to the audience without all the cliche anime garbage that floods the anime market. I am talking about all the nonsense humor that usually gets put on display in romance animes with the addition of pointless pantyshots and other fanservice. is the kind of love that you\'ll only experience once in your life if you are lucky enough (I for one was lucky enough).

The anime however, was a whole different animal in essence and I personally felt that the animators did a poor job on this then they have with other works I\'ve known them to do.The Plot ~Overall the plot depicted by the anime is ok. At first the fast pace of the anime had me entertained, but as I progressed through the story I realized just how down to earth and simple it was. There...was a lot of going back and forth between past and present, and sometimes this was pieced together in a way that simply became incomprehensible and incoherent to the manga.The story itself (as depicted by the anime) seems downright flawed and cruel, basically weak-willed boy (Haruto) has his girl (Eba) cheat on him, he wants her back but she\'s with a friend of his who\'s about to die, so he\'s stuck with a dilemma. So he hitches another girl (Asuka) nearby. Then he cheats on that girl.So between the characters cheating, that really all they let you see in this anime and its kind of depressing as a whole.The Art ~The art wasn\'t that bad. It seemed more like Modern Shoujo to me. There seems to be this presence of ""static"" in the motions created by the animators, but this should not diminish your viewing of the anime--just minor lighting aspects could have been tweaked to make the anime more bold and color-appealing like other animes.The Sound ~The OP and ED aren\'t half bad for this song. I gave this a 9 out of 10. The anime as a whole could\'ve used more string orchestra sound tracks in my honest opinion.Characters~This had me pretty sad. Not only do the animators show you so little of the characters\' character, but also the fast paced story doesn\'t give you time to breathe and analyze the characters as a whole.Haruto basically lacks a pair and when he gets it he\'s stuck with a dilemma of friendship. At first I pitied him because Eba leaves him, but towards the end I kind of understand why. I hated him when he cheats on Asuka and doesn\'t do anything when Asuka confronts him. To be honest when they were coming clean to each other I wish Haruto got up and stopped Asuka from leaving, beg her and tell her he was sorry and tell her not to leave.But then again, thats another story.Eba more or less PMS\'s half the story. First she likes Haruto like crazy, then she likes this other guy, then she wants to steal Haruto back when Haruto\'s going out with another girl? What\'s her problem?Asuka is perhaps my favorite, as she\'s the most human and understandable character throughout the entire anime. She portrays the every day girl, in essence, and when she is betrayed she is the only character I actually was able to sympathize with.Rin is your archetypal tsundere. She likes Haruto and hates her older sister, and yet gives Haruto advice and even aids the two in getting back together. I don\'t really understand her--why doesn\'t she just grab Haruto herself?As for the rest of the characters--I can\'t really say much. And the reason is because the animators failed to show more of each character--the only image you\'re able to grasp is a shallow image of one.Overall ~To be honest this piece could have used more work.If you like twisted and denied Romance then this is the anime for you. 3.5 out of 5 stars for the undeniably twisted and cruel Romance ""Kimi no Iru Machi"". was a lot of going back and forth between past and present, and sometimes this was pieced together in a way that simply became incomprehensible and incoherent to the manga.The story itself (as depicted by the anime) seems downright flawed and cruel, basically weak-willed boy (Haruto) has his girl (Eba) cheat on him, he wants her back but she\'s with a friend of his who\'s about to die, so he\'s stuck with a dilemma.

However, this anime attempts to step out of the boundaries and try a lot of different stuff, where at times two seem in love or there\'s a love pentagon. Not that this is a bad idea, it\'s just the cluster of emotions and how much the show tries to tackle at once causes it to be detrimental to my enjoyment.I have not read the manga, and I am going into this review, not with the mindset of...""the manga is better and the show fucked up"" but that the show is just not worth your time and has no polarizing or memorable moments at all.Starting off withStory: 2The show starts off with a boy leaving his small city, heading for the big city chasing a girl who left. The show is asking for a rather sublime and bittersweet reaction when reacting to the twists and turns taken that are taken. Going into detail later in the character portion, you can honestly take characters (Yuzuki\'s sister) and turn their part of the story into just a normal backstory explained for around 5-10 seconds however it\'s mainly to have more time due to the creator trying to pull off too much in a show that shouldn\'t be that complex. Although there being intriguing parts, there is so much unnecessary fanservice, characters, plot points and in general, the whole show is irrelevant and doesn\'t contribute to a larger picture and is rather contradicting at times with the main message it\'s trying to portray. Which leads me to give it a score of 2.Art: 3Nothing special. Lighting doesn\'t go with the characters and doesn\'t look clean most of the time. The writer favors more people with blue and brown hair and choosing a generic main character to lead the atrocious story. You can easily find characters from other shows that look identical to the ones in this show with low uninfluential and lazy art style with making the characters distinct and stand out.Sound: 1This is probably the worst sound/music in anime I\'ve heard. OP and ED are ok, not that bad, but the TIMING in the showexample, say a joke, have a lil funny bright song playsad, play a sad songBUT THE SHOW DOESNT THINK HEY MAYBE ITS A GOOD IDEA TO THROW MUSIC IN TO FIT THE MOOD, WHICH LEAVES ALL OF THE INTEGRAL SEENS LACKLUSTER IMPORTANCE. YOU SEE A CHARACTER CRYING OR FIND OUT SOMETHING PLOT TURNING HAVE GOOD SOUND AND HAVE COMMON SENSE, DON\'T JUST DO NOTHING.Which leads me to my Characters: 2Honestly, like I said before the show is just a gigantic clusterfuck of emotions that the writer does not know how to portray properly and give characters roles. The emotions felt at times and the way the show just crams everything into one sole character is confusing at points and leads to misleading turnouts in a lot of plot points in the show. Other than the characters being annoying bland every possible thing you can hate in a character. Which leads me to my score of 2Enjoyment: 3I\'m a heartthrob for lovey-dovey scenes in any romance, and that\'s generally what is keeping the show from being a failure at romance in general with being super frustrating at points. It\'s just disappointing in general and tries too hard to be different and have head-turning moments when they don\'t have a clue what to do after or handle moments correctly.Therefore, due to the horrific story, generic and saturated trash called art, truly terrible story, bland n uninteresting characters, and little to no enjoyment from this show I leave without a single feeling on my tongue with how bittersweet this show was;Leaving my overall score at a 2 ""the manga is better and the show fucked up"" but that the show is just not worth your time and has no polarizing or memorable moments at all.Starting off withStory: 2The show starts off with a boy leaving his small city, heading for the big city chasing a girl who left.

If you want some NTR bs this is the show.The main girl was the worst character, but all of them were soooo terrible. I wonder what’s the conclusion of the author finishing this anime. All of the characters didn’t choose to be truthful to their feelings or for the other’s. They were taking every decision possible to keep themselves miserable and the others too.It didn’t make any sense till the very end.The anime direction was so confusing, some situations just ends abruptly other stuff start out of nowhere.If you can please don’t watch this LOL! ', '""Kimi no Iru Machi is arguably the most pointless romance anime ever created. With characters engaging in cringe-worthy theatrics to the protagonist making some inexplicably foolish decisions, all culminating to an exasperating narrative.The anime kicks off with a useless and utterly tedious arc featuring Haruto and his friend Kazama vying for Eba\'s affection. However, the conflict lacks any substance whatsoever, as Eba\'s inclinations are very much evident, and much of the episodes consist of recapping her relationship with the main character. This type of dramatic tension could have been either intensified or discarded altogether. Alternatively, dedicating episodes to Kazama\'s character development with a different girl...or Eba herself could have made him more likeable and attachable for the viewers, given his rapid and almost comical disappearance.The MC\'s declaration of ""war"" earlier in the series is cringe-inducing, reminding me of low-quality late-night teen romances on channels like Star Movies. There is a recurrence of this issue, considering most of the dialogue was seemingly written by a 16 year old wattpad fanfic writer.Moving on to the protagonist, his demeanor fluctuates between a love guru and a heartless bastard, creating an odd amalgamation of character tropes that feels out of place. The show fails to capitalize on his positive traits beyond the generic ""nice guy A"" archetype. A pseudo-harem forms around him as well, and he ultimately comes across as a cheap self-insert for the writer or viewers.The vast majority of this anime feels forced, manufactured, and unrealistic. Plot points develop abruptly without easing the viewers into it, resulting in a messy and amateurishly written narrative.The last episode particularly is directed so poorly, I suspect maybe the studio ran out of budget. This is evident with how awkwardly this show is directed in the first place. It feels like there\'s a theme or an art to its direction, but looking deeper you see a half-hearted attempt to adapt a mediocre manga churned out with a fairly low budget and no passion whatsoever.Overall, Kimi no Iru Machi lacks redeeming qualities, with unresolved characters, inconsistent direction, occasional subpar animation, and forgettable storytelling. The subsequent two-episode OVA has some merits and is relatively decent, but the 12-episode series falls short, highlighting the inferiority of shounen romance compared to its contemporaries.

Well just don't watch it.🙏"", 'If you plan on watching this anime, then allow me to give you a fair heads up: it is best to read the manga first.I found that this anime (same with the OVA\'s) are more orientated for the fans of the manga, it gives off a vibe of nostalgia.Obviously the anime has some pros and cons, but note that I view the shows differently, and as far as a review goes, this is my first.Story: It is pretty basic. Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl back, happy.However in this case, you can by-pass the ""Boy meets Girl"" part, and add...alot of little twists and troubles in there.Art: There are times when the animation seems to be sloppy, as if at times the animators said ""meh..no-one will notice.."", and the faces appear to be very generic, but that\'s about it. The background/scenery art was pretty cool, and at times when there was a still frame, they made it look like a water colour based painting.Sound: Voice acting was good, alot of emotion put into the acting. Also the 2nd Ed (end of episode 6?) made me cry, the music (and the music throughout) suited the anime. If it was sad, the music gave that vibe, and so-forth.Character: Well if you watched the anime as an introduction to the series, you may not be too attached to the characters. Haruto is the indecisive protagonist, Eba is ""the one who got away"" (literally!) and the MC\'s main love interest. However! All the characters can be relate-able.  What ever decision Haruto made, you can see where he\'s getting at and understand why he did as such. you feel for Eba when all is revealed why she left Haruto, and the interactions between the two (and all other characters) is heart wrenching.Now I for one greatly enjoyed this anime. It gave me nostalgia, made me cry, made me want to falcon punch my laptop so many times, and made me happy. If you want to watch a show that tugs on your heart strings and can make you feel empty at times, the I recommend this. HOWEVER! I highly suggest you read the manga, or up til vol 10 (therefore you know the characters and understand the anime\'s setting) If not, then the OVA\'s do a re-cap of the first 5 or 7 volumes of the manga. alot of little twists and troubles in there.Art: There are times when the animation seems to be sloppy, as if at times the animators said ""meh..no-one will notice.."", and the faces appear to be very generic, but that\'s about it.

I quite enjoy it then stopped. It got boring maybe because I saw no ending to it AND maybe because there's many readers that they won't put an ending to it. Wait, I'm not here to talk bout the manga, WELL, i realized the story is very good for it has finally became an anime. The anime is not as good as the manga thou. But you must give it a try coz the twist of the story is really3x great!The story is about a hometown boy named Haruto who chased a girl to the...big city because he realized he loved her. That girl is Yuzuki Eba. Yuzuki is a city girl from Tokyo who went to Haruto's hometown to study because her father sent her there. But the truth is, Yuzuki is also looking for the promise boy she met when she were a kid, and that is Haruto. They lived in the same roof. But Haruto doesn't seem like Yuzuki(maybe coz Yuzuki is a little clingy, and flirty. LOL). When Yuzuki is about to leave the hometown, Haruto saw a picture of them when they were a kid. And that thing gave Haruto a hint that Yuzuki is being like that because he promised something to Yuzuki.That's all I wanna share. The story is really great, like, you'll be surprise most often.P.S Haruto is HOTTER in manga BELIEVE ME. Ck it out! big city because he realized he loved her. That girl is Yuzuki Eba.

Ck it out!"", 'Before I start I\'m gonna say that I watched this anime and then read the manga afterwards.I know many, many people would say things like ""anime should not be compared to manga"" etc etc. HOWEVER, in this case I feel like this anime was a complete disgrace to the manga and mangaka himself.But get this: this anime adapted 144 CHAPTERS from the manga into 12 EPISODES. Anyone with a right mind would think that\'s bizarre.The anime starts at chapter 80 in the manga, and ""tries"" to make a decent story from there by making chapters 1-80 into a 2 episode flash back and then...going from chapter 80-144 in only 10 episodes. Because of this, from an anime only point of view, you never know why the MC even likes the main heroine in the first place, and the beginning of the anime starts at such an awkward place that it\'s hard to connect with how the MC is feeling. It would have been fine if this anime just started from chapter 1, so we could have a fresh start with the characters rather than starting the anime with a character that\'s supposed to have gone through a lot of insane development already. The flash backs barely help because it\'s a MUCH different experience to watch flash backs than seeing those events actually happen chronologically. To make matters worse, the ending to this anime was so dry and abrupt that it basically forces you to read the manga. Anime should be able to stand alone without a manga, right? Well this anime is simply mediocre without reading the manga.The art is actually pretty nice. The opening looks beautiful and the characters are true to their manga forms. However, sometimes the art on certain characters look off. Other than that the art is great.The characters are one of the main problems in this anime. The characters simply lack development. The set-up for this anime makes the MC look like a stalker and the main heroine look like an a** hole, but if you actually know what truly happened in chapters 1-80, you\'d know why the MCs act the way they do. The anime rushes development for the side characters as well due the fact that there was 144 chapters adapted into a 12 episode anime.For enjoyment, I was simply left hanging at the end. At the end of the anime, I felt like I wasted my time. The events were so weirdly scattered, and I could barely connect with the characters until, BAM, the anime was over when things started getting good. It\'s really sadenning for anime only watchers, cuz the manga actually goes on for another 100+ chapters after it ends at the anime, and the anime skipped tons of chapters from the beginning. It\'s simply a mess.I would ONLY recommend watching this anime if you have read the entire manga already. I only consider this anime as eye-candy, meaning that I would only watch this to see how the manga would look animated. And it\'s definitely not bad in the animation/art department. But storywise, this anime is just mediocre at BEST. The manga is a masterpiece that should have gotten a true anime adaptation.

Sadly most animes nowadays are just ""trailers"" for the manga, and this anime is a perfect example of that.', ""''If you are not happy, I'll be here, dont forget that''This Anime really was one of the strangest Animes I recently watched. Don't missunderstand me, its not weird in a ''The-Characters-are-totally-strange-Over-The-Top-I-Dont-Understand-One-Thing Manner.Its just the hole plot of the Anime. It has a huge amounf of potential which destroys itself by one-dimensional, totally dump  & unrealistic acting main characters. Before beginning, I should mention, I only watched the anime. So this review is based on my experiences with the anime series only.STORYThe male two main protagonists are Eba Yuzuki & Kirishima Haruto. The Story itself might sound simple if you read it...the first time. Girl moves from Tokyo to the country side to join a school where her beloved boy studys. The boy, Haruto-San, doesn't like the idea of not only going to school with a foreign girl, even living with that girl together. At first, all that stuff sounds weird, more so it's like a joke. When I read the description the first time, I really thought, ''Oh no, really? unrealistic scenario incoming!''.But its not. The move of Eba Yuzuki, the main heroine, is been described in a conceivable explanation. That was a surprise, I didn't expect. Actually, the story sounded pretty interesting after eliminating this potential of missunderstanding.Long story short: The plot of the Anime has a good amount of potential but lacks extensviely in the rest, which I will explain now.ARTWell, what can we expect from that Anime regarding to the art- & animation-design? First of all we should really look up when this anime was published. Kimi no Iru Machi is from 2013. So right now as I'm writing the review to Kimi no Iru Machi, we are talking about a difference of 2 years.At no time, really no time, I felt that this Anime is really from the year 2013. More so, the art & animation really gave me the feeling, that the animations and the general art-design had to be older. The unfluent, robotic animations  appear like, the anime was published in 2009 or 2010. The moves of the characters, in particular when they are running or even slowly walking appear ludicrously robotic, the colour-design expecially from the nature appears woolly & unfinished. Even the hair-styles of the main- and secondary characters seem like, they are from the late 90's and beginning of the 00's.In contrast to that though, you have a beautiful art-design when it comes to Tokyo and the nereby surroundings. Especially at night, you notice a huge amount of light effects additionally with the awesome designed skyline of Tokyo. Nonetheless, at the end making bad design desicions regarding to the character- & nature art can't compensate the wonderfully animated city panorama.SOUNDWhen it comes to the sound of the anime I can shortly summarize it as ''mediocore''. Allthough the anime has  drastical and important turning points the sound in general is NOT doing it's  job in supporting the plot, in particular the dramatic situations. At least, it is not horribly bad at all.CHARACTERThe Characters, the meat and potatoes when it comes to creating a decent anime. Allthough this section is one of the most important aspects for the success, Kimi No Iru Machi totally fails at this point. The main problem is the  totally nonexistent empathy for the two main protagonists Eba Yuzuki & Kirishima Haruto. Both are acting in a totally scripted & iditotic manner without any sense at all. What I mean is, both characters appear totally unlikely & implausible. At no time you have the feeling of dealing with natural human beings. Instead you deal with an extreme version of stereotypes, even unusual for animes. One unrealistic conversation follows the other. Actually at various situation during the series I felt embarrassed for the characters. Kirishima ''retard'' Haruto is acting like a 14 years old boy who discovered love a few minutes ago. Eba Yuzuki is one more character whom I didn't feel any kind of empathy for. She trys to act ''kawaii'' but appeals unrealstically dump. Since in Japan this kawaii-stuff is crucial when it comes to creating a female character, Eba Yuzuki fails in every single aspect. The authors tried to pigeon-hole Eba  into the kawaii-drawer and this came out. Unnatural character acting not comprehensible, appearing like an onvoiced secondary character, allthough she is the main heroine besides Haruto.The only credible characters in the anime were a handful of secondary characters, especially Mishima Asuka & Eba Rin, the younder sister of Yuzuki-San.ENJOYMENTAll in all I still enjoyed watching the anime. Sometimes it is okay watching animes that are not outstanding and deal with problems in character creation and art-design. Sadly, the anime had the potential to be more then mediocore. But the fatal & unrealistic characters compared with the  squishy art design can't mask the lack of common theme. the first time. Girl moves from Tokyo to the country side to join a school where her beloved boy studys. The boy, Haruto-San, doesn't like the idea of not only going to school with a foreign girl, even living with that girl together. At first, all that stuff sounds weird, more so it's like a joke. When I read the description the first time, I really thought, ''Oh no, really? unrealistic scenario incoming!''.But its not. The move of Eba Yuzuki, the main heroine, is been described in a conceivable explanation. That was a surprise, I didn't expect. Actually, the story sounded pretty interesting after eliminating this potential of missunderstanding.Long story short: The plot of the Anime has a good amount of potential but lacks extensviely in the rest, which I will explain now.ARTWell, what can we expect from that Anime regarding to the art- & animation-design? First of all we should really look up when this anime was published. Kimi no Iru Machi is from 2013. So right now as I'm writing the review to Kimi no Iru Machi, we are talking about a difference of 2 years.At no time, really no time, I felt that this Anime is really from the year 2013. More so, the art & animation really gave me the feeling, that the animations and the general art-design had to be older. The unfluent, robotic animations  appear like, the anime was published in 2009 or 2010. The moves of the characters, in particular when they are running or even slowly walking appear ludicrously robotic, the colour-design expecially from the nature appears woolly & unfinished. Even the hair-styles of the main- and secondary characters seem like, they are from the late 90's and beginning of the 00's.In contrast to that though, you have a beautiful art-design when it comes to Tokyo and the nereby surroundings. Especially at night, you notice a huge amount of light effects additionally with the awesome designed skyline of Tokyo. Nonetheless, at the end making bad design desicions regarding to the character- & nature art can't compensate the wonderfully animated city panorama.SOUNDWhen it comes to the sound of the anime I can shortly summarize it as ''mediocore''. Allthough the anime has  drastical and important turning points the sound in general is NOT doing it's  job in supporting the plot, in particular the dramatic situations. At least, it is not horribly bad at all.CHARACTERThe Characters, the meat and potatoes when it comes to creating a decent anime. Allthough this section is one of the most important aspects for the success, Kimi No Iru Machi totally fails at this point. The main problem is the  totally nonexistent empathy for the two main protagonists Eba Yuzuki & Kirishima Haruto. Both are acting in a totally scripted & iditotic manner without any sense at all. What I mean is, both characters appear totally unlikely & implausible. At no time you have the feeling of dealing with natural human beings. Instead you deal with an extreme version of stereotypes, even unusual for animes. One unrealistic conversation follows the other.

So today, I’ve decided to write a review of Kimi no Iru Machi, which through my opinion, deserves criticism for its overall entity.Let’s have a review:It’s plot is  said to be portrayed  as drama and romance, however ,this is not it! Yes it depicts slice of life; however, this one is rather characterized as tragic romance.  Here, the plot is a retrospective one whereby it moves from the present...to the past from time to time, yet it gives no time for the viewer to adapt to this gigantic melancholic scenario. Kimi no Iru Machi, is a typical love story where the main character Haruto Kirishima principally has a crush on a girl Kanzaki Nanami but at the same time spends most of his time with his childhood friend Eba Yuzuki whom he disliked at first. As the anime progresses those two friends developed in terms of relationship but broke up as Eba Yuzuki went back to the city of Tokyo. Haruto sets on a quest to find her in Tokyo but meets with new acquaintances. There is more than this. Personally, this anime deserves a 5 for its story line whereby I could not find any such happiness in the atmosphere surrounding the main characters. This anime fails to develop primarily due to its 12 episodes show.Aesthetically speaking, the anime is directed with a high sense of realism. The characters are drawn with a touch of realism so does the background. There is nothing spectacular about this anime as its effect give a sense of uneasiness, coldness and fluster the viewer with frustration. Nevertheless, one positive point is that, the production has been able to demonstrate, though slightly, the difference of atmosphere of the countryside and the city. Kimi no Iru Machi deserves a 5.5 for its well drawn characters and atmosphere; however this rating does not go beyond that.Furthermore, this anime does not propel the viewer to something deep and enjoyable through its music. As for me, I skipped the Opening song as well as its ending while watching this anime progression because I was crammed with frustration.Finally it comes to the characters. I despise both Haruto Kirishima and Eba Yuzuki for their irresponsible attitude towards each other as well for other characters of the anime. Besides, for it only 12 episodes show, it gives no time for the viewer to create a bond with any specific character except for one, namely Asuka Mishima. As for Rin Eba, another likeable character from my opinion, deserves an A+ for the way she treats Haruto.Well, well,  my opinion may be bias by personal experience however I dislike this character for his irresponsible attitude towards his ex girlfriend Eba Yuzuki and Asuka Mimishima. There is nothing spectacular with this typical guy whose main concern is about mundane things. He acts impulsively and never measures the weight of his acts. What I dislike the most is that he find hopes in the end of the anime, though one may be happy for him, this character lacks maturity in decision making and acts like a spoil teenage guy.Eba Yuzuki, is the main protagonist, also characterized as a typical girl that has nothing extra ordinary but it still through her charm and beauty makes people attracted to her. However, personally, I dislike her because of her helplessness of making the right decision. Though being a joyous character, she acts like nothing matters and complicates everything. Both Yuzuki and Haruto make this anime frustrating to watch as they dull the atmosphere which from my point of view creates sadness  but yet they reject what other characters think of them. Finally those two do not fit each other because I could not find happiness in the end and again they fail to arouse the sympathy of the viewer. For me the characters(especially Haruto and Yuzuki) merit a 5 except for Asuka Mishima and Rin Eba who gladly meet my expectation and so are given a rating of 8.Hmmmm, by reading this, you might already note my level of enjoyment, Kimi no Iru Machi has only generated the negative sides of my thoughts. My heart ached while watching this anime and has spoiled my entire day. Maybe for that I’ll give it a 5 because it has been able to leave a scar in my memory. Nevertheless, nevertheless, in overall, I’ll give this anime a 4 out of hatred. to the past from time to time, yet it gives no time for the viewer to adapt to this gigantic melancholic scenario.

Most of the characters aren't particularly likable, if you even get to know anything about them really.The story revolves around a guy who loves a girl at school but does nothing for years, new girl comes along from Tokyo, he falls madly in love.   She leaves at the drop of a hat, so he runs off to Tokyo.   If someone isn't going o react to years to someone they love at school, they are not going to run off...this way for someone they just spent a few months with.The show gets trashier with see-through manipulation by the sister Rin, the ex conveniently showing up as his new best friends girlfriend as if to promote some form of conflict in the story, just for that to be written off soon after, and for her to disappear again for a year and a half.The minute she comes back into his life, he is telling lies to his girlfriend who barely seems that, as he has hardly anything good to say about her, and they are not doing anything sexual, much together, bar her eating his cooking and living next door..The story just seemed so predictable, and you could just see through the manipulation and movements, as if he just wanted to be caught, or he was stupid as we all know long term if someone keeps running off, they will not stick around.The lines, the actions just seemed horrible as if someone had meshed something together with little thought due to an anime being canceled and just had no real representation with the character, his actions, or how his family was not even bothered by him leaving.It just seemed like a trash show, for trash people.   Most of us have been indecisive, but the level of blankdom and excuses hit every tropey style anime that pulls the same sort of tricks, there felt nothing much original and reminded me of the MC in schooldays flitting between two girls.For a romance, it didn't feel like one, as was nothing to hold them together or reason why anyone would really want the other.. this way for someone they just spent a few months with.The show gets trashier with see-through manipulation by the sister Rin, the ex conveniently showing up as his new best friends girlfriend as if to promote some form of conflict in the story, just for that to be written off soon after, and for her to disappear again for a year and a half.The minute she comes back into his life, he is telling lies to his girlfriend who barely seems that, as he has hardly anything good to say about her, and they are not doing anything sexual, much together, bar her eating his cooking and living next door..The story just seemed so predictable, and you could just see through the manipulation and movements, as if he just wanted to be caught, or he was stupid as we all know long term if someone keeps running off, they will not stick around.The lines, the actions just seemed horrible as if someone had meshed something together with little thought due to an anime being canceled and just had no real representation with the character, his actions, or how his family was not even bothered by him leaving.It just seemed like a trash show, for trash people.

This is such a weird show because, on, the one hand, it is really, really, really, really, bad, but on the other, it is hard to stop watching.Well, at least that's what he said.It was hard for me to get invested in any of the characters, aside from maybe the main character's female friend (not the main girl). But honestly even then, I just didn't care. It's so easy to note care.If there's one thing I can say, it's that this show is easily better than most...shows like it. As utterly stupid as its premise is, the writing is FINE. That honestly saves this show from being completely annoying and offensive, and leads to a few actual emotional scenes.Still, would not recommend. There's probably better shows out there for the kind of people that'd be interested in this one. shows like it. As utterly stupid as its premise is, the writing is FINE.

Kazama and Asuka, in my perspective, were 3rd persons in between Haruto and Yuzuki. And here I'm not denying the fact that Kazama and Asuka loved Yuzuki and Haruto respectively. I've not read the manga, so my review is purely based on the anime.Story:This anime has one of the most wonderful love stories ever. It shows that love is stronger than any type of friendship. When a friend challenges ill friend for his former girlfriend, that's really unbelievable. Actually if it was me, I would let him have...her and accept that he has won her. The end of the storyline was wonderful, but I was hoping they would show Asuka in the end with someone who loved her dearly.Art:Nothing in particular but it was ok.Sound:Everything was beautiful and very apt to the characters.Characters:Lead characters-I think they were made for each other. I don't feel like Haruto and Asuka would've been a wonderful couple.About Supporting characters- None of them had his/her own storyline here. Some animes also show stories and loves of supporting characters, but here no one was given a particular past. But they did a great job as side characters.Overall:I am very happy that I've watched this anime and I don't hate it as some do.But I feel it's adaptation could have been much much much better. her and accept that he has won her.

The protagonist then becomes an adult pretty much and goes to Tokyo to chase after the girl of his dreams. But of course it's not that simple, the protagonist is lead through multiple emotional hurdles and it's up for him to decide, if giving up relationships is worth continuing his venture for his love.Story: 8The structure of the anime is quite unique and at first...I found it sort of annoying and almost didn't understand how they were going to fit everything in as there were constant flashbacks but the further you get into the anime, the more you can understand and respect the flashbacks as they actually add a reasonable amount of character development; slowly releasing some information to add contextual value to the current point you're at. I've seen this outside of anime but not too often in anime so it's nice to see some more structural techniques in that regard. In addition, the anime is split in half meaning halfway through the anime there'll be a huge leap in time, I think was two years (could be one) and the protagonist went in a different direction to then return back to his original direction through an interesting process and the moral at the end of story was quite nice. And that leads us to the ending, personally I was quite happy due to the sour but sweet ending leaving really no cliches and actually came to a conclusion. Meaning, no cliffhangers.Characters: 8In regards to the characters, I felt the protagonist Kirishima lacked good character development probably due to the squeeze upon the content in the first half of the anime but he has good qualities, which definitely brought interest at least and for some perhaps respect for what he was trying to achieve being hooking up with Eba. For example, his dedication is admirable and the troubles he went through to achieve his goals are relatable. Should I break this friendship to be with my love? Those sort of troubles/decisions. Character wise for Eba, the girl who the protagonist is trying to hook up could be seen as missing contextual value and etc but honestly I think this was done on purpose because we're slowly feed context about her at particular times and some may detest that but honestly I think it creates a bit of a hole, but a hole you wish to fill. Even at the end, we don't fully understand her and I think that's great because it shows the future isn't going to just be smooth sailing but a normal typical relationship that has its ups and downs. In addition, not fulling understanding her makes you want to know more and for the context they do give, it's more valuable. In that regard, you'll either love it or finding it irritating so you'll just have to find out yourself.Art & music: 6.5Music was quite nice and executed at appropriate times and additionally the art was nice but lack true colors, in other words it came off almost mildly washed out or bland, which was disappointing since the actual art is nice but it's just the colors. I'm not saying it's awful, most definitely tolerable but it could of been more colorful.Conclusion:Definitely would recommend to people a fan of romance, I'd considered it a must but definitely isn't a masterpiece. But honestly, the rushed areas at the beginning weren't nice; in fact the anime should of added more episodes because this problem occurs all the time where developers shove too much content into episodes. But the characters are memorable for their goals and it's definitely a chill anime to watch so check it out at least.

Well, I do not know if  anybody will read this, but this anime will only be good for a select few because of the realism in it (not in the way that it turned out), somebody has to suffer, and almost always, it is the person least deserving of it. I know this because I am doing this right now. In my last year at elementary school I met a girl which just shook my...world, left we gasping for air, was the only thing I was looking forward in the day, just to look at her. It was the first time, and maybe last, what I experienced to be in love. Even so, I was the most shy guy, so I did not get to talk to her much, but since I was so God dang obvious, people caught up, and so did she. Turns out we both liked each other, but nothing happened due to our mutual shyness. Here's the thing, we went to the same middle school, and when I finally got the courage to, on that summer after the 8th grade, confess, she actually said she liked me back, only to see her in a relationship with some other guy on the start of 9th grade, and that fucked me up bigtime. Thing is, things did not last long with the guy, and by mid second semester, she was single, and we started talking (Yeah, I know, why the fuck should I talk to her after that, but my feelings just wouldnt go away). I actually confessed one more time, which was the last time. She reciprocated my feelings, however, she moved to a distant country on the end of that summer (Great, I know). This is where things differ from what this anime is and my own life, but it is still a great lesson for you, and will help you aprreciate the anime. Time passed, I never felt the same about anybody again. It wasnt until my junior year of highschool in which I felt alone, and i felt like i should not be suffering like this. Because of this, I dated a girl which I liked, but wasn't exactly in love with, and that's why, after a year, it did not work out, me getting bored and probably destroying the girl's feelings. Then senior year went by and I decided to just hang with by friends and all that, and it went by.We each went our separate ways, with only 2 of my close friends joining me at the state university which I chose. On my first year of college I met this girl, which I like alot and am currently still with her, after a year, two months and twenty days (yup, im in second year on college RN). Issue is, that girl from the 8th grade, remember her? Well she came back, and although she is not on the same state university as me, she is in the one of my hometown. CAN YOU FUCKING BELIEVE IT! Even today, although I know she toyed with me, although not on purpose, and did many more things to me, I still feel feelings toward her, even though I'm very happy on my current relationship. However, if she were to pop up in front of me one day, I seriously don't know what I would do. Yes, even though I have not seen her in years, have not talked to her, I still feel a strong affection... I guess that might be the difference between your first/true love, which I think is what this anime is about, how that feeling is never fully over, as I, after 8 years, still feel it. Life is rough, relationships are hard, somebody has to suffer, and sometimes, it is the person me want to suffer the least, but either we just go with the flow, or we step up, do what we have to do, and accept the consequences head on.Sorry, I guess its not much of a review but a vent huh... But, for some reason, I think this story will be truly useful to you guys wondering if this anime is worth watching. For me? It sure as hell wasPS.

In my opinion, it was totally lame to move your whole life if your main objective is just to find out the reason why the girl you fell in love with left you. I mean you can just visit or stay a few weeks if that is all you mean to do. And then if you discover that you were replaced by your girl because of...a charitable act of your girl to be the GF of a sick/dying guy, isn\'t that a clear sign that she does not respect, let alone love, you to do that twisted hurt to you ? Come on!Despite the male MC\'s foolishness, blindness, etc. though, he was able to create a healthy relationship with a cute, devoted, loving girl. Happy ending it wasn\'t because somehow he still had a flame for his old flame. And he kept it a secret from his new GF that he was seeing his old GF. He was cheating! I drew the line there. His new GF did not deserve to be deceived nor cheated on. No matter if Eba and Haruto are destined to be with each other, what was being done to Asuka was totally unacceptable to me. Also, even if the male MC was such a ""catch"" (definitely was not), I really hated his lack of scruples or morality or whatever you want to call that, in his treatment of Asuka.

The love/drama story which has captivated many readers all over japan finally earned a animation. Originally starting with 2 OVA's. The series takes place in the Author Seo's hometown and is a character-driven romance set in the same universe as the Suzuka manga . It follows Haruto Kirishima, a self-conscious teenager, and Yuzuki Eba, an extroverted teenage girl who moves from Tokyo into the Kirishima family's home in Hiroshima Prefecture.-Story &amp; Overall-To be honest this adaption is not living up to standards set by the manga. The manga itself has been running...for four years strong so as a reader I did have high expectations for Gonzo and TV TOKYO. They have a great story in there hands which in my opinion is on par with the better romance/drama anime out there. With that said it doesn't mean I downright hate the adaption. It's just hard to comprehend how a great story can be slimmed down to likes of a 12 episode run. With the format they have with running flashbacks and then reverting to present will take a toll on the readers and those who have not read the manga, If the adaption was a 24 episode series and maybe a different animation studio this could have been a masterpiece.-Art-Art may seem like a little aspect but in reality its those awe moments that art really has an important factor. In the anime the art might come as a surprise. Its unique in its own aspect. The use of rich vibrant colors really brings out the character designs and features. It also beautifully enhances the environment and gives those awe moments there impact. On the downside the animation can be choppy at times almost seeming slowed down. Excluding the animation the overall look of the scenery and character really brings out the story and was pleasure to be seen by me as a reader.-Sound-Music wise it was on point with how the moments were and the feelings in the air. With the great music provided, the moments where music and scenery collided, the collaboration was effective and was a pleasant surprise.-Characters-Haruto Kirishima-For those who haven't read the manga the Main Character is with the highest tiers. The sad fact is the adaption couldn't portray him as good as he was in the manga due to the limited time constraint. He is a good Main Character who won't cause you to yell at the screen ask WTF?. Everything has reason and his are acceptable.Yuzki Eba-The heroine of the story, the damsel in distress. She a beautiful young women who has history with are MC. Its either you like her or you don't. For me my reasons are based on the manga.-Enjoyment-The enjoyment is there and its fairly good. The reason I can enjoy this story so much is that I can relate to the Main Character and the situation at hand. The story isn't something conjured up and not bound to happen. If anything it's happen to a fair amount of us. It provides a good story on a battlefield called love.+ Good Story Line+ Good Protagonist+ Awesome Girls+ (NO) Excessive Fan Service- 12 episodes- Choppy Animation- Complicated for (NON) Manga Readers-It's either you love it or you hate it.

In all other aspects however, the anime seems to be a jumble of inconsistencies and gives too many reasons for viewers to become frustrated as the episodes go by. A small-town guy meets a city girl where their back and forth indecisiveness of their feelings creates an interesting and momentous story with an unsatisfying resolution.Story- 7You could almost write a few different reviews for the vast amount of switching between plot and setting throughout the story. Although flashbacks to the past were necessary...for the connections/relationships between the characters to feel real, too often these threw me off the progression of the story. This series excels at wriggling into the mold of drama with tragedy that grips you. Conflict, breaking of trust and love triangles are all there, but the potential ends with no ambition to create a unique narrative. It hits the spots effectively, but to summarize its generic. Although to me it didn\'t end pleasingly, the story feels complete and is the strongest aspect to Kimi no Iru Machi.Art- 5The style is certainly unique, both the characters and setting. From a 2013 anime however you would expect a more refined animation, which is especially the case for the opening and the expressions which just feel lazy. The lighting sometimes seems overly bright and too contrasting.Sound- 6The op and ending theme are nothing out of the ordinary, the latter being quite memorable. The dialogue isn\'t cheesy and quite realistic for the context, which is a strong point that evades the risk of being over the top for a drama.Characters- 5Here is where many viewers get a bad aftertaste. The main ""protagonist"" - Haruto Kirishima - is introduced as a reasonably confident and isn\'t overly soft like many cliche dramas. A little further into the series we find out he is actually just stone cold. His obsession with his summer crush, Yuziki Eba seems to eliminate any empathy for the few likable characters who already suffer from other hardships. The only likable character for me - Asuka Mishima - gets the worst treatment out of them all. Regardless being a loyal and affectionate girlfriend, this was clearly not enough for Haruto to stop him from crapping on her trust. Yes its a drama and conflicts are crucial the development of characters, but the further we get into the episodes the less likable and just downright a*hole the pledged couple becomes. Most of these characters were quite bland and actually took some effort to remember between the overly frequent flashbacks.Enjoyment- 6My enjoyment was somewhat limited by the dynamics of the main roles, but each episode did leave me wanting to watch more. The writers didn\'t shy away from affectionate moments and emotional connections and still Haruto\'s obsession over Eba ruined too many opportunities to satisfy a romance that you don\'t resent. The story and different settings were nice and immersive, but left me without sympathy and certainly not a satisfying watch.Overall- 6On the surface Kimi no Iru Machi is emotional and gripping, though the sparks weren\'t sufficient to ignite the lack of gratifying characters. The show started with enough potential to create a successful series that may seem rushed, but as an okay drama it did not leave me with lasting appreciation. for the connections/relationships between the characters to feel real, too often these threw me off the progression of the story.

""Kimi no Iru Machi"" is filled with inordinate amount of frustration and is at times difficult to watch, revealing both the harshness of life and the uncompromising nature of desire, selfishness, and the consequences of indecision.What is also strange about this series is the fact that it adapts only about 80 of the 270 chapters from the original manga series, and it begins only around Chapter 80 (and ends around Chapter 150),...omitting in the process the entire Hiroshima arc, which is, in many ways, the most enjoyable part of the series. As the characters grow up, their horizons darken, and the anime captures some of this too. Reading the manga series itself is a quasi-masochistic experience that often ends in frustration and fury. The anime stays somewhat true to this ""furious"" tonality, and will please the most those who like substantive drama, emotional turmoil, and lots of missed connections. If you like series like ""citrus"" or ""Domestic Girlfriend"", ""Kimi no Iru Machi"" will fit the bill!I don\'t want to reveal any major details about the two main characters, Haruto Kirishima and Yuzuki Eba, but, by beginning nearly in the middle of their story, the anime naturally misses a lot of details about their prehistory (which the manga lays out). This results in a somewhat different representation of the two characters, especially of Haruto, and makes certain choices later in the anime strange and difficult to justify.The animation quality itself is rather poor, low-budget, and nondescript. I am writing this review in 2022, but I saw the original series back in 2015, and rewatched it recently, after reading the manga. For an anime made after 2012, ""Kimi no Iru Machi"" looks as if it were made around 2005-2006, as it resembles more the animation style of series like ""Clannad"" than what was already a turning point in the style and quality of animations (after 2012).In a nutshell - this is a hard-hitting and biting love drama, at times ugly, uncompromising, and even brutal. It specializes in missed connections, in deliberate interference, in frustrating mishaps, in romantic triangles, in hurting others, and in tragic circumstances that do not happen to the main characters but affect them significantly. It is also a boiling pot of angst and emotions running often above a respectable point. I have mixed feelings both about the anime and the manga. On a more positive note, the anime seems to be trying to present life and romance as forces that often don\'t help each other, and that may, in time, become mutually destructive, but in doing so, these forces also teach us something and do show a possible path to overcome both. Will the main characters take this path?

It talks about drama in anywhere I\'ve watched this series. Although I was kinda shocked a little bit that some in the episodes they jump into the future, a future where some of the characters has grown up. Somehow somewhat the name of this anime although it\'s just simple as that but still, it gives an impact towards the series itself. Kimi no Iru Machi : A Town Where You Live, where the main character chasing her love in Tokyo because he loves her too much. It\'s weird how the main character at first didn\'t care or found...the main heroine attractive. I was like, ""What happened with his old crush before?"". I honestly love this anime because I feel like I got hooked because of the drama. I feel like I have to know what happens next. I sometimes wish that I could love someone like this series would. A love that is just beautiful in a lot of ways. Unlike my reality, a crush is just a crush in which leads to a hopeless one at fact. This series is just beautiful and just heart-wrecking when it comes to romance with drama. But still, Kimi no Iru Machi, I wish this has a second season after quite awhile.

But strangely, at the same time, this anime overlook one other important facts, whichis why it's time Yuzuki had to suddenly return to Tokyo.

I understand that this story was meant to not be an enjoyable one. It was meant to look at the complex nature of relationships, the selfishness of a person, the fragility of our desires and how it can easily hurt those closest to us. But it packs punches just like a toddler can beat an empty boxing bag. The characters are under developed, the pacing was slow. It was hard to understand the reasoning behind not why but HOW they came...to their decisions so quickly and with no remorse. So really by the finale I was looking at empty characters despite knowing they share history that justified their selfish feelings and that is a shame. Sad romances exists, where a girl or guy is left behind. But the choosing man or woman psyche should have been explored. Yukuki\'s complicated homelife being the stepdaughter to her dad\'s new family should have been explored. Haruto\'s adjustment to city life and accepting Yuzuki left him the first time should have been explored. It had such promise if they delved deeper than just ""Haruto is deeply in love with Yuzuki and he will do everything to make it happen"". Anyway... this story had real, harsh great points but it was drowned by it\'s weak development and linear characters. to their decisions so quickly and with no remorse.

Humans cheat, they lie, they break up, get together and love, get with someone while wanting someone else. It’s the nature of human beings. So, I do not dislike the show because of how it shows that nature of humans, I dislike it because it doesn’t get too deep on WHY the characters are doing those behaviors. In the show they usually say “oh because of love” okay? Cool? Yes people make...stupid decisions because of love, but I wanted the show to really delve into the characters insecurities/toxic behaviors - which they did not. So a lot of the decisions being made seemed shallow - but also understandable because sometimes human actions are not able to be understood.So, that is why I’m stuck between giving this show a 7 or an 8. I decided to chose a 7 just because of how predictable the ending was and how shallow the characters were.SPOILERS AHEAD:ART: The art style of this show was really nice, I actually liked it and I liked the opening as well. The music was fine too.PLOT: The plot was pretty self explanatory. Boy and girl fall in love in high school in a rural area, girl leaves to go back to the city (Tokyo), boy moves to the city to see why she left/broke up with him. Drama begins.Characters:Okay, so this is where my real review comes in. The main character is a male - Haruto. Haruto is the most shallow and dense guy ever!! At the beginning of the show I felt sorry for him because of how shitty the lead girl was, but as the show continues I realized what a piece of shit he was. I honestly cannot even be mad because there are guys in real life that act just like Haruto, so how can I say this is unrealistic?When Haruto moves to Tokyo to track down his love Eba Yuzuki, he finds out the reason she broke up with him is because she made a promise to date a guy (Kazama, I will bring him up later because he is one of the only characters I actually liked) who is literally about to DIE. Eba begs Haruto not to say anything to Kazama because she wants him to die happy, but what does Haruto do? He ends up telling his best friend (don’t know how you can be best friends with someone in a month, but Kazama had such a good personality they just clicked) that Eba is the girl he is in love with and the real reason he moved to Tokyo.So not only is he telling his friend he loves the girl he loves, he doesn’t care he’s dying. He thinks it would be unfair to not say anything and makes it a “bet” to see who can win her. I don’t know man, after this happened I was like wow, Haruto is a selfish POS. Anyway, Haruto continues to try to win her, but after Kazama dies, he literally just stops? A year passes and he ends up dating Asuka (another great character I actually liked who I will touch on later). Haruto basically takes her for granted any chance he can, and lowkey tries to get back with Eba any chance he can (Rin Eba - Yuzuki’s sister, was the cause of some of this).I just hated how Haruto never took accountability for ANYTHING, while he literally CHEATS on his amazing girlfriend and blames Rin. He literally goes back to his childhood home KNOWING his ex that he was in love with will be there at the same time. Why TF wouldn’t you go be with Asuka and her family ? You’re girlfriend?? Haruto wanted Eba the entire time and I’m glad those two people got with each other, because honestly trash people deserve to be with trash people and I’m glad Asuka dodged a bullet.Eba Yuzuki - I’m not gonna write too much about her, I just stopped liking her after episode 4 I think? She was so manipulative but put on this innocent girl act. It made me gag. In the show when they had flashback scenes, Haruto had a crush on a girl in the town and Eba, who literally KNEW this - kissed him when said girl was right outside the door on the phone. She did the same shit, when Haruto got with Asuka - she showed up to his fucking job, flirted with him and acted all innocent. Sis, you knew what you were doing. Instead of being an adult and communicating her feelings she waits until Haruto is in a full relationship knowing damn well he loved her/still did. She was sick and twisted, don’t get me started on how she only dated a guy because he was about to DIE. And then when her ex showed up she didn’t even have the decency to tell the guy herself, her ex ended up doing it as a way to “challenge” him. I started out liking her because she seemed sweet when she visited the countryside where Haruto first lived, but as the show went on my rating for her dropped. All she did was cry, and try to manipulate the men in her life. Her and Haruto deserve to be together tbh.Asuka - she was sort of cringy when the show started, but as I kept watching I grew fond of her character. She cared deeply about her friends, especially Kazama, and she cared about Haruto too. I wish she got more screen time outside of her relationship with Haruto because I actually liked her. When they were dating she was such a chill, and trusting girlfriend. She also played sports and was sort of a tom boy, it was a typical storyline of the MC dating a Tom boy until he realizes his real love again for the “feminine, doe-eyed, heroine”. Asuka deserved better.Kazama - he didn’t have a ton of screen time either and the fact that he died was all too easy for Haruto to get Eba. I wish he didn’t die and they actually made it a little harder for Haruto, but whatever. Kazama was one of the best characters because his personality was easy to connect with. He seemed like the type of person you would WANT to be friends with. Every-time he was on screen he made me smile. They did him dirty by offing him.There are a few other characters but I honestly don’t think they are worth mentioning. Haruto has a sister who is always naked or drinking. Rin Eba was supposed to be an antagonist but she lowkey was just annoying and messy, and not in a good way. She also would flirt with Haruto and at times I think he was falling into it, which was weird as she was his loves sister. Haruto had two friends from the countryside who were decent but they didn’t have enough screen time for me to write anything about them. They were just there.Overall, if the characters were more interesting and they dug deep into their insecurities/why they do what they do (kind of like how Scum’s Wish did) I would have given this an 8 or 9. I give it a 7 because even though the plot made me roll my eyes at times, I couldn’t stop watching it. I knew what was going to happen and I still wanted to watch lol. So I guess that’s why I didn’t rate this any lower. It’s a decent watch if you like romance and drama, but there ARE better shows too. stupid decisions because of love, but I wanted the show to really delve into the characters insecurities/toxic behaviors - which they did not. So a lot of the decisions being made seemed shallow - but also understandable because sometimes human actions are not able to be understood.So, that is why I’m stuck between giving this show a 7 or an 8.

Anyway, Haruto continues to try to win her, but after Kazama dies, he literally just stops? A year passes and he ends up dating Asuka (another great character I actually liked who I will touch on later). Haruto basically takes her for granted any chance he can, and lowkey tries to get back with Eba any chance he can (Rin Eba - Yuzuki’s sister, was the cause of some of this).I just hated how Haruto never took accountability for ANYTHING, while he literally CHEATS on his amazing girlfriend and blames Rin. He literally goes back to his childhood home KNOWING his ex that he was in love with will be there at the same time. Why TF wouldn’t you go be with Asuka and her family ? You’re girlfriend?? Haruto wanted Eba the entire time and I’m glad those two people got with each other, because honestly trash people deserve to be with trash people and I’m glad Asuka dodged a bullet.Eba Yuzuki - I’m not gonna write too much about her, I just stopped liking her after episode 4 I think? She was so manipulative but put on this innocent girl act. It made me gag. In the show when they had flashback scenes, Haruto had a crush on a girl in the town and Eba, who literally KNEW this - kissed him when said girl was right outside the door on the phone. She did the same shit, when Haruto got with Asuka - she showed up to his fucking job, flirted with him and acted all innocent. Sis, you knew what you were doing. Instead of being an adult and communicating her feelings she waits until Haruto is in a full relationship knowing damn well he loved her/still did. She was sick and twisted, don’t get me started on how she only dated a guy because he was about to DIE. And then when her ex showed up she didn’t even have the decency to tell the guy herself, her ex ended up doing it as a way to “challenge” him. I started out liking her because she seemed sweet when she visited the countryside where Haruto first lived, but as the show went on my rating for her dropped. All she did was cry, and try to manipulate the men in her life. Her and Haruto deserve to be together tbh.Asuka - she was sort of cringy when the show started, but as I kept watching I grew fond of her character. She cared deeply about her friends, especially Kazama, and she cared about Haruto too. I wish she got more screen time outside of her relationship with Haruto because I actually liked her. When they were dating she was such a chill, and trusting girlfriend. She also played sports and was sort of a tom boy, it was a typical storyline of the MC dating a Tom boy until he realizes his real love again for the “feminine, doe-eyed, heroine”. Asuka deserved better.Kazama - he didn’t have a ton of screen time either and the fact that he died was all too easy for Haruto to get Eba. I wish he didn’t die and they actually made it a little harder for Haruto, but whatever. Kazama was one of the best characters because his personality was easy to connect with. He seemed like the type of person you would WANT to be friends with. Every-time he was on screen he made me smile. They did him dirty by offing him.There are a few other characters but I honestly don’t think they are worth mentioning. Haruto has a sister who is always naked or drinking. Rin Eba was supposed to be an antagonist but she lowkey was just annoying and messy, and not in a good way. She also would flirt with Haruto and at times I think he was falling into it, which was weird as she was his loves sister. Haruto had two friends from the countryside who were decent but they didn’t have enough screen time for me to write anything about them. They were just there.Overall, if the characters were more interesting and they dug deep into their insecurities/why they do what they do (kind of like how Scum’s Wish did) I would have given this an 8 or 9. I give it a 7 because even though the plot made me roll my eyes at times, I couldn’t stop watching it. I knew what was going to happen and I still wanted to watch lol. So I guess that’s why I didn’t rate this any lower. It’s a decent watch if you like romance and drama, but there ARE better shows too.', ""A love story that takes on not only the uplifting side of love, but the ugly sides as well.  Leaving out what a lot of other series only let brush across the surface, this one does not shy away.You still end up with a romance story.  One that's filled with childhood roots, unrequited love, and returning memories.  Tied into that however, you get to see different kinds of love in it's stages.  While most stories will let unrequited love just sit as tension in the plot, you get the chance to cycle through it here.  There are still some displays...of it, but it takes the step and goes beyond that as well.Story; 9/10The fact they're willing to show the sides of love that most people are not really brings some realistic feel to how it all plays out.  You get to see unrequited love, blossoming love, breakups, and what it's like to just not be with the right person.  It really challenges how you should reflect on situations that you are in.  If the story jumping around a lot early wasn't a little of a mess in terms of pace, I would have given it a 10/10.  Also, they took an easy out in the series that would have given me a better buy in.Art; 7/10The art is pretty standard.  Nothing really stands out, but nothing holds it back either.  For me, if the art is bad, I really struggle to complete any series.Sound; 6/10Nothing really stands our here but that's in a good or bad way.  The story continues along with any real impact from the soundtrack.Characters; 9/10Again, you get to see some dark sides of the characters.  Their struggles, what they are feeling, and what they are hiding from themselves.  Even though the plot hands an easy out for progression, it leaves plenty behind to work with.  The characters feel pain, and while the supporting cast lacks depth, to me it's not about the quantity.  The fact you get to experience so much more from them because they have to go through these situations, for me, gives me a lot more.Enjoyment; 8/10Besides the jumpy early episodes and the easy out they provide for themselves, I was able to really enjoy the series.  It's a show that I picked up thinking I would just brush through and pick up throughout the week but ended up watching through to the end.  After spending time recently pushing through a lot of Anime, I was waiting for one to introduce something off pace.  To me, with the both beautiful and ugly sides of love put on display here, it kept me engaged all the way to the final episode.Overall; 8/10This would have been higher if the early story plot was cleaner.  It felt like it's something that could have expanded past 12 episodes but not quite enough for say 24.  If you love the romance genre but are looking for something closer to reality this may be for you.  I've been talking about it already, but being able to see all the facets of how relationships can play out is refreshing.  Especially in a genre where most of those are left, at best, to unrequited love. of it, but it takes the step and goes beyond that as well.Story; 9/10The fact they're willing to show the sides of love that most people are not really brings some realistic feel to how it all plays out.

Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the ""genre stereotypes"" and then judging the anime around that? Just want to know if you should watch it? I\'ve got you covered.So this was just a standard romance anime for me. It wasn\'t bad. It wasn\'t amazing. It was just good. Solid example of the genre. Animation looked unique, but wasn\'t particularly amazing for me personally.Story is standard love interest with feelings realized too late, a plot twist mid story that pits friends against each other, and some more twists near the end...that lead full circle.However, the beginning of the show is a little weird. The timeline is all over the place, since they kinda throw you in halfway through right out of the gate and use flashbacks to fill in the story over the course of the first few episodes. This initially turned me off and I put off watching this for a while. I eventually came back to it and once you watch the first couple episodes everything starts coming together story-wise once you have some of the flashbacks under your belt. Additional flashbacks happen throughout the short season. I like the time skips ahead, which serve to advance the plot and create additional drama due to the short nature of the show.If you\'ve exhausted better options already, this is a good show that won\'t leave you feeling disappointed. Plot points are tied up and the ending is mostly happy. Just don\'t expect the moon and you\'ll enjoy it.HIGHLIGHTS: Short and to the point, plot twistsssss, time skips forward, Solid young romance anime entryDISAPPOINTMENTS: Time skips backwards, a little too short and to the point, plot twistssssss, nothing really stands out. that lead full circle.However, the beginning of the show is a little weird.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Also I should notice, this is a bit of odd/unique case. Precisely this is probably the first Anime where I read Manga first before watching Anime. Reasoning for that would be that Anime skipped first 60 chapters or so of Manga. Thus I decided to pick up the Manga before watching Anime. Manga I absolutely loved, and Anime version of this work I pretty much watched right after manga [few days inbetween).Wanted to add +1 score modifier because of this, but scratch that Idea. Even if...I love romance genre, I don\'t want bump up score for such reason.✦StoryWell, to not write exactly same thing as I did for Manga, I shalt keep the common element short. TLDR; Beautiful and dramatic pure love/vanilla romance with the shade of moronic drama.Well, it would be just romance without stupidity factor that I call drama. (that what makes drama, drama)So anyhow, I should probably mention the Issues I had with this Anime (might be also somewhat affect from reading beforehand). Main Issue I had with it, was the world was less richer, lot of characters didn\'t get the affection they deserver in its Animated glory. Also the first 60-80 Manga chapters were skipped in Anime, but presented somewhat in flashbacks form.  Basically, to rate by Anime itself as standalone, it was okay for most part. But with only 13 episodes,  it just didn\'t build itself up as good. Felt as many important factors were not present, emotions deliverance was a tad weak, rushed story. But in the end it was enjoyable and for most part pretty vanilla romance/pure love/successful true love and so on. Finale was acceptable I guess, though kinda was closed with a ""scar"".✦ArtFirst all let me get this off the chest. It\'s different from Manga that\'s for sure, and not in enjoyable direction.Anyhow, the Art/animation of this Anime felt quite a low budget. Characters and shading felt oddly weird and not as beautiful I remembered it from OVA (quite different feel from Manga as well, if matters). Animation felt at times very cheap or simply not packing enough punch. With budget choices artistic scenes were for the most part actually quite a nice touch. Should add that the camera angle switches, characters constantly moving, was obnoxious at times. Don\'t try shaft, you didn\'t succeed.Fanservice, ""meh"". (if matters, then very toned down and plain in comparison to Manga, where I absolutely loved it, but as have to mention again. They are quite a different things)✦SoundVoice acting on some characters felt somewhat bad. Also hated how actual children were voice acting in some flashback sequences. That just sounds horrible no matter where.Opening song was okay, but ending I absolutely loved. ""Kimi No Iru Machi"" songs, not the Kazama one.Soundtrack itself I have mixed feelings about. It definitely had presence, but it also had very odd style. In odd in a way I wasn\'t fond of.✦CharacterKind yet indecisive main guy, wanted to hurt noone, kept also at some things his distance and so on. Main girl cheerful, but not honest with herself.Lot of cute side-characters. Some tomboys as well, and some that sadly didn\'t get barely any screentime.Kanzaki and Kiyomi were my favorite.✦Enjoyment/overallFirst it disappointed me, gave it 6, then I could get into usual mindset that Manga/Anime are 2 different things. Watch/read them as different pieces of work. Then I could enjoy it a bit more, halfway I could give it 7.Yes, I did have quite some parts that disappointed me, but the core of pure love and their struggle in a moronic drama, remained. Thus I in the end, enjoyed it. But I simply couldn\'t enjoy it as much as I did manga. Many important factors were missing.

Many important factors were missing.', 'Okay so the first few lines will be a quick and short assessment of the anime for those who want to watch this abomination:The anime is decent, and the plot is good with some unexpected twists...However, by the time you end the anime you will probably hate the MC very much and his love Eba Yuzuki even more....P.S. The ending is actually bad imo....Okay so now for a detail review: (Possible Spoiler Alert from here on)-Story Analysis: The overall plot is done well since in some of the parts you will expect the expected but something completely unexpected will happen.... for example it never...took me long to predict that Kyousuke\'s gf would be Eba... that was so easy to predict, however, Kyousuke\'s death was something I did not expect.The overall plot building is nice, but the MC makes a ton of weird decisions which dont seem natural at all. Yes love is confusing and getting over your Ex-gf is hard and can be a cumbersome feeling.... However, Haruto will piss you off and many places you would be left thinking what ""d**k"" of a person.... like how the hell does a guy like him have girls falling for him.... seriously turns annoying by the time you reach the last 3-4 episodes in this series.....Sound: Well nothing to talk about here its okay but nothing amazingCharacters: Done well in my honest opinion, however, at some places it will remind you that you are watching an anime from Perhaps the 80\'s even though this anime has been released in 2013 lol.Enjoyment: None tbh... since the way Haruto ends his relationship on a whim with Asuka without even giving jack s**t ...... Like after all his screwups.... the thing that pissed me off the most is the way he breaks-up with Asuka... I swear if I was in that world I would shoot Haruto and marry Asuka.... \\(-_-)/Overall: An anime with great potential and a possibly a great plot which will only make you want to watch the next episode just so you can believe that everything will be alright in the next episode, until you realize you are out of episodes to watch and things instead of getting better will only get worse....Not a recommended anime..... however, if you have nothing to watch and are in for some drama you can surely waste time watching this.... took me long to predict that Kyousuke\'s gf would be Eba... that was so easy to predict, however, Kyousuke\'s death was something I did not expect.The overall plot building is nice, but the MC makes a ton of weird decisions which dont seem natural at all.

I will only be making a short review of what this anime is like , if it could have been better or if it deserves a second season and etc. I would just like to say that this review is based on my own opinion.Story:I gave a 7 to the story because the pace was too fast, the relationships , the background story for all the characters , their history and etc. But I can...say that this anime could have been better if they did not rush things so quickly , rather if they showed the characters development between each other.Does it deserve a second season? Umm.. I dont think so based on what I have watched every problem was solved in its own way, but what disappointed me the most was the anime\'s outcome if the story was what I expected it to be then it MIGHT have a second season but it didnt\' so thats that.Art and Sound:The art and sound is ok in its own way nothing commendable.Character:Ahh.. The Characters well just as I said the you won\'t have that much ""bond"" with the character because as I said the development was rushed just like the story it could have been better.Enjoyment:Honestly I did enjoy the anime despite its flaws in story and character development but still I recommend it to people who like romance and drama anime but still if they took the time to make it better this anime could have been awesome.from what I have learned people say that the manga is better in terms of its development and overall enjoyment but sadly I haven\'t read it as well so It might be worth a try. :) say that this anime could have been better if they did not rush things so quickly , rather if they showed the characters development between each other.Does it deserve a second season?

Unless you hate to read mangas, I would really reccomend that you choose it over the anime.The story here is all mixed up. It starts aroun chapter 80 of the manga and goes back to the part they skipped with flashbacks. That it makes it confusing and loses a lot of the characters' developement. The way it's presented can make you even hate Yuzuki for just playing with Haruto's feelings. The manga at least tries to make you understand...that she has reasons to do it and her intentions are always good.The relationship with Kazama was also really poorly adapted, and even with his childhood friends, but I can understand the last because they don't really do much in this part of the story.The art and sound are nothing special, though I liked the first ending song. that she has reasons to do it and her intentions are always good.The relationship with Kazama was also really poorly adapted, and even with his childhood friends, but I can understand the last because they don't really do much in this part of the story.The art and sound are nothing special, though I liked the first ending song."", 'Keep in mind that i am french and my english can be pretty bad, sorry for that.Well, i haven\'t read the manga at all, so my review is based on the anime without apprehension because of the original story.

The anime itself was good without reading the manga. However, now that I've finished reading the manga. This adaptation is a total disappointment.Story: The story was good. I like how this series felt realistic. It's unique because unlike other romance animes, this tends to be a serious one. Haruto, the male main character, kept on pursuing the one his loved one. This focused on their romantic relationship.Art: The adaptation stuck to the art style of the manga which is a bit weird. The body parts (mainly women) are not proportional in both the adaptation and manga. Anyways, I have nothing against that. It's...still good: it doesn't affect the anime.Sound: The voice actors and actresses really sound good. Aside from that, the background soundtracks used were fitting to every scene. Calm and comfortable.Character: My main point is that the character development in this adaptation was terrible. Ending the anime series left me with whats, hows and whys.Enjoyment: If you like a drama romance anime, I think you would enjoy this.If you haven't read the manga yet, I suggest you read it.

What I specifically want to talk about this anime is the love triangle in it which is way too difficult to understand.The plot is about Haruto who confessed his feeling to Yuzuki but got rejected because she had to move to Tokyo without telling him. For Haruto, she just suddenly disappeared from his life leaving him with a lot of questions to himself. A couple of years later, Haruto had to live with his sister and therefore moved to Tokyo so his main motive was...of course hopefully getting the chance with Yuzuki once again. Throughout the anime, Haruto ended up getting feelings for Asuka and confessed them to her and they ended up happily together. A couple of years later again, Yuzuki ended up stealing him from Asuka arrogantly, leaving Asuka in despair which does not make any sense in my opinion at all when she did not want to be with him from the start.Why would Yuzuki go that far, showing she is so mighty, until it is getting disgusting to watch?Plot 6The story got ruined by being too difficult to understand what the characters' motives.Art 8The art overall was pretty good as in the designs of the characters are pretty good especially the hair colours but some parts in the anime were ruining it.The design of the character is pretty good and the hair colors were pretty cool.Soundtrack 7a lot of sounds added in the pretty well done.Characterisation 8Enjoyment 2The relationship and the choices the characters makes are terrible.Overall 6RIP Asuka. ❤️ of course hopefully getting the chance with Yuzuki once again.

Maybe I’ve seen way too many romance anime in my lifetime. I don’t feel like there is anything wrong with it, but I just sort of feel moth about it. From Haruto’s perspective, I get it. New, charming, energetic girl comes into your life; you feel all of these new feelings and experience all of these new experiences, and then she suddenly walks out of you life without any warning leaving you unresolved and upset about how things turned out. I get that. But for me, Yuzuki just could not pull on my heartstrings...or do anything for me. I just couldn’t get it.I could relate to Asuka very well and I really liked her character. I really feel like I “got” her. Haruto even said it himself, se’s the perfect girlfriend; and for every reason he listed about her, was the reason I thought the same. Now, while I think about all these things about both Yuzuki and Asuka - Haruto included, it’s not enough. There is just not really enough there in the writing, I feel like, for me to really connect with these characters. I really tried to pay attention to what was unsaid in their nonverbal interaction because I felt like maybe if I did that, I would understand more, and that wasn’t the case. So, I like the direction of where the plot was going, but I just can’t latch onto it. There isn’t enough, and so trying to put my thoughts and feelings into this review is a little hard for me because the anime use left me scatter-brained about everything.Overall, it’s good, but the writing and character development is lacking. or do anything for me.

After reading and falling in love with the manga - I was hoping for possibly the ""next great romcom/drama"" which could have been developed if a top studio handled the process. There was a prequel OVA ""Tasogare Kousaten"" that showed great promise and was fairly cohesive. But the studio handled this story in such a confusing and unsatisfying manner - even a diehard fan felt despair after watching the end product. My breakdowns:Story -...6The source material (especially the earlier chapters) could have produced a stunning anime, however - the adaptation picked the worst possible arc to focus on, and we\'re left with little of the warmth of the slice-of-life, and we\'re placed into a position of despair right off the bat. If I wasn\'t a fan - I\'d lower this to a 3 perhaps.Art - 4GONZO was going for some type of edgy art and the result is mostly just strange compared to both manga and prequel.Sound - 8Some good VA work and a great OP by MimimemeMIMI.Characters - 5The characters are just about completely underdeveloped, even considering that a 260+ chapter manga is being developed into a 12 episode series - there were important characters that are glossed over - so we don\'t get a chance to understand why these characters are in the story and we\'re left scratching our heads. MC gets a decent backstory to explain why he\'s acting the way he does, but again - there is key info missing that we should have to connect the two arcs.Enjoyment - 6Again, as a fan of the story - of course I was glad this received an anime adaptation, but instead of feeling satisfied, I just couldn\'t help to thing I missed out on something that could have been a ""wonderful"" story.Overall - 7Could, shoulda, woulda. This series could easily get a remake that could generate a MAL score of 8+, as the manga (which I rate highly) could have given us a warm, funny SOL/RomCom that would have left warm smiles on our faces. Instead we get tossed into ""the pit"" right away. I only hope Seo\'s next adaptation ""Megami no Café Terrace"" gets the best possible result! I give this a 7 only as a fan of the mangaka, and there\'s a reason why the overall scores break down to 6.5. 6The source material (especially the earlier chapters) could have produced a stunning anime, however - the adaptation picked the worst possible arc to focus on, and we\'re left with little of the warmth of the slice-of-life, and we\'re placed into a position of despair right off the bat.

Altough i did somewhat like this and could maybe, very unlikely recommend this, this has to be a mixed feelings to not recommend.First thing off my head is the love triangle or love square that is done ok, meh. I did not like the fact that we as watchers already knew what was going to happen. It's common is these types of romance/ semi harem, but the way the anime spends a lot of time with these other characters is crazy. We spend Alot of time with these characters and to then just...have a weak ending with each one is weirdly lazy bobo writing. Some don't even get a concrete finish.

Sadly, one thing became clear to me and that thing was that Haruto was going to end up with Eba. His relationship with Asuka was so sweet. I know that Eba was always his number one, but i think he should maybe resolve his feelings first and dont involve Asuka at all.

Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35776/Kingdom_Hearts_χ_Back_Cover,"[""There's no review for this movie? Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

The direction is shit, characters just keep meeting in the same 1 or 2 locations, with a static camera angle. Vocal performances are sad.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character. Some of the moments in the OVA were flashbacks in the game...while other parts in the game were happening ""in real time"".The OVA also doesn\'t reflect the full story of KHxDR. Obviously, it can\'t because the phone game has hours of content. Because of that though, there\'s a handful of loose threads that don\'t have satisfying answers.It\'s for these reasons I wouldn\'t recommend non-fans of Kingdom Hearts giving this a watch. I think the only positives an outsider would be able to appreciate would be the fight choreography and the character designs.As a Kingdom Hearts fan though, I liked the OVA.

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I think the only positives an outsider would be able to appreciate would be the fight choreography and the character designs.As a Kingdom Hearts fan though, I liked the OVA. And I definitely would recommend watching this to other KH fans. It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series.

That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts.

The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I think the only positives an outsider would be able to appreciate would be the fight choreography and the character designs.As a Kingdom Hearts fan though, I liked the OVA. And I definitely would recommend watching this to other KH fans. It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series.

That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts.

The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I think the only positives an outsider would be able to appreciate would be the fight choreography and the character designs.As a Kingdom Hearts fan though, I liked the OVA. And I definitely would recommend watching this to other KH fans. It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series.

That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts.

The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

This OVA is no different. At the very least, it\'s not outsider-friendly.For those who don\'t know, this OVA was based on some key moments from the mobile game ""Kingdom Hearts X Dark Roads"". There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective.

There\'s a lot of context that\'s missed in this OVA. This is because a lot of the context that comes from the phone game is stuff that happens from the perspective of the player character.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

It was really cool to see some of my fav characters from the phone game reanimated with full 3D models and fully voiced.', ""This review is more directed to those who already have prior experience with Kingdom Hearts or at least know a bit about it. I highly advise against watching it as a first look into Kingdom Hearts or as a standalone movie, as it has little substance and it's hard to make sense of it on its own (even though it does come first chronologically). Since Kingdom Hearts 4 has now been announced, this movie and the lore within the mobile games are more important than ever. I say this because the trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 has a character and multiple references to things that...have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10. The characters range from being pretty intriguing and mysterious to straight up uninteresting. I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10. have only been shown in this portion of the story. As you may already know, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover tells the story of the Keyblade War through the Fortellers' perspective rather than the players. This is why it's important to not only watch this movie, but also the cutscenes from the mobile games Union Cross and Dark Road. Eventually when Missing Link is released that's going to add on some more story relevant plot points. The reason I'm saying all of this is because the movie tells a largely incomplete story that probably won't leave you satisfied. Characters like Ephemer show up but won't be shown doing much despite having played big roles in the overall plot. That's not to say the movie is unimportant, in fact it gives a nice showcase into how the Keyblade War unfolded from the Foretellers' perspective that we never get to see in the mobile games.The visuals and art are pretty solid. There's not much to complain about here. The animation in the fight scenes are well done too. 8/10. There are a few REALLY good voice actors, like the Master of Masters, while other characters' voices feel off-putting, like Aced. If you enjoyed the voice acting during game cutscenes or at least managed them, then you should be fine. Otherwise the sound and music is adequate, nothing extraordinary but not bad either. 6/10.

Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.But well lets dive in.You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the...main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3.

Nothing really new.Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player!

I think this is due to the movie's length being relatively short making it so that not all the foretellers get adequate screen time. For example we get to see plenty of cool scenes with Ava and the Dandelions while Gula and Invi don't have too much going for them. Some characters like Ira and Aced may annoy you at times because they make some impulsive and unintelligent decisions, but this is certainly not the first time (and probably not the last either) we've seen this in Kingdom Hearts so it shouldn't be something that completely deters you from watching the movie. 7/10. Storywise it sets up a lot of plot points and mysteries that get explored in the games so far. They're also going to become relevant in future installments so you can't really miss out on this one if you wanna understand the story moving forward. Because it works as a background for other events, do not expect to have your questions answered by the end of the movie. No, it is not enough to only watch this if you want to grab the whole scope of what's going on. A lot of the content supplements Union Cross so you'll feel the most complete by watching that along with this. Based on the trailer for Missing Link, it seems that is also going to help tie in all of the story elements presented here and in Union Cross. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is a bit separate, as it focuses on a character that is relevant to the first saga long after the events of the Keyblade War. There are a few connections between Dark Road and these plotlines, but it is not the focus. 9/10.I really enjoyed the movie. I had a blast discussing its meanings and contents with others as well. One of the best parts was theorizing what was gonna happen next and trying to piece it all together until Union Cross ended. Without the mobile games and the preexisting Kingdom Hearts story, this movie is mostly a mess without much to be gained from watching it. In my opinion it only works within the larger context. At least that is why I enjoyed it as much as I did. 9/10.Overall, it's a solid movie for a Kingdom Hearts fan wanting to know more of the lore from another perspective. The experience becomes a lot better if you add on the story of the mobile game Union Cross, so much so that I would almost say it's necessary if you want to get any meaning from it. 8/10."", 'For those who want to understand this whole movie I suggest that you install first the game ""kingdom Hearts Union x Dark Road"" Kingdom Hearts is very confusion lore if you didn\'t play the entire game, so I suggest that you lay it first. Also never skip any kh franchise cuz there\'s a lot of secret reports and stories even secret episodes are hidden in the game, it may be confusing but trust me it\'s very disappointing if you haven\'t play all and tries to understand the plot.So if anyone played KHUx on your mobile phone this is one of the half of the game,...it didn\'t feature nor mention who is the traidor until you play the whole game until you play the wole game. I watched it plenty of times and its so cool the dubbing in english is so perfectly fit and I didn\'t know that Ray Chase done the VA of MoM which is shocks me since I only know him in voicing Noctis. So yeah its really good overall although there are still missing that are yet to discover untilyou play the game. it didn\'t feature nor mention who is the traidor until you play the whole game until you play the wole game.
